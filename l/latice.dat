40|$|There {{is today}} a big need for {{polymeric}} material with well-defined nanostructures. Especially {{the field of}} transparent biomaterials is an intensively investigated area. The question if seeded emulsion polymerization of vinyl acetate (VAc) onto polydivinylbenzene (PDVB) seed <b>latices</b> is an appropriate way to obtain transparent <b>latices</b> with a core-shell structure is especially interesting because this material is very promising due to its unique properties as biocompatible optical material. It is shown that vinyl groups {{on the surface of}} the PDVB inhibited the conversion of seeded VAc polymerization due to unfavorable reactivity ratios of VAc and styrene (Sty) groups. The results show that covering the vinyl groups of the PDVB seed latex with a layer of polystyrene (PSty) is an option to overcome the inhibition and still obtain transparent <b>latices.</b> The polymerization of VAc onto double-layer PDVB/PSty seed <b>latices</b> could be run up to 100 % conversion.

40|$|Some novel optical {{methods to}} study the {{structure}} of ordered <b>latices</b> have been developed. These methods, {{as well as the}} Bragg diffraction technique, have been used in rheo- and electro-optical studies of latex structure. In the rheo-optical studies, ordered <b>latices</b> were subjected to a simple shear field and a three-dimensional deformation of the structure was observed. The increase in spacing between parallel layers of particles is qualitatively explained by a proposed two-dimensional sliding layer model. In the electro-optical studies, ordered <b>latices</b> were subjected to an electric field and an asymmetrical particle distribution was found.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{developed to}} obtain rate coefficients for entry and exit (desorption) in emulsion polymerizations {{was applied to}} systems stabilized electrosterically by a copolymer of acrylic acid and styrene embedded in a styrene seed particle. This was grown as a second-stage procedure, by adding styrene and acrylic acid to a styrene seed and then polymerizing. Rate coefficients for entry (ρ) and exit (k) for subsequent homopolymerization of the resulting <b>latices</b> with styrene {{were obtained from the}} time dependence of the approach to steady state using both chemical and γ-radiolytic initiation; the latter was used in relaxation mode, which measures k directly. Compared to the same <b>latices</b> with an electrostatic stabilizer, at pH 7 the electrosteric stabilizer greatly reduced both ρ and k. When ionic strength was increased, ρ increased relative to that found for electrosterically stabilized latex in the absence of added electrolyte. For electrostatically-stabilized <b>latices,</b> entry is supposed to occur by aqueous-phase propagation to a critical degree of polymerization z which then undergoes irreversible entry; the present data for electrostatically-stabilized <b>latices</b> support this model, including its prediction that ρ be independent of particle size, all other things being equal. The decrease in ρ in the electrosterically-stabilized <b>latices</b> is ascribed to a "hairy" layer through which diffusion of a z-mer is slow, so that it may be terminated prior to actual entry. For electrostatically-stabilized <b>latices,</b> exit is supposed to occur by transfer, resulting in a monomeric radical which exits by diffusing through the aqueous phase, this event competing with intraparticle propagation; the decrease k in the electrosterically-stabilized <b>latices</b> (also seen in other polymerically-stabilized systems) can be interpreted by assuming that aqueous-phase diffusion slower in the hairy layer...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} fuel {{electrode}} material is a Ni doped YSZ, however, under high steam partial pressures and low hydrogen partial pressures at the Ni-YSZ interface caused oxidation of the nickel {{and leads to}} irreversible degradation. Perovskite-type lanthanum strontium manganese (LSM) is also commonly used as a cathode material. Recent {{studies have found that}} doping LSM with scandium to form LSMS promotes mobility of oxide ions in the cathode, increasing reduction kinetics at the interface with the electrolyte and thus leading to higher performance at low temperatures than traditional LSM cells. However, further development of the sintering process parameters is required to prevent precipitation of scandium oxide into the LSM lattice. These precipitate particles are problematic because they can impede electron and ion conduction. In particular, the processing temperature and concentration of scandium in the LSM <b>latice</b> are being researched to optimize the properties of the LSMS cathode. New materials are being researched such as lanthanum strontium manganese chromate (LSCM), which has proven to be more stable under electrolysis conditions. LSCM has high redox stability, which is crucial especially at the interface with the electrolyte. Scandium-doped LCSM (LSCMS) is also being researched as a cathode material due to its high ionic conductivity. However, the rare-earth element introduces a significant materials cost and was found to cause a slight decrease in overall mixed conductivity. Nonetheless, LCSMS materials have demonstrated high efficiency at temperatures as low as 700 °C.|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to develop photon migration as a potential tool for the on-line characterization of particulate suspensions. In this study, the process of determining the particle size distribution and volume fraction a colloidal suspension by the inversion of frequency domain photon migration measurements of the isotropic scattering coefficient is demonstrated on dilute and concentrated polystyrene <b>latices</b> and titanium dioxide suspensions. Measurements were performed at wavelengths between 450 nm and 835 nm on unimodal polystyrene <b>latices</b> with mean diameters between 100 nm and 600 nm. The volume fractions of the <b>latices</b> ranged from 1 % to 35 %. Upon the utilization of the Percus-Yevick hard sphere model for the static structure factor, significant improvement was shown in the recovery of the mean diameter and volume fraction in high volume fraction <b>latices.</b> No other current sizing technique can make these measurements in concentrated suspension without system dependent calibration. Frequency domain photon migration (FDPM) has the advantage of self-calibration which makes it suitable for on-line measurement.

The epoxy-graft-acrylic polymers, used to prepare the <b>latices,</b> and films, produced from those <b>latices,</b> were also examined. It was confirmed that acrylic polymer preferentially grafts onto higher molecular weight portions of the epoxy polymer. The amount of epoxy remaining ungrafted was determined to be 80 %. This figure is higher than was previously thought. Molecular weight distribution studies were carried out on the epoxy and epoxy-g-acrylic resins. A quantitative method for determining copolymer composition using GPC was evaluated. The GPC method was also used to determine polymer composition as a function of molecular weight. IR spectroscopy was used to determine the total level of acrylic modification of the polymers and NMR was used to determine the level of grafting. Particle size determinations were carried out using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Levels of stabilising amine greatly affected the viscosity of the latex, particle size and amount of soluble polymer but the core particle size, as determined using TEM, was unaffected. NMR spectra of the <b>latices</b> produced spectra only from solvents and amine modifiers. Using solid-state CP/MAS/freezing techniques spectra from the epoxy component could be observed. FT-IR spectra of the <b>latices</b> were obtained after special subtraction of water. The only difference between the spectra of the <b>latices</b> and those of the dry film were due to the presence of the solvents in the former. A distinctive morphology in the films produced from the <b>latices</b> was observed. This suggested that the micelle structure of the latex survives the film forming process. If insufficient acrylic is present, large epoxy domains are produced which gives rise to poor film characteristics.

The author describes different methods of polymerization and different methods to improve the crystallization of polymeric <b>latices.</b> The monodisperse polymerlatices are synthesized using emulsifier free emulsion polymerization. With this method electrostatically stabile particles with a particle size between 180 and 700 nm are received. The dispersion polymerization is used to produce sterically stabile particles with diameters between 500 and 2300 nm. Polymethacrylates from methyl acrylate with different values of refractive index, solvent behavior and thermal stability are prepared by emulsion polymerization. The homopolymerization of methacrylates provides a maximal particle size of 500 nm. Particles with sizes greater than 500 nm coagulate. Feeding polymerization enables an increase of the particle size in the range above 500 nm. The limit of particle size can be increased by successive addition of monomers. Using the dispersion polymerization, monodispers polystyrol <b>latices</b> with a sterically stabilization by 2 -hydroxy propyl cellulose can be synthesized. These <b>latices</b> have a particle size of 2, 3 mum.

40|$|Latex is {{a complex}} mixture of various ingredients, whose {{function}} is unknown, but is mainly caused by a defense mechanism of the plant. Proteolytic activity has been described in many <b>latices</b> and several proteases were isolated, which are mainly cysteine and serine proteases. Mauritanicain is a serine protease from the latex of Euphorbia mauritanica L. (Euphorbiaceae), which was first isolated and characterized by Dr. André Domsalla. In this work Mauritanicain {{was identified as a}} protease with a molecular weight of 73 kDa by MALDI-TOF-MS and SDS-PAGE. It is possible that the protease is natively present as a not covalently linked dimer of a higher molecular mass. The isoelectric point of the protein is about 6. 5. An optimal degradation of the substrate casein takes place at a temperature of 55 - 65 °C and pH 5. 5 - 6. 5. Depending on the substrate, Mauritanicain prefers cleaving behind the amino acids alanine, leucine and lysine. Initially, leucine appears to be preferentially attacked, followed by lysine and alanine, but also other amino acids such as isoleucine and valine. This could be determined by an in-gel digestion of β-lactoglobulin at different time intervals. One potential pharmacological application of proteases is fibrinolysis. Therefore Mauritanicain as well as various <b>latices</b> should be tested for an effect on hemostasis and fibrinolysis. Plasmin is the natural enzyme which causes degradation of fibrin. The screening of 122 species of the Euphorbiaceae JUSS. family for proteolytic activity against the specific fluorogenic substrate for plasmin Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC, shows strong activity for 19 species, of which 12 species were selected for further studies. An SDS-PAGE analysis of the <b>latices</b> indicates a heterogeneous protein composition with partial matches. Neither for these species, nor for Mauritanicain an influence on hemostasis and fibrinolysis previously was described. The behavior of the 12 <b>latices</b> and Mauritanicain has been tested using different methods. Thrombin naturally induces the coagulation of fibrinogen to fibrin. In a fibrinogen-plate-assay Mauritanicain and the <b>latices</b> of Euphorbia mauritanica L. and Cnidoscolus aconitifolius (MILL.) I. M. JOHNST. caused clouding of the fibrinogen-agarose gel, but in contrast to the control subsequently the clouding disappeared. The fibrin(ogen) olytic activity appears to predominate for all of the <b>latices,</b> because in a spectrophotometric assay neither Mauritanicain nor one of the <b>latices</b> led to thrombin-like and calcium independent coagulation. To a variable extent all <b>latices</b> were able to inhibit calcium-induced coagulation of porcine plasma. For Mauritanicain this could also be shown at high concentrations or at a 30 minute pre-incubation. Apart from a certain ability of <b>latices</b> to activate plasmin from plasminogen, their anticoagulant effect as well as of Mauritanicain seems to be mainly the result of hydrolysis of fibrinogen and fibrin. In addition to a fibrinolytic activity in a fibrin-plate-assay, the degradation of fibrinogen and therefore also probable degradation of fibrin was proved by a reduction of thrombin-induced turbidity of a fibrinogen solution, by fibrinogen zymography and by analyzing the hydrolysis of Aα-, Bβ- and γ-chain of fibrinogen by SDS-PAGE. For Mauritanicain a time course hydrolysis in the order Aα > Bβ > γ, as well as a possible origin of the cleavage products was determined in the latter method. Behind which amino acids a cleavage in the three chains by Mauritanicain preferably takes place, has been investigated in an in-gel digestion of fibrinogen. Finally the reduction of a plasma clot could be detected at a fixed concentration for Mauritanicain and the other <b>latices</b> except for E. globosa (HAW.) SIMS, E. gregaria MARLOTH and E. schimperi C. PRESL. Thus the results of this work are, that the studied <b>latices</b> are a source of proteolytic enzymes, which can negatively affect the hemostasis due to a degradation of fibrinogen and positively affect fibrinolysis by a reduction of a resulting clot and are therefore interesting for further studies...|$|R
40|$|Plant <b>latices</b> {{have been}} {{utilized}} as therapeutic agents to treat various ailments in several traditional systems of medicine. One {{of the main}} applications of plant <b>latices</b> is to stop bleeding from minor injuries and to enhance wound healing activity. These activities are associated with hemostatic and fibrinolytic systems. Proteolytic enzymes present in plant <b>latices</b> are found to interfere with hemostatic and fibrinolytic systems. Cysteine proteases of plant <b>latices</b> have been observed for their selectivity towards certain blood coagulation factors and specific cleavage patterns resulting in the induction of blood clot formation. Ficin, a mixture of cysteine proteases from the latex of Ficus carica is shown to activate coagulation factor X. Likewise, the purified cysteine proteases, papain from Carica papaya latex and pergularain e I from Pergularia extensa latex are shown to have thrombinlike activity and directly induce fibrinogen clotting. Plant latex serine proteases including Latex Glycoprotein (LGP) from the latex of Synadenium grantii also exhibit procoagulant properties. However, their mechanism of action is not understood. In addition to clot-inducing activity, both the cysteine and serine proteases dissolve blood clot (plasmin-like activity). These properties of plant latex proteases have to be further investigated for their possible utilization in treatment of hemostatic disorders and other clinical applications...|$|R
