50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} feature of <b>Lake</b> <b>vessels</b> versus Ocean vessels is the cargo hatch configuration. On the <b>Lake</b> <b>vessels,</b> the hatches are traditionally spaced 24 ft apart. This configuration {{was needed to}} match the hatches to the loading facilities. At {{the turn of the}} 19th century, most ore loading facilities had loading chutes spaced every 12 ft. The ship designers used this pattern for their hatch configuration. This pattern continues today, even with modern <b>Lake</b> <b>vessels.</b> A lake vessel has many more hatches than an ocean vessel of equal length.|$|E

50|$|Vessel speeds {{are not as}} {{important}} on the Lakes as on the ocean. Ports are often closer together than in ocean trade, so cargo capacity {{is more important than}} speed. <b>Lake</b> <b>vessels</b> are designed with the greatest box coefficient to maximize the vessel's size in the many locks within the Great Lakes/St Lawrence Seaway system. Therefore, ship designers have favored bluff bows over streamlined bows. After World War II, several ocean freighters and tankers were transported to the Great Lakes and converted to bulk carriers as a way to acquire ships cheaply. Several of them served well in the role and continue to sail today (Lee A. Tregurtha, and a few others).|$|E

50|$|Port Clarence connects at its {{northeast}} {{end with}} Grantley Harbor, which is 3 to 4 miles wide, about 12 miles long, and connects at its eastern end by a narrow, difficult channel {{with a large}} lake farther inland. The mouth of the harbor is formed by two sand spits which slightly overlap. The water westward of the sand spits is shoal, {{but there is a}} channel close to the north one which can be used by vessels drawing 12 feet or less, but which should be sounded out before attempting to enter. Inside the harbor, the depths range from 2Â£ to 3 fathoms, and it is probable that a draft of 12 feet can be taken through the channel to the <b>lake.</b> <b>Vessels</b> have gone into Grantley Harbor to heave down and repair on the north sand spit.|$|E
50|$|Seawaymax {{vessels are}} 740 ft in length, 78 ft wide, {{and have a}} draft of 26.51 ft and a height above the {{waterline}} of 35.5 m. A number of lake freighters larger than this size cruise the Great Lakes and cannot pass through to the Atlantic Ocean. The size of the locks limits {{the size of the}} ships which can pass and so limits the size of the cargoes they can carry. The record tonnage for one vessel on the Seaway is 28,502 tons of iron ore while the record through the larger locks of the Great Lakes Waterway is 72,351 tons. Most new <b>lake</b> <b>vessels,</b> however, are constructed to the Seawaymax limit to enhance versatility by allowing the possibility of off-Lakes use. SS Edmund Fitzgerald, famous for her wreck in 1975, was the first ship constructed close to Seawaymax size.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1886 Messrs. H. D. Coffinberry and Robert Wallace, with the {{assistance}} of a few of the enterprising vessel owners of Cleveland, purchased the plant of the old Cuyahoga Furnace Company. They increased the plant's capacity for general machine and foundry work, by building a large brick machine shop, a top story fronting on the viaduct, which contained the offices, and a brick boiler shop. They also built an extensive shipbuilding plant on the river front, capable of building four of the largest vessels per annum. They then announced themselves as ready for the construction of modern <b>lake</b> <b>vessels.</b> This company was incorporated as the Cleveland Shipbuilding Company in 1888 and later became the American Ship Building Company.

5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{noted that}} Great <b>Lakes</b> cargo <b>vessels</b> could normally avoid severe storms, {{and called for}} the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great <b>Lakes</b> bulk cargo <b>vessels.</b> This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of Fitzgeralds foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great <b>Lakes</b> <b>vessels</b> had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.|$|R
50|$|The {{steamship}} Quebec, {{launched in}} 1865, appears in lists of Great <b>Lakes</b> <b>vessels.</b> At 283 feet, she was longer than both the Nebraska and the David Dows, but her service {{was on the}} St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec, not on the Great Lakes proper.

5000|$|The largest deep lock at the Soo is the Poe Lock {{which is}} 1,200 ft long and 110 ft wide. Because of size restrictions, thirty vessels on the lakes can only pass between Lake Superior and Lake Huron using the Poe lock {{although}} none approaches the lock's size. Many lakers {{are restricted to}} the Lakes, being unable to navigate the St Lawrence Seaway whose locks allow a maximum vessel size of 740 ft in length or 78 ft in breadth. The shallow draft imposed by the rivers (the controlling depth is 27 ft in the St. Marys River and [...] in Lake Saint Clair) restricts the cargo capacity of Lakers, but that is partially recovered by their extra length and box design. Since Great Lakes waves never achieve the great length or period of ocean waves, particularly compared to the waves' height, ships are in less danger of being suspended between two waves and breaking, so the ratio between the ship's length, beam and its depth {{can be a bit}} larger than that of an ocean-going ship. The <b>Lake</b> <b>vessels</b> generally have a 10:1 length to beam ratio, whereas ocean vessels are typically 7:1. The dimension of locks is the determining factor in Lake vessel construction.|$|E
50|$|Ancaster's {{dominant}} {{position in the}} region as an influential industrial, commercial and farming community throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries would soon be short-lived due to sudden modern transportation advancements in its neighbouring towns. Soon nearby Dundas and a small farm settlement close to the lakefront that by 1833 would be established as the town of Hamilton would soon become more influential mainly because of the successful completion of the following three transportation projects: the completion of the Burlington Canal in 1832 that connected Burlington Bay (Hamilton Harbour) to Lake Ontario, the completion of the Desjardins Canal in 1837 that enabled <b>lake</b> <b>vessels</b> to enter nearby Dundas through Hamilton Harbour and the completion in 1855 of The Great Western Railway connection to Hamilton (and eventually Dundas) enabled Hamilton, which already had flourishing and expanding ports, to become the prominent urban and commercial settlement in the region. Another factor in Ancaster's gradual economic decline was that stationary steam engines by the 1840s had begun powering industries thus locating industries adjacent to water power was less vital. In fact by this period even Ancaster had started to introduce steam power to its factories however it was no longer able to compete economically with Hamilton's natural shipping harbour and railway. A final contributing factor to Hamilton's dominance was the fact it was chosen to be the administrative center for the new Gore District in 1816 and was voted to be the county town instead of Ancaster. Ancaster had been the leading candidate in 1812 to be the county town and a petition had been signed with 200 signatures to further strengthen that proposal. The petitioners had argued that Ancaster's advantages were its flourishing Union Mills and other industries combined with its elegant setting which they believed would make it the most suitable candidate for building a new county courthouse. However, the War of 1812 had interrupted this original selection process, and by 1816 the promising village of Hamilton was chosen instead even though Ancaster at that time was still the most influential village in Western Upper Canada.|$|E
