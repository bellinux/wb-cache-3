40|$|The use of bacteriocins, mainly nisin, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} preservation technologies in food industries.

40|$|It {{has been}} rather {{generally}} assumed, chiefly because normal urine is practically free from <b>lipoids</b> (9, 10, 11) that the capillaries are impermeable to plasma <b>lipoids.</b> However, no serious attempts {{seem to have}} been made to test this assumption, in spite of its important bearing on the question of plasma colloid osmotic pressure. In order to determine whether <b>lipoids</b> diffuse through the capillaries without simultaneous migration of proteins, two types of experiments have been conducted. 1. Serum <b>lipoids</b> of normal individuals have been measured before and after the volume of the blood has been decreased, by a procedure which has been employed by Thompson, Thompson and Dailey (25), Krogh, Landis and Turner (13) and Ni and Rehberg (19). They demonstrated that if a normal person stands absolutely still for about half an hour the blood volume decreases and the serum proteins increase by about 10 per cent because there is transudation into the tissues of the lower extremi-ties of a protein-free ultrafiltrate of blood plasma. 2.

40|$|More than {{one-half}} of normal rabbits contain complement-fixing or precipitating antibodies against Wassermann antigens (the alcohol-soluble <b>lipoids</b> of beef, rabbit, and human hearts) by a sufficiently sensitive technique. Normal human sera tested by the same technique are uniformly negative. The intravenous injection of colloidal suspensions of beef and human heart <b>lipoids</b> into rabbits occasionally causes {{a significant increase in}} this normal Wassermann (antilipoid) titre. This may indicate a certain degree of antibody response to the <b>lipoids</b> as such; it {{may be due to the}} presence in such extracts of traces of foreign protein, which would activate the lipoid haptene into a complete antigen; or it may be a non-specific increase in a normal antibody, not due to a specific antigenic stimulus. Confirming the results of Sachs, Klopstock, and Weil, the addition of normal foreign (human) serum to rabbit, beef, and human heart <b>lipoids</b> makes them antigenic for rabbits. The intravenous injection of such lipoid-serum mixtures usually causes a significant increase in the titre of the complement-fixing and precipitating antibody against tissue <b>lipoids.</b> The precipitate which forms upon the addition of tissue <b>lipoids</b> to human syphilitic serum is by far the most efficient antigen for the production, in rabbits, of antibodies to tissue <b>lipoids</b> which we have as yet encountered. Rabbits injected intravenously with such a precipitate regularly develop a Wassermann titre which is many times higher than either the titre observed in human syphilis, or that induced by the injection of a normal serum-lipoid mixture. The very marked antigenic property of the precipitate as compared with that of a normal serum-lipoid mixture is considered to be due to the fact that it contains a foreign protein firmly bound to the lipoid particles, namely, the human reagin-globulin with which they have combined. This interpretation is supported by the observations (1) that heating at 100 °C., which does not affect the lipoid constituent of the precipitate, destroys its antigenic power for rabbits, and (2) that a similar precipitate derived from Wassermann positive rabbit serum instead of syphilitic human serum, and therefore containing tissue lipoid in combination with homologous (rabbit) protein, is completely non-antigenic for rabbits...|$|E

40|$|Stresses induce disaptation. Disadaptation induces {{depression}} and death. Animals prepare internal stress-coping substances {{for keeping the}}ir adaptation. Mouse given forced swimming stress produced an adaptogenic substance, in humoral lipoid fraction eluted with 100 mM NaCl, for keeping the physical strength, and mouse given repeated immunization stress prepared another substance, in humoral lipoid fraction eluted with 250 mM NaCl, for preventing the death. Mouse given various stresses may differently prepare these adaptogenic humoral <b>lipoids.</b> Depression closely relates to serotonergic and adrenergic neuronal activities. Production of the adaptogenic <b>lipoids</b> may be affected by antidepressants. Cerebrosides are <b>lipoids</b> primarily contented in brain sensing stresses. Cerebrosides may have adaptgenic activity same to the humoral <b>lipoids.</b> Mice were twice given immunization stress, given forced swimming stress or given fear stress on a raised platform, or not given the stresses as a control. Mice were also treated with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor clomipramine or a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor maprotiline. A humoral lipoid preventing the death was produced in the fraction eluted with 100 mM NaCl of mice given the immunization stress, of mice given the forced swimming stress, or of mice treated with clomipramine or maprotiline. Another humoral lipoid preventing the death was deduced in the fraction eluted with 250 mM NaCl of mice given the immunization stress or of mice treated with maprotiline. Porcine brain cerebroside sulfates, fractionated with 100 mM NaCl and with 250 mM NaCl, dose-dependently prevented the death. These suggest that the adaptogenic humoral <b>lipoids</b> were cerebroside sulfates prepared via serotonergic and adrenergic neuronal activities, corresponding to quality of the stresses...|$|E

40|$|That {{antibodies}} {{are formed}} for <b>lipoids</b> {{had long been}} doubted. Recently, however, this doubt has been cleared away by {{the production of the}} antibodies (1) (2) in animals injected with <b>lipoids</b> and serum proteins. It has occurred to me that polysaccharids, which belong to the same sort of emulsoids, might be endowed with antigenic properties and that their action as antigens might be facilitated by using serum proteins or other substances as vehicle. The fact that glycolytic ferment develops in the animal body after the injection of sugar has been demonstrated by Weinland, Abderhalden, and others. There is, however, little literature dealing with the antigenic nature of sugar. Heidelberger and Avery (3) (4) have isolated a substance which bore close resemblance to polysaccharids from the pneumococci.

40|$|In {{the early}} years of the present century {{considerable}} interest was aroused in relationships existing between <b>lipoids</b> and anesthetic agents by the extraordinary findings of Meyer and Overton (6) and their immediate followers.

However great the short-comings of this theory are as an ex-planation of how anesthetic agents produce anesthesia, new data were obtained during these studies which emphasize the interrelationships of lipoid solubility and anesthetic action.

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{concerning the}} mechanism of the insecticidal action of 1, 1 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethane (DDT) (I) have been published. Lauger et al. (1) suggest that the toxic component of the molecule is the linked p-chlorophenyl rings which block an enzyme system necessary for the proper functioning of the insects ’ nervous system. The trichioromethyl group ac-cording to Lauger causes the molecule {{to have a great}} affinity for <b>lipoids,</b> thus allowing the toxic component to he concentrated at its site of action, namely the nerve <b>lipoids.</b> The mechanism proposed by Martin and Wain (2) assumes that the chioro-phenyl rings confer lipoid solubiity while the remainder of the molecule is responsible for the toxicity by liberating hydrochloric at the “vital centers”. The evidence for the Martin-Wain hypothesis rests upon the relative ease with which the in vitro dehydrochiorination of DDT and similar compounds is accom-plished by alcoholic alkali. There are many objections to the Martin-Wain hypo-thesis. Lauger (1) and Mylius and Koechlin (6) reported two compounds (I...|$|E
40|$|The {{systematic}} {{study of}} cellular reactions to purified chemical fractions of the tubercle bacillus was first demonstrated by Sabin and her co-workers. ' 5 16, 17, 18 These chemically purified derivatives were prepared by Anderson of Yale. The above studies have contributed greatly {{to our knowledge}} of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Throughout all of the above work, however, no one specific factor was isolated to which the so-called "virulence " of the bacillus can be attributed. There has likewise as yet been no chemical evidence forthcoming which has shed any light upon the chemical differentiation between virulent and avirulent strains. Sabin et al. have shown, however, that the lipoid substances have exceeded all others in their ability to act as stimulants and maturation factors in the life cycle of the epithelioid cells of the host. This cellular phenomenon was demonstrated repeatedly with the phosphatide fraction of the bacillus. Later it was found that phthioic acid, a new fatty acid isolated by Anderson from the phosphatide fraction, was by itself capable of stimulating monocytes and epithelioid cells resulting {{in the formation of the}} tuberculous tissue. Although much work has been done with the phosphatide fraction, there has been no evidence assigning the latter to any specific role in the immunological mechanism of the disease. A great deal of investigation has been devoted to the antigenic properties of the <b>lipoids,</b> including fats, compound <b>lipoids</b> such as the phosphatides, 1 4 5 cerebrosides, and the derived lipoids; also those substances obtained from the simple and compound <b>lipoids</b> by hydrolysis, e. g., sterols and fatty acids.
