5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle <b>levers</b> to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust <b>levers</b> forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
5|$|In 1835 {{an act of}} Parliament {{reformed}} {{the local}} government structure, introducing a new town corporation structure with an elected mayor for the first time. Bute had {{to work harder to}} maintain his influence over the new corporation, using the various <b>levers</b> of influence at his disposal. He was successful, and in practice the elected officials and councillors were controlled by Bute and his interests.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, {{more than}} two years after the accident, CENIPA {{announced}} the results of official investigations. The report shows that one of the thrust <b>levers,</b> which control engines, was in position to accelerate when it should be in idle, but it was not proved if there was mechanical or human failure as the cause of the accident.|$|E

5|$|The similar Dardanelles Guns (for the location) {{were created}} by Munir Ali in 1464 and were still in use during the Anglo-Turkish War (1807–09). These were cast in bronze into two parts, the chase (the barrel) and the breech, which {{combined}} weighed 18.4tonnes. The two parts were screwed together using <b>levers</b> to facilitate moving it.|$|E
5|$|A {{piece of}} {{slightly}} later date, the Dardanelles Gun (see picture), {{was cast in}} bronze and made in two parts: the chase and the breech, which, together, weighed 18.4tonnes. The two parts were screwed together using <b>levers</b> to facilitate the work. Created by Munir Ali in 1464, the Dardanelles Gun was still present for duty more than 300 years later in 1807, when a Royal Navy force appeared and commenced the Dardanelles Operation. Turkish forces loaded the ancient relics with propellant and projectiles, then fired them at the British ships. The British squadron suffered 28 dead through this bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling the <b>levers</b> of patronage, and the election's result was never really in doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted {{that the government would}} win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election it appeared that the Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two. Bennett himself was defeated in his Calgary riding. When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>Lever</b> of Great <b>Lever</b> are {{charters}} {{referring to}} the <b>Lever</b> family. Adam de <b>Lever</b> and his son Ellis attested a grant; no. 45. Ellis son of Adam de <b>Lever</b> granted to William his son and his heirs {{a portion of his}} land in Little <b>Lever.</b> The bounds began at the Langcestre (alias Hanycestre) where Denebrook fell into the great water called <b>Lever</b> (alias Letoce); ascended the brook to a ditch dividing Little <b>Lever</b> and Breightmet as far as the Menesshaw; went down to the Tonge water, and down this to the first division. These boundaries are those of the present township of Darcy <b>Lever.</b> The grant included the homage of Richard del Snape, who paid 13d. rent, and other services; and the land was held of the chief lords of the fee by a rent of 4s., paid at the four terms, and by such other services as Ellis had rendered for the whole manor of Little <b>Lever</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>lever</b> {{extends to}} the right from a {{vertical}} control shaft. The <b>lever</b> has a neutral position with the <b>lever</b> extended directly {{to the right of}} the pivot. Braking is applied by progressively rotating the <b>lever</b> clockwise, which, due to the position of the level relative to the pivot, is actuated by the operator moving their hand closer to the body - to the [...] "rear". Forward traction is added by rotating the <b>lever</b> counter-clockwise, or [...] "forward". As the <b>lever</b> translates linear motion by the operator into rotary motion of the <b>lever,</b> the level is normally topped with a rotating knob at the right end. This allows the operator to slide the <b>lever</b> without twisting their wrist. The controller often also incorporates a fail-safe device (or dead man's switch) that requires constant downward pressure once the <b>lever</b> is rotated forward from the neutral position. Releasing the <b>lever</b> causes it to pop up on a spring, activating emergency braking.|$|R

5|$|Doctors who {{conducted}} post mortems on the bodies recovered recorded that most victims {{had died of}} burns. On day four Air India's flight safety officer informed the inquiry that the aircraft's thrust lever and thrust reverse <b>levers</b> were both in the forward position, possibly indicating that the pilot intended to go around. The inquiry panel stated that information from the FDR would be released at the next hearing of the Court of Inquiry in New Delhi on 3 September 2010, {{and that of the}} CVR soon after. The Court of Inquiry would submit its report on 30 September 2010.|$|E
5|$|Draught {{beer from}} a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style dispenser and a spout {{is the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull <b>levers</b> for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust <b>levers,</b> the report points to several factors that {{may have contributed to the}} accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, within just a year, in 429 BC, the Athenians {{not only}} forgave Pericles but also re-elected him as strategos. He was {{reinstated}} {{in command of}} the Athenian army and led all its military operations during 429 BC, having once again under his control the <b>levers</b> of power. In that year, however, Pericles witnessed the death of both his legitimate sons from his first wife, Paralus and Xanthippus, in the epidemic. His morale undermined, he burst into tears and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. He himself died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust <b>levers</b> into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E
5|$|A concave line of {{abrasion}} {{and polishing}} {{can be found}} on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument. These have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber <b>levers</b> and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the {{palettes}} were {{manipulated by}} a ratchet swell, a <b>lever</b> {{operated by the}} foot {{to the side of}} the console. The <b>lever</b> would fit into two or three different notches, which would lock the position of the <b>lever,</b> and therefore the shutters, in place. To change the position of the shutters, the <b>lever</b> would be kicked sideways to allow it to travel into a new position. The <b>lever</b> was weighted so that its default position was at the top, with the shutters closed. As the <b>lever</b> was lowered, the shutters would open.|$|R
50|$|The take-down <b>lever</b> {{is used to}} {{lock the}} slide back (as the Browning Hi-Power safety is used) during {{disassembly}} to allow removal of the slide release <b>lever.</b> In later variants, this <b>lever</b> is omitted and the slide must be manually aligned to remove the slide release <b>lever.</b> Once the slide and frame are aligned (by the disassembly <b>lever</b> or manually), the recoil guide is pulled forward to release the slide release <b>lever</b> {{and allow it to}} drop free. The slide will then be free to run forward and be removed from the frame.|$|R
50|$|A Johnson bar is a hand <b>lever</b> {{with several}} {{distinct}} positions {{and a positive}} latch to hold the <b>lever</b> in the selected position. The latch is typically activated with a spring-loaded squeeze handle on the <b>lever</b> so that only one hand is needed to release the latch, move the <b>lever,</b> then re-engage the latch in a different position. This is an American English term; in British English, the <b>lever</b> is named for its function.|$|R
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through <b>levers</b> with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5|$|In 1228 John Malemort, William the Smith and William the Fletcher {{arrived at}} the castle and began {{production}} operations at a forge built within the bailey. A production level of 120,000 quarrels in a 120-day period was achieved by 1233, with men like Malemort being able to produce up to 100quarrels a day. Quarrels were then put into barrels and shipped across the kingdom in large quantities. Other iron from the castle was sent to build siege engines in Hereford. The manufacturing capability of St Briavels Castle gave the king a distinct advantage over potential baronial enemies, with the supply of arms from the castle to Marcher Lords threatened by the Welsh {{being one of the}} <b>levers</b> of royal power during the period.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often used.
