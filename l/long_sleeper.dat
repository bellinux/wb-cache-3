40|$|Homeostatic sleep {{regulation}} in habitual short sleepers (sleep episode 9 h, n = 7) was investigated by studying their sleep structure and sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) during baseline conditions and after prolonging their habitual waking time by 24 h.

40|$|Sleep-wake behavior, {{as well as}} sleepiness, is {{regulated}} by the joint action of an exponentially increasing drive for sleep -sleep homeostasis-and by variations in sleep propensity due to a biological circadian oscillator. However, large inter-individual differences remain. Short and <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> {{have been known to}} differ in the amount of homeostatic sleep pressure: <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> report higher levels of subjective sleepiness after sleep deprivation, whereas short sleepers exhibit no significant increase in sleepiness. The circadian pacemaker's program might be at the origin of the variability in habitual sleep duration in <b>long</b> and short <b>sleepers.</b> Previous studies within our group showed that the dynamics of both processes are similar in experienced sleepiness as in judged sleepiness. The aim of the present investigation was to determine whether habitual short, <b>long</b> and midrange <b>sleepers</b> exhibit similar integration patterns or whether the biological underpinnings of habitual sleep time variability emerge when judging sleepiness. Our results show an additive integration rule for homeostatic and circadian determinants of daytime sleepiness in all groups. However, rescaled functional values (RSFVs) and relative range indices (RRIs) suggest that short sleepers seem to tolerate higher levels of homeostatic sleep pressure in comparison to <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> and that in <b>long</b> <b>sleepers,</b> circadian variability plays a less prominent role in functional daytime sleepiness. As sleep-wake behavior is governed by both physiological mechanisms and psychological processes influenced by past experiences related to sleep and wake, these results have implications for sleep-wake-related health and safety.

40|$|Objectives Sleep {{duration}} varies greatly among individuals. Whether this variation has {{a biological}} basis is largely unknown. Here we compared two extreme phenotypic groups, short <b>sleepers</b> and <b>long</b> <b>sleepers.</b> We tested 1) {{whether there is}} difference in the maximal sleep capacity between the two groups, or 2) {{whether there is a}} difference in the tolerance of homeostatic sleep pressure as measured on the basis of cognitive performance. Methods Healthy young (18 - 30 y) individuals who based on actigraphy were either short sleepers (n= 7, habitual bedrest 9 h) underwent a 28 -day inpatient protocol, including 4 days of habitual sleep (HS), 20 days of extended (12 h) sleep opportunities, a 36 -h sleep deprivation (SD) period, and 2 days of recovery sleep. Total sleep time (TST) was quantified daily with polysomnography, and performance with the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) several times every wake episode. Performance variables included number of lapses (reaction times, RT > 500 ms), median speed (1 /RT), and interpercentile (IPR) range (difference between 90 th and 10 th percentile in 1 /RT). Results In the HS condition, TST was 5. 8 h in the short sleepers and 8. 9 h in the <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> (p < 0. 001). At the end of the sleep extension protocol (average of last three nights), daily TST was 8. 5 h in the short sleepers and 8. 8 h in the <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> (n. s.). None of the PVT measures differed between the two groups in the HS condition. When given extended sleep opportunities, PVT performance improved in the short sleepers (p < 0. 001) but not in the <b>long</b> <b>sleepers.</b> Two-hourly PVTs during the SD revealed that short sleepers showed fewer lapses (p < 0. 001) and a smaller IPR (p < 0. 04) than the <b>long</b> <b>sleepers,</b> particularly {{in the latter part of}} the SD. Conclusion The maximal sleep capacity of young healthy adults is approximately 8. 9 h. The disparity in habitual sleep duration between short and <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> appears to reflect a trait-like difference in the tolerance of homeostatic sleep pressure rather than in the capacity to sleep. Short sleepers seem to possess a ´cognitive reserve´ that becomes apparent at very low and very high levels of sleep pressure. ...|$|R

40|$|Background. Habitual short (HSS) and <b>long</b> <b>sleeper</b> (HLS) {{were very}} {{interesting}} but under-research area. Conclusion. Our study suggested that sleep duration of human being has marked inter-individual variability with existence of extreme sleepers at both ends. Throughout different {{phases of the}} study, there was a consistent negative relationship between sleep duration and socio-economic status. Our finding of unique personality profile between short and long sleepers supported the hypothesis that different personality trait (neuroticism trait) might mediate between sleep duration and socioeconomic variables. Further studies are indicated for investigating genetic as well as biological correlates between personality traits and sleep duration. Method. Three phases were involved in this research to explore epidemiological, psychological, and PSG characteristics of HSS and HLS. Phase three: 72 subjects (23 HSS, 41 HNS, and 8 HLS) were assessed by two nights PSG {{to be followed by}} multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). 37 subjects (6 HSS, 21 HNS, and 10 HLS) were assessed by four-day Actiwatch. In the first night of PSG assessment, HLS had lower sleep efficiency and longer sleep and REM latency than HSS and HNS. In the second night, REM density in HLS was higher than HSS and HNS. In MSLT, HSS (50. 0 %) was more likely to have mildly short sleep latency than HLS (0 %). Multiple regression of these healthy sleepers suggested that shorter sleep duration was found in those subjects (a) attaining higher education level; (b) suffering from higher life stress; (c) having more sleepiness; and (d) having less neuroticism. Phase two: 252 subjects attended the face-to-face clinical interview. Among them, there were 33 HSS- 7 and 25 HLS- 9. After controlling gender and age, HSS had more chance to earn more money, live in larger house, drank more alcohol, and lower neuroticism than HLS. Result. Phase one: Brief sleep questionnaires with consent were administered to parents of students in 13 primary schools in 2003, and 10381 parents returned their questionnaires (response rate ≈ 67. 9 %). 593 subjects were excluded because of their incomplete information. Altogether, 9788 subjects were considered as eligible subjects that represented noninstitutionalized Chinese middle-age residents in Hong Kong (47. 0 % men vs 53. 0 % women, mean age: 40. 9 years +/- 4. 9 years [SD]). There were 322 (3. 3 %) HSS- 7 (≤ 7 hours), 1415 (14. 5 %) HLS- 9 (≥ 9 hours), and 481 (4. 9 %) HLS- 10 (≥ 10 hours). HSS had more chance to attain higher education level, earn more money and drank more tea/coffee than HLS. Zhang Bin. "May 2005. "Advisers: Y. K. Wing; S. O. Chan.

We collected socioeconomic, psychological, and polysomnographic characteristics of 6501 parents (3252 men and 3249 women) of 4036 primary school children in Guangzhou city. The study data were collected in three phases. The overall prevalence of short (5 h or less) and long (10 h or more) sleep duration was 0. 52 and 0. 64 %, respectively. <b>Long</b> <b>sleepers</b> had higher Eysenck Personality Questionnaire neuroticism scores [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 224, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 047 - 1. 409] and lower education levels (OR= 0. 740, 95 %CI= 0. 631 - 0. 849) than short sleepers. In the polysomnographic assessment, short, <b>long,</b> and normal <b>sleepers</b> (7 - 8 h) shared similar durations of Stage 3 sleep (short= 25. 7 ± 10. 7, long= 20. 3 ± 7. 9, and normal= 28. 0 ± 12. 8 min, F= 1. 402, P= 0. 181).

40|$|Objective: Poor sleep quality {{could be}} {{a risk factor for}} obesity. This article {{utilized}} a person-centered approach to investigate whether distinct sleep quality subtypes were associated with obesity directly, and indirectly via physical activity. Method: The sample included 8, 932 Australian employees who participated in the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia Survey. Structured interviews and self-report questionnaires collected information on sleep quality, obesity, and relevant demographic, health, and work-related variables. Latent class analysis identified distinct subtypes of sleep quality. General linear modeling examined the associations of sleep quality subtypes with body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Multicategorical mediation models examined indirect paths linking sleep quality classes with obesity via physical activity. Results: Five distinct sleep quality subtypes were identified: Poor Sleepers (20. 0 %), Frequent Sleep Disturbances (19. 2 %), Minor Sleep Disturbances (24. 5 %), <b>Long</b> <b>Sleepers</b> (9. 6 %), and Good Sleepers (26. 7 %). BMI, waist circumference, and physical activity differed among the sleep quality subtypes, with similar results observed for males and females. For example, Poor Sleepers had the highest BMIs, followed by Frequent Sleep Disturbances and Minor Sleep Disturbances; <b>Long</b> <b>Sleepers</b> and Good Sleepers had the lowest BMIs. Mediation analyses indicated that low levels of physical activity linked the Poor Sleep, Frequent Sleep Disturbance, and Long Sleep classes with higher BMI. Conclusions: These results provide new insights into the nature of sleep quality in employees. In particular, distinct sleep quality patterns had differing associations with measures of obesity, suggesting the need for tailored workplace interventions.

40|$|Short {{sleep and}} poor sleep quality are {{associated}} with risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and mortality. This study examines the contribution of sleep duration and sleep quality on a multisystem biological risk index that {{is known to be}} associated with morbidity and mortality. Analyses include a population-based sample from the Midlife Development in the United States survey recruited to the Biomarker substudy. A total of 1, 023 participants aged 54. 5 years (SD = 11. 8), 56 % female and 77. 6 % white, were included in the analyses. A multisystem biological risk index was derived from 22 biomarkers capturing cardiovascular, immune, lipid-metabolic, glucose-metabolic, sympathetic, parasympathetic, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal systems. Self-reported average sleep duration was categorized as short (5) sleep. Linear mixed effect models adjusting for age, gender, race, education, income, BMI, and health status were performed. As compared to normal sleepers, multisystem biological risk in both short (B(SE) =. 38 (. 15), p<. 01) and <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> (B(SE) =. 28 (. 11), p<. 01) were elevated.

Sleep disturbances, based on the Jenkins Sleep Questionnaire, were categorized as none/some, moderate, or severe. Sleep durations were ≤ 6 hours (short), seven to eight hours, and ≥ 9 hours (long) per night. Results: At baseline, 855 men (38 %) either reported sleep disturbances or were short or <b>long</b> <b>sleepers.</b> The presence of severe sleep disturbances increased the risk of first CVD (hazard ratio [HR]= 1. 80, 95 % confidence interval [CI]= 1. 07 - 3. 03) and CHD events (HR= 1. 97, 95 % CI= 1. 09 - 3. 56), in particular from the age of 48 years onward. In comparison to men sleeping seven to eight hours, <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> experienced a higher CVD risk (HR= 1. 56, 95 % CI= 1. 10 - 2. 22), due mainly to ischemic strokes, and starting at older ages (≥ 60 years). A joint effect between disturbed sleep and short sleep duration on CVD and CHD events was also observed. Adjustments for physical activity and depression did not substantially modify these associations. Conclusion: Severe sleep disturbances and long sleep duration were associated with specific CVD endpoints and age at onset, potentially suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. A short questionnaire discriminating different levels of sleep disturbances and sleep duration should be routinely adopted in CVD prevention programs to identify men at increased risk for early-onset events...|$|R

40|$|Background Short {{sleep and}} poor sleep quality are {{associated}} with risk of cardiovascular disease, diabe-tes, cancer, and mortality. This study examines the contribution of sleep duration and sleep quality on a multisystem biological risk index that {{is known to be}} associated with morbidity and mortality. Methods Analyses include a population-based sample from the Midlife Development in the United States survey recruited to the Biomarker substudy. A total of 1, 023 participants aged 54. 5 years (SD = 11. 8), 56 % female and 77. 6 % white, were included in the analyses. A multisys-tem biological risk index was derived from 22 biomarkers capturing cardiovascular, im-mune, lipid-metabolic, glucose-metabolic, sympathetic, parasympathetic, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal systems. Self-reported average sleep duration was catego-rized as short (< 5 hrs), below normal (5 to< 6. 5 hrs), normal (6. 5 to< 8. 5 hrs), and <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> (8. 5 + hrs).

40|$|Abstract According to the two-process {{model of}} sleep regulation, {{the timing and}} {{structure}} of sleep {{are determined by the}} interaction of a homeostatic and a circadian process. The original qualitative model was elaborated to quantitative versions that included the ultradian dynamics of sleep in relation to the non-REM-REM sleep cycle. The time course of EEG slow-wave activity, the major marker of non-REM sleep homeostasis, as well as daytime alertness were simulated successfully for a considerable number of experimental protocols. They include sleep after partial sleep deprivation and daytime napping, sleep in habitual short and <b>long</b> <b>sleepers,</b> and alertness in a forced desynchrony protocol or during an extended photoperiod. Simulations revealed that internal desyn-chronization can be obtained for different shapes of the thresholds. New devel-opments include the analysis of the waking EEG to delineate homeostatic and circadian processes, studies of REM sleep homeostasis, and recent evidence for local, use-dependent sleep processes. Moreover, nonlinear interactions between homeostatic and circadian processes were identified. In the past two decades...|$|R

When a train rides from an embankment onto a stiff structure, such as a bridge, tunnel or culvert, an abrupt change in the support stiffness occurs possibly inducing differential settlements.

A number of techniques have been proposed or implemented to provide gradual stiffness transition at the problem zones, such as methods to ensure gradually changing pad stiffness, application of <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> or installation of auxiliary rails in the transition zone.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between total sleep duration and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) in older Chinese. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS) was performed. Participants (n = 29, 333) were aged >/= 50 years. Risk of MetSyn and its components were identified for self-reported total sleep duration. RESULTS: Participants reporting long (>/= 9 h) and short (< 6 h) total sleep duration had increased odds ratio (OR) of 1. 18 (95 % CI 1. 07 - 1. 30) and 1. 14 (1. 05 - 1. 24) {{for the presence of}} MetSyn, respectively. The relationship remained in <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> (OR 1. 21 [1. 10 - 1. 34]) but diminished in short sleepers (0. 97 [0. 88 - 1. 06]) after full adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Long sleep duration was associated with greater risk of MetSyn in older Chinese. Confirmation through longitudinal studies is needed. The mechanisms mediating the link between long sleep duration and MetSyn require further investigation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Very {{few studies}} have {{examined}} sleep duration in relation to cancer incidence with the exception of breast cancer. We assessed the associations between sleep duration and incidences of total and 18 site-specific cancers in the NIH-AARP Health and Diet Study cohort, with 173, 327 men and 123, 858 women aged 51 - 72 years at baseline. Self-reported sleep duration categories were assessed via questionnaire. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI), using 7 - 8 hours/night as the reference. We observed a significantly increased risk of stomach cancer among male short sleepers (multivariable HR 5 - 6 vs. 7 - 8 hours = 1. 29; 95 %CI: 1. 05, 1. 59; Ptrend = 0. 03). We also observed suggestive associations in either short or <b>long</b> <b>sleepers,</b> which did not reach overall significance (Ptrend > 0. 05), including increased risks in male short sleepers for cancers of head and neck (HR< 5 vs. 7 - 8 hours = 1. 39; 95 %CI: 1. 00 - 1. 95), bladder (HR 5 - 6 vs. 7 - 8 hours = 1. 10; 95 %CI: 1. 00 - 1. 20), thyroid (HR< 5 vs. 7 - 8 hours = 2. 30; 95 %CI: 1. 06, 5. 02), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) (HR 5 - 6 vs. 7 - 8 hours = 1. 17; 95 %CI: 1. 02 - 1. 33), and myeloma (HR< 5 vs. 7 - 8 hours = 2. 06; 95 %CI: 1. 20 - 3. 51). In women, the suggestive associations include a decreased total cancer risk (HR< 5 vs. 7 - 8 hours = 0. 9; 95 %CI: 0. 83 - 0. 99) and breast cancer risk (HR< 5 vs. 7 - 8 hours = 0. 84; 95 %CI: 0. 71 - 0. 98) among short sleepers. A decreased ovarian cancer risk (HR≥ 9 vs. 7 - 8 hours = 0. 50; 95 %CI: 0. 26 - 0. 97) and an increased NHL risk (HR≥ 9 vs. 7 - 8 hours = 1. 45; 95 %CI: 1. 00 - 2. 11) were observed among <b>long</b> <b>sleepers.</b> In an older population, we observed an increased stomach cancer risk in male short sleepers and suggestive associations with short or long sleep duration for many cancer risks in both genders...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Both {{short and}} long sleep {{duration}} may increase risk of type 2 diabetes (diabetes). We studied if {{short and long}} sleep durations were associated with insulin resistance (IR) and insulin secretion in individuals without diabetes, and if the associations remained after we excluded individuals who reported more frequent and severe complaints of sleep apnea and insomnia. Participants and methods. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed for 722 adults without diabetes. Indices of IR and insulin secretion were calculated. Sleep duration and complaints of sleep apnea and insomnia were self-reported. Results. In comparison to average sleepers (6 - 9 h/night), short sleepers (= 9 h/night) had higher fasting and 120 -min insulin, 120 -min glucose, and HOMA(IR) and lower Insulin Sensitivity Index. After adjusting for confounders and after excluding individuals who reported more frequent and severe complaints of sleep apnea and insomnia, long sleep duration remained significantly associated with IR and insulin secretion. Discussion. Long but not short sleep duration is associated with IR and insulin secretion in individuals without diabetes whether or not accompanied by sleep complaints. <b>Long</b> <b>sleepers</b> may benefit from targeted preventions and interventions that aim at reducing risk of future diabetes...|$|R

40|$|Why do some {{individuals}} need more sleep than others? Forward mutagenesis screens in flies using engineered mutations {{have established a}} clear genetic component to sleep duration, revealing mutants that convey very long or short sleep. Whether such extreme long or short sleep could exist in natural populations was unknown. We applied artificial selection for high and low night sleep duration to an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster for 13 generations. At {{the end of the}} selection procedure, night sleep duration diverged by 9. 97 hours in the <b>long</b> and short <b>sleeper</b> populations, and 24 -hour sleep was reduced to 3. 3 hours in the short <b>sleepers.</b> Neither <b>long</b> nor short <b>sleeper</b> lifespan differed appreciably from controls, suggesting little physiological consequences to being an extreme <b>long</b> or short <b>sleeper.</b> Whole genome sequence data from seven generations of selection revealed several hundred thousand changes in allele frequencies at polymorphic loci across the genome. Combining the data from <b>long</b> and short <b>sleeper</b> populations across generations in a logistic regression implicated 126 polymorphisms in 80 candidate genes, and we confirmed three of these genes and a larger genomic region with mutant and chromosomal deficiency tests, respectively. Many of these genes could be connected in a single network based on previously known physical and genetic interactions. Candidate genes have known roles in several classic, highly conserved developmental and signaling pathways-EGFR, Wnt, Hippo, and MAPK. The involvement of highly pleiotropic pathway genes suggests that sleep duration in natural populations can be influenced by a wide variety of biological processes, which may be why the purpose of sleep has been so elusive...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSleep is {{important}} for optimal cognitive functioning across the lifespan. Among older adults (≥ 55 years), self-reported short and long sleep durations have been repeatedly, albeit inconsistently, reported to elevate the risk for poor cognitive function. This meta-analytic review quantitatively summarizes the risk for poorer cognitive function among short and <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> in older adults. Eligible publications were searched online and manually. A total of 35 independent samples (N[*]=[*] 97, 264) from 11 cross-sectional and seven prospective cohort studies were included. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were derived using random-effects models. Self-reported short and long sleep increased the odds for poor cognitive function by 1. 40 (CI[*]=[*] 1. 27 – 1. 56) and 1. 58 times (CI[*]=[*] 1. 43 – 1. 74), respectively. Effect sizes varied across studies {{and may have been}} moderated by both study type (cross-sectional and prospective) and cognitive domain assessed. For cross-sectional studies, extreme sleep durations were significantly associated with poorer multiple-domain performance, executive functions, verbal memory, and working memory capacity. Prospective cohort studies revealed the significant long-term impact of short and long sleep on multiple-domain performance only. These findings establish self-reported extreme sleep duration as a risk factor for cognitive aging...|$|R
40|$|In modern societies, many {{humans are}} exposed to a {{combination}} of acute and chronic sleep loss and circadian misalignment. Whereas it is known that these factors can impair alertness and cognitive performance, the contribution of each of them as well as their interaction when they operate together, are largely unknown. We therefore subjected young healthy individuals in the lab to a 3 -week forced desynchrony protocol during which they were exposed to a long sleep-wake cycle (42. 85 h) and a reduced sleep:wake ratio of 1 : 3. 3. Over three weeks, the protocol therefore induced an increasing chronic sleep loss while allowing extended wake and sleep episodes to occur at all circadian phases. We quantified the occurrence of spontaneous attentional failures by hours awake (acute sleep loss), by study week (chronic sleep loss), and by circadian phase derived from plasma melatonin. It was found that chronic sleep loss 1) speeds up the rate at which inadvertent attentional failures accumulate during a wake episode, and 2) amplifies the circadian variation in attentional failures. Thus, acute and chronic sleep loss in combination with circadian phase should be considered as distinct factors that interact in a non-additive way to affect waking function. In another series of studies we compared short and <b>long</b> <b>sleepers</b> and identified trait-like individual differences in the tolerance of acute and chronic sleep loss...|$|R
40|$|Shi Ngar Wong, Mark Halaki, Chin Moi ChowDiscipline of Exercise and Sport Science, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaAbstract: The sleep&ndash;wake {{cycle is}} a process not only {{dictated}} by homeostatic and circadian factors but also by social and environmental influences. Thus, the total sleep time partly reflects sleep need, which is integral to the dynamics of sleep loss recovery. This study explored {{the nature of the}} observed oscillations in total sleep time in healthy adults under spontaneous living conditions. Actigraph-measured sleep data for 13 healthy young male adults were collected over 14 consecutive days and analyzed for habitual sleep duration. The total sleep time periodicity was modeled using the cosinor method for each individual across the 14 days. The findings confirm the existence of periodicity in habitual sleep duration as there were clear periodic patterns in the majority of the participants. Although exclusive to each individual, the observed oscillations may be a resultant response of homeostatic sleep need, circadian timing, and/or social and environmental influences. These findings instigate further indepth studies into the periodicity of sleep duration in healthy individuals to provide a better understanding of sleep need in short versus <b>long</b> <b>sleepers,</b> in predicting work performance, and reducing sleepiness-related accidents following shift work, and how this periodicity may impact sleep treatment outcome in clinical populations.
