50|$|The first APL to BCPL {{conversions}} {{were completed}} in 1966. 2BCPL, formerly 11APL (2nd) (and {{for a few}} years, 98BPL 1st), entered service on 16 June of that year as a trial. Unlike the other member of the class, 2BCPL was only slightly changed from its previous identity. A single compartment at the Smoking end was walled {{off from the rest}} of the carriage and had its seats removed. That end compartment had the standard guards' equipment put in place, with a desk and a small area for vangoods storage. Taildiscs were added to both ends of the carriage for end-of-train marking in daylight, and for night red lamps were added on the four roof corners. Access to the guard's compartment was by a single door on either side of the carriage; from the guard's end looking towards the ladies' end, the left-side guard's door took the former place of the men's water closet, while the right-hand side door took the place of the former window for the ninth compartment, adjacent to the former <b>longitudinal</b> <b>seat</b> on that side of the carriage. Both fitted doors were smooth-panelled and split at half-height allowing the guard to lean out of the train to observe signals and display flags as necessary. An assortment of handrails were provided, though it seems no additional steps were provided for a guard to step up to his compartment from ground level, so he may have been required to step on the bogie's axle boxes.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} office tasks on posture and movements in field settings, and the comfort rating for chair characteristics and correlation with type of task. The tasks studied were: computer work, telephoning, desk work and conversation. Postures, movements, chair part inclinations and comfort rating {{data were collected from}} 12 subjects. Computer work showed the lowest physical activity, together with upright trunk and head position and low backrest inclination. Conversation shows the highest activity of head legs and low back together with the highest cervical spine extension. In contrast, desk work provoked the most cervical spine flexion and showed the second lowest activity. The telephoning tasks showed medium activity and the highest kyphosis. Conversation showed the highest backrest inclination. Positive comfort relations were found for computer work and a "swing system" chair, for telephoning and an active <b>longitudinal</b> <b>seat</b> rotation, and for desk work and a chair with a three-dimensionally moveable seat. © 2011...|$|E
40|$|Whole-body {{vibrations}} (WBV) have {{adverse effects}} on ride comfort and human health. Suspension seats have an important influence on the WBV severity. In this study, WBV were measured on a medium-sized compact wheel loader (CWL) in its typical operations. The effect of short-term exposure to the WBV on the ride comfort was evaluated according to ISO 2631 - 1 : 1985 and ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997. ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 and ISO 2631 - 5 : 2004 were adopted to evaluate the effect of long-term exposure to the WBV on the human health. Reasons for the different evaluation results obtained according to ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 and ISO 2631 - 5 : 2004 were explained in this study. The WBV measurements were carried out {{in cases where the}} driver wore a lap belt or a four-point seat harness and in the case where the driver did not wear any safety belt. The seat effective amplitude transmissibility (SEAT) and the seat transmissibility in the frequency domain in these three cases were analyzed to investigate the effect of a safety belt on the seat transmissibility. Seat tests were performed on a multi-axis shaking table in laboratory to study the dynamic behavior of a suspension seat under the vibration excitations measured on the CWL. The WBV intensity was reduced by optimizing the vertical and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>seat</b> suspension systems with the help of computational simulations. For the optimization multi-body models of the seat-dummy system in the laboratory seat tests and the seat-driver system in the field vibration measurements were built and validated...|$|E
