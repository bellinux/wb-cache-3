The results suggested that the combined haptic and graphic interface was preferable to the graphic interface regarding accuracy, while both interfaces were fundamentally equal concerning completion time. The results also indicated that the combined haptic and graphic interface was <b>less</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> than either the graphic or the haptic interface.

Attention is devoted to general methodological principles of psychological assessments, their contribution to personnel practice focusing on recruitment process and the discussion about increasing efficiency of selection process <b>less</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> and responsible positions. The theoretical part is mainly dedicated to the method GPOP, which in its core is based on the Jung's theory of psychological types, which has stimulated development of the questionnaire MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), and the Five-factor personality theory. Combining two completely different approaches it comes into being an assessment able to interpret on the one side, the uniqueness of personality, and on the second side its resemblance to a certain type. In the practical part, the psychometric characteristics of the questionnaire completed by 524 selected respondents are analyzed and evaluated. Reliability of the global scales is estimated of Cronbach`s alpha interval 0. 8 to 0. 9. Correlation analysis and exploratory factor analysis clearly support the expected construct of GPOP. The norms are compiled for a specific population, and the presented notifications attend on [...] ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{study the}} {{applicability}} of a visual P 3 -based and a Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) -based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for mental text spelling on a cohort of patients with incomplete Locked-In Syndrome (LIS). METHODS: Seven patients performed repeated sessions with each BCI. We assessed BCI performance, mental workload and overall satisfaction for both systems. We also investigated {{the effect of the}} quality of life and level of motor impairment on the performance. RESULTS: All seven patients were able to achieve an accuracy of 70 % or more with the SSVEP-based BCI, compared to 3 patients with the P 3 -based BCI, showing a better performance with the SSVEP BCI than with the P 3 BCI in the studied cohort. Moreover, the better performance of the SSVEP-based BCI was accompanied by a lower mental workload and a higher overall satisfaction. No relationship was found between BCI performance and level of motor impairment or quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our results show a better usability of the SSVEP-based BCI than the P 3 -based one for the sessions performed by the tested population of locked-in patients with respect to all the criteria considered. The study shows the advantage of developing alternative BCIs with respect to the traditional matrix-based P 3 speller using different designs and signal modalities such as SSVEPs to build a faster, more accurate, <b>less</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> and more satisfying BCI by testing both types of BCIs on a convenience sample of LIS patients...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain a greater {{understanding}} of what social workers perceive to be <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> and emotionally challenging work, and which strategies they use to handle it. I chose to interview six social workers, three of them had long experience of social work, and three of them had worked for less than a year. The justification for this choice wasthat I wanted to interview people with different experience of social work over time, to be able to see possible differences in what was perceived as <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> and emotionally challenging work, and how it was handled. The social workers were interviewed with a semi structured interview manual. The results showed that the organization of the social service is not fitted to the work that social workers execute. This means that what is perceived as <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> and emotionally challenging work largely depends on this. Experience of the profession does not necessarily affect what is perceived as <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> and emotionally challenging work. However, longer work experience seems to benefit a social workers choice of strategies. This means that <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> and emotionally challenging work in some cases is better handled by social workers with longer experience of the profession. The organization of the workplace can also affect which coping strategies that are being used, for example is time for reflection during working hours beneficial for the employees...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} three independent {{studies on}} Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for communication based on electroencephalography (EEG) and visual stimulation. BCIs aim at establishing a direct communication channel between {{the brain and}} an external device and are therefore particularly interesting for patients whose motor output channels are severely impaired. The main objective of this doctoral project is to develop BCIs based on visual oddball paradigms (P 300 component of the Event-Related Potential  ERP) and Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs), to assess their performance on both healthy and disabled volunteers and to study possible improvements. The first study (chapter 3) investigated the possibility to use Error-related Potential (ErrP) detection to improve the accuracy of P 300 -based spelling. When a user attempts to communicate a symbol using a BCI, he/she receives as feedback the symbol being identified as target by the BCI. However BCIs are bound to make mistakes and therefore the provided feedback can either be correct or incorrect. In this chapter, we studied the differences between EEG responses to incorrect feedback (ErrP) and those to correct feedback {{as well as the}} possibility to accurately detect those ErrPs in order to improve the BCI performance. The shapes of the EEG responses to both types of feedback are consistent with earlier EEG work on error-related processes in a non-BCI context. We also showed the possibility to accurately classify those two types of EEG responses and suggested an automatic correction strategy based on ErrP detection resulting in an improved BCI performance. However, we also stressed several critical aspects of ErrP detection such as the need to collect a large amount of training data, the importance of minimizing false detection of responses to correct feedback and the minor benefit it yields to subjects that already achieve a high spelling accuracy. In the second study (chapter 4), we investigated the applicability of two BCIs, one based on P 300 and another one based on SSVEPs, for mental text spelling on a cohort of patients with Locked-In Syndrome (LIS). In order to be applicable for daily use, these BCI systems need to be not only accurate, but also easy to use by the patient. Their applicability therefore depends not only on the achieved performance but also on the users assessment of the mental workload associated with the BCI task and the overall satisfaction with the BCI system. For this reason, the comparison was done in terms of typing performance, mental workload, and user satisfaction. We observe a better usability of the SSVEP-based BCI compared to the P 300 -based one for the sessions performed by the tested population of locked-in patients with respect to all criteria considered. Our results suggest the advantage of developing alternative BCIs with respect to the traditional matrix-based P 300 speller using different designs and signal modalities such as SSVEPs to build a faster, more accurate, <b>less</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> and moresatisfying BCI by testing both types of BCIs on a convenience sample of LIS patients. In the third study (chapter 5), we investigated the possibility to successfully combine the P 300 and SSVEP BCI paradigms in a single hybrid BCI. We hypothesized that such a system would allow to overcome the main limitations of each individual BCI paradigm, so as to be able to operate faster than purely P 300 -based BCIs and encode more commands than purely SSVEP-based BCIs. We collected and analyzed EEG data in a series of several experiments that allowed us to analyse the interactions between the brain responses of the two paradigms, and explore the possibilities of such a hybrid BCI. We observed that the hybrid stimulation scheme did not impair any of the two types of brain responses and that the latter could be detected as accurately as in their non-hybrid counterparts. We, finally, showed the possibility to detect both types of brain responses simultaneously and discussed the feasibility of such a hybrid BCI and the gain it provides over pure P 300 - and pure SSVEP-based BCIs in terms of communication rate. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Psychological {{detachment}} {{occurs in}} the absence of work ruminations during non-work time and is a vital component in the recovery from work-related fatigue, avoiding burnout, performance decrement and detrimental health-outcomes. Overcommitment to work entails excessive job involvement and resembles poor detachment. Detachment and overcommitment are influenced by characteristics of the worker, their work, and their leisure time, but few studies have examined the effects of work or leisure demands on detachment and overcommitment. The current study examined the activity demands, detachment and overcommitment ratings of 51 workers and university students by having participants complete nine internet-based surveys over four weeks, and analysing data with a multilevel modelling approach. Rates of psychological detachment were found to be increased by physically demanding leisure activities, and decreased by <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> work activities when leisure activities were mentally undemanding. In addition, detachment rates were higher when work activities were emotionally demanding and leisure activities emotionally undemanding, and when work activities were emotionally undemanding and leisure activities emotionally demanding. Overcommitment was found to be increased by leisure activities which were <b>mentally</b> <b>demanding</b> or emotionally demanding. Work ruminations during leisure time were therefore found to be influenced by work and leisure demands, with the manipulation of leisure demands thereby offering a method through with to diminish or buffer the detrimental impact of arduous work demands on the recovery from fatigue...|$|R
