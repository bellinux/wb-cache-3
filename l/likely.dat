Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for criminal purposes; they serve to incapacitate a victim {{in cases of}} drug assisted rape or robbery.|$|E

5|$|A {{study in}} 2011 by Douglas Miller {{shows that in}} English county cricket, the {{proportion}} of wickets to fall lbw has increased steadily since the First World War. In the 1920s, around 11% of wickets were lbw but this rose to 14% in the 1930s. Between 1946 and 1970, the proportion was approximately 11% but subsequently increased until reaching almost 19% in the decade before 2010. Miller also states that captains of county teams were statistically more <b>likely</b> to receive the benefit of lbw decisions—less <b>likely</b> to be out lbw when batting and more <b>likely</b> to dismiss batsmen lbw when bowling. For many years, county captains submitted end-of-match reports on the umpires; as umpires were professionals whose careers could be affected, captains consequently received leeway whether batting or bowling. Before 1963, when the status was abolished in county cricket, umpires were also more lenient towards amateur cricketers. Amateurs administered English cricket, and offending one could end an umpire's career. Elsewhere in the world, lbws are more statistically <b>likely</b> in matches taking place on the Indian subcontinent. However, batsmen from the subcontinent were less <b>likely</b> to be lbw wherever they played in the world.|$|E

5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros were more <b>likely</b> to be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they were more <b>likely</b> to be artefacts {{at the end of}} their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more <b>likely</b> to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E
