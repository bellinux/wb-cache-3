40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the experiments we carried out at the TREC 2010 Session Track. We propose an approach for interpreting reformulated queries by using query expansions derived from <b>anchor</b> <b>logs</b> which we envisage to be a potential alternative to query logs. We show that expansion with terms or phrases extracted from <b>anchor</b> <b>logs</b> improves the retrieval performance over a search session. We provide a detailed discussions of our runs which were among the top performing systems of the track. ...|$|R
5000|$|Mooring under a cliff to a buoy or by anchor, {{the ship}} would receive cargo down an apron chute or, later a wire chute. It usually took {{two days to}} load. All these ports were full of rocks both hidden and exposed. There were undertows and cross-rip {{currents}} and continual changing sandbars. The dog-hole operators obtained franchises to build and manage the chutes. When a ship entered a port, it moored to a buoy (often a <b>log</b> <b>anchored</b> to the bottom) and would be warped or winched into position for loading. A ship’s boat, crewed by three seamen and the second mate, carried the eight inch mooring lines to the buoy. The gravity chutes were troughs allowing cargo to be sent down a cliff to a ship. Besides bagged goods, the chutes were used to load other cargo, such as live hogs.|$|R
40|$|Result {{diversification}} {{deals with}} ambiguous or multi-faceted queries by providing documents that cover as many subtopics of a query as possible. Various approaches to subtopic modeling have been proposed. Subtopics have been extracted internally, e. g., from re-trieved documents, and externally, e. g., from Web {{resources such as}} query logs. Internally modeled subtopics are often implicitly rep-resented, e. g., as latent topics, while externally modeled subtopics are often explicitly represented, e. g., as reformulated queries. We propose a framework that: i) combines both implicitly and explicitly represented subtopics; and ii) allows flexible combina-tion of multiple external resources in a transparent and unified man-ner. Specifically, we use a random walk based approach to estimate the similarities of the explicit subtopics mined {{from a number of}} heterogeneous resources: click <b>logs,</b> <b>anchor</b> text, and web n-grams. We then use these similarities to regularize the latent topics ex-tracted from the top-ranked documents, i. e., the internal (implicit) subtopics. Empirical results show that regularization with explicit subtopics extracted from the right resource leads to improved diver-sification results, indicating that the proposed regularization with (explicit) external resources forms better (implicit) topic models. Click <b>logs</b> and <b>anchor</b> text are shown to be more effective resources than web n-grams under current experimental settings. Combining resources does not always lead to better results, but achieves a ro-bust performance. This robustness is important for two reasons: it cannot be predicted which resources will be most effective for a given query, and it is not yet known how to reliably determine the optimal model parameters for building implicit topic models...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the experiments we carried out at the TREC 2011 Session Track. We propose two different approaches to tackle the task introduced this year. The first one relies on a biologically inspired adaptive model for information filtering to build a user profile of multiple topics of interests throughout the session. The learnt profile is then exploited in the retrieval process. The second approach is an extension of our <b>anchor</b> <b>log</b> technique we proposed in the previous year. We use the <b>anchor</b> <b>logs</b> to simulate queries in order to derive query expansions that are relevant to user information needs throughout the session. 1...|$|R
50|$|Forestry {{forms the}} {{economic}} {{base for the}} region. Unpaved logging roads, which provide the only land access, run {{the full length of}} the lake. At {{the south end of the}} lake operates a saw mill. The logs for which are harvested further up the lake, deposited into the lake near the Momich River by a large crane. The logs are then floated down the lake to the mill in log booms drawn by tug boats. It is a common sight to see these <b>log</b> booms <b>anchored</b> in wait at lakeside.|$|R
50|$|In large {{rivers in}} the Pacific Northwest of the United States, {{it has been}} shown there is a {{lifecycle}} of tree growth and river migration, with large trees falling into the channel as banks erode, then staying in place and acting as focal points for log jam formation. These log jams act as hard points resisting further erosion and channel migration. The areas of floodplain behind these log jams then become stable enough for more large trees to grow which in turn can potentially be <b>log</b> jam <b>anchor</b> points in the future.|$|R
5|$|Shipbuilding {{business}} in Sibu {{started in the}} 1930s to supply wooden boats for river and coastal navigation. It flourished in 1970s and 1980s along with increase in exports of tropical timber from Sarawak. It later shifted its focus into steel boat building. Some of the vessels in demand are tug boats for towing logs, barges for carrying <b>logs,</b> <b>anchor</b> handlers, Offshore Support Vessels (OSV), ferries, and express boats for carrying passengers. Most of the boats built are of small and medium in size. There are a total of 40 shipyards in Sibu. A majority of the workers are welders. In 2003, 17 of the shipyards were relocated to Rantau Panjang Integrated Shipyard Shipbuilding Industrial Zone, Sibu. This included Yong Chin Kui, Far East, and TuongAik. The boats built in Sibu are often exported to neighbouring state of Sabah, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and United Arab Emirates. In the year 1991, a total of US$50 million was earned for shipbuilding {{business in}} Sibu. In 2011, Sibu ship exports stood at RM 525 million. Sibu is also the only city in Sarawak to possess a vehicle assembly plant. The plant is operated by N.B. Heavy Industries Sdn. Bhd., {{and it has been}} assembling Ankai, BeiBen, Golden Dragon, Huanghai Bus and JAC commercial vehicles since 2010. Sibu has two industrial areas: Upper Lanang Industrial estate (Mixed Light Industries) and Rantau Panjang Ship Building Industrial Zone.|$|R

5000|$|Ice {{smashed the}} bridge to pieces in 1780, leading the Council to pay Major Benjamin Eyre 7,500 pounds to rebuild it. The rebuilt bridge {{featured}} a deck over planks attached to the <b>logs,</b> with <b>anchors</b> in mid-stream to steady it and railings for safety. Flexible, it rose and fell with the tide. Heavy wagons often depressed the deck a few inches below the water. A 1796 traveler wrote, [...] "Although this bridge floated when not charged, or charged but lightly, the weight of our waggon depressed it several inches below the surface, the horses splashing through the water so that a foot passenger passing {{at the same time}} would have been exposed to serious inconvenience." [...] The bridge had a draw that could be lifted with ropes to allow boats to pass by. The whole span could be unmoored and allowed to float downstream in times of ice or heavy weather, then restored to service.|$|R
60|$|The petards were replaced, and {{the party}} again proceeded; but now Hugh swam on his back, holding a short rope {{attached}} to one end, so as to keep the log straight, and prevent its getting across the mooring chains of the boats forming the bridge; while Rupert and Gerald, each with a rope also attached to the log, floated down some ten or twelve yards {{on either side of}} the log, but a little behind it. The plan answered admirably; the stream carried the log end-foremost between two of the boats, which were moored twelve feet apart, while Gerald and Rupert each floated on the other side of the mooring chains of the boats; round these chains they twisted the ropes, and by them the <b>log</b> lay <b>anchored</b> as it were under the bridge, and between two of the boats forming it. If there were any sentries on the bridge, these neither saw nor heard them, their attention being absorbed by the expectation of an attack upon the breaches of Fort Saint Michael.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Watershed Management, 2011 Whole tree {{materials}} that include trees with attached rootwads, logs, and branches {{are recognized as}} important components of streams flowing through coastal redwood forests of Northern California. As {{the understanding of the}} importance of large wood materials has emerged, they have been recognized as key physical elements missing from many streams due to the historic and systematic removal associated with timber harvest and stream cleaning practices. The recognition of the ecological importance of wood materials within stream and floodplain ecosystems has led scientists and managers to advocate for the re-introduction of large wood directly into these environments. However, common applications of instream wood restoration can fall short of producing features capable of inducing the physical changes necessary to achieve desired restoration objectives, such as the formation of deep pools and cover. Current research shows that natural wood jams, with increased wood piece counts and volumes, are more effective at producing the hydraulic and geomorphic conditions necessary for creating and sustaining complex habitat. This study hypothesized that wood jams constructed with whole tree materials, increased wood piece counts, and greater wood volumes would be more effective than simple structures at creating the hydraulic conditions necessary for increasing instream complexity, geomorphic function, and aquatic habitat quality. Results were based on an evaluation of changes to surface sediment textures and channel morphology at ten constructed wood features built with varying complexity and wood volumes. Eight of these features were complex wood jams constructed with whole tree materials including large diameter trees with attached rootwad, logs, and branches. Each complex jam was individually designed to interact with seasonal variations in stream flow, floodplain morphology, and the dominant sediment transport regime. Two of the studied features were ???simple structures??? constructed in 1995 and comprised of one or two <b>logs</b> <b>anchored</b> to imported boulders with cable. The simple structures were designed following a standard California restoration protocol. Results indicate that complex wood jams were more effective than simple fish habitat structures in achieving common restoration objectives that include: (1) increasing percentage pool cover; (2) increasing scour pool habitat; (3) metering and sorting salmon spawning gravels; and (4) improving habitat heterogeneity. In addition, the effectiveness of an individual constructed jam improved as the overall wood piece count and volume within the jam increased. The increase in pool depths demonstrate that complex wood jams were effective at improving over summering and overwintering pool habitats for steelhead trout, coho salmon, and Chinook salmon...|$|R
50|$|Kent Shocknek is an American {{television}} newsman. Because of {{the length}} of his career, the duration of his broadcasts, and breaking news events, by the time of his retirement from news, he is credited with having <b>logged</b> more hours <b>anchoring</b> newscasts than anyone else in Los Angeles. The city has designated a day in his honor (below). Before anchoring prime-time newscasts on CBS-TV owned stations CBS2 and KCAL9, Shocknek was Southern California's first and longest-running television news morning news anchor. Starting with his tenure at CBS News, he also has been sought out to appear in dozens of feature films and television dramas - typically as a newscaster or commentator - giving rise to a popular second career that continues currently. On radio, Shocknek has narrated a daily commentary in Los Angeles, and has hosted a nationally syndicated entertainment program. TV viewers and magazine readers also recognize him as a reporter and authority on automotive issues.|$|R
40|$|This {{final report}} {{describes}} {{the establishment of}} a Working Group for Acoustic Tomography at IfM Kiel and its first investigations in the convection area of the Western Mediterranean, where the oceanographic conditions in winter {{are similar to those of}} the deep water generation areas of the subpolar North Atlantic. Three 400 Hz ''Webb'' tomography transceivers with a range of about 300 km were newly acquired for the experiments. In all, seven transceivers were used. The oceanographic situation was determined by several hydrographic <b>logs</b> and by <b>anchored</b> temperature measurements. First inversions of the tomographic routine measurements show a very good reproduction of the cooling process in the winter season and of the deep mixing process as compared to conventional oceanographic data. The project was terminated successfully, and there are plans to extend the method to a 1000 -km scale for climate studies in the North Atlantic. (orig.)

5000|$|An {{emerging}} stream restoration {{technique is}} {{the installation of}} engineered log jams. Reintroduction of large woody debris into a stream is a fairly recent method that is being experimented with in streams such as Lagunitas Creek in Marin County, California [...] and Thornton Creek, in Seattle, Washington. Because of channelization and removal of woody debris, many streams now lack the hydraulic complexity {{that is necessary to}} maintain bank stabilization and a healthy plant/animal habitat. Engineered log jams are individually designed {{to meet the needs of}} specific restoration projects, but there are overarching design elements. One element is to <b>anchor</b> <b>logs</b> along the stream bank in order to create a physical blockade against erosion. Large wood pieces, both living [...] and dead, play an important role in the long-term stability of engineered log jams. A second element of engineered log jams is to improve fish habitat. Log jams add diversity to the water flow by creating riffles, pools, and temperature variations. This is vital to fish because it provides the right circumstances to spawn, rest, feed, hunt, and hide.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of our {{participation}} in the Session track is to further evaluate our anchor expansion technique proposed {{in the previous year}} [1]. In particular, we aim to test the effectiveness of this approach on a more realistic dataset collected this year. SWIRL 2012 noted that there is still a large gap between the study of users and the study of IR algorithms [2], so the session data collected for this year’s session track aimed at addressing some of the suggestions made in the SWIRL 2012 report. We exploit the <b>anchor</b> <b>logs</b> to derive query expansions that are relevant to user information needs throughout the session. Anchor text has shown to be effective for a variety of information retrieval tasks. This include the diversity task in the TREC Web track [3]. Anchor text can be considered as a replacement to user queries as often web authors use similar labels to describe web pages to those used by searchers to find them [4]. Moreover, Dang and Croft have recently shown how anchor text can be used to simulate user sessions. They have considered all the anchor text pointing to the same document as querie...|$|R
5000|$|The Bay of Arrows is {{the inlet}} in the Samaná Peninsula where {{in his first}} voyage to the Americas the admiral had the last of these {{encounters}} with the natives, which differently from the previous ones, turned sour. According to Columbus's <b>log,</b> he <b>anchored</b> next to an islet in a bay near Isla Española on January 13, 1493, and immediately sent men to shore {{to meet with the}} natives, who happened to be the Cigüayos. Columbus's men went ashore and after some trading convinced one of the men to accompany them back to the ship to talk to Columbus. Upon meeting the Cigüayo, Columbus came to the conclusion the man was one of the Caribs. According to what Columbus had been able to decipher from conversations with other indigenous people, the Taínos greatly feared the Caribs because of their warlike and cannibalistic practices. Columbus and the Cigüayo talked about the surrounding region, and the native told him about the all-female island of Matinino as well as many surrounding islands known for their sources of gold. Columbus also offered him with food and gifts, including cloth and glass beads. Columbus then had seven of his men return to the island to bring back the native leader and trade more with the island's inhabitants. Upon arrival, it was noticed that [...] "upwards of fifty savages armed with bows and arrows, war-clubs, and javelins" [...] were waiting in the tree line [...] There was no immediate skirmish however, and trading began smoothly between the islanders and the Europeans. Columbus's men were interested in trading for bows and arrows to bring back to Spain as artifacts of the New World, and possibly to disarm them in case a clash would occur. The atmosphere was obviously tense. The Spaniards were tired and anxious to go home, but more importantly, worried about indigenous people with arrows. The Cigüayos were also apprehensive of these visitors, and on the defensive.|$|R
40|$|Cable yarding systems (also {{sometimes}} {{known as}} skyline yarding systems) are a versatile means for transporting materials in mountainous terrain in situations {{that do not}} allow for conventional harvesting methods such as ground skidding or shovel-logging. Adequate ground anchors are necessary for the safe operation of cable yarding systems. Anchored guylines stabilize the yarding tower enabling the safe transport of payloads. Typically, the anchors employed in these operations are available stumps or trees. Where adequate stumps or trees are not available, a variety of alternative anchors can be applied. These includes buried deadman <b>anchors,</b> <b>log</b> decks, engineered earth anchors, rock bolts, and mobile equipment anchors such as bulldozers or skidders.

5000|$|HeadWaters Trails Inc. in Holly (Oakland County) {{promotes}} the navigability {{of the river}} through Fenton towards Lake Ponemah, {{all the way to}} Byron, Michigan and the protection of the habitat along the river and in the river to make that experience special. They have cleaned the river as far down a Byron each year. Volunteer crews remove dead falls, and woody debris, which are anchored to the banks for shore protection and fish habitat; and remove garbage to allow canoe/kayak paddling. This will allow paddlers to start in Holly, do a small portage at Fenton dam, and continue on to Lake Ponemah. The more adventuresome can go as far as the dam in Byron. Every year Headwaters Trails hosts an annual Shiawassee River Paddle along the river between Holly and Fenton in June, known as the [...] "Adventure Paddle". In the October, it hosts [...] "Canoeing in Color", a time to see migrating birds and the changing of the leaves to brilliant fall colors. These paddles are to raise awareness of the river to the community and help support the efforts of Headwaters Trails to continue making improvements in the form of new places to put in the river as well as signage and fund the purchase of things like steel cables to <b>anchor</b> <b>logs</b> to the banks of the river. They work closely with the communities along the river to promote and conserve that trail as a place where paddle craft can go and where fish habitat is preserved. The number of Kingfishers, Blue Herons and other fishing birds is a tribute to that effort.|$|R
