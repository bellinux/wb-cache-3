25|$|The Great <b>Smog</b> of <b>London,</b> or Great <b>Smog</b> of 1952 {{sometimes}} called the Big Smoke, was a severe air-pollution event that affected the British capital of London in December 1952.

It lasted from Friday, 5 December to Tuesday, 9 December 1952 and then dispersed quickly when the weather changed.|$|R

50|$|Environmental {{concerns}} were {{rooted in the}} vast social changes {{that took place in}} the United States after World War II. Although environmentalism can be identified in earlier years, only after the war did it become widely shared social priority. This began with outdoor recreation in the 1950s, extended into the wider field of the protection of natural environments, and then became infused with attempts to cope with air and water pollution and still later with toxic chemical pollutants. After World War II, environmental politics became a major public concern. The development of environmentalism in the United Kingdom emerged in this period following the great <b>London</b> <b>smog</b> of 1952 and the Torrey Canyon oil spill of 1967.

Early air pollution control efforts were prompted by urban episodes due to local emissions, such as the 1952 <b>London</b> <b>smog</b> associated with sulphur from burning coal (see Chapter 1). Through {{the latter half of the}} 20 th century, awareness of air pollution risks to health, agriculture, natural ecosystems, and man-made structures has grown. Similarly, the geographic scale on which pollutant transport is studied and regulated has expanded. Currently, the U. S.

40|$|The <b>London</b> <b>smog</b> of 1952 {{is one of}} history’s most {{important}} air pollution episodes {{in terms of its}} impact on science, public perception of air pollution, and government regulation. The association between health and air pollution during the episode was evident as a strong rise in air pollution levels was immediately followed by sharp increases in mortality and morbidity. However, mortality in the months after the smog was also elevated above normal levels. An initial government report proposed the hypothesis that influenza was responsible for high mortality during these months. Estimates of the number of influenza deaths were generated using multiple methods, indicating that {{only a fraction of the}} deaths in the months after the smog could be attributable to influenza. Sensitivity analysis reveals that only an extremely severe influenza epidemic could account for the majority of the excess deaths for this time period. Such an epidemic would be on the order of twice the case-fatality rate and quadruple the incidence observed in a general medical practice during the winter of 1953. These results underscore the need for diligence regarding extremely high air pollution that still exists in many parts of the world. Key words: air pollution, influenza, London, mortality.

40|$|The first {{alarm system}} for summer smog was {{established}} in 1948 in Los Angeles. Following the tragic <b>London</b> <b>Smog</b> where several hundred people died, the Rhine-Ruhr area set up a winter smog alarm system in the early 1960 s. Since that time, many industrialized countries have instituted smog-alarm systems, which {{have contributed to the}} reduction of air pollution risks to the public. Perhaps more importantly, these systems have stimulated progress in air pollution abatement technologies, since the costs of closing down industries during smog episodes is often higher than the necessary investments to reduce air pollution. Today, most countries with smog alarm systems have very infrequent air pollution episodes. The situation is different in industrially developing countries, where serious air pollution episodes are frequent. These countries may need to institute smog alarm systems to protect public health. For this reason, the Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe asked IIASA to carry out a study that would help C&E European countries establish their own systems in collaboration with their neighbors. This report describes experience with winter and summer smog-alarm systems in western countries and makes recommendations for the design of cost-efficient and effective systems for C&E Europe. The Study was carried out in close collaboration with experts in these countries. We hope this report is helpful in assuring that, within a few years, efficient smog alarm systems are in place within the entire C&E European region.

Although the pathology of emphysema was well recognized at the time, the clinical diagnosis and assessment of its severity {{were known to be}} imprecise; physiological measurements assessing and following the clinical course had not been established. The study aimed to follow systematically a group of patients, selected by clinical criteria using standardized clinical and physiological techniques, over four years and correlate physiological and clinical changes in relation to prognosis and eventually to postmortem findings. Fifty-nine patients were recruited to an emphysema clinic at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, England. Inclusion criteria were dyspnea without other causes and no cor pulmonale present. Patients' symptoms were assessed by a standardized questionnaire, and measurements were taken of lung volumes, maximal ventilatory volume, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity at rest, exercise and oxygen saturation by oximetry.  During the four years of the study, 17 patients died (actuarial expected - four) and 13 presented with signs of pulmonary heart failure. All postmortem examinations (n= 9) showed advanced emphysema. A seasonal variation in dyspnea was established (the period included the infamous 1952 <b>London</b> <b>smog).</b> Four patients improved, and the remainder were unchanged or deteriorated. Close relationships were shown between dyspnea and function results, particularly for the diffusing capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO. A comparison among a group of patients with chronic bronchitis without dyspnea showed that the DLCO discriminated between them. A loss of the normal increase in DLCO during exercise was shown in emphysema...|$|E
