50|$|Bacteriophages {{are very}} robust {{biological}} agents, are {{very hard to}} kill, and are very easily spread. At lower exposures, Ultraviolet light can enhance the production of both phage T12 and speA. Longer UV exposure times can kill the phage. UV light stresses <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> leading the phages to propagate and burst the host bacterial cells. In the case of T12, exposure to UV light increases the propagation of bacteriophage T12 at 20 seconds of exposure. After 20 seconds of exposure the UV light starts to kill the bacteriophage by damaging its genome.|$|E

40|$|Thiouracil exerts an {{inhibitory}} {{influence on}} induced <b>lysogenic</b> <b>Bacterium</b> megaterium {{that is much}} more extensive on phage protein and phage DNA synthesis than on bacterial protein and DNA synthesis. The number of infectious phage particles produced decreases more than does the amount of phage protein. The action of thiouracil is reversible by uracil, but not by thymine nor thymidine. Ultraviolet irradiation suppresses the inhibitory effect of thiouracil unless the cells have {{been in contact with}} the latter for 30 - 60 min preceding irradiation. Thiouracil incorporation into RNA is also suppressed by ultraviolet irradiation. Nevertheless, a considerable amount is incorporated if the thiouracil is added 30 min before irradiation. The parallelism which seems to exist between incorporation of thiouracil into RNA and its inhibitory action on phage protein synthesis is consistent with the hypothesis that a particular fraction of RNA participates in the synthesis of phage constituents and that thiouracil influences phage synthesis by being incorporated into this fraction. Though the phenomenon is not so readily observed, azaguanine also seems to exert a selective inhibitory action on the synthesis of phage protein and phage DNA in induced <b>lysogenic</b> <b>Bacterium</b> megaterium.

This indicates that the phage proteins synthesized in the presence of RNase are not integrated into normal infectious particles. Nevertheless, these proteins are assembled into phage-like particles of normal aspect containing DNA. The fact that they are not infectious seems to be related to their defective fixation onto the host bacteria.

40|$|One {{conceivable}} {{function for}} constitutive integrase formation by lambda prophage is {{to stabilize the}} inserted state by catalyzing reinsertion of prophages that are accidentally excised.

By examining the frequency with which prophages appear in an initially unoccupied chromosomal site of a <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacterium</b> in which the prophage attachment site is duplicated, the off-rate is estimated as less than 10 (- 2) per generation for wild-type lambda, and less than 4 x 10 (- 4) for N- mutants of lambda.

There has been considerable controversy concerning this agent; it has been thought to be a nonpathogenic bacteriophage or an infectious virus masked by a component of the cell it invades. These hypotheses, however, are not entirely compatible with the hypothesis proposed in recent years by bacterial geneticists who consider this structure, now termed prophage, to be comparable to a genetic unit which is perpetuated by cell division, and which endows every microorganism in a lysogenic culture with the potentiality of producing infectious virus.

40|$|This {{method is}} based on the {{induction}} of bacteriophage λ from lysogenic cycle to lytic cycle by ultraviolet irradiation, and formation of free radicals during the course of induction. In the experiments, 108 cells/ml and 30 s (39 J/m 2) were determined as the cell density of the <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacterium</b> and UV irradiation time, respectively.

This method had good reproducibility with intra-day variations (RSD, %) of less than 4 % and inter-day variations (RSD, %) of less than 5 %, respectively. By this method, the free radical scavenging abilities (ID 50) of well-known antioxidants such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and carotenoids were determined quantitatively. The results were consistent with the ones obtained by conventional methods for evaluating free radical scavenging abilities.

40|$|The {{potential}} effect that induction of <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> has on bacteriophage production and bacterial mortality in coastal waters was investigated, and we present {{estimates for the}} percentage of lysogenic cells in a natural aquatic bacterial community. Various concentrations of mitomycin C and exposure times to UV C radiation (UV-C) (wavelength of 254 nm) were used to induce the lytic cycle in lysogenic cells of natural communities of marine bacteria. UV-C treatment occasionally resulted in phage production, but phage production induced by UV-C was always less than that caused {{by the addition of}} mitomycin C. There was no evidence that high growth rates of bacteria resulted in lysogenic phage production. The burst size of cells induced by mitomycin C was determined by transmission electron microscopy and ranged from 11 to 45. Dividing the induced phage production by the burst size provided an estimate of the number of lysogenic bacterial cells, which ranged from 0. 07 to 4. 4 % (average, 1. 5 %) of the total bacterial population. The percentages of <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> that were induced by mitomycin C were similar for samples collected nearshore from the pier of the Marine Science Institute (chlorophyll a, 1. 6 to 2. 9 (mu) g liter(sup- 1)) and in relatively oligotrophic water (chlorophyll a, 0. 2 to 0. 9 (mu) g liter(sup- 1)) collected 25 to 100 km offshore.

We have previously found <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> to be a significant proportion (43 %) of the cultivable heterotrophic microbial population. As the majority of marine bacteria are not cultivable using standard plating methods, we measured the proportion of marine <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in natural communities by prophage induction. Mitomycin C, UV radiation, sunlight, temperature and pressure were used to induce prophage in <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> from estuarine, coastal and oligotrophic offshore environments. To determine if hydrocarbon pollutants may cause the induction of marine lysogens, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons (including Bunker C # 6 fuel oil, phenanthrene, naphthalene, pyrene, and trichloroethylene) were also used as inducing agents. Induction was most often found in estuarine environments, where viral direct counts increased from 128. 8 to 345 % of the uninduced control, resulting in mortality of 10. 5 to 67. 3 % (average 34 %) of the bacterial population. Up to 38 % of the bacterial population was lysogenized in estuarine environments, as calculated from an average burst size. Microbial populations from oligotrophic offshore environments were inducible at 3 of 11 stations sampled. Eight of the 11 samples (73 %) treated with polyaromatic hydrocarbons resulted in prophage induction in natural populations. Time series analysis was also conducted in 2 samples induced by mitomycin C from the Atlantic Ocean near the coast of North Carolina, USA. For both samples, significant decreases in bacterial numbers were detected in treated samples after 8 h of incubation. A significant increase of viruses was detected at 8 h at one station and at 24 h at the other station after induction.

The level of transformation decreased even further if the competent lysogenic cells were allowed to incubate in growth media prior to selection on minimal agar. This reduction {{in the frequency of}} transformation was attributable to the selective elimination of transformed lysogenic cells from the competent population. Concurrent with the {{decrease in the number of}} transformants from a lysogenic competent population was the release of bacteriophage by these cells. The <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> demonstrated this dramatic release of bacteriophage only if the cells were grown to competence. Both the selective elimination of transformed lysogens and the induction of prophage was prevented by the inhibition of protein synthesis. Additionally, competent lysogenic cells released significantly higher amounts of exogenous donor transforming deoxyribonucleic acid than did competent non-lysogenic cells or competent lysogenic cells incubated with erythromycin. These data establish that the induction of the prophage from the competent lysogenic cells was responsible for the selective elmination of the lysogenic transformants. A model is presented that accounts for the induction of the prophage from competent <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> via the induction of a repair system.

40|$|All {{cellular}} {{organisms in}} aquatic environments {{are susceptible to}} virus attack. Viruses are the smallest but most abundant biological entities in freshwaters. This thesis describes interactions between viruses and bacteria in temperate and polar freshwaters with particular emphasis on Arctic and Antarctic aquatic systems. Free virus-like particles in freshwaters are vulnerable and exposed and as parasites their survival {{is dependent on the}} existence of a suitable host. I found that high concentrations of humic substances in lakes had a negative impact on viral abundance as viruses may be adsorbed to humic matter and replication or viral infectivity may be lost. This indicates that virus-bacteria interactions in humic lakes may differ from those in clear water lakes. Furthermore, there was a high incidence of <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in humic lakes when compared to other temperate freshwaters which could indicate that lysogeny may act as a viral survival strategy in environments where high rates of destruction and inactivation may occur. On the contrary, I found that <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> were not common in the Arctic and Antarctic freshwaters and during a seasonal study conducted on two Antarctic ultra-oligotrophic lakes <b>lysogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> were only detected on 3 out of 10 sampling occasions. As viruses are parasites the metabolic state of their host will largely determine how successful they are in replicating. I found that bacterial growth in the Arctic and Antarctic freshwaters was primarily limited by phosphorus however even though an increase in phosphorus had a positive effect on bacteria this was not reflected in the virus abundance. Using electron microscopy I established that a high percentage of the Arctic and Antarctic bacteria population was visibly infected and that the average number of virus-like particles per cell was low relative to previous reported data. This indicates that virus-bacteria interactions in polar freshwaters differ significantly from those in temperate freshwaters. In microbially dominated Antarctic freshwater lakes the major pathway of energy and carbon flow is through the microbial loop. Viral lysis disrupts this flow and shunts organic carbon back into the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool making it available for the uninfected bacterial community. I found that viral lysis of bacterial cells could contribute significantly to the DOC pool in Antarctic freshwater lakes. I estimated that over 60 % of the carbon supplied to the DOC pool originated from viral lysis during the winter months while during the summer period less than 20 % originated from viral lysis. This implies that viral processes in extreme Antarctic lakes may be of quantitative significance with respect to carbon flow...|$|E

Phage mv 4 is capable of transducing a limited set of pieces of bacterial DNA and several specific chromosomal attachment sites of phage mv 4 were identified. <b>Bacteria</b> <b>lysogenic</b> for phage mv 4 were shown to be immune to infection by L delbrueckii virulent phages related to mv 4...|$|R
