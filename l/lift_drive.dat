40|$|At present, {{there are}} {{benchmarking}} parameters {{to assess the}} energy performance of lifts, e. g. one in Germany adopted by VDI (4707 - 1 / 2), one internationally published by ISO (BS EN ISO 25745 - 2 : 2015), {{and the other in}} Hong Kong adopted by The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. These parameters are mainly checking the energy consumed by a <b>lift</b> <b>drive</b> without considering real time passenger demands and traffic conditions; the one in Hong Kong pinpointing a fully loaded up-journey under rated speed and the two in Europe pinpointing a round trip, bottom floor to top floor and return with an empty car, though including energy consumed by lighting, displays, ventilation etc. A holistic normalization method by Lam et al [1] was developed {{a number of years ago}} by one of the co-authors of this article, which can assess both drive efficiency and traffic control, termed J/kg-m, which is now adopted by the HKSAR Government as a good practice, but not specified in the mandatory code. In Europe, the energy unit of Wh has been used but here, Joule (J), i. e. Ws, is adopted to discriminate the difference between the two concepts. In this article, this parameter is evaluated under different lift traffic scenarios using computer simulation techniques, with an aim of arriving at a reasonable figure for benchmarking an energy efficient lift system with both an efficient drive as well as an efficient supervisory traffic control...|$|E
40|$|The {{transformation}} of Joint forces to be lighter, more lethal, {{and capable of}} deploying from multiple dispersed locations free of prepared landing zones requires a dedicated heavy lift VTOL aircraft capable of rapidly delivering large payloads, such as the 20 to 26 ton Future Combat System, at extended ranges in demanding terrain and environmental conditions. Current estimates for a single main rotor configuration place the design weight over 130, 000 pounds with an installed power of approximately 30, 000 horsepower. Helicopter drive systems capable of delivering torque of this magnitude succeeded in the Russian Mi- 26 helicopters split-torque design and the Boeing VERTOL Heavy Lift Helicopter (HLH) prototypes traditional multi-stage planetary design. The square-cube law and historical trends show that the transmission stage weight varies approximately as the two-thirds power of torque; hence, as the size and weight of the vehicle grows, the transmissions weight becomes an ever-increasing portion of total gross weight. At this scale, optimal gearbox configuration and component design holds great potential to save significant weight and reduce the required installed power. The drive system design methodology creates a set of integrated tools to estimate system weight and rapidly model the preliminary design of drives system components. Tools are provided for gearbox weight estimation and efficiency, gearing, shafting, and cooling. Within the same architecture, the designer may add similar tools to model subcomponents such as support bearings, gearbox housing, freewheeling units, and rotor brakes. Measuring the relationships between key design variables and system performance metrics reveals insight into the performance and behavior of a heavy <b>lift</b> <b>drive</b> system. A parametric study of select design variables is accomplished through an intelligent Design of Experiments that utilizes Response Surface Methodology to build a multivariate regression weight model. The model permits visualization of the design space and assists in optimization of the drive system preliminary design. This methodology is applied to both the Boeing HLH and the Russian Mi- 26 main gearboxes. This study applies the drive system design methodology to compare the Mi- 26 split-torque gearbox over the Boeing HLH multi-stage planetary gearbox in a single main rotor heavy lift helicopter. M. S.

The technology is simple, typically using a parallel-bar double-cam <b>lift</b> <b>driven</b> from a low-power electric motor, although the number of pumpjacks with stroke lengths 54 inches (137 cm) and longer being used as water pumps is increasing.

40|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>lift</b> <b>driven</b> {{vertical}} axis turbine {{which can be used}} for capturing energy from tidal streams. These are the straight bladed “Darrieus-type” and the helically shaped “Gorlov-type”. The Darrieus-type turbine can suffer from vibrations in the shaft due to torque variations, known as “torque ripple”. Gorlov-type turbines ought to reduce this problem but suffer from variations in force distribution along the length of turbine blade. The double multiple streamtube model (a blade element momentum model), with the Gormont-Berg adaptation for dynamic stall, is used to analyse the blade forces and shaft torques. The results show the extent to which torque ripple or variable blade force is effected by various other design choices, such as blade thickness, blade camber or turbine solidity. From these some of the requisite turbine characteristics are derived...|$|R

Making matters worse, both Túrin and his sister Nienor are enchanted by the mighty dragon Glaurung — who has sacked the great Elf-city of Nargothrond and taken up residence there — and they fall in love and live for time as man and wife. Eventually Túrin kills Glaurung, but with his death the spell is <b>lifted.</b> <b>Driven</b> mad by the realisation of their sins, Túrin and Nienor both commit suicide.|$|R

30|$|The FEA {{simulations}} {{were broken}} down into nine groups to validate the results and impact of the blade geometries. The groups were normal blades, extended normal, maple seed shape, triplaris samara seed shape, normal with tubercles, extended normal with tubercles, maple seed with tubercles, triplaris samara with tubercles on the leading edge, and triplaris samara with tubercles on the trailing edge. The normal blades are straight blades with a constant cross-section width. The extended normal blades were designed similar to the normal blades with the only difference being {{the length of the}} blade. The blade length was extended to have the same surface area for {{the lower half of the}} blade as the maple seed blade to compare the structural integrity for the same pressure application over the same area. The maple seed blade was designed to follow the geometry of a maple seed as close as possible to generate leading-edge vortices and increase the lift of the wind turbine. The cross-section of the maple seed was difficult to generate and would not be reliable at high wind speeds. Given that the wind turbine is <b>lift</b> <b>driven,</b> the use of airfoils was determined to be the best option. The triplaris samara blades were designed in a similar fashion as the maple seed blades.|$|R
