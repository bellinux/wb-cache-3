5|$|In his {{judgment}} of 29 January 2008, Justice Woo ordered Pacific Internet to release its subscribers' information {{only to the}} six Japanese companies that were parties to the case. He explicitly denied Odex access to this information. He upheld District Judge Lau's decision that Odex was not the correct party to have asked for release of subscriber data. As a result, he directed the company to pay Pacific Internet's <b>legal</b> <b>costs</b> of S$20,000. Following the ruling, some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies.

40|$|Occupational injury {{has sparked}} more {{concern to the}} {{manufacturing}} industry since it may give an impact to the organization especially on financial viewpoint. However, there is lack of consensus between researchers in identifying occupational accident indirect cost components. This study proposed {{an assessment of the}} indirect cost model by using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In total, there are 344 cases (which occurred between 2008 and 2013) were considered in developing the model and those cases were obtained from six different sectors in manufacturing industry. Data collection process involves reviewing previous accident record in that particular company. Besides, several interview sessions with site safety officers, representatives from human resource and account department, supervisors and operators were conducted in order to estimate each of indirect cost components. Both approaches also known as local specific approach. Then, CFA is performed to validate the model proposed by examining the relationship between observed variable and its latent construct. The observed variables are productivity loss, worker replacement <b>cost,</b> administration and <b>legal</b> <b>cost,</b> investigation cost, machine and equipment damage cost and product damage cost whereas latent construct used in this study is accident indirect cost. The CFA result shows that the occupational accident indirect cost model has acceptable goodness of fit. In conclusion, indirect cost components are productivity loss, worker replacement <b>cost,</b> administration and <b>legal</b> <b>cost,</b> investigation cost, machine and equipment damage cost and product damage cost...|$|R
5|$|Revie's {{reputation}} {{suffered in}} the late 1970s after his highly controversial England resignation. Both the Daily Mirror and Sunday People claimed that Revie had attempted to bribe Wolverhampton Wanderers players to lose a crucial match in May 1972. The papers quoted Wolves midfielder Danny Hegan and former Leeds United goalkeeper Gary Sprake's claims that Revie's captain Billy Bremner had tried to arrange a bribe. Bremner sued for libel and won £100,000 libel damages, along with <b>legal</b> <b>costs,</b> after both Hegan and Sprake refused to repeat their allegations under oath in court. Wolves player Derek Dougan, who had scored against Leeds in the match in question, testified {{that he had heard}} no mention of the alleged bribes.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend of}} Eberhardt's {{gave her a}} letter of {{introduction}} to playwright Eugène Brieux, who opposed French rule in North Africa and supported Arab emancipation. He sent her a several-hundred-franc advance and tried to have her stories published, but could not find anyone willing to publish pro-Arab writing. Eberhardt, unfazed, continued writing; her morale lifted when Ehnni was transferred to a spahi regiment near Marseille in late August to complete his final months of service. He did not require permission from his military superiors to marry in France, and he and Eberhardt were married in October 1901. Shortly before they were married, Eberhardt and Augustin received the news that Trophimowsky's estate had finally been sold, though due to the mounting <b>legal</b> <b>costs</b> {{there was no money}} left for them to inherit. With this news, Eberhardt abandoned any hope of having a financially secure future. In February 1902 Ehnni was discharged, and the couple returned to Bône to live with his family.|$|E

However, Jive announced on October 10, 2007, that the release date would be moved up two weeks, to October 30, 2007, due to unauthorized leaks. The following day, Zomba Label Group {{filed a lawsuit against}} Perez Hilton claiming he illegally obtained and posted on his gossip blog at least ten songs and unfinished demos of the album. Zomba representatives alleged the posts had taken place {{over the course of the}} previous three months, and requested real and punitive damages as well as <b>legal</b> <b>costs.</b> On June 30, 2009, the parties submitted a stipulation to dismiss the case, pursuant to an undisclosed settlement agreement.

5|$|In a rare move, District Judge Earnest Lau {{released}} a 14-page judgment explaining the court's denial of Odex's request for Pacific Internet's client information. He compared Odex's demands to an Anton Piller order, which {{provides for the}} right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. Seen as draconian, it is only used under extreme circumstances. He held that only copyright holders themselves, or their exclusive licensees, can bring such applications and that he was not satisfied with the evidence harvested by BayTSP for the identification of downloaders. Out of all the anime licensed to Odex, only the license in respect of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED had been granted exclusively to the company. The judge noted that, out of the 13 authorisation letters presented in court, ten of them authorised the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS), not Odex, to act for the copyright holders. Odex was ordered to pay Pacific Internet's <b>legal</b> <b>costs</b> of S$7,000.|$|E
5|$|In late 1992, the Dangerous Journeys RPG was {{released}} by Games Designer Workshop, but TSR immediately applied for an injunction against the entire Dangerous Journeys RPG and the Mythus setting, arguing that Dangerous Journeys was based on D and AD. Although the injunction failed, TSR moved forward with litigation. Gygax believed the legal action was without merit and fuelled by Lorraine Williams' personal enmity, but NEC and JVC both withdrew from the project, killing the Mythus computer game. By 1994, the <b>legal</b> <b>costs</b> associated with many months of pretrial discovery had drained all of Gygax's resources; believing that TSR was also suffering, Gygax offered to settle. In the end, TSR paid Gygax for the complete rights to Dangerous Journeys and Mythus. Although Gygax was well compensated for his years of work on Dangerous Journeys and Mythus, neither was ever published—TSR immediately and permanently shelved them.|$|E

40|$|This study uses {{a set of}} firm-level {{data from}} Worldscope to {{examine the impact of}} {{national}} legal environments on audit markets across 39 countries. Our auditor choice and audit fee results support the <b>legal</b> <b>cost</b> hypothesis that Big Five auditors charge a higher risk premium {{and are more likely to}} turn away risky clients in strong legal environments than in weak legal environments. We also find that the complementary effect outweighs the <b>legal</b> <b>cost</b> effect in that strong legal environments do not reduce the market share of high quality auditors, but they enhance the development of capital markets, which in turn creates a higher demand for quality audit service. Our general sample results show that firms in strong legal environments, ceteris paribus, are more likely to hire Big Five auditors than their counterparts operating in weak legal environments. However, among the large firms in the sample, which are more likely to have international investors, we document evidence supporting the substitution effect hypothesis that firms in weak legal environments are more likely to hire Big Five auditors than firms in strong legal environments because external auditors may serve as a substitute for legal protection t...|$|R
50|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the cost of a Dispute Board will result in even the most strenuous dispute being {{resolved}} and with an almost 99% success rate of dispute resolution without the need for either costly litigation or arbitration the savings are enormous. The reason this is significant is because the construction industry has a reputation for disputes and conflict. Anecdotal evidence from Australia, as just one example, indicates that 50% of all <b>legal</b> <b>cost</b> associated with construction is expended in connection with disputes. In almost 10% of projects, between 8% and 10% of the total project <b>cost</b> was <b>legal</b> <b>cost.</b> Not surprisingly, these projects have a high incidence of disputes. This expenditure, which globally represents an enormous sum each year, does not begin to take into account the hidden costs of disputes; the damage to reputations and commercial relationships, the cost of time spent by executive personnel, and the cost of lost opportunities. The situation is aggravated by the increased use of joint ventures both in consulting and in contracting. Such organisations are less autonomous and perhaps less able to negotiate settlements of their contractual problems.|$|R

5|$|Leeds {{finished}} second in the league for the third successive season in the 1971–72 campaign, despite playing some of the best football in the club's history.

5|$|According to a {{press release}} issued by Samuel Estimo, an {{attorney}} representing Jinky Young, the Supreme Court of Iceland ruled, in December 2009, that Watai's claim of marriage to Fischer was invalidated because of her failure to present the original copy of their alleged marriage certificate.

The exhumation was performed on July 5, 2010, {{in the presence of a}} doctor, a priest, and other officials. A DNA sample was taken and Fischer's body was then reburied. On August 17, 2010, the Court announced that based on the DNA sample it was determined that Fischer was not the father of Jinky Young. On March 3, 2011, an Icelandic district court ruled that Miyoko Watai and Fischer had married on September 6, 2004, and that, as Fischer's widow and heir, Watai was therefore entitled to inherit Fischer's estate. Fischer's nephews were ordered to pay Watai's <b>legal</b> <b>costs,</b> amounting to ISK 6.6 million (approximately $57,000).|$|E
