50|$|The {{animal is}} {{immediately}} one with its <b>life</b> <b>activity.</b> It is not distinct from that activity; {{it is that}} activity. Man makes his <b>life</b> <b>activity</b> itself an object of his will and consciousness. He has conscious <b>life</b> <b>activity.</b> It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious <b>life</b> <b>activity</b> directly distinguishes man from animal <b>life</b> <b>activity.</b> Only because of that is he a species-being. Or, rather, he is a conscious being - i.e., his own life is an object for him, only {{because he is a}} species-being. Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labour reverses the relationship so that man, just because he is a conscious being, makes his <b>life</b> <b>activity,</b> his essential being, a mere means for his existence.|$|R

25|$|The {{woman is}} {{instructed}} to resume her normal <b>life</b> <b>activities,</b> and {{to eat a}} light diet, post-operative, {{on the day of}} the breast reduction surgery; to resume washing in a shower at 1-day post-operative; to avoid strenuous physical activity, and to wear a sports brassière; the convalescence regimen is for 3-months post-operative. She is also informed that the wrinkles at the bottom of the vertical limb of the scar usually resolve and fade within 1–6 months post-operative; yet some cases might require surgical revision of the vertical scar. Scheduled follow-up consultations ensure a satisfactory outcome to the breast reduction surgery, and facilitate the early identification and management of medical complications.|$|E
25|$|The {{patient is}} {{discharged}} from hospital either {{the same day}} or {{the day after the}} breast reduction operation. Because the liposuction-only procedure featured only a few, small, surgical incisions, the woman quickly recovers her health, usually resuming daily <b>life</b> <b>activities</b> at 14 to 28 days post-operative — when the breast-molding dressings are changed; she also resumes her personal hygiene regimen to include washing under a water shower. In the initial convalescence period, the surgical-incision wounds are inspected at 1-week post-operative, during which time the woman has continuously worn a strapless brassière to contain and immobilize her corrected breasts; afterwards, she continuously wears a strapped brassière for 30 days after the breast-reduction operation.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{published}} research conducted in Second Life {{is associated with}} education and learning.

One such study tested the usefuleness of SL as an action learning environment in a senior course for management information systems students. Another presented a case study in which university students were tasked with building an interactive learning experience using SL as a platform. Both problem-based learning and constructionism acted as framing pedagogies for the task, with students working in teams to design and build a learning experience which could be possible in real life.|$|E
25|$|Residence is {{provided}} {{to students in}} 24 undergraduate and postgraduate residences and 3 postgraduate-only residences spread over the University's campuses. The first students of the Transvaal University College, resided in the Kya Rosa, a Victorian house in Skinner Street. In 1915, the first male residence Kollegetehuis was constructed on the Hatfield campus and the first female residence Asterhof in 1925. In 1916 Dutch Reformed Church established the Sonop Christelike Tehuis aiming to provide accommodation to the male students of the University, the private residence enjoys an official recognition agreement with University authorities.

25|$|The {{surgical}} {{scars of}} a breast augmentation mammoplasty heal at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within several months, {{according to the}} skin type of the woman. Depending upon the daily physical activity the woman might require, the augmentation mammoplasty patient usually resumes her normal <b>life</b> <b>activities</b> at about 1-week post-operative. The woman who underwent submuscular implantation (beneath the pectoralis major muscles) usually has a longer post–operative convalescence, and experiences more pain, because of the healing of the deep-tissue cuts into the chest muscles for the breast augmenation. The patient usually does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for about 6 weeks. Moreover, during the initial convalescence, the patient is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arms to alleviate pain and discomfort; and, as required, analgesic medication catheters for alleviating pain.|$|E

25|$|One {{method of}} non-implant breast {{reconstruction}} is initiated at the concluding {{steps of the}} breast cancer surgery, wherein the oncological surgeon is joined by the reconstructive plastic surgeon, who immediately begins harvesting, refining, and seeding (injecting) fat grafts to the post-mastectomy recipient site. After that initial post-mastectomy fat-graft seeding in the operating room, the patient leaves hospital with a slight breast mound that has been seeded to become the foundation tissue matrix for the breast reconstruction. Then, after 3–5 weeks of continual external vacuum expansion of the breast mound (seeded recipient-site)to promote the histologic regeneration of the extant tissues (fat, glandular) via increased blood circulation to the mastectomy scar (suture site)the patient formally undergoes the first fat-grafting session for the reconstruction of her breasts. The external vacuum expansion of the breast mound created an adequate, vascularised, breast-tissue matrix to which the autologous fat is injected; and, per the patient, such reconstruction affords almost-normal sensation throughout the breast and the nipple-areola complex. Patient recovery from non-surgical fat graft breast reconstruction permits her to resume normal <b>life</b> <b>activities</b> at 3-days post-procedure.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court decided under Title II of the ADA {{that mental}} illness {{is a form}} of {{disability}} and therefore covered under the ADA, and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability {{is a form of}} discrimination because it [...] "...perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life." [...] The court added, [...] "Confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday <b>life</b> <b>activities</b> of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ADA {{defines a}} covered {{disability}} {{as a physical}} or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major <b>life</b> <b>activities,</b> a history of having such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment. The EEOC developed regulations limiting an individual’s impairment to one that [...] "severely or significantly restricts" [...] a major life activity. The ADAAA directed the EEOC to amend its regulations and replace [...] "severely or significantly" [...] with [...] "substantially limits", a more lenient standard.|$|E

Occupational therapy practitioners are skilled professionals whose education includes the study of human growth and development with specific emphasis on the physical, emotional, psychological, sociocultural, cognitive and environmental components of illness and injury. They commonly work alongside clinical psychologists in settings such as inpatient and outpatient mental health, pain management clinics, eating disorder clinics, and child development services.

Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Leslie Irvine has focused her attention on pets of the homeless population. Her studies of pet ownership among the homeless [...] found that many modify their <b>life</b> <b>activities</b> for fear of losing their pets. Pet ownership prompts them to be and act responsibly, with many making a deliberate choice not to drink or use drugs, and to avoid contact with substance abusers or those involved in any criminal activity for fear of being separated from their pet. Additionally, many refuse housing in shelters if their pet is not allowed to stay with them.|$|E
