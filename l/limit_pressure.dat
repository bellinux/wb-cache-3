In supporting this program, it is required to develop the component of combustion system. One of the components is strorage tank for BBG that must be carefully designed to avoid burst type failure. Based on previous research, a toroidal tank can withstand higher <b>limit</b> <b>pressure</b> than the PERTAMINA LPG 3 kg storage tank used nowadays in Indonesia household. The present study was exstended to toroidal tank of elliptic cross-section. The strength in term of <b>limit</b> <b>pressure</b> was evaluated numerically using the ANSYS 13 finite element software. The ANSYS SHELL 181 element type was used. <b>Limit</b> <b>pressure</b> were obtained via nonlinier analysis using the well-known Newton-Raphson algorithm, and corresponding stress and strain were evaluated. The results show that toroidal tank having elliptic ratio (a/b) of 1. 0 (circular) can withstand highest <b>limit</b> <b>pressure,</b> both for in-plane and out-of-plane elliptic, i. e., 1. 16 times the pressure to yield (py). Attachment of a nozzle on intrados position results in reducing the <b>limit</b> <b>pressure</b> by 5. 21 %, becomes 1. 1 py.

This study inspects a <b>limit</b> <b>pressure</b> of the gas slip effect in tight sandstones and analyzes the characteristic parameter of capillary pressure curves.

Following to previous study {{by one of}} the authors who shows that radius ratio of 4 gives the highest <b>limit</b> <b>pressure,</b> the study was extended to determine the position of non-radial cylindrical nozzle that gives the highest <b>limit</b> <b>pressure.</b> Toroidal tank having the same volume as PERTAMINA LPG 3 kg of 7. 3 liter and radius ratio of 4 were used in this study. Cylindrical nozzle of 12. 5 mm diameter and 10 mm height was attached perpendicular to plane of the toroid. The position of nozzle was made various along a major radius of the torus, from intrados to intrados. The position of nozzle was varied every 5 mm, from 115 mm to 210 mm. The maximum applied internal pressure was 1. 5 times pressure to yield. Limits pressure were obtained via nonlinear finite element analysis using the well-known Newton-Raphson algorithm with large deformation. It was found that the best design for nozzle position, indicated by the highest <b>limit</b> <b>pressure,</b> is located between crown and extrados and close to extrados.
