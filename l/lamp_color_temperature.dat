With concentration we can achieve the maximum and faster result in our work. Some ways to improve concentration that being researched here is by arranging the wall color and the <b>lamp</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of the room. The color used as wall color in this research was the blue 9. 8 B, 7. 4 / 5. 6; and the orange 8. 1 YR, 8. 7 / 3. 7 of the Munsell color palette. Whereas the room lighting was the fluorescent lamp in 6500 K (cool daylight) and 2700 K (warm white) color temperature. Respondents of this research were 117 undergraduate students, the average GPA was 3. 28; and 20, 26 years as the mean age. The concentration and cognition tests are the Army Alfa test and IST subtest 9 that conducted in the room with different condition.

The measurement results obtained for the LED tubes have been compared to those of similar measurements obtained for fluorescent lamps. The analysis has been focused on the range of wavelengths 300 – 700 nm, the blue light range, which turned out to be defining for the risk groups of the lamps.

For imaging the paint cross-sections in visible light, Bright Field (BF) and Dark Field (DF) mode, and Ultraviolet radiation (UV 365  nm), the light microscope Zeiss AXIO Imager.A 2 m (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, United States) was used. Images were recorded with an Axio Cam MRc 5 mounted camera, producing 5 megapixels 12 -bit images. White light was provided by a LED <b>lamp</b> with a <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of 5600 Kelvin and a colibri. 2 controller for UV-fluorescence microscopy (LED 365  nm). All images were obtained and processed in the image-acquisition software Zen 2 pro (blue edition) with extended depth of focus (MEDF) facilities and observed on a calibrated Eizo Color Edge CG 277 BK computer screen. All microscopic images were color calibrated with the Rijksmuseum CZI conversion utility tool, created by Robert Erdmann. Scanning electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM–EDX) studies were performed on a JEOL JSM 5910 LV scanning electron microscope with Noran Vantage EDX system (spot analysis and elemental mapping facilities) at the Cultural Heritage Agency (RCE) in Amsterdam. For the analysis of high-resolution SE and BSE images in high vacuum, samples were gold-coated in a JEOL JFC 1200 fine coater prior to analysis to improve surface conductivity. EDX spot analysis of the pigment particles was done at 20  kV acceleration voltage, 5 – 10  mm eucentric working distance in high vacuum.|$|R
2500|$|Black-body {{radiators}} are {{the reference}} {{by which the}} whiteness of light sources is judged.
