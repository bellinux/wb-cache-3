40|$|Two {{decades after}} their rapid rise to prominence, {{the place of}} <b>livelihoods</b> {{approaches}} in contemporary development conversations and programming is unclear.

However, the recent refocusing of development and climate change discourses around the concepts of resilience and vulnerability has revived demand for methods with the holism of <b>livelihoods</b> approaches. If <b>livelihoods</b> approaches are to fill this need, they must evolve. Such an evolution requires a theory of <b>livelihoods</b> decision-making that supports an explicit framework for understanding <b>livelihoods</b> decisions.
