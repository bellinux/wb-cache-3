40|$|What is {{the future}} of <b>law</b> <b>reviews?</b> And does it matter? These are {{important}} questions, at least to legal academics and the students who run them. Whether the world would be any worse off if <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> ceased to exist or, more realistically, if the number of <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> was significantly reduced is moot at best. In this regard, the central challenge to <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> is provided by the Internet. Its capacity to revolutionize the rarefied culture of <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> and legal scholarship is profound and presents opportunities and threats that many have only begun to imagine or realize. Nevertheless, assuming that <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> are likely to be around in considerable numbers for the next little while whether in electronic form or not (and I leave this issue to others more familiar with the technological media) I want to concern myself with the substance of what <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> publish. In particular, I want to explore briefly the relationship between adjudication and legal theory as mediated and nurtured by <b>law</b> <b>reviews.</b> However, in the short space available, I will concentrate on only one, but a seriously important, dimension of this relationship - I will propose the kind of substantive content which <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> should not be including and the kind of audience to which <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> should not be catering. So that there is no mistaking my stance, I maintain that <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> do a disservice to themselves and the idea of legal scholarship generally when they pander to those judges and academics who insist that the adjudicative function {{is at the heart of}} the legal enterprise and is the raison d 2 ̆ 7 etre of legal scholarship...|$|R

5|$|Obama entered Harvard Law School in {{the fall}} of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts. He was {{selected}} as an editor of the Harvard <b>Law</b> <b>Review</b> {{at the end of his}} first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years. During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990. After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard <b>Law</b> <b>Review</b> gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.|$|E
5|$|After 1952, Willamette Law {{received}} a large Lady Justice statue when the Marion County Courthouse was demolished {{to make way}} for a new one. In 1959, the school started a <b>law</b> <b>review,</b> while enrollment increased to 185 by the mid-1960s. Because of the increased enrollment, the College of Law Foundation was created by the university's trustees in 1959 to explore the construction of a new facility. Willamette switched to the awarding of the Juris Doctor from the bachelor of laws, phased in beginning in 1965.|$|E
5000|$|In Brazil, <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> {{are usually}} run by {{academics}} as well, {{but there are}} efforts by students to change this; for example: University of Brasilia <b>Law</b> Students <b>Review</b> (re-established in 2007), the Review of the Academic Center Afonso Pena from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (published since 1996), and the Alethes Periodic from Federal University of Juiz de Fora. However, academics and official rankings usually refuse to evaluate student <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> as [...] "equals". To pursue academic recognition by the Brazilian Ministry of Education, review bodies must include post-graduated and ranked academics, which prevents student <b>law</b> <b>reviews</b> to even be recognized or compared to other similar legal periodicals.|$|R

5|$|Hand's {{three years}} at Harvard Law School were intellectually and {{socially}} stimulating.
