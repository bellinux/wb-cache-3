5|$|Rand's work on The Fountainhead was {{repeatedly}} interrupted. In 1937, {{she took a}} break from it to write a novella called Anthem. She also completed a stage adaptation of We the <b>Living</b> <b>that</b> ran briefly in 1940. That same year, she became active in politics. She first worked as a volunteer in Wendell Willkie's presidential campaign, and then attempted to form a group for conservative intellectuals. As her royalties from earlier projects ran out, she began doing freelance work as a script reader for movie studios. When Rand finally found a publisher, the novel was only one-third complete.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to western}} popular perception, the Kama Sutra is not {{exclusively}} a sex manual; it presents {{itself as a}} guide to a virtuous and gracious <b>living</b> <b>that</b> discusses the nature of love, family life, and other aspects pertaining to pleasure-oriented faculties of human life. The Kama Sutra, in parts of the world, is presumed or depicted as a synonym for creative sexual positions; in reality, only 20% of the Kama Sutra is about sexual positions. The majority of the book, notes Jacob Levy, is about the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, and how and when it is good or bad.|$|E
25|$|All of Alger's novels {{have similar}} plots: a boy struggles to escape poverty through {{hard work and}} clean living. However, {{it is not always}} the hard work and clean <b>living</b> <b>that</b> rescue the boy from his situation, but rather a wealthy older gentleman, who admires the boy as a result of some {{extraordinary}} act of bravery or honesty that the boy has performed. For example, the boy rescues a child from an overturned carriage or finds and returns the man's stolen watch. Often the older man takes the boy into his home as a ward or companion and helps him find a better job, sometimes replacing a less honest or less industrious boy.|$|E
25|$|By 1636, Lord Boyle had {{opted to}} live in the West country to see out the rest of his days. He {{purchased}} from James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven, for £5,000, the manor of Stalbridge in Dorset which became his English seat, and in 1637, he laid out a further £20,000 for Temple Coombe Manor, close by in Somerset. Boyle, at the insistence of the Howards, also bought Annery House near Bideford in 1640 for £5000. The Earl was most delighted with Annery House and the <b>living</b> <b>that</b> came with the estate; he was also delighted that he could easily travel to Youghal from Bideford. Annery House was left to his sixth son Francis Boyle upon his death in 1643. Boyle had also been left the manor of Salcombe in Devon by his friend Thomas Stafford, the illegitimate son of George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes. Salcombe, along with Halberton Manor, was also left to his son Francis and his wife Elizabeth Killigrew.|$|E

In A Countryman's Creed (1946) he harked back to a lost world, perhaps even a world that was more of his imagination than it ever was fact. As F. R. Leavis had done before him, Beach Thomas sought a rural revival to curtail what he perceived to be the rapid changes to traditional modes of <b>living</b> <b>that</b> had been evident in particular {{in the aftermath of the}} First World War and which were now ideologically challenged following the substantial victory of the socialist Labour Party in the 1945 general election.

500|$|Anthony Julius, a British {{lawyer who}} is one of Eliot's most trenchant critics on this issue, writes that [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] is [...] "exceptional in a poetry in which {{elsewhere}} Jews are dumb. The voice, however is a disciplined one and speaks lines prepared for it... The song is for, not of Simeon. Eliot gives the Jew lines that locate him, and by implication all Jews, wholly within the Christian drama. Incapable of denying its truth, but equally incapable of <b>living</b> <b>that</b> truth." [...] He accuses Eliot of animating [...] "the topoi of the Jew acknowledging his obsolescence"—essentially employing a tired characterisation of a Jewish figure as a voice attesting that Jews have no role in the Christian future. [...] Julius compares Simeon to Moses stating that he is [...] "fated to see the Promised Land but not to enter it ... witness to its truth, but denied its redemptive power, the Jew stands solemnly, humbly, outside Christianity's gates". Further, Julius draws on a quote from Eliot's earlier poem [...] "Gerontion" [...] to say that in this Christian future the Jews [...] "may find a ledge there to squat on".|$|E

Executive producer Paul Tibbitt said [...] " [...] wanted to do a show about extreme sports and the first thing that came to mind was Johnny Knoxville, because there are few humans <b>living</b> <b>that</b> are as extreme as him." [...] Knoxville accepted the role because he is a fan of the show. Knoxville said [...] "I got a lot of street cred in the office for doing SpongeBob.

[...] Knoxville asked if he needed {{to come up with a}} funny voice for his character.

[...] The song features groaning club beats, psychedelic guitar noodling, crunchy synth leads, a funked-up beat, and [...] "Ocean's distinctive croon and lots of vague new-R angst". The opening segment sports the [...] "beautiful, warped R that Ocean has become known for", but from there the song transitions into a smattering of electro-house synths, Michael Jackson-influenced pop melodies, spaced out electronic segues, UK bass breaks, saxophone, and guitar solo courtesy of John Mayer."

[...] It serves as [...] "another case where the production far outstrips the vocal work", with [...] "clanging and chiming and choirs for the intro," [...] a dance break toward the middle that sounds like it was [...] "recorded in 2018", and a slow jam for the second half that closes the song.|$|E
