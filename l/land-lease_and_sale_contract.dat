We consider the prospect of long-term antiquity leases <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> <b>contracts</b> with a pre-arranged repurchase option. Such mechanisms could raise revenue for the country of origin, while preserving long-term national ownership rights. We show that leases, which leave the country of origin in charge of future recontracting, are optimal mechanisms for resolving adverse selection, {{and that they have}} good properties for addressing corruption. Option contracts deliver more revenue now and are therefore useful for reducing credit constraints. Allowing those who disclose the existence of antiquities the right to lease objects overseas for a xed period could create incentives to reveal the location of hidden objects.

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} the Chinese laws, judicial interpretations, scholarly views and government policies relating to contractual formality for land <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> in their historical and modern settings. The thesis also employs a comparative methodology to critically evaluate the Statute of Frauds literature in some selected Common Law jurisdictions {{such as the}} United States, Australia and England. This investigation includes English legal history, {{the development of the}} Statute of Frauds legislation, associated scholarly views and judicial interpretations. These positions and arguments are compared and contrasted with their counterpart in mainland China and other Civil Law jurisdictions such as Germany and Taiwan, including Chinese legal history, the principle of freedom of contract and the Chinese version of Healing Theory. The most important original contribution is the examination and integration of the functions of formality (particularly writing) in both Sino-Civilian (mainland China, Germany and Taiwan) and Anglo-American literature which forms the theoretical framework of the thesis. Formality is also examined against the theory of freedom of contract in mainland China. Additionally, the thesis compares and contrasts the contractual consequences where the statutory writing obligation is not observed, as well as the legal techniques to address oral land <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> across the selected Common Law and Civil Law jurisdictions. Arising out of this, the thesis proposes a legal reform measure for mainland China and argues for a clear requirement of writing for real property <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> in modern mainland China. The reform recommendation also includes contractual consequence for lack of writing and the legal techniques to address the informal <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>contracts.</b> This reform has legal, political, economic and social significance. The reform increases legal certainty and clarity in land <b>sale</b> <b>contracts,</b> {{one of the most important}} dealings in Chinese society, and could be integrated into China’s unified Civil Code in the making. The reform also addresses some of the essential issues outlined by the Central Committee of Communist Party of China. Furthermore, the reform underpins the issues relating to the real property industry which constitutes a significant portion of the Chinese national economy...|$|R

40|$|Power {{purchase}} <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> in Brazil, {{have been}} receiving {{attention in the}} last few years due to the high volatility of electricity spot price (PLD) and the regulatory constraints to operate in the brazilian electricity market. In this scenario, even when contract content is clearly understood by the parties, uncertainties are commonly not well measured and flexibilities are not correctly priced. One reason is the limitation of traditional financial techniques for pricing contracts which often did not adequately take into account some important features, mispricing embedded flexibilities. These flexibilities can be seen as options by the purchasers, in the way to choose the amount of energy to be supplied (amount option) or to reduce the amount or even to interrupt the supply during a predetermined interval (reduction option). In this working progress paper, we present what is intended to investigate in the final study about valuing these flexibilities in bilateral contracts in the Brazilian electricity market, using real options approach. These flexibilities are modeled as compound European call and put options, under uncertainties of monthly energy price and energy demand. In the paper, we also intend to discuss new perspectives for independent stochastic variables modeling to value options embedded in bilateral contracts...|$|R
