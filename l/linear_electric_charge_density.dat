40|$|A wide {{class of}} exact {{solutions}} is {{obtained for the}} problem of finding the equilibrium configurations of charged jets of a conducting liquid; these configurations correspond to the finite-amplitude azimuthal deformations of {{the surface of a}} round jet. A critical value of the <b>linear</b> <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> is determined, for which the jet surface becomes self-intersecting, and the jet splits into two. It exceeds the density value required for the excitation of the linear azimuthal instability of the round jet. Hence, there exists a range of linear charge density values, where our solutions may be stable with respect to small azimuthal perturbations...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{traversable}} wormhole can exist in General Relativity only if its throat contains some exotic matter. In this paper, we obtain $(2 + 1) $-dimensional (horizonless) charged magnetic brane without (curvature) singularity. Then, we consider a nontrivial local transformation to grant a global rotation to spacetime. After that, we generalize magnetic brane to higher dimensional solutions and use the cut-and-paste method to construct higher dimensional charged BTZ-like rotating wormholes {{such a way that}} they reduce to charged magnetic BTZ solution in three dimensions, exactly. We also show that charged BTZ-like wormhole supported by the exotic matter at its throat $r=r_{+}$. Finally, we calculate the conserved quantities of the charged BTZ-like wormhole such as mass, angular momentum and <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density,</b> and show that the <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> depends on the rotation parameters, interestingly, and the static wormhole does not have a net <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density.</b> Comment: 13 pages with one eps figur...|$|R

40|$|The {{elementary}} {{electron-positron pair}} formation process is considered {{in terms of}} a revised quantum electrodynamic theory, with special attention to the conservation of energy, spin, and <b>electric</b> <b>charge.</b> The theory leads to a wave-packet photon model of narrow line width and needle-radiation properties, not being available from conven-tional quantum electrodynamics which is based on Maxwell’s equations. The model appears to be consistent with the observed pair production process, in which the cre-ated electron and positron form two rays that start within a very small region and have original directions along the path of the incoming photon. Conservation of angular mo-mentum requires the photon to possess a spin, as given by the present theory but not by the conventional one. The nonzero electric field divergence further gives rise to a local intrinsic <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> within the photon body, whereas there is a vanishing total charge of the latter. This may explain the observed fact that the photon decays on account of the impact from an external electric field. Such a behaviour should not become possible for a photon having zero local <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density.</b> ...|$|R
