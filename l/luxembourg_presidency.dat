After verbal conflict over several weeks, Blair, along with the leaders of all 25 member states, descended on Brussels for the EU Summit of 18 June 2005 to attempt to finalise the EU budget for 2007-13. Blair refused to renegotiate the rebate unless the proposals included a compensating overhaul of EU spending, particularly on the Common Agricultural Policy which composes 44% of the EU budget. The CAP stayed as it was agreed upon in 2002 and no decision about the budget was reached under the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E

In this capacity, {{she played a}} dramatic role during the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, in the first semester of 2000. The Portuguese Presidency notably succeeded in securing a compromise on the so-called Lisbon Strategy, a comprehensive plan that was aimed at boosting growth and employment level in the EU. The strategy was adopted at an extraordinary European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, a meeting in which Maria João Rodrigues acted as a sherpa for the Prime Minister. She notably contributed to build a compromise between the delegations of the British and French governments, by resorting to the open method of coordination.Maria João Rodrigues continued to monitor closely the developments of the Lisbon Strategy, in particular as Special Advisor to the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the European Union for the Mid-term Review of the Lisbon Strategy (2005) and special advisor to the European Commission and Jean-Claude Juncker on the Lisbon strategy.|$|E

The resulting and growing mobility and cross-border collaboration necessity leads to specific challenges for e-Government applications. This article {{presents the results of}} a study run by <b>Luxembourg’s</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the EU {{during the first half of}} 2005. This study investigated one central aspect in this area: How do countries identify their citizens and businesses, and what are their national provisions regarding data protection and privacy that limit and regulate the sharing of such data? In more technical terms: What is the impact of identity management and related privacy issues on the interoperability of e-Government systems? The status quo in 18 member states is illustrated, and compared with the results of a similar study run in 2001.

Shortly after, in 2004, the first experimental student exchanges took place and a new Secretariat was put in place. Also in 2004 the Campus Europae Student Council (now Club d’Europe) was created, consisting of student representatives from each member universities. It has since played an integral role in the Campus Europae network.In 2005, Campus Europae started developing the concept of studying and working abroad and also organized an International Conference about the Social Dimension of the Bologna Process, under the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the European Union. The following year Campus Europae and the European Investment Bank started investigating the possibility of establishing a pan-European loan system for student mobility and in 2007 the former EU Commissioner Ján Figeľ labeled Campus Europae as “Erasmus +”, during a conference [...] at the European Parliament.

40|$|Healthcare {{has been}} {{relatively}} slow in comparison to other industries to recognize itself as a high risk activity. Recent estimates suggest that 1 in 10 patients admitted to hospital experience some form of unintended harm. In both human and economic terms, the need to reduce these unacceptable levels of harm is impossible to ignore. Patient safety is a serious concern for many EU Member States. This has been given impetus by both the UK and <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Presidencies</b> of the European Union, {{both of which have}} made patient safety a headline health priority theme. The overriding aims of patient safety activity during the UK Presidency have been to ensure that: • patient safety becomes a key priority on the European health agenda, both at EU level and in individual Member States there are concrete mechanisms and practical programmes of activity established at the EU level to take forward patient safety issues • Activity at the European level also aims to build upon the programme established by the World Health Organization through the World Alliance for Patient Safety and the work of other key partners. Much remains to be done to achieve safer care for patients across Europe. Action at the European level has a vital role to play in ensuring that safe care is a core part of health system improvements in all countries. Safe care can never be an optional extra; it is the right of every patient who entrusts their care to our health care systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{official}} document {{adopted by the}} Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing 1995 is called the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action for Equality, Development and Peace (PfA). The PfA is an agenda for women’s empowerment that reaffirms the fundamental principle whereby {{the human rights of}} women and the girl child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. As an agenda for action, the platform seeks to promote and protect the full enjoyment of all human rights and the fundamental freedoms of all women throughout their life cycle. The report Beijing + 15 : The Platform for Action and the European Union is the third review of development at the EU-level in relation to the 12 critical areas of concern of the PfA, building on the follow-up by the EU in 2000 and on the report from the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Presidency</b> in 2005.

40|$|The {{first of}} May 2004 marked an {{important}} {{date in the}} history of Europe as a political, geographic, and social entity. After years of negotiations, ten European countries joined the European Union, bringing in their potential and expectations, adding a total population of 75 million people and a territory of 738, 000 square kilometres: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Malta, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The EU will continue its enlargement under the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Presidency.</b> The membership treaty with Bulgaria and Romania will be finalised with a view to signature in 25 April 2005, in order to join the EU by 2007. Once it has been signed, this will mark the end of the current accession cycle. Membership negotiations with Croatia should commence on 17 March 2005. In mid-December 2004 EU leaders endorsed eventual Turkish entry into the EU, but said that there could be permanent restrictions on freedom of movement for Turkish workers; earlier, the EU Parliament voted 407 - 262 in favour of Turkey's entry. Romania feels and acts like a European country. You will rather notice a European flag in Bucharest than in London, for example. Romania is not only a country who makes effort to join the European family, by introducing the necessary legal provisions in the national legislation, but it is already part of one, whole Europe, ruled by law, an area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Romania fights against immigration flows targeting Western Countries and guards the external border of European Union. In the same time, Romanians are spread all over Europe, living there alike other Europeans. Until the European Union Member States will decide that Romania truly deserves to join the family, Romanians have to prove that they do not only feel and act as Europeans, but they truly are Europeans...|$|E
40|$|Top of {{the agenda}} at the European Union (EU) summit on 15 / 16 December 2005 is the budget for 2007 - 13. The {{original}} proposal from the European Commission was for a budget of one trillion euros or 1. 21 % of EU gross national income (GNI). The proposal {{at the end of}} the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>presidency,</b> rejected at the summit in June 2005, was for 871 billion euros (1. 06 % of EU GNI). Six months, and much discussion later, the UK’s proposal is for 847 billion euros (1. 03 % of EU GNI). • Any changes to the overall size and composition of the budget as a result of the summit are likely to be marginal. The current UK proposal includes cuts in development aid to new member states, cuts in rural aid to old member states, a major review of all spending in 2008 and a small reduction in the UK’s rebate. • Of the current EU budget, approximately 45 % goes on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), 35 % on structural funds (the EU’s supra-national regional policy) and 7 % each on aid, administration and a diverse range of other policies. • The CAP has several negative effects. These include artificially inflating food prices in the EU, which is bad for consumers, particularly poorer ones; driving down the world price of food, which is bad for countries that produce food, many of which are poor and middle-income countries; and encouraging overproduction and specialisation by farmers, both of which may be bad for the environment. • Major reform of the CAP would use the principle of subsidiarity to repatriate the CAP to national level where it clearly belongs. • There are two main problems with the EU’s structural funds. First, the allocation of expenditure is highly political and as a result not well targeted on the poorest regions in the poorest countries. Second, the expenditure itself has not been very effective: no Objective 1 region (those targeted by the funds) has moved out of the category...|$|E

40|$|The Standing Committee of European Doctors (CPME) {{has been}} {{actively}} promoting patient safety {{for a long}} time, well before the issue was given a firm place on the European and international agendas. Among its efforts to help raise the profile of patient safety, CPME organised a conference on the 4 th and 5 th April 2005 together {{with a group of}} EU health stakeholders that covered the whole spectrum of healthcare delivery. The European Conference ‘Patient Safety – Making it happen!’ took place in Luxembourg {{under the auspices of the}} <b>Luxembourg</b> EU <b>presidency</b> and EU Commissioner Kyprianou and resulted in the “Luxembourg Declaration on Patient Safety”. This Declaration contains recommendations to the EU, national authorities and healthcare organizations. It underlines the added value of the EU and recommends joining forces with the WHO Alliance for Patient Safety. A culture of transparency, trust and safety is being sought for through the suggested use of e-health, flows of health information, patient involvement and reporting systems. CPME saw perseverance and commitment pay off as patient safety is now seen as a priority by all health stakeholders and EU institutional bodies (European Commission, presidencies and Council). However all parties realise full well that the Luxembourg Declaration on Patient Safety is only the first step. All efforts are now focussed on follow up and implementation...|$|R
40|$|Migration {{has always}} played an {{important}} role in Luxembourg’s history. In 2014 and 2015, due to the refugee crisis, migration became the focus of the economic, social and political debates, in particular during <b>Luxembourg’s</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the Council of the European Union. As a country that is a founding Member of the European Union and located at the centre of the EU, Luxembourg has a strong attraction for EU citizens and this - in turn - has a direct incidence on the demographic composition of the country and the workforce. Luxembourg’s demographic composition reflects its migratory diversity. In 2014, the net migration balance was positive having increased by 6. 8 % in comparison to 2013. As such, the country’s rising population numbers were mainly attributed to the immigration of individuals coming from EU Member States and other European countries. These numbers include European Union (EU), European economic area (EEA) citizens and third-country nationals from non-EU European countries. The country’s diversity is equally reflected in its labour market which heavily relies on its foreign workforce. In fact, Luxembourgish citizens represented 31 % of the workforce in 2014, while EU citizens reached 65 % and third-country nationals only 4 %. Cross border workers also represented a very important part of the Luxembourgish workforce with 44. 4 %. Due to the refugee crisis, the number of international protection applicants increased between 2013 and 2014. As a consequence, the recognition rate of the status increased as well. On the other hand, the number of returns continued to decrease. In order to respond to the crisis in an adequate manner, additional funds and staff for the Directorate of Immigration and the Luxembourg Reception and Integration Agency were allocated. Given the magnitude of the migration crisis and the pressure on external border Member States, the EU Council took the decision to relocate 160. 000 international protection applicants (European relocation scheme) who are currently in Greece and in Italy. In order to implement this decision, Luxembourg agreed to welcome 527 international protection applicants. The first group of 30 relocated individuals from Greece arrived in Luxembourg on 4 November 2015. During 2014, Luxembourg implemented several EU directives. Directive 2011 / 36 /EU of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings was implemented by the Law of 9 April 2014, which reinforced the rights of victims of trafficking in human beings by criminalising begging and the trafficking of children. Extensive work was undertaken to transpose Directives 2012 / 32 /EU and 2012 / 33 /EU of the Common European Asylum System. Two draft bills are currently within the last stages of the legislative procedure and their implementation is set to take place in 2015, after several amendments were brought to the draft bills at the end of September and October 2015. On the national level, recent legislative changes and reforms answer to several aims, ranging from attracting certain categories of migrants to strengthening the support provided to unaccompanied minors. The creation of a new authorisation of stay for investors and the modification of certain authorisations of stay to adapt them for business managers are currently under discussion by an inter-ministerial working group, which is preparing two draft bills on these issues...|$|R
