Spectrum of definitive hosts is very wide, includes ruminants, non-rumi-nants, and occasionally humans. Anthelmintic con-trol of animal dicrocoeliosis is in respect to location of fluke adults in definitive hosts (thin bile ducts) difficult, several benzimidazoles (albendazole, fenbedazole, <b>luxabendazole,</b> mebendazole, thia-bendazole, cambendazole) or probenzimidazoles (netobimin, thiofanat), praziquantel, closantel, oxy-closanid and diamphenetid were verified. Part of free living animal species (cervids, wild boar, etc.) including mouflon (Ovis musimon) is at present considered in European conditions as game and farm species,. It is generally accepted, that para-sitically positive herds of mentioned species are treatable by administration of anthelmintics mixed with feed without any direct contact with humans. In such conditions, anthelmintics are dosed per kg of body weight in lower doses but administered in longer time schemes (Cordero Del Campillo et al., 1982; Dzakula et al., 1984; Kassai and Fok, 1985). An important exception is immobilized infected animal which is prepared for future breeding in new localities. In such cases, we can use contac...|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} {{link between}} the level of glutathione S-transferase (GST, E. C. 2. 5. 1. 18) activity {{and the development of}} salicylanilide resistance in Fasciola hepatica was investigated. Various isolates of F. hepatica with varying susceptibilities to salicylanilides were isolated and maintained in the laboratory. Individual flukes of these isolates were surveyed for their level of GST activity and a correlation between the level of GST activity and drug efficacy was found. In contrast to most other studies, a decrease in GST activity was associated with an increase in drug resistance. Evidence was collected to show that this may be a selective process since flukes which had survived exposure to rafoxanide and closantel in vivo (in sheep) had lower activity levels of GST than flukes from untreated sheep. Treatment with other flukicides (oxyclozanide, <b>luxabendazole</b> and triclabendazole) did not have this effect. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with closantel induced selection of particular isoenzymes in different isolates of F. hepatica having different degrees of susceptibility to closantel. However, no single isoenzyme or isoenzyme profile was associated with resistance and, in total, up to 8 different isoenzymes could be present in a single isolate. Thus, GST has some potential as a marker enzyme for salicylanilide resistance in F. hepatica. However, the precise role of GST in resistance is unclear and the extensive inter- and intra-isolate variation in activity levels and isoenzyme characteristics of this enzyme indicate the need for considerably more study before application in field situations...|$|E
