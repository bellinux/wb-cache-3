5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek {{a crack in the}} soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the <b>legs</b> <b>out</b> of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E
25|$|At {{a special}} {{convention}} of the AA on June 13, Green convinced the AA to call the strike off. The Rank and File Movement's inadequate organization, the obstructionist policies of the Amalgamated's national leadership, strong opposition from the steel industry {{and the promise of}} enhanced governmental protection cut the <b>legs</b> <b>out</b> from the nascent organizing drive.

500|$|Since convincing walking {{movements}} {{had always}} been difficult to accomplish with the unevenly weighted Supermarionation puppets, the common practice at AP Films Studios was to allow walking to be implied, rather than seen, by having {{the hand of a}} puppeteer move a marionette's legs using a [...] "bobbing motion". The scene in which Lady Penelope sings Brains' lyrical version of [...] "Dangerous Game" [...] required the puppet to waltz through the Paradise Peaks ballroom set, necessitating that Brown move the character's <b>legs</b> <b>out</b> of shot while fellow operator Christine Glanville controlled the upper body from the overhead gantry.|$|E

He was particularly pleased with the ending, noting that [...] "I love that goose-bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising. In that episode you're talking about, there is that rising action toward the end, and then LSP [...] cuts in and says 'drama bomb!' {{in the middle of it}} to sort of, like, cut its <b>legs</b> <b>out.</b> Which I think is a lot of fun." [...] The episode was later nominated for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-format Animated Program, although it did not win.|$|E
500|$|On February 12, with {{insufficient}} cash {{to pay his}} overdue {{rent and}} a growing suspicion that police were closing in on him, Bundy stole a car and fled Tallahassee, driving westward across the Florida Panhandle. Three days later, at around 1:00a.m., he was stopped by Pensacola police officer David Lee near the Alabama state line after a [...] "wants and warrants" [...] check showed his Volkswagen Beetle was stolen. When told he was under arrest, Bundy kicked Lee's <b>legs</b> <b>out</b> from under him and took off running. Lee fired a warning shot followed by a second round, gave chase and tackled him. The two struggled over Lee's gun before the officer finally subdued and arrested Bundy. In the stolen vehicle were three sets of IDs belonging to female FSU students, 21 stolen credit cards and a stolen television set. Also found were a pair of dark-rimmed non-prescription glasses {{and a pair of}} plaid slacks, later identified as the disguise worn by [...] "Richard Burton, Fire Department" [...] in Jacksonville.

500|$|The Daily Star quoted Rowland on {{the theme}} of the song. She said [...] "I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge.

She's stretching her <b>legs</b> <b>out</b> and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming out on my own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E

2500|$|After {{the conference}} Bolikango helped to mediate {{negotiations}} between Adoula and secessionist figure Moïse Tshombe, {{leader of the}} breakaway State of Katanga. Bolikango claimed that he alone could resolve the situation by sitting [...] "Bantu fashion with <b>legs</b> <b>out</b> stretched" [...] around a table with Tshombe. On 13 February 1962 he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister. On 12 July Adoula downsized his government and dismissed Bolikango from his post. In 1963 following the defeat of Katanga, Bolikango managed to organise a parliamentary opposition coalition to Adoula's government, consisting of ABAKO, leftist followers of Lumumba (by then killed) and Antoine Gizenga, and Tshombe's Confédération des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT). He also foiled an attempt by one of Adoula's ministers to establish a pro-government party in Équateur. In the 1965 elections he was reelected to a second term in the Chamber of Deputies on a PUNA–Convention Nationale Congolaise (CONACO) ticket.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{season was}} a {{disaster}} on the field, as well. After starting 3–1, the Browns lost three straight. [...] They split the next two games, but {{the announcement of the}} move to Baltimore cut the <b>legs</b> <b>out</b> from under the team. [...] They finished 5–11, including a 1–6 record in the seven games after the announcement. Fans in the Dawg Pound became so unruly during their final home game against the Bengals that all offensive plays had to be run from {{the opposite end of the}} field. Rows of empty seats were torn from the stadium and thrown on the field. Stalls and sinks in the restrooms were torn from the walls. Several fans set fires in the stands, especially in the [...] "Dawg Pound" [...] section, and assaulted security officials and police officers who tried to quench the growing fires. The Browns won their final home game. Belichick was fired by Modell by telephone in February 1996, exactly one week after the switch to Baltimore was made official. The new team became the Baltimore Ravens.|$|E

2500|$|Das Racist's unique {{style has}} a strong {{polarizing}} tendency; their set at the 2009 Pop Montreal festival was described as [...] "the most divisive show seen at the festival". They describe their approach to music as [...] "'deconstructionalist': sawing the <b>legs</b> <b>out</b> from under hip-hop as they celebrate it". New York Times wrote [...] "Das Racist’s lack of piety has become an aesthetic of its own, with songs that are as much commentary on hip-hop as rigorous practice of it". The Root said DasRacist could speak for both [...] "the ‘hood or the nearest gated community". Playboy called the duo [...] "equal parts hip-hop and Cheech & Chong". In an interview with Sepia Mutiny, Suri described Das Racist's music:we’re not making music that’s instantly appealing. We dabble with non sequiturs, dadaism, repetition, repetition. We make dance music while talking about not-dancey things. We say things that on the surface can seem pretty dumb but it’s a mask on some Paul Laurence Dunbar shit for actual discontent {{with a lot of}} shit in the world.

2500|$|NOM {{was first}} formed {{to support the}} passage of California Proposition 8 in 2008, which amended the state Constitution to {{discontinue}} same-sex marriage ceremonies. The amendment defined marriage as the union between one man and one woman. NOM contributed $1.8million to the Proposition 8 effort, and {{has been described as}} being [...] "instrumental" [...] in the success of the initiative. Proposition 8 was passed by voters 52% to 48%, and involved an estimated $83M by both sides of the issue. The amendment was in force until United States district court Judge Vaughn R. Walker overturned it in August 2010, in the case Perry v. Schwarzenegger, ruling that it violated both the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the United States Constitution. NOM chairman Maggie Gallagher expressed her disagreement with the ruling, targeting Walker's sexuality and accusing him of [...] "substituting his views for those of the American people and of our Founding Fathers." [...] NOM President, Brian Snow, also expressed dissatisfaction with the ruling, stating [...] "With a stroke of his pen, Judge Walker has overruled the votes and values of 7 million Californians" [...] Walker did however place a temporary injunction on same-sex marriages to allow the defendants to bring their case before the United States Supreme Court. On June 26, 2013 the United States Supreme Court ruled the defendants in the case lacked standing to appeal earlier rulings in Federal Court. As a consequence, Walker's opinion striking down the law as unconstitutional stands as the final decision in the case. NOM addressed the Supreme Court's ruling on its website, asking the nation [...] "show its displeasure" [...] with the ruling, adding that [...] "the Supreme Court ripped the <b>legs</b> <b>out</b> from under the institution of marriage." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reason for}} Frazier's sudden removal {{from the top}} of the card was never explained, but Kevin Nash (Diesel) implied it had {{something}} to do with his wrestling style. Nash said in an interview with Kayfabe Commentaries that Frazier's style was very reckless and he had little regard for the safety of his fellow wrestlers. Nash said that entering the match at SummerSlam, Frazier had already injured [...] "six or eight" [...] of his colleagues in the ring. Nash said that one of the injuries was to one of the Samoans on the roster (Fatu), which he implied was not easy to do and should have raised a red flag. Nash pointed to Frazier's use of a frequently utilized move by wrestlers of comparable size, the sitdown splash. Most wrestlers who perform this move, such as the aforementioned Fatu (who adopted the move later in his career) and Earthquake, do so without incident as they perform it in such a manner that very little of their body weight actually comes in contact with the opponent's body. Frazier, as described by Nash, would kick his <b>legs</b> <b>out</b> while performing the move and thus did not allow himself to stop before impact, which caused all of Frazier's 500-plus pound body weight to shift to his rear end and land on the opponent. Further, Frazier did not perform the maneuver on an opponent's chest like usual, instead using the move on the lower back of his opponents. With this in mind Nash told Frazier to leave the move out of the match. Frazier disregarded the request and performed the sitdown splash on Nash's lower back anyway, which caused his spine to compress and his core muscles to stretch out and left Nash with a badly strained abdomen that affected his performance the rest of the match, along with the feeling that he had suffered some sort of permanent damage to his spine. Backstage, Nash recounted that a furious Vince McMahon was ready to fire Frazier immediately after the match and was about to hand him his release papers, but Nash stepped in and convinced McMahon otherwise as he did not feel Frazier should lose his job over the incident. However, it is worth mentioning that no other wrestlers when asked about Frazier have agreed with this sentiment.|$|E
