And the main commercial crop is sugarcane. Athani {{is one of the largest}} sugarcane cultivation taluks in Karnataka. 70% of the land is fertile. Sugarcane is cultivated near river Krishna and river Agrani. It is cultivated more than 1,50,000 acres in taluk.Irrigation facilities of Hipparagi barrage of Upper Krishna Projectis in athani. By this project canals were constructed. It is very helpful for cultivation of sugarcane and grapes. The Hipparagi project is useful to farmers. Most of farmers cultivate sugarcane and jawar.|$|E
5000|$|In South East Asia, {{the term}} [...] "yong tau foo" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} a dish instead of the stuffed tofu item exclusively. It is {{a variation of the}} above Hakka cuisine as cooked by other dialect groups. The dish can contain a varied selection of food items, including young tau foo, fish balls, crab sticks, bitter melons, cuttlefish, lettuce, <b>ladies</b> <b>fingers,</b> as well as chilis, and various forms of fresh produce, seafood and meats common in Chinese cuisine. Vegetables such as bitter melon and chilis are usually filled with surimi. The foods are then sliced into bite-size pieces, cooked briefly in boiling broth and then served either in the broth as soup or with the broth in a separate bowl. The dish is eaten with chopsticks and a soup spoon and can be eaten by itself or served with a bowl of steamed rice, noodles or rice vermicelli. Another variation of this dish would be to serve it with laksa gravy or curry sauce. Essential accompaniments are a spicy, vinegary chili sauce, originally made with red fermented bean curd and distantly similar in taste to Sriracha sauce, and a distinctive brown sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce for dipping.|$|E

40|$|The area {{cultivated}} {{with vegetable}} crops in the State of Qatar reached, during 1979 and 1980, {{a percentage of}} about 42. 9 % of the total cultivated (or suitable to be cultivated) area. Vegetable crops selected for collecting insect pests from them were nineteen in number. They were : tomato, eggplant, pepper, potato, watermelon, cantaloupe, wild cucumber, squash, cucumber, carrot, onion, cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, radish, lettuce, chorchorus, okra or <b>ladies</b> <b>fingers</b> and spinach. These vegetables were distributed among several districts located in north, middle and south parts of Qatar. Insect pests collected during the two-year period revealed the following : 1. The total collected insect species were 37 species. 2. Ten species of insect pests, each attacked one vegetable crop only. 3. Four species of insect pests, each attacked two crops only. 4. Three insect species, each attacked three vegetable crops only. 5. Five insect species, each attacked four crops only. 6. Six insect species, each attacked from 5. to 7 vegetable crops. 7. Nine insect species, each attacked ten or more — reaching nineteen — vegetable crops.

30|$|In a field study, {{effect of}} vermicompost {{produced}} solely from an allelopathic weed parthenium {{has been investigated}} on germination, growth, yield, and quality of <b>ladies</b> <b>finger</b> (Abelmoschus esculentus). The effect of the vermicompost in inducing resistance in <b>ladies</b> <b>finger</b> against disease was also assessed. In general vermicompost application increased germination success, plant growth, and yield—the positive effect increased in prominence as the extent of vermicompost application was enhanced from 2.5 to 5  t/ha. Parthenium vermicompost also induced beneficial changes in the biochemical and mineral content of the <b>ladies</b> <b>finger.</b> Additionally, ipomoea vermicompost induced resistance in <b>ladies</b> <b>finger</b> towards disease and pest attacks. Overall, contrary to the toxic and allelopathic nature of parthenium, its vermicompost manifests the attributes of highly plant-friendly organic fertilizer that vermicomposts derived from animal manure are known to possess.|$|R
