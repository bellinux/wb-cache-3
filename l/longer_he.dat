Emily's playful innocence is contrasted with Granpa's increasing frailty. Aware that he will not be around for much <b>longer,</b> <b>he</b> shares his memories of adventures and days gone by.|$|E
5|$|In August 1867, the {{commander}} of the Department of Washington wrote to the Chief of Ordnance, asking how much <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> needed Fort Greble as an ordnance depot for materiel removed from dismantled forts. When it could do so, the Ordnance Department removed its property to the Washington Arsenal, now Fort McNair, or transferred it to a still-garrisoned fort, though with post-war budget cuts, these were becoming few and far between.|$|E
5|$|In May 1783, General Matthews {{was accused}} of {{procrastination}} and suspended by the Bombay Government. Thereafter Colonel John Campbell received provisional command of the strategic fort of Mangalore on 5 May 1783. Tipu made several assaults on the Mangalore fort up until January 1784, all of which resulted in failure. Looking at the wounded embattled garrison, Colonel Campbell considered it futile to hold out any <b>longer.</b> <b>He</b> finally delivered the Mangalore fort to Tipu when the British capitulated on 30 January 1784. On 11 March 1784, Tipu and the British East India Company signed the Treaty of Mangalore, thus bringing {{an end to the}} Second Anglo-Mysore War.|$|E

After an experimental treatment of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, Gould made a full recovery, and his column became a source of comfort for many cancer patients.|$|E
5|$|In January 1874, Gladstone {{called a}} general election, {{convinced}} that if he waited <b>longer,</b> <b>he</b> would do worse at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, beginning on 1 February. Disraeli devoted much of his campaign to decrying the Liberal programme {{of the past five}} years. As the constituencies voted, {{it became clear that the}} result would be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen. Overall, they won 350 seats to 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish Home Rule League. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit and Hull's army wounded American morale, and {{eliminated}} the main American {{force in the}} area as a threat, {{while at the same}} time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies at Detroit and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part of the value of the captured military stores would accrue to him. (If he had lived <b>longer,</b> <b>he</b> could have settled his debts.) Brock valued the captured ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock's actions as both a sign of competence and a willingness to take action.|$|E

5|$|The web series {{begins as}} Jake Fischer arrives in Bright Falls to {{interview}} Dr. Hartman {{on his new}} book, an assignment from his publication agency. After a series of encounters with local townspeople, Jake soon finds himself the victim of long periods of lost time and black outs. He finds himself {{waking up in the}} middle of a forest and other locations where he had not been previously. He also develops an aversion towards lights and daytime. The <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> stays in Bright Falls, the more violent his behaviour becomes. When he realises this, he tries to duct-tape himself to a refrigerator and recording videotape himself in his sleep to see what might be causing the behaviour. It is implied that he is being completely taken over by the Dark Presence, to the point of murdering several people. He then vanishes, just before the arrival of Alan and Alice Wake.|$|E
5|$|While Willaumez {{was distracted}} by his missing ship, Cochrane had {{finished}} preparing the convoy. Unable to delay its departure any <b>longer,</b> <b>he</b> sent 109 large merchant ships eastwards {{under the protection}} of one small ship of the line, two frigates and two sloops, a significantly inferior force to the one under Willaumez. The convoy passed across Willaumez's cruising ground during August while the French admiral was to the north searching for Vétéran, {{and by the time he}} returned the convoy was far to the east, was well on its journey to Britain. Willaumez's absence also meant that he missed a potential encounter with Admiral Warren, who had returned to the Atlantic in search of Willaumez following his victory over Linois in March. Warren had sailed from Spithead on 4 June and by 12 July had anchored at Barbados. During August he searched for Willaumez in the eastern Bahamas but failed to discover the French squadron, which at that time was still searching for Vétéran far to the north.|$|E

25|$|Ray Ferraro {{emerged as}} a playoff hero, scoring a pair of {{overtime}} winners {{in the first round}} series against the Capitals. Instead of celebrating after winning Game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders were both irate and despondent. Turgeon, the team's star center and leading scorer, suffered a shoulder separation when Dale Hunter checked him from behind as he celebrated a series-clinching goal. Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round, if not <b>longer.</b> <b>He</b> returned only for spot power play duty in the last game of the second round.

If John Tufton had lived <b>longer,</b> <b>he</b> would have been the 11th Earl. He was educated at Westminster School and Jesus College, Cambridge.|$|E

25|$|As {{opposed to}} his {{original}} counterpart, Disney {{gave him a}} more primal nature to his personality and mannerisms, which truly exploited his character as an untamed animal (i.e. alternating between walking and crawling, animal growls). Producer Don Hahn envisioned that the Beast's psychological state has become increasing feral the <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> was under the curse, such that he would eventually lose his last vestiges of humanity and become completely wild if the spell could not be broken. Hahn's idea doesn't manifest prominently in the finished 1991 animated film, since the Beast is only seen in a brief scene some time after his transformation {{while much of the}} narrative starts during the later period of the curse.|$|E
25|$|By about 8:45a.m., {{almost three}} hours after the initial start time for the attack, Delamain still had no word that Houghton was any closer to {{clearing}} the marshes.

The Maharattas lost all of their British officers, leaving the battalion under the command of its Viceroy's Commissioned Officers. As the Maharattas and sappers attacked the northern end of the line, 2nd Dorsets struck at the center and southern end of the line, encountering stiff resistance.|$|E

He devoted much of his time to socialising – {{he was a member of}} the Bullingdon Club – and equestrian sports. He was one of the best young horsemen at Oxford and quickly found his way into the University polo team. Although he passed his exams (a requirement for university applicants to Sandhurst), he was not eligible for a degree as he had missed a term's residence due to sickness, and if he had stayed for <b>longer</b> <b>he</b> would have been above the then age limit (23) to begin officer training in the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, which he entered in January 1884. Because he had been to university Haig was considerably older than most of his class at Sandhurst, and was Senior Under-Officer, was awarded the Anson Sword, and passed out first in the order of merit. He was commissioned as a lieutenant into the 7th (Queen's Own) Hussars on 7 February 1885.|$|E

25|$|Seeing {{that the}} rabbis of Jerusalem were very {{hostile to the}} Shabbethaian movement, Ghazzati proclaimed Gaza to be {{henceforth}} the holy city. He first spread about the Messiah's fame by sending circulars from Palestine to the most important communities in Europe.

Even after Shabbethai Ẓebi's apostasy Ghazzati did not desert his cause; but, thinking it unsafe to remain in Palestine any <b>longer,</b> <b>he</b> made preparations to go to Smyrna. The rabbis, seeing that the credulous were confirmed anew in their belief, excommunicated all the Shabbethaians, and particularly Ghazzati (Dec 9, 1666), warning everybody against harboring or even approaching him. After a stay of a few months at Smyrna he went (end of April, 1667) to Adrianople, where, {{in spite of his}} written promise that he would remain quiet, he continued his agitation. He urged the Shabbethaians of Adrianople to proclaim their adhesion to the cause by abolishing the fasts of the 17th of Tammuz and the 9th of Ab.|$|E
