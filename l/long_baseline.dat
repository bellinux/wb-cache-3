5|$|Jodrell Bank {{has been}} {{involved}} with Very <b>Long</b> <b>Baseline</b> Interferometry (VLBI) since the late 1960s; the Lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes being those at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada. The Lovell Telescope and the Mark II telescopes are regularly used for VLBI with telescopes across Europe (the European VLBI Network), giving a resolution of around 0.001 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|As the {{atmosphere}} is transparent for radio waves, radio telescopes in space are of most use for Very <b>Long</b> <b>Baseline</b> Interferometry; doing simultaneous observations of a source with both a satellite and a ground-based telescope and by correlating their signals to simulate a radio telescope {{the size of the}} separation between the two telescopes. Observations can be of supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and many other things.|$|E
5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very <b>long</b> <b>baseline</b> interferometry.|$|E

5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very <b>long</b> <b>baseline</b> interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E

25|$|Because {{radio telescopes}} have low resolution, {{they were the}} first {{instruments}} to use interferometry allowing two or more widely separated instruments to simultaneously observe the same source.

25|$|Observations in 2004 by the Very <b>Long</b> <b>Baseline</b> Array for 42 {{consecutive}} days gave new data {{and understanding of}} the action of the jets.

The material the jets are impacting appears to be replaced some of the time, but not always, leading to variations in the brightening of the jets.|$|E

30|$|With {{introducing}} the third frequency signals, the model strength can be significantly improved {{so that the}} fast and reliable AR becomes easier even over <b>long</b> <b>baselines.</b> Furthermore, the enhanced model allows us to careful modelling the distance-dependent systematic biases to realize the precise RTK applications over <b>long</b> <b>baselines.</b> For the single-baseline RTK, the initial {{studies have shown that}} with triple-frequency GNSS, the service distance can be extended to about 100  km with comparable performance to current short distance RTK with dual frequency. It means that in the medium city of China, like Shanghai, we can provide the RTK service with only one reference station (Feng and Li 2010). Analogously, for the network RTK, the distance of reference stations is advised to be roughly doubled with hexagon type of reference deployment. Such network deployment can save huge money in equipment installation and on-going maintenance (Feng and Li 2008).|$|R

50|$|The <b>longest</b> <b>baseline</b> of MTRLI was 134 km, between Pickmere and Defford. The first map {{produced}} by the array was published on 6 November 1980. In the first 2 years of operation (1980-1982), the array was used to observe at frequencies of 408 MHz (with a resolving power of 1 arcsecond), 1666 MHz (0.25 arcsecond) and 5 GHz (0.08 arcsecond).|$|R
25|$|The International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) {{is based}} on {{hundreds}} of extra-galactic radio sources, mostly quasars, distributed around the entire sky.

25|$|The NAIC {{received}} $3.1 {{million from}} the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

This allotment was an increase of about 30 percent over the FY-2009 budget. However, the FY-2010 funding request by NSF was cut by $1.2 million (−12.5%) over the FY-2009 budget, in light of their continued plans to reduce funding.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{as a part}} of an ongoing shift of {{operations}} from the NRC, operations of the ARO were passed to the Center for Research in Earth and Space Technology (CRESTech).

The Observatory's main uses today are in very <b>long</b> <b>baseline</b> interferometry (VLBI) experiments mostly in geodesy, a primary global positioning system site, some use for satellite downlink, and other general experiments.

50|$|Additional {{spacecraft}} {{were given}} gamma-ray detectors. The Apollo 15 and 16 missions carried detectors {{to study the}} Moon; middle-to-late Venera spacecraft carried detectors to Venus. The relatively <b>long</b> <b>baselines</b> of these missions again showed that bursts originated at great distances. Other spacecraft (such as the OGO, OSO, and IMP series) had detectors for Earth, Solar, or all-sky gamma radiation, and also confirmed the GRB phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Fluctuating {{properties}} of the atmosphere, and in particular its water vapour content, give rise to phase fluctuations of astronomical signals which, if uncorrected, lead to rapid deterioration of performance of (sub) -mm interferometers on <b>long</b> <b>baselines.</b> The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimeter Array (ALMA) uses a 183 GHz Water Vapour Radiometer (WVR) system to help correct these fluctuations and provide much improved performance on <b>long</b> <b>baselines</b> and at high frequencies. Here we describe {{the design of the}} overall ALMA WVR system, the choice of design parameters and the data processing strategy. We also present results of initial tests that demonstrate both the large improvement in phase stability that can be achieved and the very low contribution to phase noise from the WVRs. Finally, we describe briefly the main limiting factors to the accuracy of phase correction seen in these initial tests; namely, the degrading influence of cloud and the residual phase fluctuations that {{are most likely to be}} due to variations in the density of the dry component of the air...|$|R
25|$|During the 1970s, the {{telescope}} {{was used in}} conjunction with the Mark III to develop phase stable <b>long</b> <b>baseline</b> interferometers, leading to the development of MERLIN. The telescope was used as an interferometer with the Lovell Telescope to provide more accurate positions for radio sources found from a survey done in 1972 and 1973; the position of one radio source was found to coincide with a pair of faint blue stars, and after optical observations were made it was found to be the first gravitational lens. The majority of the current observational time of the Mark II is spent either on MERLIN or VLBI observations.|$|E
25|$|Very large {{radio telescopes}} on Earth were also {{listening}} to Huygens 10-watt transmission using {{the technique of}} very <b>long</b> <b>baseline</b> interferometry and aperture synthesis mode. At 11:25 CET on January 14, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia detected the carrier signal from Huygens. The GBT continued to detect the carrier signal well after Cassini stopped listening to the incoming data stream. In addition to the GBT, eight of the ten telescopes of the continent-wide VLBA in North America, located at Pie Town and Los Alamos, New Mexico; Fort Davis, Texas; North Liberty, Iowa; Kitt Peak, Arizona; Brewster, Washington; Owens Valley, California; and Mauna Kea, Hawaii, also listened for the Huygens signal.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} tests is gravitational lensing. It has been observed in distant astrophysical sources, but these are poorly controlled and it is uncertain how they constrain general relativity. The most precise tests are analogous to Eddington's 1919 experiment: they measure the deflection of radiation from a distant source by the Sun. The sources that can be most precisely analyzed are distant radio sources. In particular, some quasars are very strong radio sources. The directional resolution of any telescope is in principle limited by diffraction; for radio telescopes this is also the practical limit. An important improvement in obtaining positional high accuracies (from milli-arcsecond to micro-arcsecond) was obtained by combining radio telescopes across Earth. The technique is called very <b>long</b> <b>baseline</b> interferometry (VLBI). With this technique radio observations couple the phase information of the radio signal observed in telescopes separated over large distances. Recently, these telescopes have measured the deflection of radio waves by the Sun to extremely high precision, confirming the amount of deflection predicted by general relativity aspect to the 0.03% level. At this level of precision systematic effects have to be carefully taken into account to determine the precise location of the telescopes on Earth. Some important effects are Earth's nutation, rotation, atmospheric refraction, tectonic displacement and tidal waves. Another important effect is refraction of the radio waves by the solar corona. Fortunately, this effect has a characteristic spectrum, whereas gravitational distortion is independent of wavelength. Thus, careful analysis, using measurements at several frequencies, can subtract this source of error.|$|E
30|$|Obviously, the AR {{performance}} in GIF model is exactly equivalent for all schemes. Note {{the effects of}} geometric and ionospheric biases are totally removed for all schemes in GIF model. It is therefore promising for <b>long</b> <b>baselines.</b> With real triple-frequency data, this model has attracted more attentions. The initial results showed that it was somehow affected by some unexpected abnormality although this degradation is lamely attributed to the multipath (Wang and Rothacher 2013).|$|R
