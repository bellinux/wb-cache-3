40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between Lévy processes under nonlinear expectations, nonlinear semigroups and fully nonlinear PDEs. First, we establish a one-to-one relation between nonlinear Lévy processes and nonlinear Markovian convolution semigroups. Second, we provide a condition on a family of infinitesimal generators (A_λ) _λ∈Λ of <b>linear</b> <b>Lévy</b> processes which guarantees {{the existence of a}} nonlinear Lévy processes such that the corresponding nonlinear Markovian convolution semigroup is a viscosity solution of the fully nonlinear PDE ∂_t u=_λ∈Λ A_λ u. The results are illustrated with several examples. Comment: 22 page...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} stochastic suppression and stabilization for nonlinear delay differential system. The {{system is}} assumed to satisfy local Lipschitz condition and one-side polynomial growth condition. Since the system may explode in a finite time, we stochastically perturb this system by introducing independent Brownian noises and Lévy noise feedbacks. The contributions of this paper are as follows. (a) We show that Brownian noises or Lévy noise may suppress potential explosion of the solution for some appropriate parameters. (b) Using the exponential martingale inequality with jumps, we discuss {{the fact that the}} sample Lyapunov exponent is nonpositive. (c) Considering <b>linear</b> <b>Lévy</b> processes, by the strong law of large number for local martingale, sufficient conditions for a. s. exponentially stability are investigated in Theorem 13...|$|E

Seminar room V 0. 05 / 2 - 3 Prigogine In {{this talk}} we state results that generalize the {{singular}} perturbation approximation (SPA) for linear deterministic systems considered by Liu, Anderson [2]. Moreover, we present {{the relation between}} stochastic and bilinear systems in this regard, see Hartmann et al. [1] for the SPA in the bilinear case.

We consider compound renewal processes with <b>linear</b> drift and <b>Lévy</b> processes. For both processes we also formulate and prove the principle of a single big jump for their maxima. The class of compound renewal processes with drift particularly includes the Cramér–Lundberg renewal risk process...|$|R

40|$|PhD (Risk Analysis), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} the calibration of models based on Lévy processes to option prices observed in some market. This means that we choose {{the parameters of the}} option pricing models such that the prices calculated using the models correspond as closely as possible to these option prices. We demonstrate the ability of relatively simple Lévy option pricing models to nearly perfectly replicate option prices observed in nancial markets. We speci cally consider calibrating option pricing models to barrier option prices and we demonstrate that the option prices obtained under one model can be very accurately replicated using another. Various types of calibration are considered in the thesis. We calibrate a wide range of Lévy option pricing models to option price data. We con- sider exponential Lévy models under which the log-return process of the stock is assumed to follow a Lévy process. We also consider <b>linear</b> <b>Lévy</b> models; under these models the stock price itself follows a Lévy process. Further, we consider time changed models. Under these models time does not pass at a constant rate, but follows some non-decreasing Lévy process. We model the passage of time using the lognormal, Pareto and gamma processes. In the context of time changed models we consider linear as well as exponential models. The normal inverse Gaussian (N IG) model {{plays an important role in}} the thesis. The numerical problems associated with the N IG distribution are explored and we propose ways of circumventing these problems. Parameter estimation for this distribution is discussed in detail. Changes of measure play a central role in option pricing. We discuss two well-known changes of measure; the Esscher transform and the mean correcting martingale measure. We also propose a generalisation of the latter and {{we consider the}} use of the resulting measure in the calculation of arbitrage free option prices under exponential Lévy models. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} an overlapping generations {{framework of}} endogenous taxation. There are {{three types of}} heterogeneity among individuals: age, productivity, and bequest motives. The heterogeneity {{gives rise to a}} redistributive conflict and, therefore, to different preferences over fiscal policy. <b>Linear</b> taxes are <b>levied</b> on consumption expenditure, wage income, and capital income. These tax rates and the provision of a public good become endogenous through a majority-voting rule. The dynamic politico-economic equilibrium is examined both in and outside the steady state. The focus is on the underlying characteristics of the economy that gives rise to a particular fiscal structure. Copyright 1996 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{predictive}} {{density function}} g' is {{obtained for the}} multilevel model which is optimal in minimizing a criterion based on Kullback-Leibler divergence for a restricted class of predictive densitites, thereby extending results for the normal <b>linear</b> model (<b>levy</b> & Perng 1986). Based upon this predictive density approach three prediction methods are examined: Multilevel, Prior, and OLS. The OLS prediction method corresponds to deriving a predictive density separately in each group, while the Prior prediction method corresponds to deriving a predictive denstiy for the entire model. The Multilevel prediction method merely adjusts the Prior prediction method by employing a well known shrinkage estimator from multilevel model estimation. Multilevel data is simulated {{in order to assess}} the preformance of these three methods. Both predictive inervals and predictive mean square error (PMSE) are used to assess the adequacy of prediction. The multilevel prediction method outperforms the OLS and prior prediction methods some what surprising since the OLS and Prior prediction methods are derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. This suggests that the restricted class of predctive densities suggest by Levy & Perng for the normal linear model may need to be expanded for the multilevel model...|$|R
40|$|This paper re-examines {{the optimal}} tax design problem (income and commodities) in the {{presence}} of externalities. The nature of the second-best, and the choice of the tax instruments, are motivated by the informational structure in the economy. The main results are: (i) environmental <b>levies</b> (<b>linear</b> or nonlinear) differ in formula from Pigouvian taxes by the expressions for the optimal tax on private goods; (ii) externalities do not affect commodity tax formulas (linear and nonlinear) for private goods; (iii) externalities do not affect the income tax structure if commodity taxes are nonlinear and affect it if commodity taxes are linear; and (iv) a general income tax plus strictly Pigouvian taxes are sufficient for efficient taxation if individuals of different types have identical marginal rates of substitution (at any given consumption bundle) ...|$|R
40|$|We combine earlier {{investigations}} of <b>linear</b> systems with <b>Lévy</b> fluctuations [Physica 113 A, 203, (1982) ] with recent discussions of Lévy flights in external force fields [Phys. Rev. E 59, 2736, (1999) ]. We give a complete {{construction of the}} Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-Cauchy process as a fully computable model of an anomalous transport and a paradigm example of Doob’s stable noise-supported Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Despite the nonexistence of all moments, we determine local characteristics (forward drift) of the process, generators of forward and backward dynamics, relevant (pseudodifferential) evolution equations. Finally we prove that this random dynamics is not only mixing (hence ergodic) but also exact. The induced nonstationary spatial process is proved to be Markovian and quite apart from its inherent discontinuity defines an associated velocity process in a probabilistic sense. 1...|$|R
40|$|Financial markets {{based on}} Lévy {{processes}} are typically incomplete and option prices depend on risk attitudes of individual agents. In this context, {{the notion of}} utility indifference price has gained popularity in the academic circles. Although theoretically very appealing, this pricing method remains difficult to apply in practice, due to the high computational cost of solving the nonlinear partial integro-differential equation associated to the indifference price. In this work, we develop closed form approximations to exponential utility indifference prices in exponential Lévy models. To this end, we first establish a new non-asymptotic approximation of the indifference price which extends earlier results on small risk aversion asymptotics of this quantity. Next, we use this formula to derive a closed-form approximation of the indifference price by treating the Lévy model as a perturbation of the Black-Scholes model. This extends the methodology introduced in a recent paper for smooth <b>linear</b> functionals of <b>Lévy</b> processes (A. Černý, S. Denkl and J. Kallsen, arXiv: 1309. 7833) to nonlinear and non-smooth functionals. Our closed formula represents the indifference price as the linear combination of the Black-Scholes price and correction terms which depend on the variance, skewness and kurtosis of the underlying Lévy process, and the derivatives of the Black-Scholes price. As a by-product, we obtain a simple explicit formula for the spread between the buyer's and the seller's indifference price. This formula allows to quantify, in a model-independent fashion, how sensitive a given product is to jump risk {{in the limit of}} small jump size. Comment: Minor correction...|$|R
