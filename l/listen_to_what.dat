25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> {{she has to say}} like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is {{struck by the fact that}} even as we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E
25|$|Biff {{leaves the}} {{restaurant}} in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy has picked up. They leave a confused and upset Willy {{behind in the}} restaurant. When they later return home, their mother angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries unsuccessfully to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father {{that he is not}} meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The feud reaches an apparent climax with Biff hugging Willy and crying as he tries to get Willy {{to let go of the}} unrealistic expectations. Rather than <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed (despite her urging him to follow her), lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he sees his long-dead brother Ben, whom Willy idolized. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house. Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out.|$|E

500|$|According to Emily Jupp of The Independent, despite various {{changes in}} musical direction, an [...] "unconventional fashion sense" [...] {{has been a}} {{constant}} in Diamandis's career. In the video to [...] "How to be a Heartbreaker," [...] she [...] "subverts the norm" [...] by wearing more clothes than male models in the background; she reflected that [...] "I don’t think it suits me to wear very little clothing, it just wouldn’t feel right. I’d rather people <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> I have to say instead of staring at my bum." [...] In 2011, when promoting The Family Jewels, Diamandis [...] described her fashion styles as [...] "vintage, cheerleader, and cartoon." [...] Four years later, she described her costumes then as [...] "very badly put together vintage, kind of glittery ensemble", and her outfits for Froot as a [...] "mix of '70s with digital fiberware...something surreal and '70s." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey {{confessed that}} she never tried to change the {{situation}} because [...] " [...] used to be insecure and cautious, and so [...] would <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the people said." [...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, {{increasing the amount of}} conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue {{at the drop of a}} hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, I had more time, and I focused more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E

[...] Conversely, Slipknot's guitarist Jim Root had said in that same interview that [...] "A lot of {{the guys in the}} band say Rick was unavailable. And yeah, he takes on a lot of projects at one time, but he also does things that are beneficial. He would <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we'd done, then have us retrack things that needed work.

500|$|Frederick {{wrote to}} Elgin in January 1895 that Karim was deeply unpopular in the Household, {{and that he}} {{occupied}} [...] "very much {{the same position as}} John Brown used to". Princesses Louise and Beatrice, Prince Henry of Battenberg, Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Secretary of State for India Henry Fowler had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen, who [...] "refused to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they had to say but was very angry, so as you see the Munshi is a sort of pet, like a dog or cat which the Queen will not willingly give up". Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the India Office that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read, and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a confidential nature. Victoria's advisors feared Karim's association with Rafiuddin Ahmed, an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League. They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman Khan. There is no indication that these fears were well-founded, or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet.|$|E
500|$|Beiderbecke's parents {{enrolled}} him in {{the exclusive}} Lake Forest Academy, north of Chicago in Lake Forest, Illinois. While historians have traditionally suggested that his parents sent him to Lake Forest to discourage his interest in jazz, others have begun to doubt this version of events, believing {{that he may have}} been sent away in response to his arrest. Regardless, Mr. and Mrs. Beiderbecke apparently felt that a boarding school would provide their son with both the necessary faculty attention and discipline to improve his academic performance. His interests, however, remained limited to music and sports. In pursuit of the former, Beiderbecke took the train into Chicago to catch the hot jazz bands at clubs and speakeasies, including the infamous Friar's Inn, where he listened to and sometimes sat in with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. He also traveled to the predominantly African-American South Side to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he called [...] "real" [...] jazz musicians. [...] "Don't think I'm getting hard, Burnie," [...] he wrote to his brother, [...] "but I'd go to hell to hear a good band." [...] On campus, he helped organize the Cy-Bix Orchestra with drummer Walter [...] "Cy" [...] Welge and almost immediately got into trouble with the Lake Forest headmaster for performing indecorously at a school dance.|$|E
500|$|... "I See You" [...] {{was written}} by James Horner and Kuk Harrell and {{produced}} by Simon Franglen as the official theme song to James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar. It {{is the second time}} that Horner and Franglen have collaborated on a theme song for a film directed by Cameron, the first being [...] "My Heart Will Go On", performed by Celine Dion and used for his 1997 film Titanic. In an interview with Rick Edwards for 4Music called Under the Skin of Leona Lewis, Lewis explained how she became involved with Avatar and recording the theme tune. The singer said that she had known about the project for some period of time as she is very interested in film in general, and that she was approached by Cameron to record Avatars official theme song. She continued to say that she was very excited about seeing the film, even before her involvement with the film came to be. Cameron invited Lewis to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they had in mind for the song, and upon hearing it, she [...] "immediately wanted to be on board." [...] One of the reasons Lewis gave as to why she accepted the proposal was that a lot of her second studio album, Echo (2009), was inspired by various films, and she {{thought it would be a}} great opportunity to appear on a soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|American {{recording}} artist Kanye West {{also contributed to}} three tracks on the album; Madonna called him [...] "the black Madonna" [...] and said, [...] "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre". Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and I do, too. I <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he has to say, take it in, and he listens to what I say and takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually jumping up and down on the soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E
500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new friends can {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> she has to say. Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look.|$|E
500|$|... "Truth", the album's title track, is an electropop {{composition}} with {{a guitar}} hook. According to Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, Shelton {{was the source}} of inspiration for the track, which reveals Stefani's [...] "giddy new-crush enthusiasm". Both [...] "Truth" [...] and lead single [...] "Used to Love You" [...] are described as [...] "truth-telling" [...] songs by Kitty Empire of The Guardian. With [...] "Used to Love You", Stefani comes to terms with herself, dealing with the aftermath of her divorce, and realizing that her relationship with Rossdale is over. Produced by Rotem, the track is a [...] "vulnerable" [...] and [...] "emotional" [...] midtempo synthpop ballad, designed to [...] "showcase her passionate, conflicted vocals". In an interview with Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani confirmed that the track was inspired by the end of her marriage, and claimed that the song was only written a few weeks before its release. The seventh track, [...] "Send Me a Picture", has dancehall elements, and was described as a sexting ode by several publications; furthermore, Mapes stated the song has a [...] "Bieber-hits-the-islands vibe", while Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club summarized its meaning as [...] "captur the delicious anticipation of a crush potentially texting a snap". [...] "Red Flag" [...] is an [...] "upbeat in-your face track" [...] beginning with [...] "an intro that sounds like a melting violin", followed by Stefani scorning her ex: [...] "This is what happens when you don't <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> your mother say." [...] Amanda Dykan of AltWire.net found it reminiscent of 2000's [...] "Ex-Girlfriend" [...] and compared Stefani's rapping style to that of Lady Gaga's.|$|E
