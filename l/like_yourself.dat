500|$|Leech {{announced}} {{the decision to}} have Barber do the work in July, stating that he had instructed the engraver to prepare designs for presentation to Secretary of the Treasury Charles Foster. In a letter printed in the New York Tribune, Gilder expressed disappointment that the Mint was planning to generate the new designs in-house, feeling that the Mint, essentially a factory for coins, was ill-equipped to generate artistic coin designs. Due to Gilder's prominence in the coinage redesign movement, Leech {{felt the need to}} respond personally, which he did in early August. He told Gilder that [...] "artistic designs for coins, that would meet the ideas of an art critic <b>like</b> <b>yourself,</b> and artists generally, are not always adapted for practical coining". He assured Gilder that the designs which Barber had already prepared had met with the approval of Mitchell, though Leech himself had some improvements to suggest to the chief engraver.|$|E
500|$|The Ottoman army {{managed to}} advance as Vlad Ţepeş instituted {{a policy of}} {{scorched}} earth, poisoned the waters, and also created marshes by diverting the waters of small rivers. Traps were created by the digging of pits, and then covered with timber and leaves. The population and animals were evacuated to the mountains and as Mehmed advanced for seven days, his army suffered from fatigue as [...] "he found no man, nor any significant animal, and nothing to eat or drink." [...] Vlad adopted guerrilla tactics as his cavalry made several hit-and-run attacks. He would also send ill people suffering from lethal diseases, such as leprosy, tuberculosis, syphilis — and in more significant numbers – those who suffered from the bubonic plague, to intermix with the Turks and infect them. The bubonic plague managed to spread in the Ottoman army. The Ottoman fleet launched a few minor attacks on Brăila and Chilia, but {{without being able to}} do much damage, as Vlad Ţepeş had destroyed most of the ports in Bulgaria. Chalkokondyles writes that the Sultan managed to capture a Wallachian soldier and at first tried to bribe him for information; when that didn't work, he threatened him with torture, to no avail. Mehmed was said to have commended the soldier by saying, [...] "if your master had many soldiers <b>like</b> <b>yourself,</b> in a short time he could conquer the world!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{traditional}} Judaism, people's actions {{do not have}} the ability to affect God positively or negatively. The Book of Job in the Hebrew Bible states: [...] "Gaze at the heavens and see, and view the skies, which are higher than you. If you sinned, how do you harm God, and if your transgressions are many, {{what do you do to}} God? If you are righteous, what do you give God? Or what does God take from your hand? Your wickedness [...] a person <b>like</b> <b>yourself,</b> and your righteousness a child of humanity." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the federalist}} forces in open disarray and the polls {{showing that the}} yes side was going to win, Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin {{suggested}} organizing a gigantic [...] "unity rally" [...] in Montreal. Most of the Cabinet was opposed to Tobin's idea, but Chrétien decided to support the rally, telling Tobin at the Cabinet meeting [...] "Brian-Go!" [...] Chrétien's chief of staff Jean Pelletier later recalled that [...] "We muscled in" [...] on leading the no forces as Johnson, the nominal leader of the no committee {{was considered to be}} an inept leader who would lose the referendum on his own. Facing defeat, Chrétien did an U-turn on the question of a [...] "distinct society", saying in a speech on October 24 in Verdun that the federal government was now open to the idea of recognizing Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] in the constitution. In a speech before the Liberal caucus on October 25, Chrétien acknowledged openly the possibility of defeat, and lashed out at the Quebec media whom he accused of pushing [...] "a big pile of shit" [...] that was allowing the yes side to win people over, and suggested that he might resign if the oui side won. On October 26, 1995, Montreal radio station disk jockey Pierre Brassard telephoned Queen Elizabeth II pretending to be Chrétien; he discussed the pending referendum, but also rambled about odd subjects, such as what the Queen would be wearing for Halloween and placing her effigy on Canadian Tire money. The Queen later said to Chrétien: [...] "I didn't think you sounded quite <b>like</b> <b>yourself,</b> but I thought, given all the duress you were under, you might have been drunk." [...] The result of Tobin's efforts was the Unity Rally of October 27, 1995, when 100,000 people showed up. On the night of the referendum, the prospect of a victory for the yes side was considered to be so realistic that Defence Minister David Collenette ordered the military to begin contingency plans to defend federal property in Quebec from a separatist take-over should the yes side prevail. On October 30, 1995, the federalist no side won by the narrowest of margins. Chrétien blamed the narrow victory on the Quebec Liberals under Johnson, whom he claimed had betrayed him, and argued the federalists would have done much better if only he had intervened in the referendum earlier, and presented the no case in terms of Trudeau-style [...] "hard federalism" [...] instead of the [...] "soft federalist" [...] no case presented by Johnson, which depicted the benefits of Confederation in purely economic terms, and had a strongly nationalist, albeit federalist tone of language.|$|E
