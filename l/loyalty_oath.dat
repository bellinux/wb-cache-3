California ACLU affiliates successfully challenged the California state <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath.</b> The Supreme Court, until 1957, upheld nearly every law which restricted the liberties of Communists.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|As head of state, Hitler became supreme {{commander}} of the armed forces. The traditional <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> of servicemen was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, {{rather than to the}} office of supreme commander or the state.

40|$|Published online: 20 July 2015 The Article {{examines}} {{the wisdom of}} <b>loyalty</b> <b>oaths</b> as a legal institution in contemporary liberal democracies. First, using comparative analysis the Article highlights the growing global interest in <b>loyalty</b> <b>oaths.</b> Second, based upon historical evidence the Article explores the functions of <b>loyalty</b> <b>oaths</b> and assesses their role. Third, through using legal analysis the Article challenges the validity of <b>loyalty</b> <b>oaths</b> and identifies three fundamental problems related to their content and form: the rule of law, freedom of conscience, and equality. The Article reveals liberal concerns associated with the added value of the duty of “loyalty to the law” (allegiance), as distinct from the duty to “obey the law” (obedience). It presents an ongoing tension between loyalty and liberalism and argues that the more loyalty liberal democracies demand, the less liberal they become. The Article concludes that <b>loyalty</b> <b>oaths</b> yield high costs but have low benefits and suggests that liberal states should abandon them as a legal institution...|$|R

5|$|After {{his escape}} from Detroit, Hines went to Toronto where several other former Confederates lived. Not expecting {{to return to}} the United States, he sent for his wife Nancy. While in Toronto he studied law with General John C. Breckinridge, a former Vice President of the United States. Once U.S. President Andrew Johnson {{declared}} a pardon for most former Confederates, Hines went back to Detroit on July 20, 1865, to sign a <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> to the United States. However, knowing that Union officials in Kentucky would consider him an exception to the pardon, he remained in Canada until May 1866.|$|E
5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath,</b> and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|Upon taking office, Johnson {{faced the}} {{question}} {{of what to do with}} the Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath,</b> passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln pocket vetoed it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, many {{academics}} left the University of California, lured away by higher-salary offers {{and by the}} University's peculiar <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> requirement. Segrè chose to take the oath and stay, but this did not allay suspicions about his loyalty. Luis Alvarez was incensed that Amaldi, Fermi, Pontecorvo, Rasetti and Segrè had chosen to pursue patent claims against the United States for their pre-war discoveries and told Segrè {{to let him know}} when Pontecorvo wrote from Russia. He also clashed with Lawrence over the latter's plan to create a rival nuclear-weapons laboratory to Los Alamos in Livermore, California, in order to develop the hydrogen bomb, a weapon that Segrè felt would be of dubious utility.|$|E
25|$|The {{well-known}} German-Jewish medievalist Ernst Kantorowicz left Germany in 1939 {{after the}} Nazi government required civil servants to swear a <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> to Hitler {{and became a}} professor at Berkeley. 'With Germany's experience before his eyes,' he refused to sign Berkeley's <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> and was among those dismissed. Later, in 1951, Cherniss suggested he apply to the Institute for Advanced Study and he secured a permanent position there. Cherniss's old colleague at Johns Hopkins, the classicist Ludwig Edelstein, had also moved to Berkeley after the war but refused to sign the <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> and lost his job. He later returned to a position at Johns Hopkins. In October 1952 Berkeley's <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> was ruled unconstitutional by the California Supreme Court. The university was ordered to reinstate all dismissed faculty.|$|E

25|$|Democratic nominee John McKeithen {{at first}} warned voters {{that they were}} {{required}} to vote for him as the party standard-bearer because their participation in a party primary carried with it a <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> to the eventual nominee.

25|$|During the McCarthy era in 1949, the Board of Regents {{adopted an}} anti-communist <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath.</b> A number {{of faculty members}} objected and were dismissed; ten years passed before they were {{reinstated}} with back pay. In 1952, the University of California became an entity separate from the Berkeley campus. Each campus was given relative autonomy and its own Chancellor.

25|$|Not unexpectedly, {{the idea}} came up in bureaucratic circles {{that it would be}} useful to again require a <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> from all state functionaries, {{including}} university professors.

25|$|The {{quid pro}} quo to attain these {{privileges}} involved swearing an oath of loyalty to William and Mary. Many Catholics found this oath repugnant when the Papacy started to support the Jacobites in 1693. A small number of Catholic landlords had sworn this <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> in 1691–3 and their families remained protected. Previous Jacobite garrison surrenders, particularly the agreement at Galway earlier in 1691, specifically provided that the Catholic gentry of counties Galway and Mayo were protected from the property restrictions, though they would be excluded from direct involvement in politics.|$|E

25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Confederate States in 1865, Jackman and some of his men decided not to surrender and headed for Mexico. Along the way Jackman reunited with his now-released family in Shreveport, Louisiana, and proceeded with them toward Texas and the border. Near the end of 1865 they arrived in the city of San Marcos, located in Hays County, Texas. Jackman entered northern Mexico, leaving his family in Texas while he ascertained whether to relocate there. Deciding against it, he crossed back into the United States and surrendered to Federal authorities in San Antonio. Taken to New Orleans, Louisiana, took the <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> to the U.S. Government, and was subsequently paroled.|$|E
25|$|Carter {{concentrated}} {{his efforts}} on trade, including ironworks, a textile factory and a flour mill, {{in addition to}} draining swamps around Nomony and diversifying crops at all his plantations. Although publicly neutral, Carter honored the continental boycott declared in 1774, and in 1775 joined Richard Corbin in expressing the council's concern about rumors of British marines being stationed at Williamsburg. Carter declined to give the loyalty assurances Dunmore required, and Dunmore dissolved the council in 1776. Carter did give a <b>loyalty</b> <b>oath</b> to the new Commonwealth of Virginia the following summer. Although Carter also declined political offices mentioned by Patriot friends, he began supplying provisions and bayonets to the American cause in the Revolution, so British ships raided his plantations near the Potomac river.|$|E
