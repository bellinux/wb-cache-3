40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique for multilingual location tagging for Indian languages. The system has a <b>language</b> <b>identifier</b> and multilingual place name tagger. The <b>language</b> <b>identifier</b> built using statistical techniques identifies {{the language of}} each sentence. The location tagger is built completely based on suffix stripping techniques, which has been more explored for Part-Of-Speech tagging task. A finite state automaton, built using the location suffixes, is used in tagger to bring a time and space efficiency. There {{is no need for}} the preprocessing of the input text. Heuristic rules are used to enhance the performance of the system. The system takes a multilingual text as an input, identifies the languages at sentence level and tags the place names.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel paradigm to spoken language identification. We first propose a universal sound recognizer that transcribes multilingual speech utterances into sound sequences using a unified inventory of sound symbols. The {{units of the}} universal sound recognizer form a sound inventory which acts as the common phone set for the languages of interest. Second, we define the concept of bag-of-sounds, the high-order statistics for the co-occurrence of sound patterns. We then build a bag-of-sounds classifier for language identification {{in a similar way}} that bag-of-words is used for text categorization. In this way, a <b>language</b> <b>identifier</b> is built by sequencing a universal sound recognizer and a bag-of-sounds classifier. The bag-of-sounds paradigm significantly reduces the development cost of adding new language capabilities to an existing language identification system. In this paper, a <b>language</b> <b>identifier</b> was built for five Asian languages to validate the approach. It achieves average 98. 1 % classification accuracy for the speech sessions of 10 -seconds length. 1...|$|E

A key challenge {{is the lack of}} an ad-equate corpus of messages annotated for language that reflects the linguistic diver-sity present on Twitter.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{implemented}} a new network information processing system using reconfigurable hardware that scans volumes of data in real-time.

In a previous project, we {{have implemented}} an N-gram based <b>language</b> <b>identifier</b> that can process up to 1 Gbps throughput. However, a large percentage of computer network traffic, such as email and web data, consists of markup information such as tags and protocol specific options.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{exploiting}} information from a wide phonetic context for the purpose of language identification. Two approaches to language modeling are presented here: 1) modified bigrams with a context -mapping matrix and 2) language models based on binary decision trees.
