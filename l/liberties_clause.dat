40|$|In June 1215 King John put his seal to Magna Carta, which {{over the}} centuries has become an icon of English (British) <b>liberties.</b> <b>Clause</b> 40 about not selling, denying or delaying justice, and Clause 39, that no free man is to be imprisoned or dispossessed “save by the lawful {{judgment}} of his peers or by {{the law of the}} land” are still in force today. For these reasons Lord Denning described Magna Carta as “the greatest constitutional document of all times—the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot”. In other words the executive can never be above the law, but for this principle to be enforced the state must disclose evidence by due process to the public by which it can be held to account. This essay explores the threats to openness of government in the digital age, which runs the risk of undermining this fundamental principle of the British constitution. These range from the intrusiveness of our surveillance society, ill-considered notions of a post-privacy world, misconceived concepts of open data to the immense difficulty of scrutinizing born-digital data released under due process for sensitive content. Such threats are balanced by a much more assertive judiciary under the supreme court, which like its American counterpart strikes down legislation, an unelected second chamber willing to challenge the executive and House of Commons select committees that are increasingly baring their teeth.

5000|$|Classified as a {{religious}} test, there are no known cases of this article being enforced in modern times, as religious freedom is provided for in the United States Constitution's Bill of Rights. In addition, Article Six of the United States Constitution is considered to prohibit such religious tests. It says: [...] "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States." [...] Current legal precedent holds that this provision is binding on the states as well under the <b>liberty</b> <b>clause</b> of the 14th Amendment to the federal constitution. Additionally, the First Amendment to the federal constitution establishes freedom of religion as a constitutional right. While the wording of this amendment specifically bars Congress from restricting freedom of religion, current precedent holds that this amendment {{and the rest of}} the United States Bill of Rights are binding on the states by the <b>liberty</b> <b>clause</b> of the 14th Amendment.|$|R

Procedural due process is required any time a person faces the deprivation of life, liberty, or property. As substantive due process arises from the <b>liberty</b> <b>clause,</b> a deprivation of a substantive due process right is a deprivation of liberty and thus requires procedural due process.|$|R
25|$|In Casey, {{the plaintiffs}} {{challenged}} five {{provisions of the}} Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 authored by Rep. Stephen F. Freind, arguing that the provisions were unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade. The Court in Roe {{was the first to}} establish abortion as a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The majority in Roe further held that women have a privacy interest protecting their right to abortion embedded in the <b>liberty</b> <b>clause</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment. The five provisions at issue in Casey are summarized below.|$|R
40|$|The United States has an {{extensive}} history of encouraging {{and protecting the}} rights of parents to make educational decisions for their children. The notion that parents speak for their children has been a longstanding, important value undergirding the operation of American public schools and early courts developed common law principles {{in support of this}} concept. Beginning in Meyer v Nebraska, the United States Supreme Court enshrined this common law concept that parents could make educational decisions for their children as a constitutional right under the <b>liberty</b> <b>clause</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the intervening eight decades, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have wrestled with interpreting how this constitutional right should be balanced with the emerging post-Tinker v Des Moines Independent School District constitutional rights of students and the post-Hazelwood School District v Kuhlmeier right of school districts to make reasonable curriculum decisions even if they limit student expression. Complicating this constitutional balancing is how courts should address the rights of students where those rights may conflict with the educational choices of parents. To the extent that courts recognise the choices of students over those of their parents, the nature of the parent-child relationship as developed under common law and enshrined in the <b>liberty</b> <b>clause</b> has been dramatically altered.

5000|$|Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) pressed Alito {{to either}} agree or {{disagree}} with a statement by Chief Justice John Roberts that the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision was [...] "settled law." [...] Alito would not agree, stating that it was a matter that could come before the court, and that [...] "it is an issue that is involved in litigation now at all levels." [...] He did say, [...] "When a decision is challenged and reaffirmed, it increases its value. The more times it happens, the more respect it has." [...] Senator Durbin suggested there seemed to be inconsistency between Alito's unequivocal support for the unspecified right to desegregated schools in Brown v. Board of Education from the equal protection clause and his refusal {{to do the same for}} the Griswold case from the <b>liberty</b> <b>clause.</b> Durbin also questioned Alito further regarding his membership in Concerned Alumni for Princeton, and Alito again denied remembering any details about his membership in the organization.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to critically assess the current status of the legal regime governing the international carriage of goods by sea, with the main focus being on the implied terms which form the foundation of international shipping law in general, and on the doctrine of deviation in particular. This will include a critical review of the rule against unjustified deviation in contracts of affreightment by posing the following questions: (i) Is the rule against unjustified deviation still relevant in the modern context of international carriage of goods by sea? In light of: The development of transport vessels, <b>liberty</b> <b>clauses,</b> different types of charterparties, and held cover clauses? (ii) Should the rule against unjustified deviation be treated any differently from other implied shipping terms? Is the rule against deviation an absolute obligation? Should unjustified deviation amount to fundamental breach of a contract? Should there not be some degree of flexibility in the judicial approach to the law on deviation? (iii) Do we need harmonisation, unification and interpretation of deviation rules? It is hoped that in attempting to answer these questions some light may be shed on this important area of shipping law...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIf {{there were}} no express {{provisions}} in the charter party as to seaworthiness or a ship owner's obligation to exercise reasonable dispatch, there is an implied obligation in common law. At other times, {{in the absence of}} an express term, the right to nominate a port does not give rise to a correlative warranty on the nomination to a safe port. Likewise, a change of circumstances occurring after the conclusion of the contract may be sufficient to discharge the parties from further performance of their contract. In common law, the shipper has an implied obligation to inform the ship owner on the dangerous nature of the shipped goods. Last but not least, whether the owner of the vessel operates a liner service or a under a charter undertakes that his vessel, while performing its obligations under the contract of carriage, will not deviate from the contract of carriage. Based on theoretical and jurisprudential aspects, this article aims to analyze the consequences of the ship owner's breach of the contract, the implications of express <b>liberty</b> <b>clauses,</b> and where appropriate, the Hague-Visby Rules incorporation effect. In conclusion, the obligations have different meanings depending on the type of the contract of affreightment and the circumstances in which the obligation must be fulfilled or the moment while operating...|$|R
5000|$|In Leduc v Ward, {{a vessel}} was to voyage from Fiume (modern day Rijeka) to Dunkirk. The {{bill of lading}} gave [...] "liberty to call at any ports in any order". She did not proceed to Dunkirk, but headed for Glasgow, and was lost in a storm near Ailsa Craig. Just as in Glynn v Margetson, the Court of Appeal held that the {{deviation}} was unjustifiable and was not permitted by the <b>liberty</b> <b>clause,</b> so the carrier was liable for the lost cargo. [...] (Had {{the court held that}} the deviation was justified, the carrier would have avoided liability as the storm would have been an [...] "Act of God"). Even though it was accepted that the shipper had been verbally informed that the vessel might make passage to Glasgow, this evidence was not admissible, because the parol evidence rule prevents recourse to extraneous evidence when construing a written document. Using the criteria of differential bargaining strength of the parties, whereby the carrier is usually deemed to have greater bargaining power than the shipper, note that the parol evidence rule may be relaxed if a shipper seeks to rely on any verbal promises of the carrier (rather than vice versa, as in Leduc v Ward) [...]|$|R
5000|$|Civil liberties {{groups have}} {{called on the}} {{government}} to effect the forum clause into UK law {{in relation to the}} extradition request for Richard O'Dwyer, amid concerns over whether the U.S. courts are the appropriate legal forum. According to Liberty, [...] "Enacting the forum amendment would have been quite simple. It's not that we're arguing that in every case where activity has taken place here we shouldn't allow people to be extradited. But we should at least be leaving our judges some discretion to look at the circumstances."

50|$|Cameron's {{conviction}} did {{not have}} any legal standing, only standing within the church itself. Thus the worst consequences for him would have been deposition (exclusion from the ministry) or excommunication (expulsion from the church). However he withdrew his last appeal and resigned from the ministry on 31 July 1994. In strict church law he might have succeeded in his appeal given the <b>liberty</b> of opinion <b>clause</b> in the Basis of Union 1901 of the Presbyterian Church. On the other hand, his denial in his books of basic teachings of the historic Christian faith were plainly contrary to the vows he had taken. He returned to Scotland in January 1996, and left the Church of Scotland to be ordained in the Scottish Episcopal Church (an historic Church that is in communion with the Church of England within the Anglican Communion).|$|R
