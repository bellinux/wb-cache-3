40|$|This {{fact sheet}} series {{highlights}} innovative ways that ranchers and family forest owners are prospering from protecting and/or enhancing ecosystem services on their land. Ecosystem services are the benefits people receive from nature like water quality, wildlife habitat, and carbon sequestration. Ecologically sound practices often cost landowners more than less environmentally friendly tactics. However, some consumers {{are willing to}} pay more for the assurance of production practices they value. Third-party certification is a way to acknowledge sustainable production practices beyond what is required by law. The market for such products is often new and relatively small, but one company is betting that in the future, certification will be essential to market access. A certified timber company and sawmill in Northwest Montana is using log-buying policies to incentivize certified sustainable forestry practices on private <b>lands.</b> <b>Stewardship</b> is rewarded, and both landowners and the mill benefit by being better prepared in evolving markets...|$|R

40|$|Extended Abstract: In Canada, the {{endangered}} sharp-tailed snake (Contia tenuis) is known from {{only a few}} localities on the southern Gulf Islands and southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia. These areas are heavily modified, and the human population continues to increase at a rapid rate. Because most of the known localities of the sharp-tailed snake are on private <b>lands,</b> <b>stewardship</b> by landowners {{is essential for the}} survival of the species. Potential habitat also exists on publicly-owned lands, including the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve and lands managed by the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Coast Guard within the Capital Regional District. Stewardship and protection of sharp-tailed snake habitats within these lands is also important. The goals of the stewardship efforts initiated by the Sharp-tailed Snake Recovery Team are to (1) educate the public, landowners, and resource managers about habitat management practices that are beneficial to the species, (2) encourage the establishment of conservation covenants on private lands, (3) restore habitat at selected sites, (4) train landowners to monitor populations, and (5) locate possible undiscovered populations so that appropriate protection measures can be applied. To contribute to these goals, we developed and delivered a multi-media presentation t...|$|R
