50|$|Notholaena, cloak fern, is a genus of ferns in the Cheilanthoideae {{subfamily}} of the Pteridaceae. Ferns of this genus {{are mostly}} epipetric (growing on rock) or occurring in coarse, gravelly soils, and are most abundant and diverse {{in the mountain}} ranges of warm arid or semiarid regions. They typically have a creeping or erect rhizome and leaves that are pinnatifid to pinnate-pinnatifid with marginal sori protected by a false indusium formed from the reflexed margin of the <b>leaf.</b> <b>Members</b> of Notholaena also have a coating of whitish or yellowish farina (a powdery wax that prevents desiccation) on the surfaces of the leaves.

As a result of the study, it was identified that the anatomical characteristics of the species resemble other members of the Resedaceae family to which this species belongs. The most distinguishing characteristic of the species in the anatomical structure is the presence of myrosin cells, which are also present in the root, stem and <b>leaf</b> of other <b>members</b> of the family.
