5|$|At West Palm Beach, the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets with broken trunks. Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Street {{lighting}} system {{is an essential}} structure {{for the safety of}} traffic. Most of the <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is made of steel and it is vulnerable to corrosion due to its hazardous surrounding environment. To mitigate such corrosion problems, stainless steel and iron steel are usually adopted, but they are also usually manufactured by hand, so it is not economical. Therefore, to overcome such problems new type FRP <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is proposed. In recent years, FRP materials in the construction market are popularly utilized as an alternative for conventional construction materials. FRP material is known to have many advantages such as high chemical resistance, electro-magnetic transparency, high specific strength and stiffness, etc. In this paper, structural behavior of FRP <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is compared with that of conventional <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> structures and we proposed the cross-section configuration of the FRP <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> with details on the manufacturing procedure...|$|R
50|$|With Budweiser's {{sponsorship}} of the Daytona Shootout ending after 2012, and series sponsor Sprint taking over {{sponsorship of}} that race, Coors <b>Light</b> <b>Pole</b> Winners are once again given a birth in the renamed Sprint Unlimited. When Coors <b>Light</b> <b>Pole</b> Qualifying is rained out, the polesitter is not given the Coors <b>Light</b> <b>Pole</b> Award and the Sprint Unlimited birth, the same protocol followed by Budweiser {{at the time when}} they gave away a position in the Bud Shootout. However, with the new multi-round qualifying format being used starting in 2014, the Coors <b>Light</b> <b>Pole</b> Award and the Unlimited birth are given out as long as at least one round is completed. An example of this contrast is that at the 2014 Toyota Owners 400, Coors <b>Light</b> <b>Pole</b> Qualifying was completely rained out, giving Kyle Larson the pole position, however he was not given the Coors <b>Light</b> <b>Pole</b> Award or a birth in the 2015 Sprint Unlimited. However, later in the year at the Coke Zero 400, David Gilliland was fastest in round 1 of qualifying, and was given the pole after rounds 2 and 3 were rained out. Because one round of qualifying had been completed, the session was declared official and Gilliland was given the Coors <b>Light</b> <b>Pole</b> Award and the berth in the 2015 Sprint Unlimited.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Under {{excitation}} from wind, highway <b>lighting</b> <b>poles</b> {{of various}} types have exhibited problematic vibrations. Previous study of these vibrations and the consequent fatigue and failure of the structures was primarily based on analytical formulation and laboratory tests, and the effort {{has been focused on}} some specific perceived types of oscillations. The prototype aerodynamic behavior of <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> structures still need to be further investigated. This paper presents an interpretation of the <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> vibrations observed through a long-term full-scale measurement project. Based on this interpretation, the excitation mechanisms that induced the vibrations were identified. ...|$|R
25|$|EVOH {{is used in}} {{multilayer}} {{films for}} packaging as a barrier layer (barrier plastic). As EVOH is hygroscopic (water-attracting), it absorbs water from the environment, whereby it loses its barrier effect. Therefore, it must {{be used as a}} core layer surrounded by other plastics (like LDPE, PP, PA or PET). EVOH is also used as a coating agent against corrosion at street lights, traffic <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> and noise protection walls.|$|E
25|$|The {{placement}} of energy attenuation devices (e.g. guardrails, wide grassy areas, sand barrels) is also common. Some road fixtures such as road signs and fire hydrants {{are designed to}} collapse on impact. <b>Light</b> <b>poles</b> are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car that hits them. Highway authorities may also remove larger trees from the immediate vicinity of the road. During heavy rains, if the elevation of the road surface isn't higher than the surrounding landscape, it may result in flooding.|$|E

When it became evident that the aircraft was going to overrun the runway due to the high speed and poor braking action on the slush-covered pavement, the pilot purposely steered the jet into an embankment to avoid striking <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> past {{the far end of}} the runway. There were no injuries to the four passengers or two crew, but the aircraft was written off.|$|E

25|$|Street length {{influences}} proportionately {{the amount}} of street components {{that have to be}} constructed such as pavement, curbs and sidewalks, storm sewers and drains, <b>light</b> <b>poles,</b> and trees. The street length of a given area of development depends on the frequency at which streets occur which in turn depends on the length and width of a block. The higher the frequency of streets the longer is their total length. The smaller the block dimensions the higher the frequency of the streets. As the frequency of street increases so does the number of intersections. Intersections normally cost more than straight street length because they are labour-intensive and require street and traffic signage.|$|E

It intersects SR-171 (3300 South) right after crossing Mill Creek, then passes Nibley Golf Course before entering Salt Lake City. Throughout this area (and continuing {{as far north as}} Liberty Park in Salt Lake City), the road was widened to four or more vehicle lanes in each direction by acquisition (using eminent domain) and flattening of a large amount of property on the west side; as a result few structures (and even fewer old buildings) front onto {{the west side of the}} street, whereas the east side has many remaining old houses and even old street <b>light</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|E
25|$|The tornado reached EF3 {{strength}} {{just past}} the Liberty Expressway as it impacted a one-story brick home, removing the roof and collapsing several exterior walls, snapping or uprooting almost all surrounding mature trees, and tossing a vehicle in the area. A few other homes in this area also sustained significant structural damage. It then quickly weakened back to EF2 intensity as it completely destroyed the canopy of a service station, snapped large trees, tore the entire roof off of a restaurant, and severely damaged a large Procter & Gamble plant in Albany. Multiple anchored double-wide trailers were completely destroyed at the Marine Corp Logistics Base, and concrete <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> were snapped. Several semi-trailers were tossed and piled atop each other, and multiple other large metal industrial buildings sustained heavy damage in this area as well.

40|$|Abstract. Fatigue {{cracking}} {{reported in}} a <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> on an elevated bridge structure near Wellington {{raised the question of}} how to better design for and predict the fatigue life of <b>lighting</b> <b>poles</b> subject to wind induced fatigue. There have been concerns as to the reliability and currency of the methods commonly used in New Zealand. The paper therefore reviews current international design methods and describes the development of an improved fatigue design method for <b>lighting</b> <b>poles</b> in New Zealand. The new method uses fracture mechanics based crack growth formulations in conjunction with a modified J. D. Holmes Method for wind response analysis of the pole to varying wind speeds. Cumulative crack growth is calculated iteratively rather than using an S-N curve based Palmegran-Miner summation. Wind spectra used in the method are developed from long term meteorological records at representative locations. Software has been prepared to enable quick assessment of the expected fatigue life of <b>lighting</b> <b>poles,</b> and associated gear openings and holding down bolts The method and software has been calibrated with reference to full scale laboratory fatigue proof testing of representative base stubs and natural wind response testing of a 12 m high <b>lighting</b> <b>pole...</b>|$|R
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} on January21, a large tornado touched down {{northwest}} of Purvis in Lamar County, Mississippi, at 3:35a.m. EST (08:35UTC). The tornado initially caused EF1 damage, snapping and uprooting many trees and destroying small sheds. A house sustained minor roof damage and collapse of its carport, and a power pole was snapped as well. Further to the northeast, the tornado reached EF2 intensity as it ripped the roof off of a well-built brick home and destroyed outbuildings. As the tornado approached the Forrest County line, EF2 damage continued as another home had its roof torn off, a mobile home was completely destroyed, and a billboard pole was snapped. Other homes in this area sustained minor roof damage, and trees and power poles were downed. The tornado intensified to EF3 strength shortly after it crossed the Forrest County line and entered residential areas of southwestern Hattiesburg, where multiple well-constructed brick homes had roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed, and an elderly woman was killed. The tornado continued producing EF3 damage as it crossed Veterans Memorial Drive, snapping metal power pylons and severely damaging two buildings at Living Word Church. Maintaining its strength, the tornado moved across U.S. Route 49 and through a residential area, damaging several homes and destroying the top floor of a church. The tornado then tore directly through the William Carey University campus, resulting in severe structural damage and tossing and damaging numerous vehicles in the parking lots. Multiple large, multi-story brick buildings had windows blown out, roofs ripped off, and top floor exterior walls collapsed. <b>Light</b> <b>poles</b> were downed at the ball field as well.|$|E

500|$|Minneapolis was {{intended}} to be covered in its entirety by the wireless network, with certain exceptions (such as the Eloise Butler Wildflower Garden, which lacked the infrastructure to support such a system). The city's numerous lakes were also ruled out for network coverage, since sending and receiving signals on them would require transmission poles in the water. [...] The first area of the city to receive the service was Downtown Minneapolis, though it was delayed two weeks there due to technical challenges posed by the skyscrapers in the area, as well as the uneven terrain of the Mississippi River {{on the east side of}} the area. The goal was to blanket the entire city with the network by November 2007 and in spite of delays, USI Wireless expected that the next area for installation, a residential neighborhood, would be easier thanks to its flat terrain. In late 2008, however, the completion of the network was stuck at 82% because of a misunderstanding between the Minneapolis Park Board, who stated that USI Wireless could not install their radio transmitters on park land without the proper permits, and USI Wireless, who had been unaware of this. A further delay in 2008 came in the form of <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> that were breaking under the stress of the wireless transmitters being placed upon them in neighborhoods in the Calhoun-Isles area of the city. In response, the city paid $1 million to install new <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> in the area that would be capable of supporting the transmitters.

500|$|With Osiel imprisoned, however, Costilla Sánchez {{was deemed}} more {{powerful}} than Antonio Ezequiel.

Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, too, was part of the first tier circle, but he headed Los Zetas, while the other two commanded the Gulf Cartel directly. The triumvirate of Antonio Ezequiel, Costilla Sánchez, and Lazcano controlled the flow of narcotics from the southern state of Quintana Roo to the northern Tamaulipas state. Although initially part of a single command structure during the Osiel era, members within Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel began to follow orders of their respective commanders. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Gulf Cartel [...] "operated with a certain structure that allowed for rivalries among lieutenants to exist without affecting the organization as a whole". But with Osiel's absence, several top leaders within the cartel fought {{to take control of the}} leadership void. This eventually resulted in the split of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in early 2010, prompting daily shootouts and killings from both fronts. The conflict between both groups triggered in Reynosa, Tamaulipas in January 2010, when Samuel Flores Borrego of the Gulf Cartel killed a Zetas leader. When the fighting broke out in Reynosa, Antonio and Los Escorpiones, his private army, made their way into Valle Hermoso, Tamaulipas and took the city from Zetas's control.
