25|$|Throughout the battle, British ships {{experienced}} {{difficulties with}} communications, whereas the Germans {{did not suffer}} such problems. The British preferred signalling using ship-to-ship flag and <b>lamp</b> <b>signals,</b> avoiding wireless, whereas the Germans used wireless successfully. One conclusion drawn was that flag signals were not a satisfactory way to control the fleet. Experience using lamps, particularly at night when issuing challenges to other ships, demonstrated this was {{an excellent way to}} advertise your precise location to an enemy, inviting a reply by gunfire. Recognition signals by lamp, once seen, could also easily be copied in future engagements.|$|E
25|$|The two escort {{ships were}} unaware of what was {{happening}} to General Belgrano, as they were out of touch with her in the gloom and had not seen the distress rockets or <b>lamp</b> <b>signals.</b> Adding to the confusion, the crew of Bouchard felt an impact that was possibly the third torpedo striking {{at the end of its}} run (an examination of the ship later showed an impact mark consistent with a torpedo). The two ships continued on their course westward and began dropping depth charges. By the time the ships realised that something had happened to General Belgrano, it was already dark and the weather had worsened, scattering the life rafts.|$|E

50|$|During the day, {{the guard}} uses the {{traditional}} green flag {{to signal the}} pilot to depart, and the red flag to stop, assisted by two-way radios. After sunset, the guard uses <b>lamp</b> <b>signals</b> {{in place of the}} flags. A couple of minutes before signalling departure to the pilot, the guard blows a whistle to warn passengers to board the train. After ensuring all passengers are safe to travel, the guard signals the green flag by waving it from the brake van. In an emergency, the guard uses the red flag to indicate a stop, and may directly apply brakes to stop the train. The pilot is not allowed to move the train without a signal from the guard, as the guard {{is in charge of the}} train.|$|E

50|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>lamps</b> (such as Aldis <b>lamps),</b> are visual <b>signaling</b> {{devices for}} optical {{communication}} (typically using Morse code). Modern <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> are a focused lamp which {{can produce a}} pulse of light. In large versions this pulse is achieved by opening and closing shutters mounted {{in front of the}} lamp, either via a manually operated pressure switch or, in later versions, automatically.|$|R

5000|$|Colors {{of traffic}} lights are {{confusing}} to some dichromats {{as there is}} insufficient apparent difference between the red/amber traffic lights and sodium street lamps; also, the green can be confused with a grubby white lamp. This is a risk on high-speed undulating roads where angular cues cannot be used. British Rail color <b>lamp</b> <b>signals</b> use more easily identifiable colors: The red is blood red, the amber is yellow and the green is a bluish color. Most British road traffic lights are mounted vertically on a black rectangle with a white border (forming a [...] "sighting board") and so dichromats can more easily look for {{the position of the}} light within the rectangleâ€”top, middle or bottom. In the eastern provinces of Canada horizontally mounted traffic lights are generally differentiated by shape to facilitate identification for those with color blindness. In the United States, this is not done by shape but by position, as the red light is always on the left if the light is horizontal, or on top if the light is vertical. However, a single flashing light (red indicating cars must stop, yellow for caution/yield) is indistinguishable, but these are rare.|$|E
50|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{faced by}} an attacking force {{in a trench}} battle was unreliable communications. Wireless communications were still in their infancy, so the available methods were telephone, telegraph, semaphore, <b>signal</b> <b>lamps,</b> <b>signal</b> flares, homing pigeons and runners. Messages frequently could not get through, or if they did, were out of date. A delay would pass when transferring news to the division, corps and army headquarters.|$|R

40|$|There is {{some concern}} that turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. Two studies were performed. The first study was a survey of current practice in the U. S. with regard to the use of clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The main results are that clear outer lenses on rear turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> are used in about 28 % of all vehicle models, while the corresponding percentage for front turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is about 70 %. The second study photometrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and color contrast between the on and off states for turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> that use either an amber lens or a clear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that color contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with clear-lens <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> remains to be ascertained...|$|R

50|$|In market {{there are}} many special {{converters}} that solves the problem of connecting a car with European wiring to a trailer with North American wiring. What most of these converters do is to bring together the turn <b>signals</b> and stop <b>lamp</b> <b>signal</b> from a three-wire solution using 54, L and R into a two-wire solution using L54 and R54 according to DIN where brake light and turn indicator uses the same wire and bulb for each side. These converters usually don't handle the case of separate position light circuits for left and right side in the towing vehicle.|$|R

Krepost Sveaborg had both a regular telephone system and a second, independent telephone network dedicated for fire control. The primary telephone exchange was located on Iso Mustasaari.

The telephone cabels on main line of defence were usually buried, while second line used overhead lines.

40|$|The use of clear-lens <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> on automobiles, {{motivated}} {{largely by}} styling considerations, has prompted interest in {{whether there are}} any safety consequences associated with these lamps. In a previous report (UMTRI- 98 - 2), {{it was found that}} under bright, sunny conditions, luminance contrast between the off and on states of clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is smaller than for lamps using amber lenses. On the other hand, color contrast between the off and on states is greater with clear-lens turn signals. An experiment was conducted to compare the reaction time of drivers to <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> using clear and amber lenses. The results indicate that luminance contrast is the primary characteristic influencing driver performance and that no compensatory advantage appears to be obtained with increases in color contrast. This result is also consistent with evidence from basic research on visual search...|$|R
