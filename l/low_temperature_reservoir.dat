40|$|Graphene {{irradiated}} by a {{circularly polarized}} laser has been predicted to be a Floquet topological insulator showing a laser-induced quantum Hall effect. A circularly polarized laser also drives the system out of equilibrium resulting in non-thermal electron distribution functions that strongly affect transport properties. Results are presented for the Hall conductance for two different cases. One {{is for a}} closed system such as a cold-atomic gas where transverse drift due to non-zero Berry curvature {{can be measured in}} time of flight measurements. For this case the effect of a circularly polarized laser that has been switched on suddenly is studied. The second is for an open system coupled to an external reservoir of phonons. While for the former, the Hall conductance is far from the quantized limit, for the latter, coupling to a sufficiently <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>reservoir</b> of phonons is found to produce effective cooling, and thus an approach to the quantum limit, provided the frequency of the laser is large as compared to the band-width. For laser frequencies comparable to the band-width, strong deviations from the quantum limit of conductance is found even for a very <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>reservoir,</b> with the precise value of the Hall conductance determined by a competition between reservoir induced cooling and the excitation of photo-carriers by the laser.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that two {{geophysical}} quantities have comparable values. First, Earth’s total negative entropy flux integrated over geological time and, second, its extensive Bekenstein entropy bound, which follows if entropy is an extensive function of volume and energy. The similarity between both numbers suggests that the formation of young, i. e. non-primordial, planetary mass black holes may not be impossible. Planet Earth is an open thermodynamic system far from equilibrium. Its global thermodynamic state is to a large part determined by incoming solar energy and by a negative flux of radiation entropy, socalled exergy.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between wear and the generation of entropy in dry sliding of metals. It is postulated that wear is related to irreversible entropy generation within the MAZ. We present a model, that treats the MAZ as a heat engine in the Carnot sense. The model assumes that the MAZ is a heat engine that transports heat from a high temperature reservoir, represented by the asperity contact layer, to a <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>reservoir,</b> represented by the sub-contact layer. Consequently an entropy generation source that represents the irreversibilities within the MAZ is defined and a study of the entropy generation is attempted. Wear data, published elsewhere, of two materials, Oxygen Free High conductivity Copper, and Commercially Pure Titanium are analyzed using the developed model. It is found that wear for both materials is correlated to entropy generation, and to the entropy flow within the MAZ. Interestingly, moreover, in view of the contrasting wear trends of the test materials, the relationship of the mass wear rate and the specific wear rate of each material with respect to entropy generation are totally opposite to each other. A common feature between the behavior of the two materials, was found in wear behavior with respect to a so called Ratio of Residual Entropy. This ratio determines wether the system is over or under supplied with entropy. It is found that when the capacity to transport entropy exceeds the entropy supply the mass wear rate increases, and when the entropy transport capacity of the system is exceeded and entropy generation takes place the mass wear rate decreases. This is attributed to the re-establishment of equilibrium within the system. Comment: paper Presented in Leeds-Lyon Symposium on Tribology, Lyon 200...|$|E
40|$|Graphene, a {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) honeycomb structure allotrope of carbon atoms, {{has a long}} history since the invention of the pencil [Petroski (1989) ] and the linear dispersion band structure proposed by Wallace [Wal]; however, only after Novoselov et al. successively isolated graphene from graphite [Novoselov et al. (2004) ], it has been studied intensively during the recent years. It draws so much attentions not only because of its potential application in future electronic devices but also because of its fundamental properties: its quasiparticles are governed by the two-dimensional Dirac equation, and exhibit a variety of phenomena such as the anomalous integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) [Novoselov et al. (2005) ] measured experimentally, a minimal conductivity at vanishing carrier concentration [Neto et al. (2009) ], Kondo effect with magnetic element doping [Hentschel and Guinea (2007) ], Klein tunneling in p-n junctions [Cheianov and Fal’ko (2006), Beenakker (2008) ], Zitterbewegung [Katsnelson (2006) ], and Schwinger pair production [Schwinger (1951); Dora and Moessner (2010) ]. Although both electron-phonon coupling and photoconductivity in graphene also draws great attention [Yan et al. (2007); Satou et al. (2008); Hwang and Sarma (2008); Vasko and Ryzhii (2008); Mishchenko (2009) ], the nonequilibrium behavior based on the combination of electronphonon coupling and Schwinger pair production is an intrinsic graphene property that has not been investigated. Our motivation for studying clean graphene at low temperature is based on the following effect: for a fixed electric field, below a sufficiently low temperature linear eletric transport breaks down and nonlinear transport dominates. The criteria of the strength of this field [Fritz et al. (2008) ] is eE = T 2 /~vF (1. 1) For T >√eE~vF the system is in linear transport regime while for T <√eE~vF the system is in nonlinear transport regime. From the scaling’s point of view, at the nonlinear transport regime the temperature T and electric field E are also related. In this thesis we show that the nontrivial electron distribution function can be associated with an effective temperature T∗ which exhibits a dependence on electric field E and electron-phonon coupling g: T∗ ∝ E 1 / 4 g(1. 2) The anamolous exponent 1 / 4 may obtained from scaling. Meanwhile, yet we cannot obtain the distribution function, however, argument based on scaling gives us the current dependence on electric field: J ∝√Eg 2 (1. 3) which is a very different result compared with the results in which electrons do not experience scattering. This result provides us with important insighht into the correct nonequilibrium distribution function because now we know what the electric field dependence of current must be. Due to the applied field, the electronic system produces heat which prevents us from reaching a steady state. In order to remove Joule heat, we imagine that we have a graphene flake attached to a semiconductor substrate. Joule heat either transport to its environment or to the substrate as shown in 1. 1. The red lines represent heat current flowing from high temperature sample to the <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>reservoir.</b> However, for a very large system, the temperature gradient is 0 in the plane so heat cannot be conducted outside in the horizontal direction, while the energy gap in semiconductor also forbids electron current from flowing into the substrate. But for phonon thermal current, the temperature gradient is large in the vertical direction, so heat can be transported into the substrate via phonons. There are two possible channels of phonon degrees of freedom, acoustic phonon and optical phonon. As we can see from Fig. 1. 2 [Kusminskiy et al. (2009) ], since the optical phonon excitation energy is too large for a low temperature system, it is note likely to be excited by the nonlinear electric field, so the possible way left is by electron-acoustic phonon scattering. Here acoustic phonon acts as a heat bath to absorb the Joule heat created by pair production process. Hence the scattering process is determined by electron-acoustic phonon interaction which will be introduced in section 3. 3...|$|E

Samples from a <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> oil <b>reservoir</b> in Nigeria were analyzed using DNA pyrotag sequencing. The microbial community compositions of these samples revealed an abundance of anaerobic methanogenic archaea. Activity of methanogens was demonstrated by incubating samples anaerobically in a basal salts medium, in the presence of carbon steel and carbon dioxide. Methane formation was measured in all enrichments and correlated with metal weight loss. Methanogens were prominently represented in pipeline solids samples, scraped from the inside of a pipeline, comprising over 85 % of all pyrosequencing reads. Methane production was only witnessed when carbon steel beads were added to these pipeline solids samples, indicating that no methane was formed as a result of degradation of the oil organics present in these samples. These results were compared to those obtained for samples taken from a <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> oil field in Canada, which had been incubated with oil, either in the presence or in the absence of carbon steel. Again, methanogens present in these samples catalyzed methane production only when carbon steel was present.

From these studies it appears that carbon steel, not oil organics, was the predominant electron donor for acetate production and methane formation in these <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> oil fields, indicating that the methanogens and acetogens found may contribute significantly to MIC...|$|R

Two test cases are investigated, modelled after the <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> geothermal fields of Middenmeer in The Netherlands and Soultz-sous-Forêts in France. Resulting produced thermal water temperature and thermal energy flow rate profiles are simulated with and without consideration of the geothermal system. A resolution of 200 × 200 equidistant structured cells is applied to cover an integrated (reservoir and surrounding) domain that extends 2 km vertically and 10 km horizontally. The reservoir domain extends 200 m vertically and 1 km horizontally, covered by a computational grid resolution of 20 × 20. Sensitivity analysis show that this is the best resolution that can be applied without losing simulator stability and accuracy. Results show that the conductive heat transfer recharge originating from the surrounding geothermal system has a significant effect on reservoir lifetime by reducing temperatures after thermal drawdown up to 26. 5 % in the first test case and up to % 22. 6 in the second test case.

40|$|For {{sufficiently}} <b>low</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>temperatures,</b> it {{is known}} that open quantum systems subject to decoherent interactions with the reservoir relax towards their ground state in the weak coupling limit. Within the framework of quantum master equations, this is formalized by the Born-Markov-secular (BMS) approximation, where one obtains the system Gibbs state with the <b>reservoir</b> <b>temperature</b> as a stationary state. When the solution to some problem is encoded in the (isolated) ground state of a system Hamiltonian, decoherence can therefore be exploited for computation. The computational complexity is then given by the scaling of the relaxation time with the system size $n$. We study the relaxation behavior for local and non-local Hamiltonians that are coupled dissipatively with local and non-local operators to a bosonic bath in thermal equilibrium. We find that relaxation is generally more efficient when coherences of the density matrix in the system energy eigenbasis are taken into account. In addition, the relaxation speed strongly depends on the matrix elements of the coupling operators between initial state and ground state. We show that Dicke superradiance is a special case of our relaxation models and can thus be understood as a coherence-assisted relaxation speedup.

40|$|It {{is known}} [2, 5 et al] that biodegraded oils occur at shallow depths with <b>low</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>temperatures</b> (not {{exceeding}} 70 oC). In West Siberia such parameters typify, mainly, Cretaceous rocks (Aptian- Albian- Cenomanian and Berriasian- Hauterivian) [3]. With this work {{a collection of}} oils have been studied, confined to Cretaceous reservoirs in West Siberia. Sampling depths vary from 1270 to 3600 m, and <b>reservoir</b> <b>temperatures</b> vary from 40 oC to 120 oC. A comparative analysis is given on oils physical and chemical content composition, {{as well as on}} content composition of C 5 -C 8 low-boiling HC, n-alkanes C 10 +, a-cyclic isoprenoids, steranes and terpanes. To determine HC composition of oils, gas-liquid chromatography and chromato-mass-spectrometry methods were applied. The comparative analysis of the obtained analytical data shows that biodegraded oils from West Siberia are characterized by higher density (900 kg/m 3 and more), compared to non-maturated oils, and their HC composition is quite specific. By C 5 – C 8 HC group content composition biodegraded oils are distinguished by the lowest abundance of alkanes (not more than 55 per fraction), and C 5 –C 8 n-alkanes versus C 5 – C 8 i-alkanes ratio does not exceed 0. 15.

The possibility of increasing the efficiency of hydrodynamic influence on the reservoir in {{the conditions of the}} fields of the southwest Yakutia due to the use of displacing compounds on the water-soluble polymer base is established experimentally. At present more then 60 % of the recoverable oil reserves belong to the category of reserves, which are difficult for extraction. Oil reserves in such fields, with the acceptable technical and economic factors, can be developed only under the condition of using the physico-chemical methods of the influence on the oil reservoir [1]. Thereupon, the choice of the most efficient technological scheme of such influence, directed at the maximum reduction of the residual oil reserves, is of a particular urgency.
