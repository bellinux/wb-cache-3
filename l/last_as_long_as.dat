5|$|After {{one season}} in the Third Division South and {{eighteen}} in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, Palace's stay in the division was to <b>last</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, {{it was a difficult}} division to be promoted from, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Division Three South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth. Palace finished runners-up no less than three times, and when the 1939–40 season ended, Palace were sitting fourth. Unfortunately the season was only four matches old, cancelled with the onset of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{eight to}} nine months, {{following}} which a single calf or twins (even triplets at times) are born. In a 2004 {{study in the}} Sariska reserve, twins accounted for as high as 80 {{percent of the total}} calf population. Births peak from June to October in the Bharatpur National Park, and from April to August in southern Texas. Calves are precocial; they are able to stand within 40 minutes of birth, and forage by the fourth week. Pregnant females isolate themselves before giving birth. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves are kept in hiding for the first few weeks of their lives. This period of concealment can <b>last</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> a month in Texas. Calves, mainly males, bicker playfully by neck-fighting. Young males would leave their mothers at ten months to join bachelor groups. The lifespan of the nilgai is typically ten years in Texas.|$|E

5|$|The Northern Celestial Masters {{followed}} certain regular, communal rites. One {{of these}} communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could <b>last</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had {{to abstain from}} eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, leeks and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations {{as well as the}} burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears and raising the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by waving her tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may <b>last</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may {{then move on to}} mate with another female.|$|E
5|$|For otariids {{and some}} phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups {{for a few}} days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These {{foraging}} trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, the pups will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the Galápagos fur seal it can <b>last</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are weaned.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of {{the withdrawal of the}} British blockade, Emperor Napoleon ordered two squadrons to put to sea with orders to raid the British trade routes that crossed the Atlantic. These forces were to inflict as much economic damage to Britain as possible without engaging an equivalent British naval squadron and risking defeat and capture. The cruise was expected to <b>last</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> 14 months, sustained by captured food supplies from British merchant ships. Sailing unopposed on 13 December 1805, the squadrons separated two days later in pursuit of British merchant convoys, one squadron steering for the South Atlantic under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez and the other, under Vice-Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues, sailing for the Caribbean. The Admiralty in London did not discover that the French had sailed until 24 December, and the two squadrons they prepared in pursuit, under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, did not sail until January 1806, by which time the French had disappeared into the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The stay in Paris {{required}} a temporary {{discharge from the}} army, which Quisling slowly grew to understand was permanent: army cutbacks meant {{that there would be}} no position available for him when he returned. Quisling devoted much of his time in the French capital to study, reading works of political theory and working on his philosophical project, which he called Universism. On 2 October 1923, he persuaded the Oslo daily newspaper Tidens Tegn to publish an article he had written calling for diplomatic recognition of the Soviet government. Quisling's stay in Paris did not <b>last</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> planned, and in late 1923 he started work on Nansen's new repatriation project in the Balkans, arriving in Sofia in November. He spent the next two months travelling constantly with his wife Maria. In January she returned to Paris to look after Asja, who took on the role of the couple's foster-daughter; Quisling joined them in February.|$|E
5|$|Ganteaume {{selected}} 11 {{ships of}} the line for the operation, including the 120-gun first rate Impérial, flagship of Vice Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues, who was to sail to the Caribbean with four other ships {{of the line}}, two frigates and a corvette. His squadron carried over 1,000 French soldiers to augment the garrison on Santo Domingo under General Jean-Louis Ferrand, and was then required to spend two months blockading Jamaica before cruising along the American Eastern Seaboard to Newfoundland, returning to France when food supplies ran low. The other squadron was given to Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez in Foudroyant, with orders to cruise the shipping lanes of the South Atlantic before sailing to the Leeward Islands, communicating with the French colonies of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Cayenne and blockading Barbados. When British opposition became too strong, he was {{to return to the}} South Atlantic off Saint Helena, also returning to France once food supplies ran low. His squadron consisted of six ships of the line, two frigates and two brigs, and included among its captains Jérôme Bonaparte, the Emperor's younger brother. Although both squadrons carried six months provisions, they were expected to capture more during their voyages and it was intended that their raiding operations should <b>last</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> 14 months, causing severe indirect damage to the British economy by restricting the movement of trade.|$|E
