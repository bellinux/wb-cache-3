5|$|As Miraz and {{his army}} arrive at Aslan's How, Caspian {{suggests}} Peter and Miraz duel to the death, with the loser's army to surrender, {{to buy time}} for <b>Lucy</b> <b>and</b> Susan to find Aslan.

Peter defeats Miraz, and gives Caspian his sword to finish him off, but Caspian spares Miraz's life. Sopespian kills Miraz with one of Susan's arrows and accuses the Narnians, leading to a battle, with the Telmarines gradually winning. Lucy finds Aslan in the woods and he awakens the trees, turning the battle in the Narnians' favor. Sopespian orders a retreat to a bridge, where they are confronted by <b>Lucy</b> <b>and</b> Aslan. Aslan summons the river god, who destroys the bridge, killing many of the soldiers, swallowing Sopespian and winning the battle.|$|E
5|$|During Paramount ownership, {{the theatre}} {{was known as}} Paramount Theatre. Eventually, the Paramount Theatre stage was {{converted}} to an artificial ice surface, and renamed Wonderland Theatre. Two ice shows were presented, titled Endless Summer on Ice (2007–2009) and Snoopy Rocks! on Ice (2010–2011). The first production included Scooby-Doo and outfits like s'mores, while Snoopy, Charlie Brown, <b>Lucy</b> <b>and</b> Linus appeared in sequences of the latter. The show appeared at various other former Paramount Parks, and in each situation, the sequenced did vary between the Scooby-anchored and Peanuts-anchored productions.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel {{taps into}} their {{connection}} and reveals {{that he has}} located McClane's estranged daughter, <b>Lucy,</b> <b>and</b> intends to kidnap her. McClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility, where Farrell discovers that Gabriel's men are downloading all the information. He manages to encrypt the data just in time before he is captured. Gabriel kidnaps Farrell and takes him as well as Lucy, who had been kidnapped earlier, with him as his team flees from Woodlawn. McClane pursues Gabriel, hijacking his semi and enlisting Warlock to trace Gabriel's vehicle. Gabriel accesses the communication system of a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II and, impersonating an air traffic controller, orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving. McClane barely escapes, then {{makes his way to}} a nearby warehouse where Warlock has tracked Gabriel. There, Gabriel is installing the remaining files and holding <b>Lucy</b> <b>and</b> Farrell. Although McClane kills most of Gabriel's remaining henchmen, Emerson shoots him in the right shoulder.|$|E

5|$|In both later {{works such}} as Caroline Mordaunt and her earlier evangelical texts, Sherwood participated in the Victorian project of {{prescribing}} gender roles; while her later works outlined ever more stringent and narrow roles for each sex, her early {{works such as}} The Fairchild Family suggested such demarcations as well: <b>Lucy</b> <b>and</b> Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin.|$|E

5|$|During a party, Marianne finds Willoughby, but {{he barely}} {{acknowledges}} their acquaintance. Marianne later learns {{that he is}} engaged to the wealthy Miss Grey and becomes inconsolable. Brandon calls on the Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced then abandoned his young ward, Eliza Williams, who has given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars (Jean Marsh) learns of Edward's engagement to <b>Lucy</b> <b>and</b> threatens to disinherit him unless he calls it off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying with Mrs. Jennings' daughter, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her home, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. He insists that he loved Marianne and would have married her, {{but he had to}} marry a rich woman because his aunt disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually falling in love with Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that <b>Lucy</b> <b>and</b> Edward have married. However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert (Leo Bill). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} five retablos (reredos). The central retablo (or retablo mayor) {{at the altar}} houses images of Saint Peter, the patron, paired with Saint Paul on the {{uppermost}} niche. On the lowest level are images of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a secondary patron, in the center. Also on the lowest level were statues of Saint Lucy, patron against typhoons and Saint Francis Xavier, patron against floods and alligators. Both Saint <b>Lucy</b> <b>and</b> Saint Francis were elected patrons in 1697. Behind {{the walls of the}} retablo mayor are the remains of the former Jesuit altarpiece, a bas-relief of Saint Ignatius Loyola and St Francis Xavier dressed as a pilgrim.|$|E
5|$|The {{work on the}} game's {{scenario}} {{was split}} between four writers.

5|$|Tibbets {{returned}} to Maxwell Air Force Base, where {{he attended the}} Air War College. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France. He left <b>Lucy</b> <b>and</b> his sons behind in Alabama, and he and Lucy divorced that year. During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He {{returned to}} the United States in February 1956 to command the 308th Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956. They had a son, James Tibbets.|$|E
5|$|When Edward {{found out}} about Harclay's treason, he issued an order for the earl's arrest. As Harclay {{attempted}} to garner support for his cause, the king began to fortify the northern castles. The stalemate lasted until 25 February, when Sir Anthony Lucy arrested the earl at Carlisle Castle. Lucy, who acted with only a small force, was clearly trusted by Harclay, so the arrest must have been conducted as a surprise manoeuvre. The enmity between <b>Lucy</b> <b>and</b> Harclay could stem from a dispute over the honour of Papcastle. In 1322, Harclay had also briefly disseised Lucy of his lands after the 1322 rebellion, even though Lucy had taken no part in that event.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 Dunford House was let. Catherine and {{her four}} younger daughters {{moved to a}} house in South Kensington—the eldest, Kate, had married in 1866. The ménage proved unsatisfactory; Ellen, Jane and Anne were now {{displaying}} considerable independence of spirit, and differences of opinion arose between mother and daughters. Catherine moved out, taking the youngest daughter <b>Lucy,</b> <b>and</b> went to Wales where she lived until her death in 1877. In South Kensington, Ellen, Jane and Anne, often joined by Kate, established a sisterhood determined both to preserve Richard Cobden's memory and works and to uphold his principles and radical causes by actions of their own. Together they stopped publication of a memoir of their father, sponsored by his former colleagues and compiled by a family friend, Julie Salis Schwabe. This caused some offence; Schwabe had given the family financial and emotional support after Richard's death. However, Jane in particular wanted a more substantial memorial, and secured the services of John Morley, whose biography of Richard Cobden was published in 1881.|$|E
