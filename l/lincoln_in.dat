5|$|The Keating Five scandal was {{prompted}} by the activities of one particular savings and loan: Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, California. Lincoln's chairman was Charles Keating, who ultimately served {{five years in prison}} for his corrupt mismanagement of <b>Lincoln.</b> <b>In</b> the four years after Keating's American Continental Corporation (ACC) had purchased <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> 1984, Lincoln's assets had increased from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was {{nominated}} to the see of <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> April 1123 and was consecrated bishop on 22 July 1123, {{at a ceremony}} held in Canterbury. He owed his appointment to his uncle's influence with King Henry I; the Peterborough version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle noted that Alexander's elevation to the episcopate was done entirely {{for the love of}} Roger.|$|E

Ngor and John Malkovich – for his performance Waterston received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination.

5|$|Lincoln rarely raised {{objections}} in the courtroom; {{but in an}} 1859 case, {{where he}} defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, {{who was accused of}} stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.|$|E
5|$|Though {{alarmed by}} the {{election}} of Abraham <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> the election of 1860, Hawes was an opponent of secession, supporting instead the idea of armed neutrality. In May 1861, Hawes, Breckinridge, and Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin represented the Southern Rights viewpoint at a convention to decide Kentucky's course in the Civil War. He attended another such convention in September 1861. Neither convention produced a conclusive decision.|$|E
5|$|Two American presidents {{had been}} assassinated in the 19th century—Abraham <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> 1865 and James A. Garfield in 1881.

When in his hometown, Canton, Ohio, he often walked to church or the business district without protection, and in Washington went on drives with his wife without any guard in the carriage.|$|E

5|$|A December 1988 audit by the FHLBB found <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> {{violation}} of many regulations and {{in danger of}} default. The following month they ordered Keating to stop transferring cash from Lincoln to American Continental, which imperiled the latter's survival strategy and caused its stock price to nosedive. Keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves failed and he lost $11 million in one month alone. Keating got Senators DeConcini and Cranston to pressure the regulators to let a sale go through, {{but this time the}} lawmakers were ignored.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln's service {{during the}} Black Hawk War {{has been a}} source of {{discrepancies}} and questioning, with two major battle sites being affiliated with <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of combat. A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the second battle, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at Kellogg's Grove to help bury the dead. One of the soldiers in the company was Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln assisted with the burial and later made a statement about the experience that has been connected with both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.|$|E
5|$|Alexander of Lincoln (died February 1148) was {{a medieval}} English Bishop of Lincoln, {{a member of}} an {{important}} administrative and ecclesiastical family. He was the nephew of Roger of Salisbury, a Bishop of Salisbury and Chancellor of England under King Henry I, and he was also related to Nigel, Bishop of Ely. Educated at Laon, Alexander served in his uncle's diocese as an archdeacon in the early 1120s. Unlike his relatives, he held no office in the government before his appointment as Bishop of <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> 1123. Alexander became a frequent visitor to King Henry's court after his elevation to the episcopate, often witnessing royal documents, and he served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire.|$|E

5|$|Another son, Albert Gallatin Edwards (1812–1892), was an {{assistant}} secretary of the U.S. Treasury under President Abraham <b>Lincoln.</b> <b>In</b> 1887 he founded the brokerage firm A. G. Edwards in Saint Louis, Missouri. A third son, Benjamin S. Edwards (1818–1886), established a successful law practice in Springfield, Illinois {{and served as a}} judge in Illinois' Thirteenth Circuit. Ninian Edwards' daughter, Julia Edwards Cook, married Congressman Daniel Pope Cook. Their son, John Pope Cook, was a mayor of Springfield and a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Day-Lewis played Abraham <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> Steven Spielberg's film Lincoln (2012). Based on {{the book}} , the film began {{shooting}} in Richmond, Virginia in October 2011. Day-Lewis {{spent a year in}} preparation for the role, a time he had requested from Spielberg. He read over 100 books on Lincoln, and long worked with the makeup artist to achieve a physical likeness to Lincoln. Lincoln received widespread critical acclaim, much of it directed to Day-Lewis's performance. It also became a commercial success, grossing over $275 million worldwide. In November 2012, Day-Lewis received the BAFTA Britannia Award for Excellence in Film.|$|E
5|$|During the 1860s, Parker {{continued}} {{both his}} {{legal and political}} careers. In 1864, he formally split from the Democratic Party over conflicting opinions on slavery. He ran as a Republican for county prosecutor of the Ninth Missouri Judicial District. By the fall of 1864, he was serving {{as a member of}} the Electoral College and voted for Abraham <b>Lincoln.</b> <b>In</b> 1868, Parker won a six-year term as judge of the Twelfth Missouri Circuit.|$|E

Dr. Silva explains to Fauxlivia {{that he wants}} to see through the end of his research, needing only one more human host for a final gestation cycle to birth the queen beetle from which the beetle species, and his cure, can be sustained. Fauxlivia feels pains in her body when Dr. Silva implies the last cycle has begun, believing herself to be the host.|$|E
5|$|Foster {{returned}} to <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> December, {{and a month}} later {{was told by the}} club that he was free to find another club after being deemed surplus to requirements at Sincil Bank. Shortly after, in January 2007, he mutually agreed to cancel his contract with Lincoln, enabling him to join Conference North side Stalybridge Celtic. He made his debut for Stalybridge in the FA Trophy, starting in a 1–1 draw against Kettering Town, scoring an own goal just before half-time. He scored his first goal for the club against one of his former employers, Alfreton, netting the winner in a 2–1 victory. He made six appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring once.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey was Archdeacon of <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> {{the diocese}} of Lincoln by September 1171, and {{probably}} retained that office until he was confirmed as bishop-elect in 1175. He also held a prebend, an income from land owned by a cathedral chapter, in {{the diocese of}} London, {{but there is little}} evidence that he executed the duties of either office. There are some indications that he studied canon law at a school in Northampton, and that he taught in Paris during the early 1170s. He also acted as a papal judge-delegate at that time. Pope Alexander III initially refused to confirm Geoffrey's selection as Bishop of <b>Lincoln</b> <b>in</b> about May 1173, prompting Geoffrey to travel to Rome in October 1174 to secure confirmation of this office. He was confirmed in the office of bishop by July 1175, but he was not ordained at that time, as he was under the canonical age for holding a bishopric. Geoffrey's youth was one of Alexander's objections to Geoffrey's election, and the pope only confirmed the office under duress. Another potential problem was Geoffrey's illegitimacy, which normally disbarred a person from holding ecclesiastical office, but that was dealt with by the granting of a papal dispensation.|$|E
