The approach we are proposing transforms multilabel problem into regression problem about numerical <b>labels</b> which can reflect the hidden <b>label</b> importance. In order to explore the numerical <b>label,</b> one way is to extend the <b>label</b> space to a Euclidean space by mining the hidden <b>label</b> importance from the training instances. Such process of transforming logical <b>labels</b> into numerical <b>labels</b> is called <b>Label</b> Enhancement. Besides, we give three assumptions for numerical <b>label</b> of multi-label instance in this paper. Based on this, we propose an effective multi-label learning framework called MLL-LE, i. e., Multi-Label Learning with <b>Label</b> Enhancement, which incorporates the regression loss and the three assumptions into a unified framework.

40|$|Abstract Background To compare {{reactions}} to warning <b>labels</b> presented on cigarette packages {{with a specific}} focus on whether the new Chinese warning <b>labels</b> are better than the old <b>labels</b> and international <b>labels.</b> Methods Participants aged 18 and over were recruited in two cities of Jiangsu Province in 2008, and 876 face-to-face interviews were completed. Participants were shown six types of warning <b>labels</b> found on cigarette packages. They comprised one old Chinese <b>label,</b> one new <b>label</b> used within the Chinese market, and one Chinese overseas <b>label</b> and three foreign brand <b>labels.</b> Participants were asked {{about the impact of}} the warning <b>labels</b> on: their knowledge of harm from smoking, giving cigarettes as a gift, and quitting smoking. Results Compared with the old Chinese <b>label,</b> a higher proportion of participants said the new <b>label</b> provided clear information on harm caused by smoking (31. 2 % vs 18. 3 %). Participants were less likely to give cigarettes with the new <b>label</b> on the package compared with the old <b>label</b> (25. 2 % vs 20. 8 %). These proportions were higher when compared to the international <b>labels.</b> Overall, 26. 8 % of participants would quit smoking based on information from the old <b>label</b> and 31. 5 % from the new <b>label.</b> When comparing the Chinese overseas <b>label</b> and other foreign <b>labels</b> to the new Chinese <b>label</b> with regard to providing knowledge of harm warning, impact of quitting smoking and giving cigarettes as a gift, the overseas <b>labels</b> were more effective.
