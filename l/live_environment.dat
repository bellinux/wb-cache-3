2500|$|Parker's {{decision}} to make the music for Tame Impala in the studio by himself {{is a result of}} Parker liking [...] "the kind of music that is the result of one person constructing an awesome symphony of sound. You can layer your own voice 700 times for half a second if you want, and I just love that kind of music." [...] However, Parker has to translate his music to a live setting with the band, and the band doesn't play the songs until they have been recorded. [...] "The only jamming that's done as a band is done a long time after the song is recorded {{for the sake of the}} <b>live</b> <b>environment.</b> It's good for us, because we can take a song that's been recorded and do what we want to it: slow it down, speed it up, make it 10 seconds or 10 minutes long. It gives us a lot of freedom." ...|$|E
2500|$|Live {{images are}} the typical way for users {{to assess and}} {{subsequently}} install Ubuntu. These can be downloaded as a disk image (.iso) and subsequently burnt to a DVD and booted, or run via UNetbootin directly from a USB drive (making, respectively, a live DVD or live USB medium). Running Ubuntu {{in this way is}} typically slower than running it from a hard drive, but does not alter the computer unless specifically instructed by the user. If the user chooses to boot the live image rather than execute an installer at boot time, there is still the option to then use an installer called Ubiquity to install Ubuntu once booted into the <b>live</b> <b>environment.</b> Disk images of all current and past versions are available for download at the Ubuntu web site. Various third-party programs such as remastersys and Reconstructor are available to create customized copies of the Ubuntu Live DVDs (or CDs). [...] "Minimal CDs" [...] are available (for server use) that fit on a CD.|$|E
2500|$|The latter-day line-up of The Byrds, {{featuring}} McGuinn, White, Parsons, and Battin, {{was regarded}} by critics and audiences as being much more accomplished in concert than previous configurations of The Byrds had been. This being the case, it {{made perfect sense}} to capture the band's sound in a <b>live</b> <b>environment</b> and so, in February and March 1970, two consecutive New York concert appearances were recorded. The first of these was the band's performance at Queens College's Colden Center Auditorium on February 28, 1970, with the second being their performance at the Felt Forum on March 1, 1970. (Untitled) featured recordings from both of these concerts, spliced together {{to give the impression}} of a single continuous performance. Of the seven live tracks featured on the album, [...] "So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star", [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", [...] "Mr. Spaceman", and [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] were drawn from the Queens College performance, while [...] "Lover of the Bayou", [...] "Positively 4th Street", and [...] "Nashville West" [...] originated from the Felt Forum show. The appearance on the live LP of the band's earlier hit singles [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", [...] "So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star", and [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] had the effect of forging a spiritual and musical link between The Byrds' current line-up and the original mid-1960s incarnation of the band.|$|E

Most importantly, LVC used as a verb is an integrated interaction of the three environments with the <b>Live</b> <b>environment</b> always present. For example, a Simulator Construct VC event should be called something other than LVC (such as Distributed Mission Operations (DMO)). In the absence of the <b>Live</b> <b>environment</b> LVC and LC do not exist, making the use of the LVC term wholly inappropriate as a descriptor.|$|E
