However, inventorship can be relevant to patentability in Europe, although in only a limited way. Where a disclosure is made within 6 months preceding the filing date of a European patent application, the disclosure is not taken into consideration if it was due to, or in consequence of, an evident abuse {{in relation to the}} applicant or his <b>legal</b> <b>predecessor.</b> Thus the identity of the inventor (who is often the applicant, or his <b>legal</b> <b>predecessor)</b> can be of vital importance.|$|E

2500|$|Two <b>legal</b> <b>predecessors</b> {{directly}} influenced Bracton. The {{first was}} Martin de Pateshull, one of John of England's clerks, who became {{justice of the}} bench in 1217, and in 1224 {{was one of the}} itinerant justices whom Falkes de Breauté attacked. Bracton esteemed Pateshull highly, and remarked, [...] "In any list of regular justices, Pateshull's name so constantly precedes all others that he must have enjoyed some pre-eminence, though perhaps not of a definitive kind." [...] Pateshull was archdeacon of Norwich Cathedral and dean of St. Paul's Cathedral. His capacity for hard work was such that a brother justice asked Hubert de Burgh to excuse him from going on circuit with Pateshull on the ground that he wore out his colleagues by his incessant activity. Of his abilities as a lawyer, Bracton's appreciative citations speak eloquently. He appears to have gained his reputation as a lawyer, pure and simple. He died in 1229.|$|R

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the impacts of}} real estate transactions without recording of the ownership in the land title-registration. It is {{based on interviews with}} six different real estate companies in the Oslo region. The consequence of lacking registration of ownership is that the real owner will run the risk of loosing legal protection against the creditors of <b>legal</b> bankrupt <b>predecessors.</b> There are still several companies who manipulate the judical registration system, because there are strong economic incentives to do so. However, companies as tools for real estate transactions tend to include newer and legal mechanism for reducing costs and taxes relating to property rights’ transfer. This will probably result in less manipulation over time...|$|R
