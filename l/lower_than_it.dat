5|$|The {{intervention}} in May 2000 {{was the first}} major deployment of British forces to Sierra Leone during the civil war, but {{was not the first time}} British personnel had served there. In May 1997, a two-man training team from the British Army was sent to train SLA officers but discovered that the SLA's strength was much <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had reported. The government was overthrown in a coup before any training could take place. Following the restoration of the elected government by the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in February 1998, HMS Cornwall sailed to Freetown with food and medical supplies. Her crew assisted with infrastructure repairs and her helicopter was used to move people and supplies around Sierra Leone until she left in mid-April. As the security situation in Sierra Leone deteriorated later in the year, the Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted a non-combatant evacuation operation under the codename Operation Spartic over Christmas 1998. Approximately 80 people—predominantly British citizens, many of them staff or dependants from the British High Commission—were evacuated over two days.|$|E

Still, when Napoleon arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> was at the height of Mamluk—and Cairene—influence in the mid-14th century.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to score music for the whistle using {{standard}} musical notation. The tin whistle is not a transposing instrument - for example, music for the D tin whistle is written in concert pitch, not transposed down a tone as would be normal for transposing instruments. Nevertheless, {{there is no real}} consensus on how tin whistle music should be written, or on how reading music onto the whistle should be taught. However, when music is scored for a soprano whistle it will be written an octave <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> sounds, to spare ledger lines and make it much easier to read.|$|E

25|$|Advocates of neo-liberal {{economics}} {{argue that}} while import substitution policies might create {{jobs in the}} short run, as domestic producers replace foreign producers, neoliberal theory believes {{that in the long}} run output and growth will be <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> would otherwise have been. This is because import substitution denies the country the benefits to be gained from specialisation and foreign imports. The theory of comparative advantage shows how countries will gain from trade. Moreover, protectionism leads to dynamic inefficiency: Domestic producers have no incentive from foreign competitors to reduce costs or improve products. Import substitution can impede growth through poor allocation of resources, and its effect on exchange rates harms exports.|$|E
25|$|Producers {{reduced their}} {{expenditures}} on durable goods, and inventories declined, but personal income was only 15% <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> {{had been at}} the peak in 1937. As unemployment rose, consumers' expenditures declined, leading to further cutbacks in production. By May 1938 retail sales began to increase, employment improved, and industrial production turned up after June 1938. After the recovery from the Recession of 1937–38, conservatives were able to form a bipartisan conservative coalition to stop further expansion of the New Deal and, when unemployment dropped to 2% in the early 1940s, they abolished WPA, CCC and the PWA relief programs. Social Security remained in place.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the overall}} decline of KRON as an independent, its newscasts {{initially}} pulled in respectable ratings though viewership was <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> {{was before the}} station lost its NBC affiliation. During the February 2004 sweeps period, the station placed second in the ratings behind KTVU. However, KRON's news viewership has gradually fallen since that point; also in 2004, the station posted an 8.7% market share, down from the 21% share it had as an NBC affiliate. The 9 p.m. newscast created after becoming independent eventually fell to fourth place by 2005. In March 2006, KRON's morning newscast posted an average viewership of approximately 28,000 viewers. By 2009, overall viewership for the station's newscasts had fallen to fifth place among the Bay Area's news-producing English-language television stations.|$|E

25|$|Temperature: Bonsai {{roots in}} pots {{are exposed to}} much greater {{variation}} in temperature than tree roots deep in the soil. For bonsai from native species, local temperatures do not generally harm the tree. But for bonsai from warmer native climates, the grower can {{increase the likelihood of}} successful cultivation either by insulating the tree from local winter conditions, or by actively increasing the bonsai temperature during the cold season. For trees from climates slightly warmer than the local one, bonsai pots can be partially buried in the ground and can be covered with an insulating layer of mulch. For trees from significantly warmer climates, warmer temperatures can be maintained in a cold frame or greenhouse, so that a relatively tender tree is not exposed to temperatures <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> can bear. This approach may also artificially extend the bonsai's growing season, affecting watering and fertilization schedules.|$|E
25|$|Fife left {{medical school}} and was {{commissioned}} Second Lieutenant in U.S. Army in June 1939. Fife then reported to the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis, Washington for training in Aug 1940. After receiving his basic infantry training, he reported to the 60th Infantry at Fort Bragg in North Carolina where he served as an Assistant Operations Officer in September 1940. Fife volunteered for the 18th class of Parachute Jump School in Fort Benning, Georgia in April 1942. Following his training in May 1942, he joined the newly formed 503rd parachute infantry battalion as Company Commander. As Company Commanding Officer of the 503rd parachute infantry regiment in Sept 1943, Fife led his company in a jump in the Markham Valley, New Guinea. This was the first successful airborne combat jump in the Pacific Theater of Operations. His first combat jump was planned with the ground elevation 500 feet <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> actually was and Fife {{found himself in a}} coconut tree. Fife had completed 35 training and combat jumps by the time WWII ended.|$|E
25|$|Parker and Stone {{continue}} to write, direct, and voice most characters on South Park. Over time, {{the show has}} adopted a unique production process, in which an entire episode is written, animated and broadcast in one week. Parker and Stone state that subjecting themselves to a one-week deadline creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a funnier show. Although initial reviews for the show were negative in reference to its crass humor, the series has received numerous accolades, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, and numerous inclusions in various publications' lists of greatest television shows. Though its viewership is <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> was {{at the height of}} its popularity in its earliest seasons, South Park remains one of the highest-rated series on Comedy Central. In 2012, South Park cut back from producing 14 episodes per year (seven in the spring and seven in the fall) to a single run of 10 episodes in the fall, to allow the duo to explore other projects the rest of the year. The show is currently renewed through 2019, when it will reach its twenty-third season.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the Institute for Energy Research {{commissioned}} the Danish think-tank CEPOS (Centre for Political Studies) {{to report on}} electricity exports from Denmark and {{the economic impact of}} the Danish wind industry. This heavily criticized report states that Danes pay the highest residential electricity rates in the European Union (mostly for government revenue, but partly to subsidize wind power), and that the cost of saving a ton of carbon dioxide between 2001 and 2008 has averaged 647 DKK (€87, US$124). It also estimated that 90% of wind industry jobs were transferred from other technology industries, and states that as a result Danish GDP is 1.8billion DKK (US$270million) <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> would have been without wind industry subsidies of 1.7-2.6 billion DKK (roughly $320M - $480M) yearly in 2001-2005. The report was later heavily criticised. Firstly Danish engineering magazine Ingeniøren claimed that the report was ordered and paid for by the American oil and coal lobby through IER. Later, several Danish researchers and professors from all technical universities in Denmark, wrote a joint response to the report, refuting it. The report from CEPOS was even brought to Government level, where minister of Climate and Energy Lykke Friis discredited the work done by CEPOS and the report. The World Nuclear Association estimates that the report was IER's response to US president Obama's 2009 Earth Day speech in Newton, Iowa claiming that USA could generate 20% of its electricity from wind by 2030, as Denmark already was.|$|E
