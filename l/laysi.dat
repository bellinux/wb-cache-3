40|$|Conventional {{wisdom and}} {{a wealth of}} {{research}} suggest that effective networks are an important key to career success. Yet, {{why do so many}} people struggle to build and maintain professional relationships? In this dissertation I argue that, rather than not knowing how to network, most people feel conflicted about the idea of networking. The present research applies a motivational framework to networking. Building on the idea of lay theories in motivational psychology, this dissertation investigates how lay theories of social intelligence influence networking engagement. Hereby, I distinguish between fixed (social intelligence is inborn and static) and growth (social intelligence can be nurtured and developed) theories of social intelligence and develop a new Lay Theories of Social Intelligence (<b>LaySI)</b> scale. Results show that <b>LaySI</b> is a distinct construct and predicts engagement in networking above and beyond the effects of personality traits. Using multiple methodologies, including experiments and field studies, this dissertation shows that people holding fixed theories not only feel less engaged, but also are less likely to create new relationships and seek fewer opportunities to network. Tracing the mechanism for reduced engagement, this dissertation identifies two mediators by which fixed theories inhibit networking engagement: people’s attitudes toward networking as immoral and futile endeavor. Important for professionals, the present research shows that lay theories can be updated by providing new information to promote networking engagement, even among seasoned executives. By examining what people actually believe or feel about professional networking, the present research contributes to a more complete understanding of the motivational psychology of networking. Similarly, this dissertation enriches and extends traditional networks literature by demonstrating how cognitive antecedents influence the formation of relationships...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{preparation}} of high temperature ceramics simultaneously containing silicon, nitrogen and carbon has only relatively recently become {{an area of}} interest for inorganic crystal chemists, and the recent discovery of {{a new series of}} carbonitrides with the general formula MM’Si 4 N 6 C is of interest because of the good high temperature properties they appear to display. On the one hand, M and M ’ can be the same trivalent metal- either rare earth or yttrium; in this case, the resulting compounds display orthorhombic (pseudo-hexagonal) structures. Alternatively the metals may be a mix of di- (Ca,Sr, Ba) and tri-valent (Y,Ln) cations, in which case the carbon is replaced by nitrogen, and the overall symmetry is hexagonal. Other quaternary nitrides of a similar type can be produced if the two metal cations remain trivalent and one of the silicon atoms is replaced by aluminium. The present study describes the {{preparation of}} powder samples of Y 2 Si 4 N 6 C and <b>LaYSi</b> 4 N 6 C starting from YH 2, La, Si 3 N 4 and carbon precursors, and summarises attempts to achieve a dense product by hot-pressing at 1700 - 1800 o C. Some preliminary mechanical property measurements are included...|$|E
