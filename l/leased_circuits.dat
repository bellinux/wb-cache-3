5000|$|In 1975, MCI began {{experimenting with}} {{offering}} switched voice telecommunications in direct competition with AT&T. Until then MCI sold point-to-point voice and data services using their microwave relay backbone.

One early customer was CNA Insurance in Chicago, served by one of the two Collins systems located at MCI's facilities on the 21st floor of Chicago's John Hancock building. The second Collins switch was located at MCI facilities in New York City and sold voice services to a variety of customers including RCA Global Communications under MCI's [...] "Execunet" [...] service banner. The experiment proved successful and a third switch was purchased from Danray Corporation (later purchased by Northern Telecommunications, now Nortel) and installed in the MCI Chicago facility alongside the Collins system. When GE later bought RCA and broke it up MCI purchased the RCA Global Communications division. Many more Danray switches were purchased and deployed at strategic points of their service area to become the first viable competitor to AT&T's long-distance voice services for businesses.|$|E
