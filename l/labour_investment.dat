40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} High Performance Works Systems (HPWS) on firm labour productivity and innovation. Considerable studies have proved that investment in HPWS is associated with superior organizational performance (Huselid, 1995; Authur, 1994; Delery and Doty, 1996; Guthrie, 2001). However, {{there is still no}} agreement on whether High Performance Work Systems are universally applicable or contingent on certain circumstances. This thesis contributes to the universal versus contingency debate by testing the moderating effect of contextual factors on these relationships. Following a theoretical review of HPWS literature, a conceptual framework was developed which introduced moderator variables to explain the HPWS-performance link. This was guided by contingency theory and empirical work related to environmental fit (Burns & Stalker, 1994; Youndt et al., 1996). Industry growth and industry dynamism were chosen as industry level moderators while <b>labour</b> <b>investment</b> represents a firm level moderator. The data used in this study was collected from a national general manager and HR manager survey which was conducted in 2006. A sample of 132 matched responses from both GM and HR managers were used in the analysis. The results show that the implementation of HPWS is associated with an increase in both labour productivity and innovation. Further analysis was conducted to test the moderating effect between HPWS and a number of contextual factors including industry characteristics and organisational characteristics on firms‟ labour productivity and innovation. Regression results show that industry level characteristics have a moderating effect on the HRM-performance link: industry growth moderates the relationship between HPWS and innovation but has no significant moderating effect on HPWS-labour productivity relationship. Industry dynamism was found to have a moderating effect on the relationship between HPWS and labour productivity but no significant interaction effect was found on innovation. At the firm level, results show that firms‟ <b>labour</b> <b>investment</b> moderates the relationship between HPWS and labour productivity. Similarly an effect was found on the relationship between HPWS and workforce innovation.

The legumes were velvet bean, pigeonpea, soyabean, groundnut, bunch-type cowpea and Bambara groundnut. Twelve farmers hosted the experiments and each farmer formed a group of at least 4 other farmers to evaluate the legumes. Farmer participatory monitoring and evaluation of the legume and P combinations was conducted during the experiment to determine farmer preferences and acceptance of the technology. Measured grain yields, returns to labour and total costs of the P-fertilized legumes were compared with those for the unfertilized legumes. The application of P fertilizer significantly (P = 0. 05) increased legume grain yields, particularly with velvet bean, and soyabean.

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the factors {{influencing}} the ability of firms to compete in globalised markets. The Austrian and evolutionary economics and the endogeneous growth literature highlight the role of innovation activities in enabling firms to compete more effectively - and expand their market share. On {{the basis of these}} theories, and using a large panel of firms from several Central and East European Countries (CEECs), this paper attempts to identify the factors and forces which determine the ability of firms to compete in conditions of transition. The competitiveness of firms, measured by their market share, is postulated to depend on indicators of firms' innovation behaviour such as improvements in cost-efficiency, labour productivity and investment in new machinery and equipment as well as characteristics of firms and their environment such as location, experience, technological intensity of their industries and the intensity of competition. To control for the dynamic nature of competitiveness and the potential endogeneity of its determinants, and to distinguish between short and long run effects of firm behaviour, a dynamic panel methodology is employed. The results indicate that the competitiveness of firms in transition economies is enhanced with improvements in their cost efficiency, productivity of <b>labour,</b> <b>investment</b> and their previous business experience while stronger competition has a negative impact on it. competitiveness, restructuring, transition economies, market share, dynamic panel analysis...|$|E
40|$|The Chinese {{economy has}} {{entered a new}} phase of {{development}} in which sources of growth {{are not so much}} dependent upon pure increases in <b>labour,</b> <b>investment</b> and credit expansion, but from productivity improvement, structural changes, technological progress and the benefits from improvement of the social security and welfare improvement. When market functions are fully established to become a main channel for allocating resources, the entrepreneurship will flourish engaging in more innovative activities, workers will move more freely and have more incentives to improve their skills, firms will become more productive through market entry and exit, the economic structure will become more balanced because of the improved resource allocation, and in the end, growth will become more spontaneous and sustainable. In this sense, reforms could deliver ‘dividend’ by raising China’s potential economic growth rates. For China to confront all the challenges it faces at present, the reforms undertaken now have to be deep, comprehensive and far-reaching in order to succeed in paving the way for China to complete the task of transformation in the long-term.

40|$|Growth {{control of}} container-grown hardy nursery stock {{generally}} requires substantial <b>labour</b> <b>investment.</b> Therefore {{the possibility of}} alternative growth control using deficit irrigation is appealing. Increasing water costs and limited availability of abstraction licences have added further incentives for nursery stock producers to use deficit irrigation. There are still, however, concerns that inherent nonuniformity of water uptake under commonly used overhead irrigation, and differing irrigation requirements of diverse crops and substrates, may limit the commercial relevance of a protocol developed for single crops growing in 100 % peat and irrigated with a high precision drip system. The aim {{of this research was}} to determine whether growth control of hardy nursery stock is possible using deficit irrigation applied with conventional overhead irrigation. Over two years, crop growth under an overhead irrigation system was compared under full irrigation and two severities of deficit irrigation. Initially, two crops of contrasting canopy structure i. e. Cornus alba and Lonicera periclymenum were grown. In a subsequent experiment one crop (Forsythia × intermedia) was grown in two substrates with contrasting quantities of peat (60 and 100 %). Deficit irrigation was found to be highly effective in controlling vegetative growth when applied using overhead irrigation - with similar results as when drip irrigation was used. This comparable response suggests that deficit irrigation can be applied without precision drip irrigation. Scheduling two very different crops with respect to their water use and uptake potential, however, highlighted challenges with respect to application of appropriate deficits for very different crops under one system; responses to deficit irrigation will be more consistent where nursery management allows for scheduling of crops with very different architecture and water use under different regimes. The effectiveness of deficit irrigation in controlling the growth of Forsythia was similar when a reduced peat based substrate was compared with pure peat; additionally, flowering was enhanced...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{roles and}} {{responsibilities}} {{of men and women}} in east African smallholder pig-raising households and the entitlements each can claim from pig-enterprise income are unknown. The article is a qualitative genderand- household-head-disaggregated exploration of Ugandan smallholder pig farmers’ perceptions. Asset ownership, control, and access; division of labour; and decision-making related to pig rearing and pig-enterprise income are presented in the context of the potential impact of adopting improved diets for pigs (a productivity improvement). Results: Potential benefits of improved diet adoption included faster pig growth; increased farmer income and pig population; new on-farm employment and produce market opportunities; and improved pig market opportunities and family- and community-level well-being. Contradictory views about the potential impact of diet adoption on labour requirements and feed costs, and the inclusion of seasonal, home-grown ingredients were expressed. Concerns about people and pigs competing for food and personal safety were also voiced. Women allocated pig-enterprise income to provide for their children, household, and extended family, and spent only the remaining income on themselves. Men allocated income to meet personal needs, and to provide for their children, wife, second wife/family, extended family, and lovers. Men and women in female-headed households (WFHH) had overt decision-making ability over the pig enterprise and pig-enterprise income. Some women in male-headed households (WMHH) had overt decision-making ability over the pig enterprise and pig-enterprise income when their husband allowed it, or failed to provide, or was away. Pig ownership and <b>labour</b> <b>investment</b> by WMHH did not guarantee that women had decisionmaking ability or benefitted from pig-enterprise income. Some WMHH employed covert strategies which mitigated their relative disadvantage. Threat of domestic violence inhibited the decision-making ability of WMHH. Polygyny reduced intra-household communication transparency. Conclusions: Diet adoption could benefit smallholder pig-raising households and farming communities, but lack of funds and human/pig food competition could limit adoption. Men, WFHH, and some WMHH had overt decisionmaking ability over the pig enterprise and pig-enterprise income. Men allocated income to benefit themselves, and their multiple families and lovers. Women allocated income to benefit their families and spent only surplus income on themselves. Women employed covert strategies to mitigate their relative disadvantage.

40|$|Empirical {{investigation}} {{of the impact of}} institutional and socioeconomic factors on agricultural productivity and natural resource conditions is important for an informed evaluation of current policies, and to identify areas for future improvements. In this line, the current study addresses three topics of relevance to the process of agricultural intensification and natural resource management {{in the context of the}} less-favoured Highlands of Tigray, Ethiopia. The first topic assesses the impact of land contracting, in the form of sharecropping, on plot level crop and land management input use and intensity of use decisions, and the efficiency of resource use by tenants on their own and on sharecropped-in plots. Controlling for other socio-economic and biophysical factors, contrary to the predictions of the Marshallin theory of sharecropping, the study finds no statistically significant impact of tenancy status on input use and resource use efficiency at plot level. The second topic focuses on understanding of farmers' perceptions of rainfall-related production risk and uncertainty in the study area, and investigates how that influences their decisions on the intensity of plot level farm management input use and investment in land management. The findings show that farmers differ highly in their production risk perceptions even they face similar external circumstances and their socioeconomic features are found to account for such differences. Farm management input use and <b>labour</b> <b>investment</b> in land management by farmers did not show statistically significant associations with the risk perception of farm decision-makers. The third topic assesses the effectiveness of the household level labour quota system as a collective resource management institution employed in Tigray, and seeks to identify the household level factors that explain the degree of farmers' (non) -compliance with the system. The results from this assessment indicate the need for adapting the system to the changing socioeconomic circumstances of the households, and creating functional decentralized systems of resource management, considering the economic objectives of the human element. Overall, farmers' decisions on plot level farm management and investment for land improvement, and compliance with collective action institutions are influenced by their socioeconomic and institutional circumstances that require policy consideration. Therefore, policy interventions are necessary to alleviate major constraints for efficient resource use, create production risk management services, and promote self-sustaining systems of communal resource management in the region...|$|E
30|$|Our data {{indicate}} that in remote rural counties of the Mongolian Altai mountains, livestock losses in the 2009 / 10 dzud were very high and in particular affected herders with smaller and/or goat-dominated herds, who often were of Kazakh and Uriankhai ethnicity. Whereas Uriankhai households and the wealthier Torguud herders pursued a quick re-stocking of herds, small-scale Kazakh herders abandoned livestock-keeping. For a majority of herders, local ecological knowledge of predicting harsh winters and taking precautions against such disaster gained importance only after the 2009 / 10 dzud. Therefore, priority was given to hay-making and winter pen preparation, whereas improvement of livestock productivity through segregated grazing (otor) of selected animals, frequent pastureland rotation of the main herd, controlled mating and early sale of fattened as well as skinny livestock were sometimes mentioned but hardly practiced. Since animals that enter the winter season in healthy and well-fed condition are more resistant against disaster than lean animals, national and international organizations wishing to support livestock keepers in this and similar regions should highlight the relevance of these local approaches. However, <b>labour</b> <b>investments</b> in refined herding strategies, hay-making and winter pen preparation can be substantial and surpass the capacities of individual households.

40|$|What is {{the cost}} of living in the Papua New Guinea highlands? An answer is sought using a time and energy {{accounting}} approach. The subsistence regime of Wola-speaking highlanders, the subjects of this investigation, comprises three components. The principal one is horticulture: people clearing gardens from forest and grassland, with tuberous crops predominating, notably sweet potato. The second component comprises animal rearing, notably of domestic pigs. The third, and least important, is hunting and gathering for food in the forest. The calculated returns on investments in these subsistence domains vary considerably. Gardens return in their crops between ten and fifteen times the energy expended in cultivation. Pigs may also give a good return, of four to five times the energy invested in rearing them, if slaughtered when adult, but people regularly keep animals for years and may incur negative energy returns on their <b>labour</b> <b>investments.</b> This relates to the high cultural premium put on pigs. Foraging for food is also energetically costly, the Wola expending four times more energy on these activities than they gain in return from the food they secure. This analysis of energy gains and losses challenges the relative notion of affluence as applied to foragers, by reviewing it in the comparative context of subsistence horticulture. ...|$|R
