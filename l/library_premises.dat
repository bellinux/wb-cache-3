50|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century {{it became clear}} that the <b>library's</b> <b>premises</b> in the Trinitatis Complex were outdated. They had become too small and the unusual access along the Round Tower's helical {{corridor}} was also impractical. In 1856, the university held an architectural competition for the design of a new library on a site in Fiolstræde, just behind the university's main building. The competition was won by Johan Daniel Herholdt. Construction started in 1857 and the new building was completed in 1861. The same year the astronomical observatory also moved to a specially designed building, the Østervold Observatory, constructed on the city's old fortifications which were being decommissioned.|$|R

The whole process was more complex than initially thought, but finally PMB was selected. The testing for the data migration, from a DOS-ISIS based catalog to a web-based one, took almost a year. The Library started the formal use of PMB as catalog and circulation system in 2013. This document describes the complete migration process, that was divided in two steps.

The building was renamed T.S. Eliot House in 2008. The opportunity was taken for a major rationalisation and overhaul of the greater part of the <b>library's</b> <b>premises.</b> Staff activities were concentrated in T.S. Eliot House (freeing up space in the older buildings for book storage and members' facilities); a new reading room was inserted in a lightwell; the Art Room was completely restructured and redesigned; the main Issue Hall remodelled; new circulation routes created; and other alterations made elsewhere. The first phase of work, the modification and refurbishment of T.S. Eliot House, was completed in 2007; and the second phase in 2010. The architects for the redevelopment were Haworth Tompkins with Price & Myers acting as consulting structural engineers; while the toilets were designed in collaboration with Turner Prize-winning artist Martin Creed.|$|R

The majority of the structure for the first two storeys had taken shape by Christmas 2010. By Autumn 2011 the structure of the building was complete and the building was being fitted out. External groundwork and paving was mostly complete by now as well.The Hub was opened on Monday 5 September 2011 and has since become a focal point of the locality. Due to its height, rising to three storeys, and position on the gently rising slope of Rodway Road, the Hub building can be seen rising above the surrounding buildings, particularly when approaching the area from the north side, over the railway bridge.|$|E

It is fitting then to recognise that a well planned strategy, involving the library and the management of the institution could provide significant influence to achieve the KM objectives. Librarians and information professionals (IPs) should be dedicated to fulfilling the varied information needs of the users, amidst the K-economy by providing accurate and relevant bibliographic and physical access and offer referral to the multidimensional range of information within the <b>library</b> <b>premise</b> and outside.

Librarians in Malaysia, specifically in academic libraries, have been initiating proactive approaches in marketing library services & resources for users to access it in a more efficient and effective way.

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} 1 ibrarianship code is {{to form and}} build {{librarian}} personality who can make possible the same opportunity to acquiring knowledge for all users, irrespective of their different demands or special needs. When we discuss the importance of building librarian personality the demanding work with users we confront the problem of ethical treatment very often. Ethics advises only general rules which are rarely simple and they are frequently opposite to each other. The process of reacting between the librarian and the user - as with general information needs as with special functional needs - is also dependent on librarian's professional relation which is formed on important elements such as professional qualification,experiences, creativeness and ethics. We are also interested in question where is the border between ethical and non - ethical action in key situations when the 1 ibrarian meets functionally handicapped user. Opportunities for non - ethical reaction of professional workers are much more possible if the <b>library's</b> <b>premises</b> and the furniture don't offer suitable conditions for adaptable communication with the handicapped. But {{on the other side}} the 1 ibrarian has just because of the bad arhitectural conditions better occasion to introduce himself {{as one of the best}} ethically formed personalies compared with other professions.
