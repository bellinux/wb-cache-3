On September6, {{a tropical}} storm warning was issued for locations south of <b>La</b> <b>Paz</b> {{on the east coast}} of Baja California, while {{a tropical storm}} watch was hoisted for areas south of Punta Abreojos on the west coast. A tropical storm warning was then issued for the west coast of Baja California south of Cabo San Lázaro. As Greg intensified, a hurricane warning was raised from Arroyo Seco southward, and for the east coast of Baja California from <b>La</b> <b>Paz</b> southward. A tropical storm watch was raised from north of <b>La</b> <b>Paz</b> to Loreto. Late on September7, the hurricane warning was reduced to a tropical storm warning as Greg weakened.

5|$|In <b>La</b> <b>Paz,</b> {{capital of}} Baja California Sur, the {{hurricane}} downed 40power poles. Authorities {{cut off the}} power supply {{to the city to}} prevent electrocutions from downed wires. Strong winds downed trees and destroyed many advertisement signs. Heavy rainfall totaling more than 20inches (500mm) in isolated areas resulted in ankle-deep flooding, closing many roads in addition to the airport in <b>La</b> <b>Paz.</b> In <b>La</b> <b>Paz,</b> 300families received damage to their homes, with another 200families left homeless after their houses were destroyed. The combination of winds and rain destroyed thousands of flimsy houses across the region. The rainfall also destroyed large areas of crops, and also killed many livestock. The rainfall caused the Iguagil dam in Comondú to overflow, isolating 15towns due to 4feet (1.5m) floodwaters. In the coastal city of Mulegé, flash flooding caused widespread damage throughout the town and the death of a United States citizen. More than 250homes were damaged or destroyed in the town, leaving many people homeless. Severe flooding blocked portions of Federal Highway 1, and damaged an aqueduct in the region.|$|E
5|$|All {{flights in}} and out of the Cabo San Lucas, <b>La</b> <b>Paz,</b> Los Cabos, and Loreto {{airports}} were cancelled on September15. A terminal roof at the Los Cabos was detached and the ceiling was partially destroyed. As a result, approximately 3,000-4,000people aboard 44flights were stranded. Although the interior walls of the airport in <b>La</b> <b>Paz</b> sustained damage, the airport resumed normal operations within a week following Odile. Throughout the peninsula, 30,000vacationers were stranded, including 26,000 from other nations, mainly from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Many of the stranded were evacuated to shelters, though one of the shelters collapsed due to overcrowding. By September16, many tourists were airlifted to surrounding airports, including Tijuana, Mazatlán, Guadalajara, and Mexico City, although one person perished on a flight back via a heart attack due to stress the storm created.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane-force winds blew down trees, signs, {{and power}} lines {{in and around}} <b>La</b> <b>Paz,</b> while closer to the beach the {{hurricane}} destroyed multiple beach huts. Rough surf in the harbor of <b>La</b> <b>Paz</b> sunk one fishing vessel and grounded four others. Efforts by the Mexican Navy prevented an additional vessel and two cruise ships from being grounded. In Cabo San Lucas, effects were minimal, amounting to light winds and rain of less than 2inches (50mm). The passage of the hurricane left citizens in Todos Santos without power for around 24hours. Heavy rainfall caused severe inland flooding, destroying bridges and multiple mudslides, some of which blocked roads. Flash flooding in desert inland areas washed out roads, causing the Mexican government to restrict traffic {{through much of the}} peninsula for up to a week after the storm. Many roads remained impassable for a month after the hurricane. The closed roads and the airport in <b>La</b> <b>Paz</b> and southern Baja California left some tourists stranded. The rainfall was welcome in some desert areas, where the moderate precipitation filled reservoirs. Two rescue workers died when they were swept away by the floodwaters. Six municipalities in Baja California were declared disaster areas, and by four days after landfall, the Mexican government prepared emergency funds to meet the immediate needs of the affected citizens.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the city}} of <b>La</b> <b>Paz,</b> damage to roads was {{estimated}} at MX$200million (US$15.5million).
