Surakarta : Industrial Engineering Faculty of Engineering, Sebelas Maret University, January 2007. Interior gypsum is gypsum product {{which is}} used in frieze art to give artistic value {{with the result that}} a house can be seen more interesting. On the {{manufacture}} process of interior gypsum, gypsum was added with an inorganic material in the form of <b>lasing</b> <b>fibre,</b> which is known as rowing fibre. Usage of this <b>lasing</b> <b>fibre</b> was to strengthen interior gypsum from fissure and fracture defects during production process, occasionally occured at the moment of releasing printing mould as well as installation moment. These conditions can be minimized with several methods, among others by improving the compressive strength quality of the interior gypsum product. According to the previous study (Dani Instika, DETERMINING OF OPTIMUM SETTING USING TAGUCHI METHODS IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS OF INTERIOR GYPSUM BASED ON THE EXAMINATION OF COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH (A CASE STUDY AT UD. MAHKOTA SOLO), the obtained result was rowing fibre function as <b>lasing</b> <b>fibre</b> didn't {{have an effect on the}} compressive strength of interior gypsum. Effort on exploiting other alternative materials as <b>lasing</b> <b>fibre</b> encourages the researcher to try using an alternative material as substitution of rowing fibre. This material is natural fibre in the form of Agave Cantula Roxb fibre. The aim of this research is to find out the influence of Agave Cantula Roxb fibre usage to the compressive strength of interior gypsum. According to the data processing, the result obtained from this research is, the factors which have an effect to compressive strength quality on interior gypsum at optimal condition are water and fibre volume fraction. Optimum setting level of compressive strength quality on interior gypsum is obtained when fibre volume fraction is 0...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} Rayleigh {{scattering}} effects in ultra-long Raman fibre laser. It {{has been found}} that in a long fibre cavity (- 100 km) the distributed feedback due to Rayleigh back scattering at propagation of light between fibre Bragg grating reflectors may be comparable with the lumped feedback provided by the FBG itself. As a result, Raman <b>lasing</b> in the <b>fibre</b> span limited by lumped (FBG) reflector at one side only appears possible due to significant reflection from the RS-based "random" distributed mirror at the other side. Thus, it concludes that a distributed Rayleigh scattering "random" mirror can form a cavity together with a single FBG spliced to the opposite cavity end...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTraditionally laser polymer welding {{has been}} done by using lasers with {{wavelength}} of c. 1 μm wavelength. With this wavelength one of the pair of polymers to be joined needs to be transparent and one absorbing, usually clear and black, respectively. Joining of two transparent polymers with laser has been possible only by using absorbing additive between the samples or by doping the polymer with absorbing additive. During the last years lasers with new wavelengths between 1. 4 to 2 μm have been developed. With this wavelength range welding of the transparent polymer to another transparent one without any absorbing additives is now possible. In this paper joining of transparent to transparent polymers with quasi-simultaneous laser welding (QSLW) technique and <b>fibre</b> <b>lase</b> with wavelength of 1. 94 μm is studied. Also a new scanning technique for QSLW is introduced. In this technique laser beam path is off-setting to a different place in every scanning round. This way the Gaussian beam shape of fibre laser can be smoothened to be more suitable for polymer welding and more flexibility on laser welding of polymers is achieved without losing the benefits of quasi-simultaneous laser welding...|$|R

This thesis looks into the possibility for lasing at around 3 μm, where tellurite glass is transparent. To test the lasing potential of fabricated tellurite glass microstructured <b>fibres,</b> <b>lasing</b> at 1. 5 μm was demonstrated. The research contained within this thesis includes: The development and characterisation of the tellurite glass composition; including modifications made to this composition to match the refractive indices of the doped and undoped glasses, reducing the glass material loss, finding the glass crystallisation stability and density as well as measuring the temperature dependence of the glass melt viscosity, of which an understanding is required for its extrusion (Chapter 2).

40|$|We present, for {{the first}} time, a {{detailed}} investigation {{of the impact of}} second order co-propagating Raman pumping on long-haul 100 G WDM DP-QPSK coherent transmission of up to 7082 km using Raman fibre laser based configurations. Signal power and noise distributions along the fibre for each pumping scheme were characterised both numerically and experimentally. Based on these pumping schemes, the Q factor penalties versus co-pump power ratios were experimentally measured and quantified. A significant Q factor penalty of up to 4. 15 dB was observed after 1666 km using symmetric bidirectional pumping, compared with counter-pumping only. Our results show that whilst using co-pumping minimises the intra-cavity signal power variation and amplification noise, the Q factor penalty with co-pumping was too great for any advantage to be seen. The relative intensity noise (RIN) characteristics of the induced fibre laser and the output signal, and the intra-cavity RF spectra of the fibre laser are also presented. We attribute the Q factor degradation to RIN induced penalty due to RIN being transferred from the first order fibre laser and second order co-pump to the signal. More importantly, there were two different <b>fibre</b> <b>lasing</b> regimes contributing to the amplification. It was random distributed feedback lasing when using counter-pumping only and conventional Fabry-Perot cavity lasing when using all bidirectional pumping schemes. This also results in significantly different performances due to different laser cavity lengths for these two classes of laser...|$|R
40|$|The use of rare-earth ion dopants {{to obtain}} {{near-infrared}} (NIR) emission and <b>lasing</b> in glass <b>fibres</b> and waveguides is well known. However, {{due to the}} intrinsic nature of the spin-forbidden 4 f- 4 f transitions the emission is generally only tuneable over a narrow spectral range (~ 50 nm). The development of a broadband NIR source or tuneable laser would have applications in telecommunications, sensing amongst others. The ability {{to do this in}} a non-linear material would have additional benefits including the possibility of developing integrated devices. To this end we have investigated the incorporation of various transition metal dopants into Ga:La:S glass system (GLS). We have identified a number of transition metal ions that show potential for developing broadband source and in particular V. When V is incorporated into GLS strong room temperature emission is observed peaking at ~ 1550 nm with what appears to be some dependence of the emission upon excitation at wavelength. The room temperature lifetime of the emission shows a non-exponential decay with a 1 /e time of 31 µs. The incorporation of Cr into GLS during the glass melting results in the formation of Cr ions that act as emitting centres. Again there appears to be some dependence on excitation wavelength of the emission which is ~ 1100 nm when exciting at 800 nm. The emission is also seen to shift upon cooling of the sample to 77 K to longer wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|Scaling {{of laser}} power and {{brightness}} {{to meet the}} needs of ever-demanding applications is a demanding task which continues to preoccupy many within the laser community. In conventional 'bulk' solid-state lasers the main obstacle is heat generation in the laser medium and its associated detrimental effects. Methods for combating these problems have been the focus of much research, resulting in many novel laser geometries with improved thermal management and reduced thermal lensing, but often at the expense of increased complexity and reduced flexibility. An alternative approach, which is beginning to attract a great deal of interest, is to operate the laser with the laser medium maintained at cryogenic temperatures (~ 77 K), where the effects of heat loading are dramatically reduced due to a large increase in thermal conductivity and a large decrease in the temperature coefficient of refractive index (dn/dT) and expansion coefficient [1]. In host materials such as YAG the net reduction in thermal effects can be over 50 times compared to operation at room temperature. In the case of diode-pumped Yb:YAG lasers, the combined effect of a massive reduction in thermo-optic aberrations and lower re-absorption loss has allowed very impressive results to be achieved in terms of output power and beam quality from relatively simple laser resonator configurations [2]. In this paper we report on preliminary work ultimately aimed at achieving a further reduction in thermal effects by combining the advantages of cryogenic cooling with a very low quantum defect fibre-laser-pumping of bulk solid-state lasers. Here we describe preliminary results for a cryogenically-cooled Ho:YAG laser in-band pumped by a high-power Tm-doped silica <b>fibre</b> <b>lase...</b>|$|R
40|$|Eye-safe lasers {{operating}} at the wavelength of 1550 nm are {{of great interest}} {{for the development of}} coherent sources for remote sensing, such as LIDARs or range finding systems. The most efficient activator ion commonly employed for this emission wavelength is Er 3 +, while inorganic glasses are suitable host materials because of their low cost, high versatility and the possibility they offer of obtaining the active cavity {{in the form of an}} optical fibre. Among the possible host glasses, silica is the most popular choice thanks to its high thermal stability and good mechanical properties. However, its reduced solubility for rare earth ions does not allow the implementation of compact optical devices, while on the contrary phosphate glasses represent an interesting alternative. This work reviews the design, fabrication and characterization of a series of Er-doped phosphate glasses suitable for the realization of eye-safe laser sources. The glasses were doped with increasing Er 3 + ion amounts, namely 0. 02, 1, 2, 6 and 10 mol%. A series of phosphate glasses with increasing Er 3 + ion concentration (Table 1) was prepared by mixing powdered chemicals with 99 +% purity. The batched chemicals were melt quenched at temperature above 1300 °C under a dry air flux and finally casted onto pre-heated brass moulds. The physical, thermal and optical properties of the glasses were thoroughly evaluated. All the prepared glasses were homogeneous and highly stable: average values of 486 ± 3 °C and 982 ± 3 °C were measured for glass transition (Tg) and crystallization (Tx) temperatures, respectively. The term ΔT = Tx−Tg is commonly used as an estimate of the glass stability and the obtained value of ΔT = 496 ± 6 °C demonstrates the ability to draw crystal free optical fibres. Prism coupling technique was used to measure the refractive index of the manufactured glasses (Fig. 1) at five different wavelengths. Emission spectra were measured by exciting the glass samples with a laser diode {{operating at}} the wavelength of 976 nm, using a lock-in and a chopper to improve S/N ratio. Lifetime values up to 7 ms were measured at the wavelength of 1550 nm for the Er 3 +: 4 I 13 / 2 excited state level. The results of the full characterization of the prepared samples will be presented, together with the selection of the best candidate for the fabrication of the active medium of the eye-safe optical <b>fibre</b> <b>lase...</b>|$|R
