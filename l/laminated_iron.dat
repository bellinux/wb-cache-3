40|$|Single-phase <b>laminates</b> of <b>iron</b> {{titanate}} {{were formed}} by gel-casting {{in both the}} presence and absence of a magnetic field to produce alternating layers of textured and nontextured microstructure, respectively. X-ray analysis was performed on each lamina verifying that alignment was maintained throughout processing. Tunnel cracks were found in trilayer laminates (nontextured/textured/nontextured) when the alignment direction was parallel to the interface between layers. The cracks are consistent with a stress profile of residual tension parallel to the interface in the textured layer...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{simulation}} of eddy currents in <b>laminated</b> nonlinear <b>iron</b> cores by the {{finite element method}} is of great interest {{in the design of}} electrical devices. The dimen-sions of the iron core and the thickness of the laminates are very different. Thus, finite element models considering each laminate require many finite elements leading to ex-tremely large systems of equations. A multi-scale finite ele-ment method has been developed to cope with this problem. Numerical simulations in 2 D demostrate an excellent accu-racy and very low computational costs. ...|$|R
50|$|Toroidal {{inductors}} and transformers are inductors and transformers {{which use}} magnetic cores with a toroidal (ring or donut) shape. They are passive electronic components, {{consisting of a}} circular ring or donut shaped magnetic core of ferromagnetic material such as <b>laminated</b> <b>iron,</b> iron powder, or ferrite, around which wire is wound.|$|E
5000|$|An {{ignition}} coil {{consists of a}} <b>laminated</b> <b>iron</b> core surrounded by two coils of copper wire. Unlike a power transformer, an {{ignition coil}} has an open magnetic circuit — the iron core does not form a closed loop around the windings. The energy that is stored in the magnetic field of the core is the energy that is transferred to the spark plug.|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} voltage of a transformer {{is proportional to}} the product of the core area, magnetic flux, and frequency. By using a much higher frequency, the core area (and so the mass of the core) can be greatly reduced. However, core losses increase at higher frequencies. Cores generally use ferrite material which has a low loss at the high frequencies and high flux densities used. The <b>laminated</b> <b>iron</b> cores of lower-frequency (<400 Hz) transformers would be unacceptably lossy at switching frequencies of a few kilohertz. Also, more energy is lost during transitions of the switching semiconductor at higher frequencies. Furthermore, more attention to the physical layout of the circuit board is required as parasitics become more significant, and the amount of electromagnetic interference will be more pronounced.|$|E
40|$|Single phase <b>laminates</b> of <b>iron</b> {{titanate}} {{were formed}} by gelcasting {{both in the}} presence and absence of a magnetic field to produce alternating layers of textured and non-textured microstructure, respectively. X-ray analysis was performed on each lamina verifying that alignment was maintained throughout processing. Toughness of trilayer laminates (non-textured/textured/non-textured) were measured using {{a modified version of}} the short double cantilever beam geometry. Toughness experiments resulted in large scale crack deflection of several hundred microns. Peak toughnesses were measured to be well over 8 MPa•m^(1 / 2) which is a substantial improvement over monolithic iron titanate...|$|R

5000|$|Electricity {{generation}} {{began in}} 1886 with two dynamos, giving a maximum combined capacity of [...] There was a two mile long transmission {{line from the}} generating station to the stamping battery. However, this early system proved to have many problems, and the mines inspector {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "very little is yet really known about electricity". At first, the dynamos were incapable of powering the full 30 stamps and the water turbine was still needed to run the battery at full capacity. The dynamos were upgraded the following year, replacing the cast-iron armatures with <b>laminated</b> <b>iron</b> ones, and by 1888 the electric plant was capable of powering the 30 stamps as well as an air compressor and a stone breaker.|$|E

50|$|Audio {{frequency}} chokes (AFC) {{usually have}} ferromagnetic cores {{to increase their}} inductance. They are often constructed similarly to transformers, with <b>laminated</b> <b>iron</b> cores and an air gap. A major use in the past was in power rectifiers and direct current motor controllers to produce direct current (DC), where they were {{used in conjunction with}} large electrolytic capacitors to remove the voltage ripple (AC) at the output DC. A rectifier circuit designed for a choke-output filter may produce too much DC output voltage and subject the rectifier and filter capacitors to excessive in-rush and ripple currents if the inductor is removed. However, modern electrolytic capacitors with high ripple current ratings, and voltage regulators that remove more power supply ripple than chokes could, have eliminated heavy, bulky chokes from mains frequency power supplies. Smaller chokes are used in switching power supplies to remove the higher-frequency switching transients from the output and sometimes from feeding back into the mains input. They often have toroidal ferrite cores.|$|E

The main objective of this work is to understand the limits of controllability of these magnets for use in controlled applications such as electromagnetic suspensions (EMS) and bearings. Experimental results obtained using <b>laminated</b> and solid <b>iron</b> cores indicated that the ac losses are dominated by eddy currents in the iron cores, and the losses in the superconductor are relatively insignificant...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{machines}} with distributed concentrated windings are challenging {{the selection of}} the soft magnetic materials due to stator design and power conversion efficiency. A shorter magnetisation path and relatively high magnetisation frequency establish a good potential for low permeability soft magnetic materials with low power losses in the core. The focus of this article is on the analysis of a three-phase machine with <b>laminated</b> and <b>iron</b> powder cores where the concern is on the modular winding design, torque capability and stator efficiency. Different iron powder cores are compared to laminated core on basis of 2 D FEA. The three-phase machine torque is compared with the conventional distributed concentrated winding, an axially distributed wave winding, and a number of circumferentially distribute wave-winding segments. According to 3 D FEA, the conventional coils are preferred if the permeability of the core is low...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{electrical}} conductivity of the metal, when a solid one-piece metal core {{is used in}} alternating current (AC) applications such as transformers and inductors, the changing magnetic field induces large eddy currents circulating within it, closed loops of electric current in planes perpendicular to the field. The current flowing through {{the resistance of the}} metal heats it by Joule heating, causing significant power losses. Therefore, solid iron cores are not used in transformers or inductors, they are replaced by <b>laminated</b> or powdered <b>iron</b> cores, or nonconductive cores like ferrite.|$|R
50|$|The {{general design}} was distantly {{reminiscent}} of the Stahlhelm, but with some considerable alterations. The general structure and depth were similar, but the brim was shortened, opened wider and more gradually turned. The ventilation apertures were retained, but set in smaller rounded fittings. The angles of the side and upper surfaces were conically increased {{with the aim of}} causing hits of over 90° angle to ricochet. From mid-front to mid-rear a well-pronounced projecting rib was shaped. As a result the helmet received a very distinctive outline with only a distant likeness to the Stahlhelm. It was made of steel with only a small quantity of the first model made of lighter <b>laminated</b> <b>iron,</b> exclusively as officers' dress gear. The edges of the shell were rolled over in the earliest type known as A, while on the later type known as B these were straight cut. In 1939 a new redesigned version with shallowed shell and shortened brim, known as type C, was brought into service. An estimated 70% of all production was of this third model. Factory-issued helmets were initially dark greyish-green in colour with a small shield in Bulgarian flag colours on the right. Later new brighter pea-green shade was introduced. The leather suspension, or liner, were produced in several different variants. The M36 helmet design became lighter, more compact, and more comfortable than the First World War-era designs and provided excellent protection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Homogenization {{represents}} a promising method to simulate eddy current losses in <b>laminated</b> <b>iron</b> cores efficiently. First, multi-scale homogenization {{is demonstrated by}} a multi-scale approach {{in the context of}} an electrostatic problem. Then, multi-scale homogenization is extended to the eddy current problem. Two multi-scale approaches for the magnetic vector potential have been derived to simulate the eddy current losses of a <b>laminated</b> <b>iron</b> core in 2 D efficiently and accurately. A rather coarse finite element grid suffices to approximate the homogenized solution of laminated media accurately. A representative numerical example for the electrostatic problem and one for the eddy current problem are presented to demonstrate the validity of multi-scale homogenization, the accuracy of the homogenized solution and to compare the computational costs.

500|$|Gibraltar's {{guns were}} reorganised and {{upgraded}} from 1856. Many of the 24-pounder guns were replaced with 32-pounders and the retired batteries were equipped with 68-pounders. A {{wide variety of}} old guns was still in use, including iron-cast 6-, 12- and 18-pounder, which complicated the supply and maintenance of the batteries. At its peak, the fortress had 681 guns in 110 batteries and positions. As the British artist William Henry Bartlett put it in 1851, [...] "Ranges of batteries rising from the sea, tier above tier, extend along its entire sea-front, at the northern extremity {{of which is the}} town every nook in the crags bristles with artillery". However, only a decade later the rapid introduction of rifled artillery firing explosive shells was already beginning to make the fortifications obsolete. As a result of recommendations by Colonel William Jervois, the coastal batteries were upgraded with armoured casemates made from expensively constructed <b>iron</b> <b>laminates.</b> He also proposed to build a sea fort in the bay, along the lines of Britain's Palmerston Forts, though this was never carried out.|$|R
