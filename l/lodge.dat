5|$|Exclusive Jurisdiction is {{a concept}} whereby only one Grand <b>Lodge</b> will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will {{have to choose between}} them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand <b>Lodge</b> of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand <b>Lodge.</b> Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand <b>Lodge</b> of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand <b>Lodge</b> of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).|$|E

40|$|Strong {{wind and}} heavy rain remain {{the two most}} {{important}} causes of large acreage wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) <b>lodging</b> in China. For research the influence of wind speed and rainfall-separately as well as together-on the extent and degree of <b>lodging,</b> five levels of the severity of <b>lodging</b> were defined based on a combination of the <b>lodging</b> area and the degree of tilting. Detailed meteorological information was studied on 52 instances of large-scale <b>lodging</b> that occurred from 2007 to 2014. The results showed that strong wind's <b>lodging</b> accounted for 8 % of the instances studied, continuous rainfall's <b>lodging</b> accounted for 19 % and strong winds-heavy rainfall's accounted for 73 %. The minimum instantaneous wind speed that could cause large-scale <b>lodging</b> was closely related to rainfall. Without rainfall, the wind speed that resulted in <b>lodging</b> ranging in severity from slight to severe (Level 2 to Level 5) was 14. 9 m/s, 19. 3 m/s, 21. 5 m/s, and 26. 5 m/s, respectively; when accompanied by rainfall, the wind speed that resulted in <b>lodging</b> of the same severity decreased linearly with the increase of rainfall. These results will be particularly useful in preventing and alleviating wheat <b>lodging</b> as well screening wheat varieties with good <b>lodging</b> resistance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Lodging</b> was {{investigated}} using six lines of self-pollinating buckwheat. Each line {{had a different}} plant type, namely erect type, semi-dwarf type and chrysanthemum type. Plant characteristics were measured just before the occurrence of <b>lodging.</b> The percentage of <b>lodging</b> was the highest in erect type (76 %), {{but there was no}} <b>lodged</b> plant in chrysanthemum type. The most of <b>lodging</b> was only bending of the plant, and the <b>lodging</b> caused by breaking of the stem was below 10 % of total area. There is no relation between <b>lodging</b> percentage and plant length or top fresh weight, but the diameter of cotyledon internode revealed {{a significant difference between the}} <b>lodged</b> and unlodged lines. The median point percentage and diameter and thickness of the lower part stem probably have any relation with <b>lodging,</b> The thickness of internode in the lower part of the stem had a negative correlation to the <b>lodging</b> caused by breaking of the stem. These results suggested that it is important to breed the cultivars with lower portion of the median point, short length of cotyledon internode, thick stem in lower part for improving <b>lodging</b> resistance...|$|R

40|$|Sensitivity to <b>lodging</b> of oat {{varieties}} {{has been}} reduced in the last decades through the introduction of dwarfing genes. However, <b>lodging</b> may still cause significant yield loss, underscoring {{the need for new}} oat varieties with higher levels of <b>lodging</b> tolerance. In the present study, we analysed <b>lodging</b> and plant height in a collection of European oat accessions including landraces, old and modern varieties, in order to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for identifying markers associated to <b>lodging</b> tolerance. This collection has been recently genotyped by the Infinium 6 K SNP array for oat and SNP data were analysed as continuous intensity ratios, rather than as discrete genotypes (Tumino et al. 2016, Theor Appl Genet 129, pp. 1711 – 1724). Phenotypes for <b>lodging</b> severity, plant height and growth habit were collected under natural conditions in eight European countries. Plant height correlated to <b>lodging</b> severity as previously observed in many studies, explaining about 30 % of <b>lodging</b> variation.
