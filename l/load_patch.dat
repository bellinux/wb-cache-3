50|$|The PLGen module {{stands for}} the virtual model {{generator}} or the pre-processor of the PLPAK. It mainly changes any structural drawing to {{what is called the}} “virtual model”. Modeller can import structural drawings from DXF CAD files or can draw then directly using the CAD capabilities of the PLGen. The virtual model looks very similar to the original structural drawing. The PLGen mainly define the structure using series of objects. These objects are classified into one of three categories: the geometrical objects (single slab and openings), the loading objects (column load, wall load, <b>load</b> <b>patch,</b> load assembly) and the supporting objects (column, wall, wall assembly, soil support, beam). Using such objects the modeler can define all elements in the building slab. It has to be noted that the virtual model represents the actual slab shape (not like the centre-line model of the finite element method). Columns and walls are represented by the actual cross section shape. The PLGen can also input the numerical models of each object such as the number of boundary elements for each segments, the discretization of the beam-slab contact areas, etc. Load cases only (i.e. no load combinations) are defined in the PLGen module. Material properties are also defined herein. The below Figure demonstrates the graphical user interface of the PLGen module.|$|E
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{a review of}} the IACS Unified Requirements for Design of Polar Ships against Ice Loads. The {{transversely}} stiffened plate requirements in IACS URI are based on a roof-top yield line mechanism where the rectangular yield lines corresponds to the <b>load</b> <b>patch</b> boundaries. Results shows that this is a non-conservative assumption, and plates with a high frame span to <b>load</b> <b>patch</b> height ratio are implicitly allowed to develop more permanent deformations. The IACS URI design capacity is compared to the plate capacity formulation developed by Nyseth et. al. Nyseth. Nyseth's formulation shows more consistent levels of permanent deformations for different plate and <b>load</b> <b>patch</b> geometries. The plate - <b>load</b> <b>patch</b> geometries within the validity of the assumed yield line pattern in Nyseth's formulation creates an upper bound of implicitly allowed permanent sets. Based on the results from analyses, this thesis recommends the Nyseth plate capacity formulation for utilisation in requirements. The requirements for transverse frames are derived from three different failure modes; a three hinge collapse mechanism, a shear hinge collapse mechanism and a symmetric shear failure. Results showed that there are some more conservatism in the shear hinge collapse mechanism than in the three hinge mechanism. In general, the frame design capacity corresponded well with the design limit of severe loss of stiffness. A Matlab program was developed to introduce moving pressure distributions into Abaqus. The pressure distribution is applied as a <b>load</b> <b>patch</b> to any plane plate in the Abaqus model. Assumed pressure distributions measured during deployments with USCGC Polar Sea were produced and implemented to a PC 7 flat bar grillage. Static, quasi-static and dynamic analyses were performed. Static scaling of the worst pressure distribution, to the same strain level as with IACS URI design pressure, resulted in a similar pressure level. The nominal force from the worst pressure distribution was lower. This because, the smaller contact area distributed the force over fewer frames. Moving the pressure distribution quasi-statically showed indications of a shift in structural damage from the trailing side to the forward side of the load motion. This effect was amplified in dynamic analyses. The tangential velocity of the pressure corresponded with the eigenfrequency of a web-plate oscillating eigenmode. This decreased the structural strength of the frames and increased the magnitude of structural damage in the grillage. This lead to a further shift of structural damage towards the moving direction. Adding strain rate reduced this effect. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} Genetic Algorithm Optimisation Methods (GA) is studied {{and for the}} first time used to design high {{efficiency}} microwave class E power amplifiers (PAs) and associated <b>load</b> <b>patch</b> antennas. The difficulties of designing high efficiency PAs is that power transistors are highly non linear and classical design techniques only work for resistive loads. There are currently no high efficient and accurate procedures for design high efficiency PAs. To achieve simplified and accurate design procedure, GA and new design quadratic equations are introduced and applied. The performance analysis is based on linear switch models and non linear circuitry push-pull methods. The results of the analytical calculations and experimental verification showed that the power added efficiency (PAE) of the PAs mainly depend on the losses of the active device itself and are nearly independent on the losses of its harmonic networks. Hence, it has been proven that the cheap material PCB FR 4 can be used to design high efficiency class E PAs and it also shown that low Q factor networks have only a minor effect on efficiency, allowing a wide bandwidth to be obtained. In additional, a new procedure for designing class E PAs is introduced and applied. The active device (ATF 34143) is used. Good agreement was obtained between predicted analyses and the simulation results (from Microwave Office (AWR) and Agilent ADS software). For the practical realization, class E PAs were fabricated and tested using PCB FR 4. The practical results validate computer simulations and the PAE of the class E PAs are more than 71...|$|E

40|$|The {{calculation}} of ice-induced loads on ships is still mainly based on empirical models. In {{order to gain}} a better physical understanding of the loading on ice-going vessels, Det Norske Veritas launched an ice load monitoring project involving full scale trials with the coastguard vessel KV Svalbard during the winters 2006, 2007 and 2011. The results from the full scale measurements conducted with KV Svalbard has been topic of several earlier master's thesis at NTNU,The master thesis consists of four parts. The first part is a literature review of the mechanical and physical properties of sea ice. The second part is a review of the rule sets developed by DNV and the IACS regarding vessels operating in ice infested waters. Both design principles and numerical values have been evaluated. The main difference between the designs principles used, is that IACS base their rules on a plastic method of approach, while DNV uses an elastic method. Despite the difference in the design principles, when comparing their numerical values turned out to be quite similar. The DNV rules are in general most conservative for the smaller vessels and the IACS rules the most conservative for large vessels. The third part consists of a finite element study of a part of the bow on KV Svalbard. A systematic load scheme is used, consisting of 102 load cases. For each of the stress factors there where made graphs that showed the stress at the sensor location when moving the patch load. The sensor mounted on the frame were able to measure load that was within the frame loading area and sensor mounted on the stringer could measure stress for all of the load cases in the horizontal directions. One of the explanations for this is that the stringer transfers stress from the <b>load</b> <b>patch</b> area that could be measured by the sensors. The last part consists of a comparison between measurements from the full scale trials and the results from the 102 load cases. This comparison is done through a weighted summation method where 5 different load cases are combined to represent the measured result, and a load factor is calculated for each load case for its contribution of the measured results. The stress component used in this comparison is the shear stress tau xy The load cases were tested against the 11 measurements from the full scale trials. There were in total 11 load cases that gave positive factors for all of the 11 measurements at the same time. A figure was made to show which load cases were likely to contribute in the solution of the load cases. Load cases inside the frame loading area have the largest load factors for the solution of measurements. This load decision scheme is very sensitive to the selection of load cases and boundary conditions. A change of the boundary conditions for the model was tried out for 7 load cases, and with changed boundary conditions, only 5 gave positive load factors. The results of this thesis shows that is possible to find many solution to the measured result by combining many load case, but is it not possible to decide the solution. </p...|$|E

40|$|Different aspects {{concerning}} {{the resistance of}} steel girders subjected to concentrated forces have interested {{a large amount of}} researchers all over the world. The subject most dealt with among researchers is what is called "patch loading", a concentrated force applied at one flange. Generally, the resistance to concentrated forces is considered as being a problem of very complex nature. Therefore all studies aiming at predicting the ultimate resistance of steel girders to concentrated forces gives more or less empirical solutions. This thesis focus on three different applications of concentrated forces. Concentrated forces applied at one flange, opposite concentrated forces applied at two flanges and concentrated forces applied at an unstiffened girder end. The first application is recognized as <b>patch</b> <b>loading,</b> the second and third are herein defined as opposite <b>patch</b> <b>loading</b> and end <b>patch</b> <b>loading,</b> respectively. The report is divided in two parts, the main text and the appendices. The appendices are used to give results form tests performed herein and to present data for tests taken from the literature, but also to give results from a comparison with a design model suggested herein and the tests. The main text starts with an introduction giving the basis in the subject and a review of earlier work and ends up in a suggestion for a design model for the ultimate resistance for the three different applications of concentrated forces. The design model is developed with the purpose to be consistent for the three load applications, simple enough to be fit for use and also harmonized with those used for other buckling problems. The design model is based on a von Karman approach and includes three parts, an expression for the yield resistance, the elastic buckling load and a resistance function. The expression for the yield resistance is based on observations and conclusions from an experimental investigation, including a total of 48 tests on welded girders made from the high strength, quenched and tempered steel Weldox 700 and 12 tests on rolled beams. All three load applications were tested, with the majority of the tests performed as end <b>patch</b> <b>load</b> test. Approximate solutions for the elastic buckling <b>load</b> for <b>patch</b> <b>loading,</b> opposite <b>patch</b> <b>loading</b> and end <b>patch</b> <b>loading</b> are formulated on the basis of results from FEM. The buckling coefficients includes a contribution from the flange stiffness and the approximate solutions gives a reasonable accuracy compared to the result from FEM. The resistance function is empirically determined from about 250 <b>patch</b> <b>load</b> tests, since this is the only load application for which one can find tests on girders with slender webs in the literature. The resistance function is also proven suitable for opposite <b>patch</b> <b>loading</b> and end <b>patch</b> <b>loading.</b> Compared to results from a total of about 540 tests, the design model suggested herein gives a better accuracy in the prediction of the ultimate resistance for all three load applications than other leading design models from the literature. What can be considered as new and original in this thesis is that it gives a consistent model for prediction of the resistance of steel girders subjected to concentrated forces which is harmonized with the models for other instability problems a design model that extends the applicability to high strength, quenched and tempered steels additional solutions for the critical buckling loads for various boundary conditionsGodkänd; 1995; 20070426 (ysko...|$|R

The proposed study gives an insight into the functioning of slot cut and stub loaded antennas and proposed formulations can be used to design them at give frequencies. Keyword...|$|R
40|$|A compact circularly {{polarized}} antenna operating at 915 [*]MHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band for biomedical implantable applications is presented and experimentally measured. The proposed antenna can be miniaturized {{to a large}} extent with the compact size of 15 × 15 × 1. 27 [*]mm 3 by means of <b>loading</b> <b>patches</b> to a ring-shaped microstrip patch antenna. An impedance bandwidth of 10. 6 % (865 – 962 [*]MHz) for reflection coefficient less than − 10 [*]dB can be obtained. Meanwhile, the simulated 3 [*]dB axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth reaches 14 [*]MHz. Finally, the optimized design was fabricated and tested, and the measured results agree well with simulated results...|$|R
