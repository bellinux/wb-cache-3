The relationships among variables (NIST characteristics) <b>lets</b> <b>us</b> present a segmentation of the cloud landscape that we believe can inform where different projects may find examples of best practice or technology choices suitable in those type of projects. The joint representation informs projects about {{their position in the}} landscape, and informs standards developers about the relevant cloud activities when considering the landscape characteristics. Finally, measuring robustness for different partitions of the variables (all 13 characteristics; 5 essentials; 8 common) <b>lets</b> <b>us</b> reach conclusions about which of these partitions may be more meaningful and in that sense better.|$|R

It will <b>let</b> <b>us</b> make materials over fifty times lighter than steel or aluminium alloy but with the same strength. We'll be able to make jets, rockets, cars or even chairs that, by today's standards, would be remarkably light, strong, and inexpensive. Molecular surgical tools, guided by molecular computers and injected into the blood stream could find and destroy cancer cells or invading bacteria, unclog arteries, or provide oxygen when the circulation is impaired.|$|E
