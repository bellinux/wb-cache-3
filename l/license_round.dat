40|$|Extract: When {{examining}} {{and comparing}} Norwegian and Australian petroleum legislation and regulation, parallels exist between petroleum regulation in both jurisdictions, since each have common internalised functions. In particular, this includes a petroleum legislative framework that comprises acts, regulations, and administrative guidelines in each jurisdiction. Both countries award petroleum licences to participants, {{and may also}} stipulate conditions for the award of petroleum licences. Although Norway uses the North Sea model, and Australia the North American model, both jurisdictions use the award of petroleum licences in formal <b>licensing</b> <b>rounds</b> {{to establish and maintain}} a relationship between the State and the oil companies during the exploitation of petroleum resources. In addition, there are administrative provisions in each jurisdiction for the allocation of petroleum licences outside of these formal <b>licensing</b> <b>rounds.</b> This paper provides a descriptive overview of the regulation of petroleum activities in Australia and Norway, covering the legal framework, joint venture arrangements, and the decommissioning of petroleum structures...|$|R

IOCs that were awarded blocks include Petrobras, Maersk Oil, Cobalt, BP, Repsol, Total, Eni, ConocoPhillips, and Statoil. Some of those companies have slowed their investments in Angola’s presalt, and some wells have been closed and abandoned. The combination of disappointing results and geological complexity, compounded by the low-oil-price environment, has resulted in reduced investment in Angola’s presalt areas.

The search for hydrocarbons is at present focused on the Cretac-eous–Paleocene succession with the Paleocene deep-water play as the most promising (Lamers & Carmichael 1999). The exploration and evaluation of possible plays are almost solely based on seismic interpretation and limited log and core data from wells in the area west of the Shetlands.

It is not even mentioned in India's central government energy infrastructure or electricity generation plan documents through 2025.

40|$|After {{more than}} 30 years of {{exploration}} {{and more than}} 100 wells drilled in the Barents Sea, only one field is in production and one is under development. However, recent discoveries made {{over the last three}} years have heightened the interest for exploration in the region. Nevertheless, the industry is still facing major challenges in finding commercial volumes of hydrocarbons, despite the fact that numerous wells have encountered shows or minor amounts of gas and oil, proving a working hydrocarbon system in large parts of the area. Since 2008, 3 D controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data have been acquired in the Barents Sea, providing additional geophysical information in the last three <b>licensing</b> <b>rounds.</b> In this paper, we showed how CSEM data can help the industry make better decisions in various stages of exploration. CSEM data, being sensitive to hydrocarbon saturation and volume, have the potential to reduce the risk of exploration failures of a prospect by influencing the chance of success and the expected size and volume. To illustrate this, we showed three case examples. (1) How CSEM can support certain play models, and hence, give valuable information in a license application phase as well as in drilling decisions. (2) How CSEM can support decisions to apply or not apply for certain blocks in a <b>licensing</b> <b>round.</b> (3) How CSEM can help prospect ranking and drill-or-drop decisions. All these three cases demonstrate the power of using CSEM as a complementary tool together with seismic data and other geologic information. This paper argues that CSEM data could have provided a correct prediction for all of the wells drilled in the Barents Sea where 3 D CSEM data are available, provided there are sufficient sensitivity and 3 D inversion results. This in turn proves the value of acquiring CSEM data in addition to seismic...|$|R

In the grant system, the license will be granted to the company or joint venture that shows the highest interest and ability for the exploration of the license. This can be shown by the company experience, projected plan for the exploration (by high investment) and or longest presence on the country as a petroleum exploration company.|$|R

Esso was the first oil company to start drilling for oil off the coast of Norway.
