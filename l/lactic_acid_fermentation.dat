25|$|In industry, <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> is {{performed}} by lactic acid bacteria, which convert simple carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, or galactose to lactic acid.

2500|$|<b>Lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>{{fermentation}}</b> and ethanol fermentation {{can occur}} {{in the absence of}} oxygen. [...] This anaerobic fermentation allows many single-cell organisms to use glycolysis as their only energy source.|$|E
2500|$|These {{processes}} {{also were}} included in early fermentation of beer. These processes were introduced in early Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India, and still use the same basic biological methods. [...] In brewing, malted grains (containing enzymes) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific yeasts to produce beer. In this process, carbohydrates in the grains were broken down into alcohols such as ethanol. Later other cultures produced the process of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> which allowed the fermentation and preservation of other forms of food, such as soy sauce. Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce leavened bread. Although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until Louis Pasteur's work in 1857, {{it is still the}} first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form.|$|E
2500|$|According to his son-in-law, René Vallery-Radot, in August 1857 Pasteur sent a {{paper about}} <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> to the Société des Sciences de Lille, but {{the paper was}} read three months later. A memoire was {{subsequently}} published on November 30, 1857. In the memoir, he developed his ideas stating that: [...] "I intend to establish that, {{just as there is}} an alcoholic ferment, the yeast of beer, which is found everywhere that sugar is decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid, so also there is a particular ferment, a lactic yeast, always present when sugar becomes lactic acid." [...] Pasteur also wrote about alcoholic fermentation. It was published in full form in 1858. Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Justus von Liebig had proposed the theory that fermentation was caused by decomposition. Pasteur demonstrated that this theory was incorrect, and that yeast was responsible for fermentation to produce alcohol from sugar. He also demonstrated that, when a different microorganism contaminated the wine, lactic acid was produced, making the wine sour. In 1861, Pasteur observed that less sugar fermented per part of yeast when the yeast was exposed to air. The lower rate of fermentation aerobically became known as the Pasteur effect.|$|E
50|$|During {{or after}} the {{alcoholic}} fermentation, a secondary, or malolactic fermentation can also take place, during which specific strains of bacteria (lactobacter) convert malic acid into the milder <b>lactic</b> <b>acid.</b> This <b>fermentation</b> is often initiated by inoculation with desired bacteria.|$|R
40|$|Microbiological {{analyses}} of cucumbers fermented {{in cooperation with}} an industry pickle plant were performed to determine the major causes of bloating.

High <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacterial counts persisted throughout all fermentations and {{at no time did}} the yeast and/or coliform populations reappear. Strains of Lactobacillus b re vis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, both heterofermentative organisms, were isolated as possible causa-tive agents of bloating. However, bloating was not severe. Forty-five percent of the cucumbers examined after fermentation did not bloat, forty-six percent bloated slightly and only two percent exhibited moderate or advanced signs of bloating...|$|R
50|$|When {{ruminants}} consume diets high in starch or sugar, these easily fermentable carbohydrates {{promote the}} proliferation of S. bovis in the rumen. Because S. bovis is a <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacterium, <b>fermentation</b> of these carbohydrates to <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> can cause a dramatic decline in ruminal pH, and subsequent development of adverse conditions such as ruminal acidosis or feedlot bloat.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> occurs {{only when}} aerobic cells are lacking oxygen [...] However, some aerobic {{mammalian}} cells will preferentially use <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> over aerobic respiration. This phenomenon {{is called the}} Warburg effect and is found primarily in cancer cells. [...] Muscles cells under great exertion will also use <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> to supplement aerobic respiration. <b>Lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> is somewhat faster, although less efficient, than aerobic respiration, so in activities like sprinting it can help quickly provide needed energy to muscles.|$|E

50|$|The souring of African sorghum beer by <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> is {{responsible}} for the distinct sour taste.

40|$|Soy germ is a {{remarkable}} source of bioactive phytochemicals offering an interesting alternative as starting ingredient for fermented food. This work aimed to determine whether <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria <b>fermentation</b> of soy germ induces changes on its phytochemical composition. The antioxidant properties of fermented soy germ samples periodically taken during the fermentation process were evaluated and correlated with the concentration and structural modifications of isoflavones, saponins, phytosterols and tocopherols. Fermented soy germ extracts exhibited a higher inhibition effect against the superoxide anion radical, and lesser but significant ferric-reducing and DPPH radical scavenging effects compared with raw soy germ. By comparison to the traditional whole seed-based products, soy germ exhibits higher levels of isoflavones, saponins, phytosterols and tocopherols. All these phytochemicals contributed to the antioxidant capacity of soy germ and were conserved under <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria <b>fermentation...</b>|$|R
30|$|Fed-batch {{fermentation}} {{is normally}} used {{in order to}} avoid substrate-level inhibition in microbial fermentation (Bai et al. 2003). In comparison, batch and fed-batch fermentations may produce higher <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations than a continuous fermentation. Often, {{this is due to the}} complete consumption of substrates available in the batch and fed-batch fermentations, whereas there are always remaining residual concentrations of substrates in the continuous fermentation (Hofvendahl and Hahn-Hägerdal 2000; Abdel-Rahman et al. 2013). In-situ removal of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> from <b>fermentation</b> broth is another interesting strategy to reduce <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> product inhibition in the fermentation of LAB (Cui et al. 2016; Garret et al. 2015; Jianlong et al. 1994). Nonetheless, most of the studies on the extractive <b>fermentation</b> of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> using anion exchange resin are focusing on the improvement of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> production instead of cell biomass (Boonmee et al. 2016).

40|$|Thirteen {{varieties}} of cabbage, including five commonly used commercial varieties and eight newly developed hybrids, were analyzed {{for their ability}} to undergo <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentations.</b> The rates of fermentation, total quantities of acids produced, and chemical analyses indicate that 11 of the 13 selections could support adequate fermentation at any of the three stages of maturation. However, two varieties G 27 × G 51 (105) and G 60 × W- 1 (106), harvested during the earlier phases of the 1967 and 1968 growing seasons, failed to undergo proper fermentations and consistently resulted in producing putrid products. These hybrids when harvested at the late stage of maturation were capable of producing total titratable acidities comparable to the acceptable varieties. However the resulting sauerkrauts were judged to be of poor quality. The inability of these varieties to support adequate fermentations may be due to growth inhibitory substances or the lack of inherent maturation-dependent growth factor(s) essential for the growth of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria...|$|R

The biofilm reactors containing various pp composite chips were compared with a biofilm reactor containing pure polypropylene chips and with a reactor containing a suspension culture. Continuous fermentation was started, and each flow rate (0. 06 to 1. 92 ml/min) was held constant for 24 h; steady state was achieved after 10 h. <b>Lactic</b> <b>acid</b> production was determined throughout the 24 -h period by high-performance liquid chromatography.
