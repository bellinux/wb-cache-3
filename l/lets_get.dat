Lopez included [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] in the set list for her <b>Lets</b> <b>Get</b> Loud Tour in 2001 at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and on 11 February 2003 she included the song in her live video album [...] Cuban singer Gloria Estefan performed a cover version during the Selena ¡VIVE! concert in 2005; Tarradell commented in The Dallas Morning News that it had been a [...] "lovely rendition". Puerto Rican singer Ana recorded the song for her album Amor Latino. The Korean singer Im Tae Kyung performed a slower pop ballad version that incorporates a guitar as its musical foundation. A reggae-inspired version of the song appeared on Fiona's Best of Sweet Love.|$|E
