5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} {{on the outcome of}} the battle are mixed, with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action. Jylland is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.|$|E

The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the Golden Horn, while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus' galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from August 6 to the 7th also failed. With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to seriously threaten Constantinople again.

40|$|Given a polytope P ⊂ Rn, we {{say that}} P has a {{positive}} semidefinite <b>lift</b> (psd <b>lift)</b> <b>of</b> size d if one can express P as <b>the</b> linear projection <b>of</b> an affine slice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive semidefinite cone Sd+. If a polytope P has symmetry, we can consider equivariant psd lifts, i. e. those psd lifts that respect <b>the</b> symmetry <b>of</b> P. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simplest families <b>of</b> polytopes with interesting symmetries are regular polygons in the plane, which have {{played an important role}} in <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> linear programming <b>lifts</b> (or extended formulations). In this paper we study equivariant psd <b>lifts</b> <b>of</b> regular polygons. We first show that the standard Lasserre/sum-of-squares hierarchy for the regular N-gon requires exactly dN/ 4 e iterations and thus yields an equivariant psd <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> size linear in N. In contrast we show that one can construct an equivariant psd <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regular 2 n-gon of size 2 n − 1, which is exponentially smaller than <b>the</b> psd <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sum-of-squares hierarchy. Our construction relies on finding a sparse sum-of-squares certificate for <b>the</b> facet-defining inequalities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regular 2 n-gon, i. e., one that only uses a small (logarithmic) number of monomials. Since any equivariant LP <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regular 2 n-gon must have size 2 n, this gives <b>the</b> first example <b>of</b> a polytope with an exponential gap between sizes <b>of</b> equivariant LP <b>lifts</b> and equivariant psd lifts.

5|$|Peking opera was {{initially}} an exclusively male pursuit. The Qianlong Emperor had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance {{of women on}} the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. They were given a venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ban after {{the founding of the}} Republic of China in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.|$|E

On 1 October, Kadijević issued an ultimatum to Croatia threatening destruction of one civilian facility vital to the Croatian population for each military post captured by the ZNG.

5|$|The elytra allow beetles to both fly {{and move}} through {{confined}} spaces, doing so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before take off. The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles {{attached to the}} wing base; {{as long as the}} tension on the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In some day-flying species (for example, Buprestidae, Scarabaeidae), flight does not include large amounts of <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins. The altitude reached by beetles in flight varies. One study investigating the flight altitude of the ladybird species Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis using radar showed that, whilst the majority in flight over a single location were at 150–195m above ground level, some reached altitudes of over 1100m.|$|E

The first-order invariants for the idempotent <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automaton rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states in the rule may cause these invariants to behave differently from in the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{the river}} otter can walk, run, bound, or slide. Foot falls during walking and running follow the {{sequence}} of left limb, right limb, right limb, left limb. During walking, the limbs are moved in a plane parallel to the long axis of the body. Bounding {{is the result of}} simultaneous <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limbs off the ground.

Sliding occurs mostly on even surfaces of snow or ice, but can also occur on grassy slopes and muddy banks. Sliding across snow and ice is a rapid and efficient means of travel, and otters traveling over mountain passes, between drainages, or descending from mountain lakes often slide continuously for several hundred meters. Rear leg paddling enables continuous sliding where gravity is an insufficient or an opposing force. During winter, the river otters heavily use openings in the ice, and may excavate passages in beaver dams for accessing open water.|$|E

5|$|Bragg {{retained}} his position, relieving or reassigning {{the generals}} who had testified against him, and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units {{that he brought}} with him from Virginia. Despite the dysfunctional command climate under Bragg, and the lack of support from the War Department and President Davis concerning Bragg's removal, Longstreet did the best he could to continue to seek options in the Chattanooga Campaign. While Bragg resigned himself and his army to the siege of the Union Army of the Cumberland in Chattanooga, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> siege by Grant. He knew this Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport, Alabama, where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in Rome, Georgia, to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis, but it was disapproved by Bragg, who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg's arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by the Union Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on Bragg's part, but also because the War Department intended for Longstreet's men to return to Lee's army and this movement was in that direction.|$|E
