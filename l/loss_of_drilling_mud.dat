5000|$|From a model {{developed}} by geologists {{working in the}} UK, the drilling pipe penetrated the overpressured limestone, causing entrainment of mud by water. Whilst pulling the drill string out of the well, there were ongoing losses of drilling mud, {{as demonstrated by the}} daily drilling reports stating [...] "overpull increasing", [...] "only 50% returns" [...] and [...] "unable to keep hole full". The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> and associated drop in downhole mud weight eventually resulted in a drilling kick, with over 365 barrels of fluid erupting at the Banjar Panji-1 wellhead. Blowout preventers were closed to help kill the kick, which resulted in a spike in downhole pressure within the wellbore. The drilling-induced triggering model proposes that the increase in pressure within the wellbore was sufficiently high to induce a large hydraulic fracture in the formation. The extra pressure caused the hydraulic fractures to propagate 1-2 km to the surface and emerged 200 m away from the well. The lack of protective casing in the bottom 1742m of the borehole is considered a key reason why the drilling kick could not be controlled and why pressures during the kick were high enough to initiate hydraulic fracturing. Alternatively, it has also been suggested that the increased fluid pressure in the borehole, due to the kick, may have triggered reactivation of a nearby fault system, rather than hydraulic fracturing (in a similar manner to how fluid injection can induce seismicity). Though steel casing is used to protect the well bore in oil or gas exploration, this can only be applied in stages after each new section of the hole is drilled; see drilling for oil.|$|E
30|$|Wellbore {{instability}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} problems that engineers encounter during drilling. Borehole stability requires the knowledge of interaction between rock strength and in situ stress. The drilling of an in-gauge hole is an interplay of two factors: uncontrollable and controllable. Uncontrollable factors are the earth stresses (horizontal and vertical), pore pressure, rock strength and rock chemistry. Controllable factors include mud weight, wellbore azimuth and inclination (Mohiuddin and Khan 2007). Therefore, the way to prevent wellbore instability during drilling is to adjust engineering practices by choosing optimal wellbore trajectories and mud weights. From the mechanical perspective, a wellbore can fail by induced stresses (usually two types): shear failure and tensile failure, which can lead to a stuck pipe, wellbore breakout, induced fracture, poor cementation, side track, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> (Mclean and Addis 1994). Therefore, critical mud pressure should be considered in order to mitigate wellbore instability-related problems. Although, the selection of a suitable failure criterion for wellbore stability analysis is difficult and controversial (Al-Ajmi and Zimmerman 2009), numerous drilling engineers tried to predict wellbore stability prior to drilling, via different rock failure criteria, and they also investigated stress concentration around the wellbore in order to propose an optimum mud weight window for a successful drilling operation.|$|E
30|$|In {{the absence}} of a second well in the reservoir, tap water was heated and {{injected}} in five stages. The first test (= stage  0) was performed after the borehole reached a depth of 297  m TVD after <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> were encountered. Stages 1 – 4 followed after completion of the borehole and a pumping test.|$|R
30|$|For {{drilling}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry and geothermal exploration and production, fracture pressure is the pressure required to fracture the formation and to cause mud losses from a wellbore into the induced fractures. Fracture gradient is obtained by dividing the true vertical depth into the fracture pressure. The fracture gradient is the upper bound of the mud weight; therefore, the fracture gradient is an important parameter for mud weight design in both stages <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> planning and operations. If the downhole mud weight is higher than the formation fracture gradient, then the wellbore will have tensile failures (i.e., the formation will be fractured), causing <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> or even lost circulation (total <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> the mud). Therefore, fracture gradient prediction is directly related to drilling safety.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, the auditors' {{assessment}} use {{relatively low}} porosity {{figures for the}} highly fractured carbonate reservoirs at Shaikan. It has been difficult for some shareholders to reconcile the apparent low fracture porosity figures suggested in the audits {{with the fact that}} the drilling on Shaikan has been notoriously difficult because <b>of</b> huge <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> which have probably been lost into the fracture network. This is also in apparent contrast to reports from over 50 yrs earlier which indicated that the huge Kirkuk oil field in Kurdistan also has significant fracturing in its reservoirs and other apparent similarities between Kirkuk and Shaikan (Daniel, E. J., 1954, Fractured Reservoirs in the Middle East, AAPG Bull., v. 38, p. 774-815.) Daniels even refers to one well where a 14 ft timber when lowered into it was returned to surface after undergoing a 180 degree rotation! The former Chief Executive Officer of Gulf Keystone referred shortly before Christmas 2014 to [...] "the drill bit dropping three metres at Shaikan" [...] during the <b>drilling.</b> The likelihood <b>of</b> significant fracturing and potentially cavernous porosity at Shaikan appears to be real. The former Chief Executive Officer has also said that Shaikan has [...] "one hell of a fracture population".|$|R

In practical drilling operations, resistivity loggings, especially shallow lateral resistivity logging in gas hydrate bearing sediments (GHBS), are likely to be affected by <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> invasions. Here, we use available data from site measurements to construct a two-dimensional model for hydrate reservoirs around the borehole SH 2, a hole that was drilled during the first expedition in Shenhu area of South China Sea to examine and drill into gas hydrates. We then use this model to investigate the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> invasions and the effect <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> properties (e. g., temperature, density, and salinity) on resistivity logging using a numerical simulation. This simulation and associated calculations indicate that shallow lateral resistivity logging is significantly affected by variations in <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> temperature, which leads to hydrate dissociation and the formation of secondary hydrates. Increasing <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> salinity accelerates hydrate dissociation, and has a greater effect on shallow lateral resistivity logging than the free gas produced during drilling and any potential mud density influence, which is generally dependent on the depth at which the <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> invasion occurred. This means that future drilling operations should focus on ensuring that the temperature, salinity, and density <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>muds</b> remain within a reasonable range in order to minimize the effect of mud invasions on resistivity logging data.

The drilling rig which is used to carry out this drilling operation is divided into 5 (five) systems they include: •	Hoisting system: This is the part <b>of</b> the <b>drilling</b> rig the helps increment in the wellbore depth they includes the hoisting tower structure i. e. the mast and derrick, the substructure, the draw works(hoist), the derrick line and its accessories and finally the travelling and crown block. •	Circulating system: This is the path in which mud and cuttings pass through during the drilling process so as to enhance a better rate of penetration (ROP) by suspension of cuttings ensuring that bit cuts a fresh surface while rotating, they include the stand pipe, Kelly hose, the drill stem, the annulus, the mud return line, the shale shaker, the mud pit. •	Rotary system: This system aids in the rotary action which aids drilling, ensuring a better rate of penetration (ROP), they include the swivel, Kelly, rotary drive and rotary table •	Power system: This system provides all the necessary power to carry out the drilling work; this is basically the Gen set and any other power generating equipment. •	Well control and monitoring system: this system basically helps to monitor the drilling operation, drilling a well is very dangerous, because the pressure in the reservoir could be significant high, which normally about couple thousands psi.
