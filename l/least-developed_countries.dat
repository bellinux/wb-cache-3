40|$|Background: Recent {{cross-cultural}} {{comparisons between}} Asian and Western cultures {{have shown that}} ageism arises more {{from the lack of}} availability of social and economic resources for older adults than from the culture itself. We tested this assumption by conducting a survey among people living in a <b>least-developed</b> <b>country</b> compared with a developed country. Methods: Twenty-seven Belgians living in Belgium, 29 Burundians living in Belgium and 32 Burundians living in Burundi were included in this study. Their attitudes toward older adults were assessed using several self-reported measures. Results: Statistical analyses confirmed that older people are more negatively perceived by Burundians living in Burundi than by Burundians and Belgians living in Belgium, whose attitudes did not differ from each other. Conclusion: Consistent with our hypothesis, our results suggest that the level of development of a country and more particularly the lack of government spending on older people (pension and healthcare systems) may contribute to their younger counterparts perceiving them more negatively.

40|$|Lack {{of access}} to modern energy {{services}} is a daunting development challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. The promotion of renewable energy technologies (RETs) by development partners and government organizations {{is one way of}} meeting this challenge. Despite substantial investment of effort, the diffusion of RETs in Africa has been disappointing, leading to a search for more effective policies and approaches. In this paper, we discuss the role of technological innovation system (TIS) in fostering technology diffusion. We argue that the functional build up of TIS shapes technology diffusion levels in <b>least-developed</b> <b>country</b> settings. We report a comparative analysis of the biogas TIS in Kenya and Rwanda by applying the so-called the 'functions approach to innovation systems'. On this preliminary evidence, we argue that patterns of accumulation of TIS functions may determine rates of technology diffusion. We argue that to ensure accelerated diffusion of RETs, policy attention should be paid to improving the functional performance of TIS...|$|R

However the commercial herd has now shrunk by some 60 % in recent years to less than half a million head of cattle. Not only have export markets in Europe been lost but there is now a shortage of beef on local markets. Commentators suggest a recovery in commercial beef production could take up to ten years. Comment: Whether the Zimbabwean beef industry will ever export to the EU again is an open question. The recent granting of duty-free access to ACP <b>least-developed</b> <b>country</b> beef exports under the 'everything but arms' initiative has not led to any new exports, since SPS standards for beef now constitute a significant barrier to trade.

40|$|Ethiopia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} countries to climate change. This is because its important economic sector, agriculture, is virtually rain-fed. The role of the sector in the current economic structure and the potency of the anticipated biophysical impacts of climate change necessitates proactive adaptation in agriculture. This, however, breeds questions of adaptation costs and adaptation finance. This study attempts to derive plausible range of planned adaptation costs in agriculture along with their economy-wide and regional effects in Ethiopia. It also assess the economy-wide and regional effects of the likely options available to a government of a <b>least-developed</b> <b>country</b> to finance adaptation in agriculture. The results show that planned public adaptation in agriculture puts pressure on government surplus, impedes on manufacturing and private services, and GDP of urbanized regions. As such, it may strain the current macroeconomic endeavors of the country which puts government driven structural transformation and reducing fiscal deficit relative to GDP at the center. Government of Ethiopia may reconcile this by laying out incentives to urban agriculture and private investment in agriculture. Besides, foreign support in the form of biotechnology transfer and debt-relief may help to control the side effects of grants on foreign exchange market and trade balance...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a computable general {{equilibrium}} {{approach to}} simulate two opposing views describing regional trade agreements either as building blocks for or stumbling blocks to multilateral trade liberalization. This study focuses on {{the free trade agreement}} (FTA) between the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and the European Union (EU). Results show that although a regional trade agreement may slightly raise welfare among the members of the agreement, the cost to nonmembers can be high. In this paper we argue that multilateral liberalization and a regional free trade agreement between the EU and CEMAC are not mutually exclusive. Regional trade agreements should be complementary and consistent with a multilateral agreement, not an attempt to replace it. The regional breakdown in our design considers 14 regions, allowing for country-specific analysis for one <b>least-developed</b> <b>country</b> (Democratic Republic of Congo) and one non-least-developed country (Cameroon). Multilateral liberalization amplifies welfare gain for Cameroon. The Democratic Republic of Congo, with its weaker institutional capacity, is affected negatively. An EU-CEMAC FTA without multilateralism produces gains for both Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The gain for Cameroon is, however, moderate compared with that achieved when the EU-CEMAC FTA is accompanied with a multilateral agreement.

40|$|The article {{claims that}} the TRIPS standard-setting, i. e. {{strengthening}} IPRs in agriculture and pharmaceuticals carries mixed economic prospects and concerns for an agriculture-prone and densely populated <b>least-developed</b> <b>country</b> (LDC) like Bangladesh. With the lack of R&D due to low income, the standard-setting does not help the country to fulfil subsistence needs or promote economic development through innovations. However, exception clauses and special and differential treatment {{in terms of the}} compliance deadline coupled with technology transfer promises, carry economic development prospects for the country that is already known as a promising finished product manufacturer reverse-engineering existing seeds and pharmaceuticals. During the TRIPS transition period and afterwards the privileged position of an LDC is likely to serve both the ends of meeting survival needs and making economic progress with the supply of reverse-engineered products to home and abroad. However, to capitalize on such privileges, Bangladesh needs to streamline its existing IPR legislation, especially in defining patentable inventions with rigid qualifying clauses, broadening the extent of compulsory licensing and sticking with the TRIPS by adopting flexible interpretation and not going beyond the TRIPS. Similarly, the TRIPS needs to be more specific on technology transfer arrangements, which are currently 'best endeavour' nature objectives and principles. Therefore, LDCs should push for specific rules in WTO negotiations. 45 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Before the {{creation}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, individual countries were free to determine their own patent laws. This position has now changed. A WTO Agreement, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS Agreement), which is binding on all members, aims at establishing strong minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPRs). Such minimum standards include the implementation of patent protection for pharmaceuticals. Bangladesh {{is a member of the}} WTO and as a <b>least-developed</b> <b>country</b> (LDC) has been granted until 1 January 2016 to facilitate the introduction of pharmaceutical patents under the TRIPS Agreement into its national intellectual property legislative regime. This thesis analyses options for implementing TRIPS-compliant patent law in Bangladesh with a focus on pharmaceutical patents. Brazil and India were in a similar position prior to becoming TRIPS compliant, so those countries’ experiences become an important basis for the analysis of the transition to TRIPS-compliance in pre-compliant countries. This thesis combines doctrinal analysis, comparative reviews and a mixed-method research approach to answer the research questions as identified for the study. The thesis examines two underlying research questions: 1. Using the experience of India and Brazil, what are the different options available to Bangladesh to change existing patent law to comply with TRIPS in the area of pharmaceutical patents? 2. Using the options identified, what changes to the Bangladeshi patent law will need to be made to balance both pharmaceutical innovation and access to medicines in Bangladesh? To answer research question one, the thesis used doctrinal analysis and comparative reviews and then to answer research question two it used an original survey instrument and interviews to examine the views of identified stakeholders such as commercial entities in the pharmaceutical industry, relevant regulatory bodies in Bangladesh, public-health groups and academics [...] .

5000|$|This {{issue of}} {{compulsory}} licensing of drugs treating serious diseases was {{addressed by the}} Doha Declaration which recognized the problem and required the TRIPs council to find a solution. On 17 May 2006 the European Commission's official journal published Regulation 816/2006, which brings into force {{the provisions of the}} Doha Declaration.

However, {{it should be noted that}} this is not limited to only <b>least-developed</b> <b>countries</b> - every country that is a member of the WTO has the right under the TRIPs agreement to issue a compulsory license if there is a public health need.

40|$|CSR is {{a rising}} {{phenomena}} in Afghanistan – {{but why are}} firms concerned about CSR in a least-developed context such as Afghanistan, {{and what are the}} strategic benefits? This paper {{is one of the first}} to explore these CSR issues in a <b>least-developed</b> <b>country.</b> It does so by focusing on CSR in the Afghan telecommunication sector and in particular on ‘Roshan’ as a case company. The findings of this paper are two-folded. First, it provides an overview of the CSR practices in the telecommunication sector in Afghanistan. Second, it focuses on one case and explains whether Roshan can gain strategic advantages through CSR in Afghanistan, and if so which and how these strategic benefits are gained. The paper shows that the developmental challenges of Afghanistan are the key explanations for why companies engage in CSR. Roshan has engaged in proactive CSR to overcome the contextual barriers for growth. Based on an analysis of five CSR projects, it can be assessed that Roshan enhances its competitive advantage through CSR in internal, external, and wider- society levels. It is analyzed that Roshan influences its competitive context both from inside-out and out-side in dimensions, and that the CSR projects could all live up to the strategic CSR criteria drawn from the academic work of Porter and Kramer, Burke and Logsdon and Blowfield. Finally, the paper discusses how in a context of a weak state and civil society, and massive developmental challenges, CSR is not a matter of an ‘add-on choice’, but is based on a ‘license to operate’ motivation, where businesses have free room for maneuvering CSR towards their strategic priorities and business goals. Whether this creates a ‘shared value’ for both business and in particularly for the society is however still questionable...|$|R
40|$|Ethiopia, {{the most}} populous <b>least-developed</b> <b>country</b> outside of the World Trade Organization, is {{on the process of}} {{accession}} since 2003. What the potential implications of this accession will be for the financial service sector, which is widely closed from foreigners participation, is an interesting question since liberalization commitments under the GATS have different impact on different modes of supply and for different stakeholders. Financial services are key to any properly functioning economy and hence their liberalization which caries many advantages and risks is a sensitive issue requiring acceding governments to carefully handle the negotiation process by addressing their basic needs. This thesis discusses the impact of Ethiopian accession on its financial service sector focusing on the banking, insurance and micro finance sectors, and market access and national treatment issues. It identifies different commitment scenarios under each mode of supply considering the potential legal and economic impacts on stakeholders i. e. consumers, domestic financial institutions and the government of Ethiopia. It asserts that Ethiopian poor financial service sector which is dominated by the banking sector and public financial institutions will highly benefit from the conditional liberalization of mode 1 and mode 4; full liberalization of mode 2; and liberalization of mode 3 through branches, equity participation and/or subsidiaries. This combination of scenarios seems the most feasible that allows Ethiopia {{to take advantage of the}} liberalization process while simultaneously minimizing the spill-over risks. Moreover, acceding to the WTO alone will not enable Ethiopia to achieve growth in the financial service sector or economically. Therefore, the Ethiopian government should equally pay attention to solving domestic problems of regulation, corruption and lack of competition.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{prolonged}} freeze in EU sugar prices on the economies of ACP sugar suppliers was noted with concern by ACP Ministers at their June 2002 meeting in the Dominican Republic. They called on the EU to: recommend ways to more effectively share the burden imposed {{by the introduction of}} improved access for <b>least-developed</b> <b>country</b> sugar suppliers under the EBA; examine the possibility of increasing the market access granted to ACP suppliers {{in the light of the}} enlargement of the EU. Comment: The freeze in the EU sugar price has been exacerbated by the decline in the value of the Euro against the US$. This has been a particular problem for Caribbean sugar suppliers whose principal imports are all US$ denominated. The current recovery in the value of the Euro vis-à-vis the US$ (now almost at 1 : 1 parity) should improve US$ denominated earnings on Caribbean sugar exports to the EU. Of more serious concern in the long term however are the current European Commission proposals for 'the introduction of a decoupled system of payments per farm', which ultimately would be extended to a reformed sugar sector. Under this scenario EU sugar prices would drop dramatically to around world market price levels. The proposals being put forward in the rice sector, involving a one-off 50 % reduction in the EU rice price are indicative of how dramatic the price effects of such a reform process can be. ACP sugar suppliers will have to consider carefully how they could respond to this type of trajectory for the future of the EU sugar regime and will need to monitor carefully the current EU Council discussions on the Commission's proposals for the mid-term review of the CAP.
