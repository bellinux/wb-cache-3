5|$|The {{load borne}} by the two wheels varies not only with center of mass {{location}}, which in turn varies with the amount and location of passengers and luggage, but also with acceleration and deceleration. This phenomenon is known as <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> or weight transfer, depending on the author, and provides challenges and opportunities to both riders and designers. For example, motorcycle racers {{can use it to}} increase the friction available to the front tire when cornering, and attempts to reduce front suspension compression during heavy braking has spawned several motorcycle fork designs.|$|E

25|$|Trail {{can vary}} as the bike leans or steers. In {{the case of}} {{traditional}} geometry, trail decreases (and wheelbase increases if measuring distance between ground contact points and not hubs) as the bike leans and steers {{in the direction of}} the lean. Trail can also vary as the suspension activates, in response to braking for example. As telescopic forks compress due to <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> during braking, the trail and the wheelbase both decrease. At least one motorcycle, the MotoCzysz C1, has a fork with adjustable trail, from 89mm to 101mm.|$|E

25|$|Wood posts {{enable the}} {{fabrication}} of strong, direct, yet inexpensive connections between large trusses and walls. Exact details for post-to-truss connections vary from designer to designer, {{and may be}} influenced by post type. Solid-sawn timber and glulam posts are generally notched to form a truss bearing surface. The truss is rested on the notches and bolted into place. A special plate/bracket may be added to increase connection <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> capabilities. With mechanically-laminated posts, the truss may rest on a shortened outer-ply or on a shortened inner-ply. The later scenario places the bolts in double shear and is a very effective connection.|$|E
25|$|The {{reinforcement}} in a RC structure, {{such as a}} steel bar, has {{to undergo}} the same strain or deformation as the surrounding concrete {{in order to prevent}} discontinuity, slip or separation of the two materials under load. Maintaining composite action requires transfer of load between the concrete and steel. The direct stress is transferred from the concrete to the bar interface so as to change the tensile stress in the reinforcing bar along its length, this <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> is achieved by means of bond (anchorage) and is idealized as a continuous stress field that develops {{in the vicinity of the}} steel-concrete interface.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{previous}} factors, {{one of the biggest}} difficulties with offshore wind farms is the ability to predict loads. Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw) platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for floating systems. Foundations and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore wind systems, and must take into account every single one of these factors. <b>Load</b> <b>transfer</b> in the grout between tower and foundation may stress the grout, and elastomeric bearings are used in several British sea turbines.|$|E

Assuming that each main transformer could carry 100  % of the load, and the automatic switching could make a part of <b>loads</b> <b>transferred,</b> the remaining part would be transferred through the connection between stations, therefore there will be 1.3  MW <b>load</b> <b>transferred</b> in 5  h, which cannot reach the safety standard {{in view of the}} overlong time.|$|R

40|$|A novel shortfiber {{composite}} {{in which}} the microscopic advanced fiber reinforcements are coated with radially aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is analyzed in this study. A shear-lag model is developed to analyze the <b>load</b> <b>transferred</b> to such coated fibers from the aligned-CNT reinforced matrix in a hybrid composite application. It is found that if the carbon fibers are coated with radially aligned CNTs, then the axial <b>load</b> <b>transferred</b> to the fiber is reduced due to stiffening of the matrix by the CNTs. Importantly, it is shown that at low loading of CNTs in the polymer matrix, {{there is a significant}} reduction in the maximum interfacial shear stress, e. g., at 1 % CNTs, there is an ~ 25 % reduction in this maximum stress. Further, the modification in the load sharing between the fiber and the matrix plateaus at ~ 2 % CNT matrix loading, indicating a small but critical window for engineering the interface in this manner. Effects of the variation of the aspect ratio of the fiber, CNT volume fraction and the application of radial load on the <b>load</b> <b>transferred</b> to such CNT coated fibers are also investigated...|$|R
25|$|Three inch (7.5cm) {{diameter}} bolts connect {{portions of}} the bridge deck mounting bosses to several concrete columns. There are 288 such bolts of various lengths. The bolts were tested in place by overtightening their retaining nuts. In the two weeks subsequent to this tightening, 30 of the first 96 bolts loaded failed. These bolts vary in length from 9 to 17 feet and failure was initially attributed to hydrogen embrittlement, with hydrogen introduced during either manufacturing or electroplating. Some of the bolts can be replaced while others cannot be removed and <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> will require more complex remediation methods. Repairs were initially not expected to delay the opening, but later it was believed it would delay the opening until December. The fix could cost up to five million dollars. A temporary fix was announced on August 15, 2013, with the opening revised back to its original date. The solution selected was to add a tendon-secured saddle at each deck boss location. It was suggested internally that issues with tensioning the main cable {{may have led to}} the bolt failures.|$|E
50|$|Lowering the CoM {{towards the}} ground is one method of {{reducing}} <b>load</b> <b>transfer.</b> As a result <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> is reduced in both the longitudinal and lateral directions. Another method of reducing <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> is by increasing the wheel spacings. Increasing the vehicle's wheelbase (length) reduces longitudinal <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> while increasing the vehicle's track (width) reduces lateral <b>load</b> <b>transfer.</b> Most high performance automobiles are designed to sit {{as low as possible}} and usually have an extended wheelbase and track.|$|E
50|$|In wheeled vehicles, <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> is the {{measurable}} {{change of}} load borne by different wheels during acceleration (both longitudinal and lateral). This includes braking, and deceleration (which is an acceleration at a negative rate).No {{motion of the}} center of mass relative to the wheels is necessary, and so <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> may be experienced by vehicles with no suspension at all. <b>Load</b> <b>transfer</b> is a crucial concept in understanding vehicle dynamics. The same is true in bikes, though only longitudinally.|$|E

It uses a kinematic suspension force called [...] "position sensitive anti-squat." [...] When a vehicle accelerates the suspension reacts (typically in the form of suspension compression) to a phenomenon called <b>load</b> <b>transfer.</b> The position-sensitive anti-squat of dw-link offsets the rearward <b>load</b> <b>transfer</b> that happens during vehicle acceleration.

50|$|Weight {{transfer}} is generally of far less practical importance than <b>load</b> <b>transfer,</b> for cars and SUVs at least.

Total available grip will drop by around 6% {{as a result of this}} <b>load</b> <b>transfer.</b> At the same time, the CoM of the vehicle will typically move laterally and vertically, relative to the contact patch by no more than 30 mm, leading to a weight transfer of less than 2%, and a corresponding reduction in grip of 0.01%.|$|E

40|$|An {{interacting}} particle {{model for}} <b>load</b> <b>transferring</b> in parallel architectures is defined. In {{the case of}} an infinite lattice the model is proved to be ergodic and to converge exponentially fast to its equilibrium. When the architecture is that of a complete graph, the total number of loads behaves as a birth and death process, and explicit upper bounds on the benefits that can be expected from a transferring policy are derived. Experimental results for different types of architectures are presented and compared to the solution of the mean field equations. There is fairly good agreement between the two for quantities of practical interest. Key Words: <b>Load</b> <b>transferring,</b> Interacting particle system, ergodicity.
