40|$|Fusion {{proteins}} {{allow for}} the analysis of receptor/G protein coupling under defined conditions. The beta 2 -adrenoceptor (beta 2 AR) fused to the long splice variant of Gsalpha (Gsalpha L) exhibits a higher apparent constitutive activity than the beta 2 -adrenoceptor fused to the short splice variant of Gsalpha (Gsalpha S). Experimentally, this results in higher efficacy and potency of partial agonists and in higher efficacy of inverse agonists at the beta 2 AR <b>fused</b> to Gsalpha <b>L</b> relative to the beta 2 AR fused to Gsalpha S, indicating that the agonist-free beta 2 AR and the beta 2 AR occupied by partial agonists promote GDP dissociation from Gsalpha L more efficiently than from Gsalpha S. In fact, the GDP affinity of Gsalpha S fused to the beta 2 AR is higher than the GDP affinity of Gsalpha <b>L</b> <b>fused</b> to the beta 2 AR. We asked the question whether the histamine H 2 -receptor (H 2 R) exhibits similar coupling to Gsalpha splice variants as the beta 2 AR. To address this question, we studied H 2 R-Gsalpha fusion proteins expressed in Sf 9 cells. In contrast to beta 2 AR-Gsalpha fusion proteins, the potencies and efficacies of partial agonists and the efficacies of inverse agonists were similar at the H 2 R <b>fused</b> to Gsalpha <b>L</b> and Gsalpha S as assessed by guanosine- 5 '-O-(3 -thio) triphosphate binding and/or steady-state GTPase activity. However, the time course analysis of guanosine- 5 '-O-(3 -thio) triphosphate binding indicated that Gsalpha S fused to the H 2 R possesses a higher GDP-affinity than Gsalpha <b>L</b> <b>fused</b> to the H 2 R. Our data show that the H 2 R <b>fused</b> to Gsalpha <b>L</b> and Gsalpha S possesses similar constitutive activity and is insensitive to differences in GDP affinity of Gsalpha splice variants.

40|$|Borna disease virus (BDV) is a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA {{virus that}} {{replicates}} and transcribes its genome in {{the nucleus of}} infected cells. BDV proteins involved in replication and transcription must pass through the nuclear envelope to associate with the genomic viral RNA. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) of BDV is postulated to be the catalytic enzyme of replication and transcription. We demonstrated previously that BDV L localizes to the nucleus of BDV-infected cells and L-transfected cells. Nuclear localization of the protein presupposes {{the presence of a}} nuclear localization signal (NLS) within its primary amino acid sequence or cotransport to the nucleus with another karyophilic protein. Because L localized to the nucleus in the absence of other viral proteins, we investigated the possibility that L contains an NLS.

To develop an M. pulmonis-specific antigen for serological diagnosis, we cloned the cDNA of P 46 -like lipoprotein (P 46 L), an M. pulmonis putative periplas-mic protein. P 46 L is a homolog of P 46, an M. hyopneumoniae antigen. We produced recombinant P 46 <b>L</b> <b>fused</b> to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in Escherichia coli. Immunoblot analysis revealed that sera from Mycoplasma-infected mice and rats contained anti-P 46 L antibod-ies. We developed an ELISA using the recombinant P 46 L-GST protein as an antigen. Thirteen of the 14 samples from rats naturally infected with M. pulmonis were determined to be positive according to the commercial ELISA (MONILISA Myco) and positive by our ELISA. Furthermore, 18 / 19 samples from mice experimentally infected with M. pulmonis were positive using our P 46 L-GST ELISA. In contrast, only 8 / 19 samples from infected mice were positive by the commercial ELISA.

Glioblastoma multiforme, {{the most aggressive}} form of glioma, is a lethal brain tumor with a dismal median survival of 15 - 19 months. Immunotherapy is a promising adjuvant therapy for malignant brain tumors. Lack of adequate, endogenous antigen presentation and the immune suppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment present significant hurdles {{that need to be}} overcome in order to mount an effective immune response, capable of tumor elimination. Vaccination with tumor-derived antigen has sought to overcome inadequate antigen presentation, yet has shown to been inefficient at complete tumor elimination. Functionally unresponsiveness, anergy, can be induced in immune cells when antigen recognition occurs without proper costimulation. To test if additional costimulation was necessary to achieve a functional immune response, costimulatory molecules 41 BBL, CD 80, GITRL and OX 40 <b>L,</b> <b>fused</b> to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin, were tested in combination with tumor vaccine. Vaccine/Fc-OX 40 L yielded the most potent response resulting in complete tumor regression in the majority of animals and the generation of immunological memory capable of rapidly clearing tumor upon tumor rechallenge. Additionally, combining vaccine/Fc-OX 40 L with the standard of care chemotherapy resulted in regression of 100 % of glioma tumors, however 80 % of these animals developed fatal secondary lymphoid malignancy. These data demonstrate Fc-OX 40 L has incredibly potent activity against experimental gliomas relative to the other molecules tested. In addition, it reveals a potential hazard in combining mutagenic chemotherapeutics with immunotherapy. Lymphocytes isolated from vaccine/Fc-OX 40 L treated animals had enhanced cytolytic activity and increased proliferative capacity, compared to controls. Additional analysis demonstrated a CD 4 T cell, NK, and B cell dependent, and CD 8 T cell independent mechanism of action. The presence of tumor reactive antibody in the serum of treated mice and deposition of antibody at the tumor site, combined with the observation that loss of the Fc receptor negatively affected the ability of animals to control tumor growth generated interest in antibody-mediated mechanisms. Tumor infiltration of perforin expressing NK, NKT, and neutrophil-like cells in vaccine/Fc-OX 40 L treated animals may provide a possible mechanism of tumor killing. Further understanding the necessary effector cells and mechanisms involved in tumor elimination will aid in the design of future immunotherapy approaches...|$|R

Methodology/Principal Findings: To analyze real-time trafficking of vRNPs in live infected cells, we created a recombinant Sendai virus (SeV), rSeVLeGFP, which expresses <b>L</b> protein <b>fused</b> to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The rSeVLeGFP showed similar growth kinetics compared to wt SeV, and newly synthesized LeGFP could be detected as early as 8 h postinfection.

Analysis of LeGFP movement using time-lapse digital video microscopy revealed directional and saltatory movement of LeGFP along microtubules. Treatment of the cells with nocodazole restricted vRNP movement and reduced progeny virion production without affecting viral protein synthesis, suggesting the role of microtubules in vRNP trafficking and virus assembly. Further study with an electron microscope showed close association of vRNPs with intracellular vesicles present in infected cells.

Each mouse was immunized either intraperitoneally (i. p.) or subcutaneously (s. c.) with three doses (at 2 -week intervals) of the various antigen combinations in alum adjuvant and then challenged in mouse models featuring different infection routes with multiple Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. In the i. p. infection sepsis model, H 70 +YLN consistently provided significant protection against three different challenge strains (serotypes 1, 2, and 6 A); the CD 2 +YLN and H 70 +L 460 D combinations also elicited significant protection. Protection against intravenous (i. v.) sepsis (type 3 and 6 A challenge strains) was largely dependent on PspA-derived antigen components, and the most protection was elicited by H 70 with or without L 460 D or YLN. In a type 4 intratracheal (i. t.) challenge model that results in progression to meningitis, antigen combinations that contained YLN elicited the strongest protection.

40|$|Background: The l‑arabinose {{isomerase}} is an intracellular enzyme which converts l‑arabinose into l‑ribulose {{in living}} systems and d‑galactose into d‑tagatose in industrial processes and at industrial scales. d‑tagatose {{is a natural}} ketohex‑ ose with potential uses in pharmaceutical and food industries. The d‑galactose isomerization reaction is thermody‑ namically equilibrated, and leads to secondary subproducts at high pH. Therefore, an attractive l‑arabinose isomerase should be thermoactive and acidotolerant with high catalytic efficiency. While many reports focused on the set out of a low cost process for the industrial production of d‑tagatose, these procedures remain costly. When compared to intracellular enzymes, the production of extracellular ones constitutes an interesting strategy to increase the suitabil‑ ity of the biocatalysts. Results: The l‑arabinose isomerase (l‑AI) from Lactobacillus sakei was expressed in Lactococcus lactis in fusion with the signal peptide of usp 45 (SPUsp 45).

40|$|Background Mutations in calcium-responsive transactivator (CREST) {{encoding}} gene {{have been}} recently linked to ALS. Similar to several proteins implicated in ALS, CREST contains a prion-like domain and {{was reported to}} be a component of paraspeckles. Results We demonstrate that CREST is prone to aggregation and co-aggregates with FUS but not with other two ALS-linked proteins, TDP- 43 and TAF 15, in cultured cells. Aggregation of CREST affects paraspeckle integrity, probably by trapping other paraspeckle proteins within aggregates. Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules. Neither of the CREST mutations described in ALS alters its subcellular localization, stress granule recruitment or detergent solubility; however Q 388 stop mutation results in elevated steady-state levels and more frequent nuclear aggregation of the protein. Both wild-type protein and its mutants negatively affect neurite network complexity of unstimulated cultured neurons when overexpressed, with Q 388 stop mutation being the most deleterious. When overexpressed in the fly eye, wild-type CREST or its mutants lead to severe retinal degeneration without obvious differences between the variants. Conclusions Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity. A change in CREST levels in neurons which might occur under pathological conditions would have a profound negative effect on neuronal homeostasis.

Various TNFRSF agonists have been clinically evaluated, but {{have met with}} limited efficacy and/or toxicity. Recent insights indicate that 'first-generation' TNFRSF agonists lack efficacy as they do not effectively cross-link their corresponding receptor. Reversely, ubiquitous TNFRSF receptor(s) cross-linking by CD 40 and Fas agonistic antibodies resulted in dose-limiting liver toxicity. To overcome these issues, we developed a novel pretargeting strategy exploiting recombinant fusion proteins in which a soluble form of TRAIL, FasL or CD 40 <b>L</b> is genetically <b>fused</b> to a high-affinity anti-fluorescein scFv antibody fragment (scFvFITC).

However, detection of VLP-specific antibodies in sera does not always indicate a malignant lesion as positive results may also be due to a nonmalignant viral infection. Furthermore, malignant lesions are associated with an increased antibody titer for E 6 and E 7 proteins. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an ELISA using a novel chimeric virus-like particle (cVLP) encoding an <b>L</b> 1 protein <b>fused</b> with a string of HPV- 16 E 6 and E 7 seroreactive epitopes to its C-terminus to be used for detection of HPV- 16 specific antibodies in patients with cervical intraepithelial lesion grade 1 (CIN 1). Results The sera of 30 patients with CIN 1 who also tested positive for HPV- 16 DNA and of 30 age-matched normal donors negative for HPV infection were tested for the {{presence of}} IgG antibodies specific for either VLP-L 1 (HPV- 16 L 1), gVLP (derived from Gardasil), or cVLP by ELISA. The cVLP-reactive sera yielded two distinct groups of results: (H) reactivity levels that presented very strong cVLP-specific titers, and (L) reactivity levels with significantly lower titers similar to those obtained with VLP-L 1 and gVLP antigens. Additionally, the sera that presented the higher cVLP titers closely matched those that had significantly stronger reactivity to E 6 and E 7 epitopes. Interestingly, the samples with the highest titers corresponded to patients with the higher numbers of sexual partners and pregnancies. On the other hand only 4 out of the 12 sera that harbored antibodies with VLP neutralizing ability corresponded to the group with high cVLP antibody titers. Conclusion We report for the first time that chimeric particles containing HPV- 16 <b>L</b> 1 protein <b>fused</b> with E 6 and E 7 seroreactive epitopes enable much better detection of IgG antibodies in the sera of CIN 1 patients positive for HPV- 16 infection than those obtained with VLPs containing only the HPV- 16 L 1 protein. We also found that the sera with higher cVLP antibody titers corresponded to patients with more sexual partners and pregnancies, and not always with to those with a high neutralizing activity. This novel assay could help in the development of a tool to evaluate cervical cancer risk. </p...|$|R
40|$|Paramyxoviruses are {{assembled}} at {{the plasma}} membrane budding sites after synthesis {{of all the}} structural components in the cytoplasm. Although viral ribonuclocapsid (vRNP) is {{an essential component of}} infectious virions, the process of vRNP translocation to assembly sites is poorly understood. To analyze real-time trafficking of vRNPs in live infected cells, we created a recombinant Sendai virus (SeV), rSeVLeGFP, which expresses <b>L</b> protein <b>fused</b> to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The rSeVLeGFP showed similar growth kinetics compared to wt SeV, and newly synthesized LeGFP could be detected as early as 8 h postinfection. The majority of LeGFP co-localized with other components of vRNPs, NP and P proteins, suggesting the fluorescent signals of LeGFP represent the locations of vRNPs. Analysis of LeGFP movement using time-lapse digital video microscopy revealed directional and saltatory movement of LeGFP along microtubules. Treatment of the cells with nocodazole restricted vRNP movement and reduced progeny virion production without affecting viral protein synthesis, suggesting the role of microtubules in vRNP trafficking and virus assembly. Further study with an electron microscope showed close association of vRNPs with intracellular vesicles present in infected cells. In addition, the vRNPs co-localized with Rab 11 a protein, which is known to regulate the recycling endocytosis pathway and Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking. Simultaneous movement between LeGFP and Rab 11 a was also observed in infected cells, which constitutively express mRFP-tagged Rab 11 a. Involvement of recycling endosomes in vRNP translocation was also suggested by the fact that vRNPs move concomitantly with recycling transferrin labeled with Alexa 594. Collectively, our results strongly suggest a previously unrecognized involvement of the intracellular vesicular trafficking pathway in vRNP translocation and provide new insights into the transport of viral structural components to the assembly sites of enveloped viruses...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of the interferon-induced antiviral state was studied in heterokaryons and cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids). An autoradiographic assay for the antiviral state, in which the percentage of cells containing vaccinia viral DNA factories was determined, was used. The {{expression of}} the antiviral state was dominant in homokaryons and heterokaryons formed by fusion of interferon-treated cells with untreated cells. Cytoplasts derived from treated cells conferred resistance to virus growth on cybrids formed by fusing such cytoplasts with untreated cells. Treatment of L cell x HeLa cell heterokaryons with human interferon or mouse interferon was much less effective in inducing a detectable antiviral state than was similar treatment of parental cells with homospecific interferon. The antiviral state was fully induced when heterokaryons were treated simultaneously with both types of interferon. Cybrids formed by <b>fusing</b> <b>L</b> cell cytoplasts with HeLa cells or HeLa cytoplasts with L cells did not enter a detectable antiviral state after treatment with interferon specific for the cell type of the enucleated parent. However, treatment of cybrids with interferon specific for the cell type of the nucleated parent was effective in inducing a detectable antiviral state...|$|R
40|$|Ordering of {{regression}} or classification coefficients {{occurs in}} many real-world applications. Fused Lasso exploits this ordering by explicitly regularizing {{the differences between}} neighboring coefficients through an l 1 norm regularizer. However, due to nonseparability and nonsmoothness of the regularization term, solving the fused Lasso problem is computationally demanding. Existing solvers can only deal with problems of small or medium size, or a special case of the fused Lasso problem in which the predictor matrix is the identity matrix. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the split Bregman method to solve a class of large-scale fused Lasso problems, including a generalized fused Lasso and a fused Lasso support vector classifier. We derive our algorithm using an augmented Lagrangian method and prove its convergence properties. The performance of our method is tested on both artificial data and real-world applications including proteomic data from mass spectrometry and genomic data from array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). We demonstrate that our method is many {{times faster than the}} existing solvers, and show that it is especially efficient for large p, small n problems, where p is the number of variables and n is the number of samples.

40|$|Summary. We {{consider}} the supervised classification setting, {{in which the}} data consist of p features measured on n observations, each of which belongs to one of K classes. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical method for this problem. However, in the high dimensional setting where p n, LDA is not appropriate for two reasons. First, the standard estimate for the within-class covariance matrix is singular, and so the usual discriminant rule cannot be applied. Second, when p is large, {{it is difficult to}} interpret the classification rule that is obtained from LDA, since it involves all p features. We propose penalized LDA, which is a general approach for penalizing the discriminant vectors in Fisher’s discriminant problem in a way that leads to greater interpretability. The discriminant problem is not convex, so we use a minorization–maximization approach to optimize it efficiently when convex penalties are applied to the discriminant vectors. In particular, we {{consider the}} use of <b>L</b> 1 and <b>fused</b> lasso penalties. Our proposal is equivalent to recasting Fisher’s discriminant problem as a biconvex problem. We evaluate the performances of the resulting methods on a simulation study, and on three gene expression data sets. We also survey past methods for extending LDA to the high dimensional setting and explore their relationships with our proposal...|$|R
40|$|Infections with shiga toxin-producing bacteria, like enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae, {{represent}} a serious medical problem. No specific and effective treatment {{is available for}} patients with these infections, creating a need {{for the development of}} new therapies. Recombinant lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis was engineered to bind Shiga toxin by displaying novel designed albumin binding domains (ABD) against Shiga toxin 1 B subunit (Stx 1 B) on their surface. Functional recombinant Stx 1 B was produced in Escherichia coli and used as a target for selection of 17 different ABD variants (named S 1 B) from the ABD scaffold-derived high-complex combinatorial library in combination with a five-round ribosome display. Two most promising S 1 Bs (S 1 B 22 and S 1 B 26) were characterized into more details by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance and microscale thermophoresis. Addition of S 1 Bs changed the subcellular distribution of Stx 1 B, completely eliminating it from Golgi apparatus most likely by interfering with its retrograde transport. All ABD variants were successfully displayed on the surface of <b>L.</b> lactis by <b>fusing</b> to the Usp 45 secretion signal and to the peptidoglycan-binding C terminus of AcmA. Binding of Stx 1 B by engineered lactococcal cells was confirmed using flow cytometry and whole cell ELISA.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between the L. pneumophila phagosome and monocyte lysosomes were investigated by prelabeling the lysosomes with thorium dioxide, an electron-opaque colloidal marker, and by acid phosphatase cytochemistry. Phagosomes containing live L. pneumophila did not fuse with secondary lysosomes at 1 h after entry into monocytes or at 4 or 8 h after entry by which time the ribosome-lined L. pneumophila replicative vacuole had formed. In contrast, the majority of phagosomes containing formalin-killed L. pneumophila, live Streptococcus pneumoniae, and live Escherichia coli had fused with secondary lysosomes by 1 h after entry into monocytes. Erythromycin, a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis, at a concentration that completely inhibits L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication, had no influence on fusion of L. pneumophila phagosomes with secondary lysosomes. However, coating live L. pneumophila with antibody or with antibody and complement partially overcame the inhibition of fusion. Also activating the monocytes promoted fusion of {{a small proportion of}} phagosomes containing live L. pneumophila with secondary lysosomes. Acid phosphatase cytochemistry revealed that phagosomes containing live L. pneumophila did not fuse with either primary or secondary lysosomes. In contrast to phagosomes containing live bacteria, the majority of phagosomes containing formalin-killed <b>L.</b> pneumophila were <b>fused</b> with lysosomes by acid phosphatase cytochemistry. The capacity of L. pneumophila to inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion may be a critical mechanism by which the bacterium resists monocyte microbicidal effects...|$|R
30|$|Previously, {{our group}} {{reported}} that Arabidopsis RopGEF 7, grouped {{into the same}} clade with OsRopGEF 7 B (Additional file 1 : Figure S 7), maintains the stem cell niche by auxin-dependent PLT pathway. Knock-down of AtRopGEF 7 by RNA interference technique indicated that AtRopGEF 7 can regulate the auxin efflux transporter PIN 1, PIN 3 and PIN 7 accumulation and thereby affects polar auxin transport that affects root development (Chen et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2014). Additionally, auxin plays vital roles in determining floral organ development. Plants harboring mutations in PIN 1 often show strong defects in inflorescence with naked stems, often produce only a few abnormal flowers. pin 1 mutant flowers exhibit variable petals number, fused floral organs, and expansion of the stylar and stigmatic regions of the gynoecium (Okadala et al. 1991; Cheng and Zhao 2007; Yamaguchi et al. 2013; Holt et al. 2014). Similarly, osropgef 7 b- 1 and RNAi <b>L</b> 31 exhibited <b>fused</b> ovaries (Table 1; Figs. 2 i-q, 4 f-j), and osropgef 7 b- 1 showed three glumes (Fig. 2 h). Though our {{results indicated that the}} transcripts of all four OsPIN 1 members are maintained at the same levels in osropgef 7 b- 1 and RNAi L 31 as those in the wild type (Additional file 1 : Figure S 5 C, D), we could not exclude the possibility that OsRopGEF 7 B might regulate PIN 1 at the posttranscriptional level.|$|R
