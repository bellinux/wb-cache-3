50|$|Composition leather is {{made from}} {{recycled}} leather off-cuts, trimmings and shavings that would normally be sent by the leather industry to landfill. The type of leather specifically used {{in the manufacture of}} composition leather is called ‘wet blue’. This raw material, which is duck-egg blue in colour (hence the name), comes straight from tanning. The shavings are bonded to a fabric layer commonly using a process such a hydro-entanglement to force the <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> into the fabric layer. The product is then finished, typically with a polyurethane based system to give a resemblance of leather. The amount of leather shavings within the final product typically constitute less than 50% of the product.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} effect on the {{incidence}} of cancer of exposure to chemicals handled in the leather tanning industry. MATERIALS AND METHODS [...] A case-control study was performed within a cohort of 2487 workers employed for at least six months during the period 1900 - 89 in three Swedish leather tanneries. 68 cancer cases (lung, stomach, bladder, kidney, nasal, and pancreatic cancers and soft tissue sarcomas) and 178 matched controls were studied. Effects of chemical exposures on cancer incidence, adjusted for age at risk, sex, and plant were estimated with a conditional logistic regression model. RESULTS [...] A significant association was found between exposure to <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> and pancreatic cancer (odds ratio (OR) 7. 19, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 44 to 35 - 89). An association was indicated between <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> from vegetable tanning and lung cancer. After adjustment for smoking habits a tentative association between organic solvents and lung cancer lost its significance. No association was found between exposure to chlorophenols and soft tissue sarcomas. CONCLUSIONS [...] The significant association between leather tanning and soft tissue sarcomas that was found in our previous cohort analysis could not be explained by exposure to chlorophenols. On the other hand a significant association was found between exposure to <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> and pancreatic cancer, and exposure to <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> from vegetable tanning was often present in cases with lung cancer. Due to the small numbers of cases, the results can, however, only lead to tentative conclusions...|$|E

One of the substrates was grape seeds, which have an agricultural origin, whereas the other substrate was vegetable-tanned <b>leather</b> <b>dust,</b> which has an industrial origin. Under the assumed experimental conditions of the performed lab-scale test series, the grape seed substrate exhibited a resulting net methane production of 175. 0 NmLg volatile solids (VS) − 1; hence, it {{can be considered as}} a potential energy source via anaerobic digestion. Conversely, the net methane production obtained from the anaerobic digestion of the vegetable-tanned <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> substrate was limited to 16. 1 NmLgVS− 1. A detailed characterization of the obtained digestates showed that there were both nitrogen-containing compounds and complex organic compounds present in the digestate that was obtained from the mixture of <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> and inoculum. As a general perspective of this experimental study, the application of diversified characterization analyzes could facilitate (1) {{a better understanding of the}} main properties of the obtained digestates to evaluate their potential valorization, and (2) a combination of the digestate characteristics with the corresponding methane productions to comprehensively evaluate the bioconversion process...|$|E

40|$|Background: Sinonasal cancer (SNC) {{is a rare}} tumor with {{predominant}} occupational etiology {{associated with}} exposures to specific carcinogens. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe SNC cases recorded in Italy in the period 2000 - 2016. Methods: Clinical information, occupational history, and lifestyle habits of SNC cases collected in the Italian Sinonasal Cancer Register were examined. Age-standardized rates were estimated. Results: Overall, 1529 cases were recorded. The age-standardized incidence rates per 100000 person-years were 0. 65 in men and 0. 26 in women. Occupational exposures were predominant among the attributed exposure settings, primarily to wood and <b>leather</b> <b>dusts.</b> Other putative causal agents included chrome, solvents, tannins, formaldehyde, textile dusts, and pesticides. Many cases had unknown exposure.

40|$|A large {{case-control study}} of bladder cancer (2982 cases; 5782 controls) {{included}} information about occupational exposure to leather. Occupational histories of exposed white study subjects were reviewed and 150 {{were determined to}} have had "true" on the job exposure to leather. The odds ratio estimate (OR) of bladder cancer associated with such exposure in white subjects (n = 8063) was 1. 4 (95 % confidence limits = 1. 0, 1. 9) after adjustment for sex, age, and cigarette smoking. The risk was highest in those first employed in a leather job before 1945, although no dose-response relation with duration of leather employment was found. Subjects employed in "dusty" leather jobs had a slightly higher risk than those {{with other types of}} leather jobs. Our results are consistent with reports of an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with exposure to leather. Although the agents responsible have not been identified, our findings of an increased risk associated with exposure in the earlier years of this century and in dusty jobs suggest that <b>leather</b> <b>dusts</b> may be important...|$|R

40|$|Using {{the renowned}} shoe {{manufacturing}} sector in Marche Region (Italy) as a case-study, this paper {{deals with the}} characterisation of (1) the chemical and physical properties of representative types of shoe manufacturing wastes, (2) the quality profile of a particular material recovery finalised to a soil destination, and (3) the flue gas emissions from burning tests {{in view of the}} potential for energy recovery. The property characterisation has primarily revealed the following aspects: a general condition of resulting higher ash contents in shoe waste materials having a mineral or synthetic processing origin; and relatively high energy contents, ranging on the whole expressed as LHV (lower heating value) from 15, 710 kJ kg- 1 (for vegetable-tanned <b>leather</b> <b>dust)</b> to 42, 439 kJ kg- 1 (for natural rubber). The characterisation of a fertiliser that can be generated from the particular waste type of vegetable-tanned <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> has determined an interesting quality profile classifiable as organic-nitrogen fertiliser with acceptable values of the humification parameters and heavy metal contents significantly below the assumed quality limits. Finally, simplified pilot-scale burning tests have provided the following findings: higher NOx emissions produced from leather-based materials as compared with the cellulose-based material, which are likely attributable to the substantial “fuel nitrogen” content of the original animal skins; higher HCl emissions produced from the leather-based materials in comparison with the cellulose-based material; and a more even combustion process occurred for the <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> than for the other shoe materials...|$|E

40|$|Background The leather {{industry}} contributes {{vast amounts of}} pollution damaging to aquatic and terrestrial environments. <b>Leather</b> <b>dust</b> is a chromium-contaminated waste produced from the shaving and buffering processes involved in leather tanning. Microorganisms have been investigated for their usefulness in bioremediation and recycling of waste materials. Solid leather waste is the current focus of material to be remediated in this study. Objective The present work focuses {{on the development of}} a process to degrade the <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> protein with the aim of removing the chromium bound within the protein. As part of the study, detecting the presence of biosurfactant production was performed to fuel further interest in value-added by-products of the process. Method Bacillus subtilis SA- 6 was used to treat the <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> over a 10 day shake flask study. Daily samples were taken and analysed for chromium content by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The surface tension of the shake flask cultures was also investigated to detect for any valuable by-products such as biosurfactants for future prospects of developing an economically viable process. Results Chromium concentration demonstrated an exponential increase between 0 - 120 h in shake flask experiments. In the presence of B. subtilis SA- 6 chromium concentration in cell free supernatant increased from 0. 13 ± 0. 09 mg/L to 190. 81 ± 20. 18 mg/L compared to when B. subtilis SA- 6 was absent. Surface tension decreased during fermentation from 53. 23 ± 0. 92 mN/m to 30. 13 ± 0. 15 mN/m in 24 h. Conclusion This study demonstrates a waste management process, which detoxifies solid tannery waste to reduce environmental pollution, whilst yielding value-added products (such as biosurfactant) to provide an economically viable bioprocess with potential for large-scale development...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in the carcinogenic and biological actions of N-nitroso compounds arose following the reports of the hepatotoxicity by Freund ' and Barnes and Magee 2 and ofcarcinogenicity (Magee and Barnes) 3 of the simplest nitrosamine: N-nitrosodimethylamine (dimethylnitrosamine) and the subsequent observa-tion of Schoental 4 and Druckrey et aP on the carcin-ogenic action of the nitrosamides: n-methyl N-nitrosourethane and N-methyl N-nitrosurea. Magee and Barnes in 1956 showed the carcinogenic effects of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in rats. Evidence that certain consumer and industrial products contain N-nitroso compounds led to speculation that workers in the industries that either use or manufacture nitrosamine precursors (amines and nitrogen oxides) may be exposed to these agents. ' One such industry is leather tanning. Dimethylamine sulphate (DMAS, a precursor of N-nitrosodimeth-ylamine NDMA) is used in leather tanneries as a depilatory agent in the hide process (P Walker et al, MITRE Corporation report MTR 7152, 1976). Following these observations, Rounbehler et al carried out a study of human exposure to N-nitrosamine by examining work environments of the leather tanneries. 9 Different amounts ofNDMA were detected in air samples taken from different sites in the tannery. The highest levels, up to 47 pg/m 3 were in the retanning, colouring, and fat liquoring area. Fridman et al detected a nitrosamine group attached to various other groups in different samples by using infrared spectroscopy; nitrosamines show an intense band in the infrared region caused by the vibration of the N = 0 bond.

The aim of this study was to investigate by polymerase chain reaction the role of polymorphisms at CYP 1 A 1 and GSTM 1 genes in 30 ethmoid ITAC patients and 79 healthy donors. The distribution of Thr/Asn genotype at CYP 1 A 1 codon 461 was significantly overrepresented among the patients (23. 3 %; P =. 0422), whereas the Ile/Val genotype at CYP 1 A 1 codon 462 was not significantly different between cases and controls (P =. 76). The GSTM 1 null genotype was not significantly different between cases and control (P = 1), but we observed that the combined codon 461 Thr/Asn and GSTM 1 null genotype was overrepresented in the patient group (P =. 0019). The results reveal that patients with CYP 1 A 1 codon 461 polymorphism may be at high genetic risk of ITAC and that the risk increases in the presence of combined polymorphism of CYP 1 A 1 and GSTM 1 null genotype.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} cancer risk of shoe {{manufacturing}} workers and evaluate whether the risk {{was associated with}} exposure to <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> and solvents. METHODS: Data from two historical cohort studies of shoe workers were expanded and analysed in parallel. A total of 4215 shoemakers from England contributing 103 726 person-years at risk and 2008 shoemakers from Florence, Italy, contributing 54, 395 person-years at risk {{were included in the}} analysis. Exposure to leather dusts and solvents from glues was evaluated on the basis of job title information. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated as ratios of observed deaths (Obs) over expected derived from national mortalities. RESULTS: Overall mortality was lower than expected in both cohorts (English cohort: Obs 3314, SMR 81, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 78 - 84; Florence cohort: Obs 333, SMR 87, 95 % CI 78 - 97). An increased risk of nasal cancer was found (English cohort: Obs 12, SMR 741; Florence cohort: Obs 1, SMR 909). 10 of the 13 cases occurred among English workers employed in the manufacture of welted boots (SMR 926, 95 % CI 444 - 1703), a sector of the industry thought to have had the highest exposure to <b>leather</b> <b>dust.</b> Mortality from leukaemia was not increased in the English cohort (Obs 16, SMR 89), but was increased in the Florence cohort (Obs 8, SMR 214, 95 % CI 92 - 421); and the highest risk was found among shoe workers in Florence who were first exposed between 1950 and 1959 when exposure to benzene was substantial (Obs 3, SMR 536, 95 % CI 111 - 1566). Some evidence for an excess risk of stomach, bladder, and kidney cancer, as well as multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was also found in the Florence cohort only among workers employed in jobs with the highest exposure to solvents. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the associations between exposure to <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> and nasal cancer and between exposure to benzene and leukaemia in the shoe manufacturing industry and suggest that the risk of other cancers may be increased among workers exposed to solvents or glues...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{association}} between intestinal-type sinonasal adenocarcinoma and the occupational exposure to <b>leather</b> <b>dusts</b> {{has been widely}} documented, but the identification of precursor lesions in exposed workers has remained controversial. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the histological changes and modifications in the phenotype of epithelial cells in nasal mucosa of leather workers. METHODS: Biopsy specimens of the mucosa of the middle turbinate were obtained from 139 subjects who had been employed in leather factories for 10 - 48 years (median, 29 years). Tissue fragments were routinely processed for histological examination and immunostainings for cytokeratin 20, CDX- 2, and MUC- 2 were performed. RESULTS: Regarding the surface epithelium, the most common histopathological finding was the presence of squamous metaplasia (64. 7 %), which was associated with mild to moderate dysplasia in 37 cases (41. 1 %), and goblet cell hyperplasia was identified in 30 biopsy specimens (21. 6 %). Positivity for MUC- 2 was detected in goblet cells of 20 of the 30 samples with goblet cell hyperplasia (66. 6 %), whereas no immunostaining was observed for cytokeratin 20 and CDX- 2. Presence of goblet cell hyperplasia was significantly associated with longer occupational exposure in leather tanning activities (p = 0. 03). None of the alterations observed (squamous metaplasia, dysplasia, or goblet cell hyperplasia) showed correlation with smoking habits. Similarly, there was no correlation between squamous metaplasia with or without dysplasia and type and duration of occupational exposure. CONCLUSION: Our data identify goblet cell hyperplasia as possible work-related alterations of nasal mucosa in leather workers. Additional investigations are needed to clarify the significance of these findings in the development of sinonasal intestinal-type carcinoma...|$|R

Of the 116 cases of sinonasal cancer and 259 controls identified, interviews were completed for 92 (79 %) {{of the cases}} and 195 (75 %) of the controls. Everusers of cigarettes had a moderately elevated risk for sinonasal cancer. The association was strongest for squamous cell carcinoma among recent users of tobacco (RR= 3. 1, P< 0. 05, one-sided). For recent tobacco users, {{there was also a}} trend in risk associated with the amount of cigarette use (P< 0. 05, one-sided). Associations between tobacco use and adenocarcinoma were inconsistent, and no positive associations were found for the other histologic types, largely undifferentiated tumours. The study findings indicate that tobacco use, and in particular recent tobacco use, is associated with the development of squamous cell sinonasal cancer. Over the last 50 years, several occupational risk factors for sinonasal cancer have been identified, including exposure to nickel, chromium, wood and <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> (Anon., 1983; Redmond et al., 1982).

50|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to chemicals, dusts, radiation, and certain industrial processes have been tied to occupational cancer. Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, also called Carcinogens, may cause mutations that allow cells to {{grow out of}} control, causing cancer. Carcinogens in the workplace may include chemicals like anilines, chromates, dinitrotoluenes, arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds, beryllium and beryllium compounds, cadmium compounds, and nickel compounds. Dusts that can cause cancer <b>leather</b> or wood <b>dusts,</b> asbestos, crystalline forms of silica, coal tar pitch volatiles, coke oven emissions, diesel exhaust and environmental tobacco smoke. sunlight; radon gas; and industrial, medical, or other {{exposure to}} ionizing radiation can all cause cancer in the workplace. Industrial processes associated with cancer include aluminum production; iron and steel founding; and underground mining with exposure to uranium or radon.|$|R
30|$|The {{accumulation}} {{of dust and}} soot particles on the leather surface can be a serious problem for <b>leather</b> conservation since <b>dust</b> particles are abrasive and {{can be difficult to}} remove from the irregular surfaces. These accumulated particles accelerate leather deterioration through promoting microbial growth and the absorption of moisture from the surrounding environment [6]. Also, vegetable tannins can deteriorate due to exposure to UV radiation as vegetable tannins are strongly absorbing between 270 and 350  nm [20]. Oxidation, combined with the effects of atmospheric pollution, can also lead to acidification and darkening of the leather surface [21]. Presence of pollution gases, which could be transformed into acids by the reaction with moisture, can oxidise the lubricating agent and dressing layers on the leather surface and among the collagen fibres leading to the darkening of leather surface. Furthermore, acidification causes leather decomposition, which will be manifested in a grain layer which appears powdery [22].|$|R
40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to carcinogens contributes {{greatly to the}} etiology of sinonasal cancer (SNC), but the role of different risk factors in determining different histological subtypes is disputed. All consecutive surgical epithelial SNC cases (case-series study) underwent a systematic occupational medicine examination to determine previous {{exposure to}} a wide range of work-related chemical hazards. We investigated 65 SNC cases including intestinal-type adenocarcinoma [ITAC] squamous-cell carcinoma [SCC], and others. Occupational exposure was recognized for 39 cases. Occupational exposures were sensibly more frequent among ITAC than among SCC or other histotypes. Occupational exposure in ITAC cases was to <b>leather</b> or wood <b>dust</b> only, while among non-ITAC cases, we recognised exposure to formaldehyde, solvents and metal fumes. A high proportion of SNC with occupational exposure originated in the ethmoidal epithelium. In our case-series of SNC, a very high frequency of previous occupational exposure to carcinogens was detected, suggesting that occupational hazards may be associated to the aetiopathogenesis, primarily for ITAC, but also for other histotypes. Besides leather or wood, other chemical agents must be recognized as occupational risk factors...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose The {{objective}} {{of this article was}} to estimate the social cost of respiratory cancer cases attributable to occupational risk factors in France in 2010. Methods According to the attributable fraction method and based on available epidemiological data from the lit- erature, we estimated the number of respiratory cancer cases due to each identified risk factor. We used the cost- of-illness method with a prevalence-based approach. We took into account the direct and indirect costs. We estimated the cost of production losses due to morbidity (absenteeism and presenteeism) and mortality costs (years of production losses) in the market and nonmarket spheres. Results The social cost of lung, larynx, sinonasal and mesothelioma cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, chromium, diesel engine exhaust, paint, crystalline silica, wood and <b>leather</b> <b>dust</b> in France in 2010 were estimated at between 917 and 2, 181 million euros. Between 795 and 2, 011 million euros (87 - 92 %) of total costs were due to lung cancer alone. Asbestos was by far the risk factor representing the greatest cost to French society in 2010 at between 531 and 1, 538 million euros (58 - 71 %), ahead of diesel engine exhaust, representing an estimated social cost of between 233 and 336 million euros, and crystalline silica (119 - 229 million euros). Indirect costs represented about 66 % of total costs. Conclusion Our assessment shows the magnitude of the economic impact of occupational respiratory cancers. It allows comparisons between countries and provides valu- able information for policy-makers responsible for defining public health priorities...|$|E
40|$|Chromium (Cr), {{being an}} {{excellent}} tanning agent, {{is widely used}} in the leather industry and tannery workers (TW) are exposed to it either {{in the form of}} inorganic Cr(III) compounds or Cr bound to proteins (<b>leather</b> <b>dust)</b> in the process of leather production. During the present study, the effect of Cr on the hematological indices in TW was evaluated. In this study, hematological indices of 92 male TW aged 20 – 60 years were compared with 79 control males who hardly had a chance of exposure to chromium. Both groups were subdivided into four age groups with an interval of 10 : group A, 20 – 29 years; group B, 30 – 39 years; group C, 40 – 49 years; group D, 50 – 60 years. Total erythrocyte count (TEC) was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in TW of age group A, B and C than control subjects. Packed cell volume (PCV) was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in TW of age group B while mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in TW of age group D. Within the TW, MCH was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in the age group D as compared to age group A and B. No significant changes were observed in the values of hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration between TW and control individuals. The low values of TEC, PCV and MCH might be a result of chromium exposure in the tannery workers and may act as indicators of chromium toxicity...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—A {{case-control study}} was {{conducted}} in France to assess possible associations between occupational exposures and squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx and hypopharynx.  METHODS—The study was restricted to men, and included 201  hypopharyngeal cancers, 296  laryngeal cancers, and 296  controls (patients with other tumour sites). Detailed information on smoking, alcohol consumption, and lifetime occupational history was collected. Occupational exposure to seven substances (formaldehyde, <b>leather</b> <b>dust,</b> wood dust, flour dust, coal dust, silica dust, and textile dust) was assessed with a job exposure matrix. Exposure variables used in the analysis were probability, duration, and cumulative level of exposure. Odds ratios (ORs) with their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression, and were adjusted for major confounding factors (age, smoking, alcohol, and when relevant other occupational exposures).  RESULTS—Hypopharyngeal cancer was found to be associated with exposure to coal dust (OR 2. 31,  95 % CI 1. 21  to 4. 40), with a significant rise in risk with probability (p< 0. 005 for trend) and level (p< 0. 007 for trend) of exposure. Exposure to coal dust was also associated with an increased risk of laryngeal cancer (OR 1. 67,  95 % CI 0. 92  to 3. 02), but no dose-response pattern was found. A significant relation, limited to hypopharyngeal cancer, was found with the probability of exposure to formaldehyde (p< 0. 005 for trend), with a fourfold risk for the highest category (OR 3. 78  ,  95 % CI 1. 50  to 9. 49). When subjects exposed to formaldehyde with a low probability were excluded, the risk also increased with duration (p< 0. 04) and cumulative level of exposure (p< 0. 14). No significant association was found for any other substance.  CONCLUSION—These results indicate that exposure to formaldehyde and coal dust may increase the risk of hypopharyngeal cancer.    Keywords: laryngeal cancer; hypopharyngeal cancer; occupational exposure; job exposure matrix; formaldehyde; coal dus...|$|E
40|$|The {{scent of}} toxic moth poisons {{containing}} the fumigants naphthalene or p-dichlorobenzene {{is a familiar}} spring�me smell in closets, chests, and clothes storage areas. The two major ingredients in mothballs, used individually or in combina�on, are extremely dangerous petroleum-based chemicals that can cause a range of short and long-term health effects, including cancer, blood, kidney, and liver effects. 1 - 4 In 1991, the state of California canceled all pes�cide uses of naphthalene due to known health effects and inadequacies in exis�ng data. However, it is registered with the U. S. Environmental Protec�on Agency (EPA) and is in use in other states. 5, 6 With striking hazards linked to these fumigants, the use of management prac�ces, insect traps, and other repellents takes on an important urgency. Health Concerns Moth repellents are pes�cides used to kill the larvae of clothes moths and/or carpet beetles. These insects lay their eggs on fabric and other tex�les, and when hatched, their larvae feed on organic ma�er trapped within the fibers, chewing away to leave gapping holes in favorite sweaters or clothing. The moth larvae feed on wool, feathers, fur, hair, <b>leather,</b> lint, <b>dust,</b> paper, and occasionally co�on, linen, silk, and synthe�c fibers. 7 Mothballs, usually placed in closed or sealed closets and containers, sublime –meaning they transform from a solid directly into a gas, and the vapors build up and kill moths and their larvae. However, direct and indirect exposures to these vapors are harmful. Mothballs are made with either, or a combina�on of, naphthalene and p-dichlorobenzene as the ac�ve ingredient. Note: p-dichlorobenzene has been replacing naphthalene in the formula�on of moth repellents, and is also used as the primary ingredient in many restroom deodorizers...|$|R
40|$|Background The sinonasal {{cavities}} {{represent an}} anatomical region {{affected by a}} variety of tumours with clinical, aetiological, pathological, and genetic features distinct from tumours at the main head and neck cancer localisations. Majority being malignant tumours and squamous-cell carcinoma contribute 80 % of the sinonasal malignancies, maxilary sinus being the most affected sinus. The disease is associated with occupational exposure to a number of materials wood and <b>leather</b> <b>dusts</b> being among the culprits. Sinonasal tumours affect all races and males being the ones most affected compared to females. The peak age at diagnosis is sixth decade. Since the clinical symptoms are non specific, patients always present to the hospitals with advanced stage of the disease which make the prognosis to be poor despite improvement in the diagnosis and management of the disease. Objective This study aimed at determining the prevalence and presentation of sinonasal tumours among patients attending Otorhinolaryngology department of Muhimbili National Hospital,Dar es Salaam Tanzania. Study design Hospital-based, descriptive cross sectional study Methodology A total of 6630 patients attended Otorhinolaryngology department of Muhimbili National Hospital from June 2015 to February 2016 through convenient sampling were enrolled to participate in this study. Patients were interviewed by using structured questionnaire and clinical examination forms. Those with clinical presentations of sinonasal tumours underwent several investigations so as to confirm the presence and extent of the disease. They included biopsy for histopathology, CT Scan of the nose and paranasal sinuses and Chest X ray for those with malignancies. All information obtained was entered in the computer and analyzed using SPSS statistical analysis package. Frequency and percentage were calculated to determine the prevalence of sinonasal tumours in the study population. The Chi-square test was used to compare prevalence by age and sex and P value of < 0. 005 was considered statistically significant. Results Among 6630 study participants 3417 (51. 5 %) were females and 3213 (48. 5 %) were males. Their age ranged from 0 to 98 years with mean age of 27. 61 years, SD ± 22. 0. Most of them 2102 (31. 7 %), were in the age group of 0 – 9 years. The prevalence of sinonasal tumours among the study participants was 0. 6 %, and the age group of 50 years and above had higher prevalence 19 (1. 4 %) compared to other age groups. The prevalence obtained was higher among males, 23 (0. 7 %) compared to females, 15 (0. 4 %) with the ratio of 1. 5 : 1. Rhinological features were the most common clinical presentations (97. 4 %) while otological features were the least (26. 3 %). Among 38 patients with sinonasal tumours, 30 (78. 9 %) had malignant type and 13 (43. 3 %) were in the age group 50 years and above. Majority 6 (75 %) of those with benign type were in the same age group as for malignant type. Both benign and malignant sinonasal tumours had male preponderance. Inverted papilloma accounted for 62. 5 % (5 out of 8) of the benign sinonasal tumours while SCC constituted 42. 9 %(6 out of 30) of the malignant type. Most of patients with malignant sinonasal tumours 22 (73. 3 %) had stage IV disease while none was in stage I or II. Twenty percent had neck node metastasis to level I and II and one patient with metastasis to the chest. Most of them had all sinus groups being involved with tumours and 31. 6 % had outside sinuses involvement. Conclusion. Majority of sinonasal tumours in our setting were malignant type and squamous cell carcinoma being the most occuring histological type while inverted papilloma was the mostly frequent encountered benign type and both had male preponderance mostly seen at the age of 50 years and above. Rhinological features were the most clinical presentations of the disease. Majority of patients with malignant tumours were in stage IV of the disease and none in stage I or II and thus the need for advocacy for early health seeking behaviour to the community and early detection of the disease by health personnels in the primary health centers hence prompty referal to otorhinolaryngology specialists for definitive managemen...|$|R
40|$|Health {{risks of}} inhaled nasal toxicants were {{reviewed}} {{with emphasis on}} chemically induced nasal lesions in humans, sensory irritation, olfactory and trigeminal nerve toxicity, nasal immunopathology and carcinogenesis, nasal responses to chemical mixtures, in vitro models, and nasal dosimetry- and metabolism-based extrapolation of nasal data in animals to humans. Conspicuous findings in humans are the effects of outdoor air pollution on the nasal mucosa, and tobacco smoking as {{a risk factor for}} sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma. Objective methods in humans to discriminate between sensory irritation and olfactory stimulation and between adaptation and habituation have been introduced successfully, providing more relevant information than sensory irritation studies in animals. Against the background of chemoperception as a dominant window of the brain on the outside world, nasal neurotoxicology is rapidly developing, focusing on olfactory and trigeminal nerve toxicity. Better insight in the processes underlying neurogenic inflammation may increase our knowledge of the causes of the various chemical sensitivity syndromes. Nasal immunotoxicology is extremely complex, which is mainly due to the pivotal role of nasal lymphoid tissue in the defense of the middle ear, eye, and oral cavity against antigenic substances, and the important function of the nasal passages in brain drainage in rats. The crucial role of tissue damage and reactive epithelial hyperproliferation in nasal carcinogenesis has become overwhelmingly clear as demonstrated by the recently developed biologically based model for predicting formaldehyde nasal cancer risk in humans. The evidence of carcinogenicity of inhaled complex mixtures in experimental animals is very limited, while there is ample evidence that occupational exposure to mixtures such as wood, <b>leather,</b> or textile <b>dust</b> or chromium- and nickel-containing materials is associated with increased risk of nasal cancer. It is remarkable that these mixtures are aerosols, suggesting that their "particulate nature" may be a major factor in their potential to induce nasal cancer. Studies in rats have been conducted with defined mixtures of nasal irritants such as aldehydes, using a model for competitive agonism to predict the outcome of such mixed exposures. When exposure levels in a mixture of nasal cytotoxicants were equal to or below the "No- Observed-Adverse-Effect-levels" (NOAELs) of the individual chemicals, neither additivity nor potentiation was found, indicating that the NOAEL of the "most risky chemical" in the mixture would also be the NOAEL of the mixture. In vitro models are increasingly being used to study mechanisms of nasal toxicity. However, considering the complexity of the nasal cavity and the many factors that contribute to nasal toxicity, it is unlikely that in vitro experiments ever will be substitutes for in vivo inhalation studies. It is widely recognized that a strategic approach should be available for the interpretation of nasal effects in experimental animals with regard to potential human health risk. Mapping of nasal lesions combined with airflow-driven dosimetry and knowledge about local metabolism is a solid basis for extrapolation of animal data to humans. However, {{more research is needed to}} better understand factors that determine the susceptibility of human and animal tissues to nasal toxicants, in particular nasal carcinogens...|$|R
