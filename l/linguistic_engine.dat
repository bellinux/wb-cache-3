NooJ has been rewritten from the ground up, with a new computer architecture and an innovative <b>linguistic</b> <b>engine</b> that makes it possible to build a new set of NLP applications. Among other novelties, NooJ's <b>linguistic</b> <b>engine</b> uses a new type of lexical data base, its dictionaries, that are an improvement upon the INTEX dual system of DELA dictionaries and Lexicon-Grammar tables...|$|E
40|$|The INTEX <b>linguistic</b> <b>engine</b> (Silberztein 1993) {{used two}} sets of {{dictionaries}} that were designed at Prof. Maurice Gross’s LADL laboratory: on the one hand, DELA-type dictionaries describe simple and compound words (Courtois, Silberztein 1990) within four types of dictionaries: DELAS: Electronic Dictionary of LADL for Simple word forms DELAF: Electronic Dictionary of LADL for inFlected simple word forms DELAC: Electronic Dictionary of LADL for Compound word forms DELACF: Electronic Dictionary of LADL for inFlected compound word forms On the other hand, lexicon-grammars describe frozen expressions (Gross M. 1993). The INTEX lexical parser recognizes simple words by looking up DELAF-type dictionaries, whose entries are all the inflected word forms of a language (Courtois 1990). For instance, {{the following is a}} sample of a DELAF: avais,avoir. V:I 2 s a,avoir. V:P 3 s avoir,avoir. V:IN...|$|E
40|$|Despite early {{claims to}} the contrary, thesauri {{continue}} to find use as access tools for information in the full-text environment. Their mode of use is changing, but this change actually represents an expansion rather than a contraction of their utility. Thesauri and similar vocabulary tools can complement full-text access by aiding users in focusing their searches, by supplementing the linguistic analysis of the text search engine, and even by serving {{as one of the}} tools used by the <b>linguistic</b> <b>engine</b> for its analysis. While human indexing continues to be used for many databases, the trend is to increase the use of machine aids for this purpose. All machine-aided indexing (MAI) systems rely on thesauri as the basis for term selection. In the twenty-first century, the balance of effort between human and machine will change at both input and output, but thesauri will continue {{to play an important role}} for the foreseeable future. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E

40|$|As {{more and}} more speech systems require {{high-level}} linguistic knowledge to accommodate various levels of applications, corpora that are tagged with high-level linguistic annotations as well as signal-level annotations are highly recommended for development of today's speech systems. Among the high-level linguistic annotations, POS (part-of-speech) tag annotations are indispensable in speech corpora because they provide the basic-level syntactic classes for each morpheme, which are essential for most modern spoken language applications of morphologically complex agglutinative languages such as Korean. Considering the above demands, we have developed a single unified speech corpus tool that enables corpus builders to link linguistic annotations with signal-level annotations using a morphological analyzer and a POS tagger as basic morpheme based <b>linguistic</b> <b>engines,</b> and integrates syntactic analyzer, phrase break detector, graphemeto -phoneme converter, automatic phonetic aligner and stati [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the use of a natural {{language}} analytics engine to provide feedback to students when preparing an essay for summative assessment. OpenEssayist is a real-time learning analytics tool, which operates through the combination of a <b>linguistic</b> analysis <b>engine</b> that processes the text in the essay, and a web application that uses the output of the <b>linguistic</b> analysis <b>engine</b> to generate the feedback. We outline the system itself and present analysis of observed patterns of activity as a cohort of students engaged with the system for their module assignments. We report a significant positive correlation between the number of drafts submitted to the system and the grades awarded for the first assignment. We can also report that this cohort of students gained significantly higher overall grades than the students in the previous cohort, who had no access to OpenEssayist. As a system that is content free, OpenEssayist can be used to support students working in any domain that requires the writing of essays...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} Malaysia's {{linguistic}} politics and policies reflect {{so much of}} what has been at the heart of Malaysia's creation of its own identity, and in more recent times, what it sees as its special roles in. the wider world. In another perspective, {{it could be argued that}} this linguistic history reflects a shift from a reactive language policy seeking to solve pressing internal tensions, largely ethnic in nature, in the period from 1957 to the early 1990 s, to a clearly more proactive policy which is heavily involved in forging a newer Malaysia with external priorities and often asserted aspirations of playing a larger role on the global stage. It is probably also true to say that much of this latter shift to a proactive stance is closely associated with Dr Mahathir's administration, and with the present Defence Minister, Najib Tun Razak, who as Minister for Education in the early 1990 s made much of the public running for the shift allowing - indeed, encouraging - a competence in English to be a critical feature for the new Malaysia of the 21 st Century. This discussion therefore will focus on this shift in Malaysia's language policies from a reactive to a proactive stance, and will also examine some of the critical scenarios that have impacted on Malaysia's language policies for the 21 st Century. Much of this analysis will consequently focus on English language policies and issues as these constitute the <b>linguistic</b> <b>engine</b> behind much of Malaysia's extension to its self image - an engine that simultaneously is emerging in many polities, but an engine that is often causing concern over its apparent 'killer' nature in terms of the fate of other languages on the world scene. It will be very apparent that language policy never arises in a vacuum and consequently there needs to be some recognition of the evolving Malaysian political tapestry pre- and post 1999 elections and an appreciation of the impact of September II, 2001 on Malaysia in the early 21 st Century...|$|E

The corpora that can be constructed using our annotation tool are multi-purpose and applicable to both speech recognition and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Finally, since the linguistic and signal processing engines and user interactive visualization tool are implemented within a client-server model, the system loads can be reasonably distributed over several machines. 1...|$|R
40|$|Although several {{syntactically}} annotated corpora (or treebanks) {{exist for}} Dutch, they are seldomly used for descriptive linguistic research {{because there are}} no easy-to-use exploitation tools available.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an essay-writing study using a {{technical}} {{system that has}} been developed to generate automated feedback on academic essays. The system operates through {{the combination of a}} <b>linguistic</b> analysis <b>engine,</b> which processes the text in the essay, and a web application that uses the output of the <b>linguistic</b> analysis <b>engine</b> to generate the feedback. In this paper we focus on one particular visual representation produced by the system, namely “rainbow diagrams”. Using the concept of a reverse rainbow, diagrams are produced which visually represent how concepts are interlinked between the essay introduction (violet nodes) and conclusion (red nodes), and how concepts are linked and developed across the whole essay – thus a measure of how cohesive the essay is as a whole. Using a bank of rainbow diagrams produced from real essays, we rated the diagrams as belonging to high-, medium- or low-scoring essays according to their structure, and compared this rating to the actual marks awarded for the essays. On the basis of this we can conclude that a significant relationship exists between an essay’s rainbow diagram structure and the mark awarded. This finding has vast implications, as it is relatively easy to show users what the diagram for a “good” essay looks like. Users can then compare this to their own work before submission so that they can make necessary changes and so improve their essay’s structure, without concerns over plagiarism. Thus the system is a valuable tool that can be utilised across academic disciplines...|$|R
40|$|DOI: 10. 1109 /TAES. 2011. 5705676 We {{present an}} {{integrated}} sensing approach for enabling autonomous landing of a robotic spacecraft on a hazardous terrain surface; {{this approach is}} active during the spacecraft descent profile. The methodology incorporates an image transformation algorithm to interpret temporal imagery land data, perform real-time detection and avoidance of terrain hazards that may impede safe landing, and increase the accuracy of landing at a desired site of interest using landmark localization techniques. By integrating a <b>linguistic</b> rule-based <b>engine</b> with linear algebra and computer vision techniques, the approach suitably addresses inherent uncertainty in the hazard assessment process while ensuring computational simplicity for real-time implementation during spacecraft descent. The proposed approach is able to identify new hazards as they emerge and also remember the locations of past hazards that might impede spacecraft landing. We provide details of the methodology in this paper and present simulation results of the approach applied to a representative Mars landing descent profile...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} of extracting models from natural language text sources. This requires linguistic analysis as well as techniques for interpreting and using the analysis results. Our <b>linguistic</b> analysis <b>engine</b> provides feature analysis for a rule-based model element detection. Furthermore, the presented approach enables users to generate domain- and application-specific model element detection rules based on natural language sample sentences. Detection rules {{also have to be}} connected to instantiation rules for the respective type of model element. This is done through a highly system-supported mapping step where users are able to choose elements from arbitrary meta models and to connect their properties with functions over natural language sentence parts. As both, the definition and application of detection rules is always a sensitive balancing act between precision and recall, these steps are highly interactive. That is why our current prototype also supports detection rule adaption and iterative rule set completion – always to the level of current need...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Multilevel fusion is a {{key issue}} for {{developing}} the decision-making kernel of multiagent systems. This article presents a formulation of predictive decision-making algorithm for multilevel multiagent based team decision-making system with the I/O mode characterizations of feature in–decision out or data in–decision out methods. The sequential data fusion is conducted through a dynamic behavior modeling method capable of esti-mating the observed system parameters from the raw sensory measurements over period of time. The temporal es-timated model is used to forward prediction of the observed system output for decision-making. A self-evaluation method to estimate the prediction quality is used to generate the individual decision confidence for final decision integration, which is conducted through a multi-layered fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> reasoning <b>engine.</b> The method is imple-mented for an autonomous tracking system that consists of a target tracking agent whose inputs are visual and ultrasonic range measurements and a collision avoidance agent whose inputs are ultrasonic range measurements. The experimental results conducted by a mobile robot and intelligent electrical wheelchair will demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy, and robustness of the system based on the multisensor fusion method...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} build a lingustic search engine, similar in overall design to Google and Altavista but meeting the {{specifications}} and requirements of researchers into language. Impressive effect to smaller corpora {{could be applied to}} the web so that web searches could be specified in terms of linguistically interesting units such as lemmas, word classes, and constituents (e. g. noun phrase) rather than strings. Thesauruses and lexicons could be developed directly from the web. The way would be open for further anatomizing of web text types and domains, both a topic of interest in itself and one where strategies would be needed so that web-based lexical resources could be developed for specific text types or domains, or so that the biases of the web could be countered to provide `general languages' and `sublanguage' resources from the web. All of this can potentially be done for all of the many languages for which there is ample data on the web. The web, teeming as it is with language data, of all manner of varieties and languages, in vast quantity and freely available, is potentially a fabulous linguists' playground.

40|$|OpenEssayist is an automated, {{interactive}} {{feedback system}} designed to provide an acceptable level of support for students as they write essays for summative assessment. There are two main components to the system: (1) a <b>linguistic</b> analysis <b>engine</b> and (2) a web application that generates feedback for students The main pedagogical challenge in the e-assessment of free text is how to provide meaningful “advice for action” {{in order to support}} students writing their summative assessments. We have built a first working version of the system in which we use unsupervised graph-based ranking algorithms (following Mihalcea & Tarau, 2005) to automatically extract key words, phrases and sentences from student essays. We have developed several external representations of these summarisation techniques. For examples, key words and key phrases can be viewed in a word cloud or in a dispersion graph, and they can be explored and organised into groups. Holistic approaches have also been tested using ‘mash ups’ where key words and key sentences are highlighted in context in the essay itself, helping students to investigate the distribution of key words and its potential implications for the clarity of the narrative. This paper will report the findings from our pilot studies of the interactive models associated with the summarisation techniques...|$|R

Preliminary experiments on morpheme spotting and sentence recognition based on connectionist phoneme recognition results verify that the V-morph and morpheme-graph are viable for complex integrated speech and natural language processing, and the approaches can be extended to other morphologically-complex agglutinative languages such as Japanese. 1 Introd [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I have {{examined}} the French nominal multi-word unit mise en N and its many variants in a dynamic perspective {{on the basis of}} data collected from French language online newspapers between 2006 and 2007. In its most general sense, mise en N means ‘the action of putting somewhere, or the result of this action’ and is closely related to the verb mettre and the multi-word verb construction mettre en N (‘to put’/’to put somewhere’). It is a common and productive lexical form used in specialised as well as in general language. As an old lexical construction stretching back to Latin through Middle and Old French, it has a wide range of semantic content and features, and can be interpreted in different ways. However, existing studies of mise en N often consider its variants either as fixed expressions or as intrinsically belonging to the verb category. The objective {{of this study was to}} show that the scope of mise en N is much wider than this and that its variation can be seen as a result of the dynamic properties inherent to the construction that mise en N represent. To do this, the construction was studied from a nominal perspective as a proper lexical unit, where its variants were considered as multi-word nouns denoting an action; and, due to its many variants, it was also studied through an approach which included dynamic or unstable linguistic features, by considering mise en N as a nominal multi-word construction. therefore adopted a multi-methodological approach where 247 variants of the mise en N construction were studied in a dynamic corpus of data derived from online newspapers through the <b>linguistic</b> search <b>engine</b> GlossaNet. The variants were analysed in different perspectives (semantic content, morphosyntactic properties, frequency of use) and various linguistic and lexicographic sources (traditional dictionaries, online and dynamic dictionaries, term bases, the Web) were used to complement and evaluate the corpus findings. The analysis was based on a set of morphosyntactic, morphological and semantic evaluation criteria, and was systematised in an analyse table inspired by the lexicon grammar model developed by Maurice Gross (1975). Our analyses resulted in 271 identified mise en N variants, that is variants identified with a specific meaning and set of properties and thus provided with an individual entry in the table. Our findings show that mise en N can be seen as having a double lexical status: mise en N as a fixed multi-word expression (unité figée); and mise en N as a fixed multi-word construction (construction figée). As a fixed expression, a mise en N variant has become a part of the lexicon as a regular lexical unit, with a fixed form and meaning. The fixed mise en N variants were grouped in a separate category labeled locutions figées (LF). As a fixed construction, I consider mise en N as a lexical pattern that can be used to create other variants, and that can perhaps also explain its continuous variation and productivity. In addition it can be considered to have a more functional role which might indicate an ongoing grammaticalisation process. The analyses identified four types of mise en N constructions: type A where mise en N is linked to the verb mettre in a locative sense (‘to put (something) somewhere’), ex. mise en pots; type B including mise en N variants linked to the causative verbs rendre/faire devenir (‘to make (someone/something) become’), ex. mise en accessibilité; type C including variants linked to the factitive verb faire (‘to make (someone/something) do’), ex. mise en circulation; type D including a heterogenous group of mise en N that can be linked to a variety of verbs, ex. mise en emploi, mise en peinture, mise en tourisme. The types can also be characterised by the type of action they imply. Type A and B would have an affected object with a passive function, the affected objet of type C would be active; however, type D can be said to denote the sense of action more generally, i. e. providing the sense of action and of duration to something that is lacking it, or where the sense of action is ambiguous, as in the case of action nouns that can be interpreted as an process, an event or as the result of the action. </p...|$|R
