The Economist and the Ayn Rand Institute approve and advocate a <b>legal</b> <b>market</b> elsewhere.

25|$|A {{consequence}} of the black market for organs has {{been a number of}} cases and suspected cases of organ theft, including murder for the purposes of organ theft. Proponents of a <b>legal</b> <b>market</b> for organs say that the black-market nature of the current trade allows such tragedies and that regulation of the market could prevent them. Opponents say that such a market would encourage criminals by making it easier for them to claim that their stolen organs were legal.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{regulatory}} {{barriers to}} entry remain to protect the domestic legal industry. Issues relating to Chinese law must be referred to Chinese law firms, and foreign lawyers are also prohibited from interpreting or practicing Chinese law or from representing their clients in court. However, in reality many foreign law firms interpret laws and manage litigation by directing the local firms they must have cooperative relationships with. In this regard, China's restrictive <b>legal</b> <b>market</b> can be directly tied to a phobia of people asserting their legal rights {{in the face of}} rampant corruption. Information received from the State Council Legislative Office suggests that China may be allowing foreigners to sit the Chinese Lawyers Examination, or have a mutual recognition treaty with other countries to allow foreign lawyers to conduct non-litigation Chinese legal work.|$|E

U. S. firms and attorneys have been applying to open offices in Korea since March 2012, when the Korea-U. S. Free Trade Agreement went into effect. The global legal community has been forecasting the moves into Korea {{as well as the}} broader effect foreign entry will have on the Korean domestic <b>legal</b> services <b>market.</b> Many point to Germany as the gloomy example of a country whose certain <b>legal</b> <b>markets</b> were dominated by foreign presence.
