25|$|Other {{materials}} used, were Tonkin bamboo Calcutta reed, ash wood, hickory, ironwood, maple, <b>lancewood,</b> or malacca cane. These {{products were}} light, tough, and pliable. Rods were generally made in three pieces called a butt, midsection, and tip. The butts were frequently made of maple, with bored bottom; this butt outlasted several tops. Midsections were generally made from ironwood {{because it was}} a thicker, strong wood. Tips were generally made from bamboo for its elasticity which could throw the bait further and more accurately. Handles and grips were generally of cork, wood, or wrapped cane. Many different types of glue held these sections together, most commonly Irish glue and bone glue. This was until hilton glue, or cement glue, was introduced because of its waterproof qualities. Even today, Tonkin split-bamboo rods are still popular in fly fishing.|$|E

50|$|There are few {{endemic species}} as these grasslands {{are typical of}} much of {{northern}} Australia at this latitude but the grasslands are nonetheless largely intact and rich in wildlife. Mammals include the large eastern wallaroo, northern nail-tail wallaby (Onychogalea unguifera), and the long-tailed planigale which is the smallest marsupial in the world. The <b>lancewoods</b> are home to the spectacled hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes conspicillatus), while the Bungle Bungle has some unique plants and an endemic Lerista skink lizard the Lerista bunglebungle. Mammals that have become depleted or disappeared from these grasslands include the bilby (Macrotis lagotis), northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) and golden bandicoot (Isoodon auratus).|$|R
500|$|The Catlins {{features}} dense temperate rainforest, {{dominated by}} podocarps. This {{is the largest}} area of native forest remaining on the South Island's east coast, with over [...] of forest and neighbouring subalpine areas being protected in Catlins Conservation Park. The forest is thick with trees such as rimu, totara, silver beech, matai and kahikatea. Of particular note are the virgin rimu and totara forest remaining in those areas which were too rugged or steep to have been milled by early settlers, and an extensive area of silver beech forest close to the Takahopa River. This is New Zealand's most southerly expanse of beech forest. Many native species of forest plant {{can be found in}} the undergrowth of the Catlins forest, including young <b>lancewoods,</b> orchids such as the spider orchid and perching Easter orchid, and many different native ferns.|$|R

50|$|Toothed <b>lancewood</b> or horoeka, Pseudopanax ferox, is a {{small tree}} endemic to New Zealand. It {{is similar to the}} more common <b>lancewood,</b> Pseudopanax crassifolius, but with more {{prominently}} tooth-shaped leaves. The juvenile leaves are a very dark grey-brown to grey-green colour, narrow, stiff and up to 40 cm long. Once the slow growing tree reaches maturity at 10 to 15 years, the leaf form becomes shorter, wider and dark green in colour. It is only in adulthood that the tree's shape changes from one central stem and downward growing leaves to a more typical tree shape with branches spreading to build a round head. A mature toothed <b>lancewood</b> can reach 6 metres height with a trunk of up to 25 cm in diameter. The mature trunk has distinctive longitudinal grooves which sometimes twist slightly.|$|E
