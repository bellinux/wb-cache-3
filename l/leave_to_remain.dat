5|$|One {{issue that}} has arisen is whether a Singaporean who votes {{in a foreign country}} where the right to vote is not {{exclusive}} to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of Commonwealth countries, including Singapore, who are resident in the UK and have <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> there (or do not require such leave) to register to vote in general elections and local government elections. When queried, the Elections Department stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore. However, this interpretation of the PEA has not been tested in court.|$|E

During January and February, this species is frequently flooded with high-temperature water.

25|$|According to the Home Office, {{he arrived}} in Britain on 13 March 2002, on a six-month visitor's visa. After its expiry, he applied to stay on as a student, and was granted {{permission}} to remain until 30 June 2003. The Home Office said it had no record of any further correspondence, but added: 'We have seen a copy of Mr Menezes' passport, containing a stamp apparently giving him indefinite <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in the UK. On investigation, this stamp was not one that was in use by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate on the date given.' This was denied by the family of Menezes; and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw stated that he believed Menezes {{was living in the}} UK legally, but had no precise information to confirm this. Immigration records show that Menezes entered the Republic of Ireland from France on 23 April 2005. There are no records to show the exact date that he returned to the UK; however, under the Common Travel Area system, a foreign citizen entering the UK through the Republic of Ireland has an automatic right to remain for three months. Therefore, Menezes was lawfully in the UK on the day he was killed, even if the stamp in his passport recording indefinite <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> had been a forgery.|$|E

Most were women and children, some of them of French or Spanish origin, several following their husbands to the UK. Once back in Gibraltar Avoceta also embarked survivors rescued {{from the loss of}} Aguila. Her cargo included cork, 573 sacks of mail and some diplomatic bags.|$|E
25|$|Some Somali {{refugees}} {{have also been}} resettled in the UK under the government's Gateway Protection Programme, which was launched in 2004. Under this scheme, refugees designated as particularly vulnerable by the UNHCR are assessed for eligibility under the 1951 Refugee Convention by the Home Office. If they meet the eligibility criteria they are then brought to the UK and granted indefinite <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain.</b> The first Somali refugees to be resettled arrived in 2010, and between 2010 and 2012, a total of 418 Somalis were resettled in the UK. Further numbers of Somalis were resettled under the programme in 2013.|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} is the UK's [...] "quota refugee" [...] resettlement scheme. Refugees {{designated as}} particularly vulnerable by the UNHCR are {{assessed by the}} Home Office for eligibility under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. If they meet the eligibility criteria they are then brought to the UK and granted indefinite <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain.</b> The International Organization for Migration (IOM) helps facilitate pre-departure medical screening, counselling, dossier preparation, transport and immediate arrival assistance. Once in the UK, refugees are entered into a 12-month support programme intended to aid their integration. The programme has involved local authorities and NGOs including the British Red Cross, the International Rescue Committee, Migrant Helpline, Refugee Action, the Refugee Arrivals Project, the Refugee Council, Scottish Refugee Council and Refugee Support. These organisations formed the Resettlement Inter-Agency Partnership {{at the planning stage}} of the programme, in order to pool their resources and form a partnership for the delivery of services to the resettled refugees.|$|E

500|$|The House of Lords {{modified}} its {{holding in}} Zamir {{in the later}} decision Khera v. Secretary of State for Home Department; Khawaja v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ("Khawaja", 1983). The facts of this case, which involved two separate appellants, {{were similar to those}} of Zamir. Khera had entered the country by allegedly deceiving a medical officer into thinking he was not married. An answer to the contrary would have precluded him from being given leave to enter the UK. The other appellant, Khawaja, having unsuccessfully applied for a UK visa in Brussels, entered the UK by flying into Manchester, saying he would stay for one week and then return to Brussels to continue his studies. Facts later surfaced proving that, {{at the time of his}} entry, contrary to his declaration that he was single, he had been married to a woman who had entered the UK on the same flight but had been attended to by a different immigration officer and was granted indefinite <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in the UK as a returning resident.

500|$|Fowzi Nejad was {{the only}} gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who {{allegedly}} intended {{to take him back}} into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage {{from the back of the}} embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying [...] "We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release.|$|E
500|$|Oldfield, an Australian national, said he {{was making}} [...] "a protest against inequalities in British society, {{government}} cuts, reductions in civil liberties and a culture of elitism". Oxford number two, William Zeng, denounced Oldfield and described him as [...] "a mockery of a man", while Oxford boat club president Karl Hudspith tweeted [...] "my team went through seven months of hell, this {{was the culmination of}} our careers and [...] took it from us". [...] Educated at the Sydney Church of England Grammar School, the University of Sydney and the London School of Economics, and Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, Oldfield tweeted the day after the race, [...] "Having been deep within elite institutions I have a very good understanding of them. I protest their injustices – ask anyone that knows me". On his blog, Oldfield compared his actions to those of Emily Davison, the suffragette killed after stepping in front of the King's horse at The Derby in 1913. [...] Despite later stating he had some sympathy for both the rowers and spectators, he said he had no regrets and that he [...] "would have felt less of a man" [...] had he not made the protest. [...] In October 2012, Oldfield was jailed for six months for causing a public nuisance and ordered to pay £750 costs. In June 2013, he was refused <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in the United Kingdom, the Home Office claiming his presence there was not [...] "conducive to the public good". Oldfield, whose wife is from India, appealed on the grounds that she would be threatened in Australia, and in December 2013, the deportation order was overturned. [...] Security for the 2013 race was increased as a result of Oldfield's actions, with Royal Marines, additional stewards and the Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit in attendance.|$|E

50|$|Symptoms of {{nitrogen}} deficiencies in plants is general chlorosis of the leaves, {{which is when}} leaves turn pale green, and leaves cup upwards quite severely in deficient plants. Nitrogen deficiencies also cause <b>leaves</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> small, and drop prematurely, resulting in less photosynthesis occurring in the plant, and fewer, smaller tubers can form for harvest. Research done by Yara International has shown {{that there is a}} direct correlation between tuber size and yield, and the amount of plant-available nitrogen in the soil. This makes it crucial that the fields have enough nitrogen in the soil to grow a prosperous crop. However, excess nitrogen in the soil can also be harmful to potato production, influencing how well the roots are able to develop, and delays can occur in tuber initiation during the tuberization stage of potato growth.|$|R
