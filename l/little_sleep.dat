5|$|While the Carthaginians were in {{the process}} of {{defeating}} the cavalry, the masses of infantry on both sides advanced towards each other in the center of the field. The wind from the east blew dust in the Romans' faces and obscured their vision. While the wind was not a major factor, the dust that both armies created would have been potentially debilitating to sight. Although it made seeing difficult, troops would still have been able to see others in the vicinity. The dust, however, was not the only psychological factor involved in battle. Because of the somewhat distant battle location, both sides were forced to fight on <b>little</b> <b>sleep.</b> Another Roman disadvantage was thirst caused by Hannibal's attack on the Roman encampment during the previous day. Furthermore, the massive number of troops would have led to an overwhelming amount of background noise. All of these psychological factors made battle especially difficult for the infantrymen.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{the court}} {{sentenced him to}} {{imprisonment}} and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops {{made it difficult for}} the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, still were present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies just stepped over Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, hoping to be removed by foreign troops, which would be a symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having <b>little</b> <b>sleep</b> and food (Rejtan is said to have refused to eat in the Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out.|$|E

25|$|Deadliest Catch is a {{documentary}} series aired by the Discovery Channel beginning in 2005. The show highlights {{the dangers of}} king crab fishing: freezing temperatures, turbulent seas, the pots that must be dragged up can weigh well over a ton when full, and, since the season is short – both because of regulations and the weather – fishermen often spend {{days at a time}} in very rough seas working long hours with <b>little</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jackson's {{peculiar}} personal traits {{contributed to}} his unpopularity as an educator.

25|$|Meade's orders had {{stated that}} the {{reconnaissance}} in force by four of his corps would be started by 7 a.m. on July 14, but by this time signs were clear that the enemy had withdrawn. Advancing skirmishers found that the entrenchments were empty. Meade ordered a general pursuit of the Confederates at 8:30a.m., but very little contact could be made at this late hour. Cavalry under Buford and Kilpatrick attacked the rearguard of Lee's army, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, which was still on a ridge about {{a mile and a}} half from Falling Waters. The initial attack caught the Confederates by surprise after a long night with <b>little</b> <b>sleep,</b> and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. Kilpatrick attacked again and Buford struck them in their right and rear. Heth's and Pender's divisions lost as many as 2,000 men as prisoners. Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew, who had survived Pickett's Charge with a minor hand wound, was mortally wounded at Falling Waters.|$|E

25|$|Before the Battle of Princeton on 3 January 1777, the Pennsylvanians {{made the}} second night march in a row with very <b>little</b> <b>sleep</b> and the {{soldiers}} were exhausted. The order of march for John Sullivan's division was a vanguard under Isaac Sherman followed by the brigades of Arthur St. Clair and Mifflin. While Sullivan's column swung to the right, the troops under Nathanael Greene turned to the left, led by 350 men under Hugh Mercer. Charles Mawhood's British 17th Foot and 55th Foot immediately confronted Greene's column. After a firefight, the British charged and routed the American vanguard, mortally wounding Mercer. Mawhood's soldiers advanced toward the Thomas Clark House and hill but were halted by cannon fire from Joseph Moulder's artillery company. As the British attack stalled, Washington patched together {{a line from the}} brigades of John Cadwalader, Daniel Hitchcock, Edward Hand, and Mifflin. After exchanging volleys with the British, the Americans finally advanced. Mawhood's outnumbered force put up a spirited resistance but his soldiers finally broke ranks and fled.|$|E

500|$|Although the Queen was {{set against}} Beatrice marrying {{anyone in the}} {{expectation}} that she would always stay at home with her, {{a number of possible}} suitors were put forward before Beatrice's marriage to Prince Henry of Battenberg. One of these was Napoléon Eugéne, the French Prince Imperial, son and heir of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France and his wife, the Empress Eugénie. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon was deposed and moved his family to England in 1870. After the Emperor's death in 1873, Queen Victoria and Empress Eugénie formed a close attachment, and the newspapers reported the imminent engagement of Beatrice to the Prince Imperial. These rumours ended with the death of the Prince Imperial in the Anglo-Zulu War on 1 June 1879. Queen Victoria's journal records their grief: [...] "Dear Beatrice, crying very much as I did too, gave me the telegram... It was dawning and <b>little</b> <b>sleep</b> did I get... Beatrice is so distressed; everyone quite stunned." ...|$|E

Harring considered it fateful that she was involved in a minor car accident {{on the way to the}} first interview, only to learn her character would also be involved in a car accident in the film. Watts arrived wearing jeans for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day [...] "more glammed up". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with <b>little</b> <b>sleep,</b> Theroux arrived dressed all in black, with untidy hair.

2500|$|Typically, each {{cycle of}} the Race {{features}} eleven teams. Each team is composed of two people with a pre-existing relationship, such as dating, married, and divorced couples; siblings; parent and child; lifelong friends; sports team colleagues; and co-workers. However, some seasons have introduced twists on this concept: the second All-Stars season featured a team made by the production due to illness befalling an original competitor while season 26, which has a theme of only people who are dating each other competing, featured five of the teams participating in a [...] "blind date". Dynamics of the relationship under the stress of competition is a focus of the show, and are often described by the teams during interviews held before, during, and after the teams have raced, and through discussion with the show's host when they arrive at the Pit Stop. The stress of racing with one's partner, staying ahead of the competition, completing the assigned tasks, and dealing with <b>little</b> <b>sleep</b> or luxury combined to create [...] "killer fatigue", a phrase coined by fans of the show. Often a team's inability {{to cope with the}} fatigue is what is ultimately responsible for a team's elimination from the Race.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{game was}} against Zaire. While {{the first two}} games were in the compact Morehouse College gym, filled to {{capacity}} with under 5,000 spectators, the third game would be in the Georgia Dome. VanDerveer expect more fans, but wasn't expecting 31,320, representing the largest crowd in history to witness a women's basketball game. Although it was a home [...] crowd, VanDerveer was happy that the opponent was Zaire, in case the size of the crowd made them nervous. Zaire was over-matched, and the USA team won 107–47, ensuring a place in the medal rounds. The next game was against Australia, one of the stronger teams in the field. The game was the first game played by Team USA after the bombing incident which left the team with <b>little</b> <b>sleep.</b> The attendance set a new record, with 33,952 spectators. The game was close for much of the game, with no team leading by more than six points until late in the second half, when Team USA extended the margin and won 96–79. The next game was against Japan. With no Japanese player over six feet tall (1.83 m), Team USA had a height advantage. The USA exploited the advantage, and opened up a 28-point lead, but Japan fought back with three-point shooting and cut the lead to 13 at one point. The final margin was 15 points, the closest game to that point.|$|E
