40|$|The aim of {{our work}} is to {{evaluate}} a new legislative proposal of the Italian pension system due to Giuliano Cazzola e Tiziano Treu and to compare it with the system in force due to former Minister Elsa Fornero. The evaluation is made in terms of adequacy. We make use of a mathematical model which, under the hypothesis of demographic equilibrium, formalizes the legislative changes of the pay-as-you-go pension system. The model is tested using Italian demographic and socio-economic data.

30|$|The ratio between pension {{value and}} {{contribution}} base {{can provide an}} insight into {{what would happen to}} the nature of the system under the type of reform analysed in this article. It is known as replacement ratio because it highlights the relation between an individual’s pension and their <b>last</b> <b>wage.</b> If the pension system is purely contributory or Bismarckian, this ratio remains roughly constant in line with contributions. This implies that if someone has a higher salary (i.e. a higher contribution base), he will contribute more overall and will be entitled to receive a higher pension. As observed in Fig. 8, the ratio is maintained nearly constant in the neutral scenario. In the case of female university graduates the replacement rate increases slightly due to the fact that they have more complete work histories, therefore gaining access to higher pensions.|$|E
40|$|For the {{integration}} of unemployed persons into the first labour market, the reservation wage of the unemployed plays an important role. It is the wage level from which the unemployed person is prepared to accept a job offer. The paper examines the level and the determinants of reservation wages ascertained in the socio-economic panel (GSOEP 2000). Reservation wages in Germany are on average above wages before unemployment and very high in international comparison. It seems that unemployed take their <b>last</b> <b>wage</b> rate before unemployment as a guideline and reduce wage demands only slightly with longer unemployment. Unemployed people with low incomes before unemployment show a clearly higher relative reservation wage than unemployed people with a high former income - due to the small wage gap by the relatively high transfer incomes.

If we compare the starting wage with the <b>last</b> <b>wage</b> earned before unemployment  (2 a), we find that subsidized workers – compared to all other newly hired workers – have experienced a significantly larger mean gain in daily wages, ranging from about   1 to nearly 4   Euros in the four groups investigated. However, compared to the selected comparison group of unsubsidized workers, the difference vanishes and turns – while small – even significantly negative for male East German workers. Results for the matched sample are similar for mean daily wages of subsidized and similar unsubsidized workers, cumulated over longer periods  (2 b). Comparing mean wages over these time periods and imputing wages of zero for days without employment, we find a mean wage gain of subsidized compared to all unsubsidized workers  (2 c) of about   6 to 9   Euros.

25|$|The <b>last</b> war <b>waged</b> by Louis XIV {{proved to}} be one of the most {{important}} to dynastic Europe. In 1700, King Charles II of Spain, a Habsburg, died without a son. Louis's son the Grand Dauphin, as the late king's nephew, was the closest heir, and Charles willed the kingdom to the Dauphin's second son, the Duke of Anjou. Other powers, particularly the Austrian Habsburgs, who had the next closest claims, objected to such a vast increase in French power.|$|R

The ACS sample covers up to 2007, but my specification relies on minimum wage changes {{from the previous}} year, so the <b>last</b> minimum <b>wages</b> that are accounted for are in 2006. In a few cases, state minimum wages changed in July or after. The ACS finishes surveying in June so the migration associated with these increases does not contaminate the present year’s count.|$|R
40|$|During the <b>last</b> decades, <b>wage</b> {{inequality}} in Germany has considerably increased {{both within and}} across regions. Building on concepts of the task-based approach, this paper studies whether {{and to what extent}} these developments are driven by technological change. We present novel evidence that technological change is positively related to intra-regional wage inequality. This is driven by increases in the compensation for non-routine cognitive tasks that are prevalent at upper percentiles of the wage distribution combined with decreases in the compensation for non-routine manual tasks, which are located at lower percentiles. Because there exists substantial variation in the degree of technology exposure across German regions, technological change can also explain part of the rise in inter-regional wage inequality...|$|R
50|$|The Constitution of May 3, 1791, was a {{culmination}} of the belated reform process of the Commonwealth. It attempted to integrate Lithuania and Poland more closely, although the separation was preserved by the added Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations. Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, 1793 and 1795 terminated its existence and saw the Grand Duchy of Lithuania divided between the Russian Empire, which took over 90% of the Duchy's territory, and the Kingdom of Prussia. The Third Partition of 1795 took place after {{the failure of the}} Kościuszko Uprising, the <b>last</b> war <b>waged</b> by Poles and Lithuanians to preserve their statehood. Lithuania ceased to exist as a distinct entity for more than a century.|$|R

40|$|Optimal wage indexation, as {{derived by}} Gray, {{was subject to}} {{criticism}} {{due to a lack}} of efficient use of information; failure to clear the market which resulted in non-optimal contracts; and the lack of an explicit use of welfare criteria. The purpose of this paper is to derive a wage contract scheme that is free from the above criticism, but is capable of preserving the insight of Cray's analysis. In so doing the analysis reveals the role of costs of information collection in a world characterized by incomplete information. The analysis focuses also on the interaction between wage indexation and costly information collection as alternative adjustment schemes. It is shown that the first depends only on relative variances, whereas the second also depends on aggregate volatility. The justification for labor contracts hinges on the cost of information collection and <b>last</b> minute <b>wage</b> negotiation. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the peak}} {{national}} organisation {{of the community}} sector and advocate for low income and disadvantaged people, ACOSS has a long standing interest in minimum wages. We have regularly made submissions on minimum wage fixation to industrial tribunals since the mid 1990 s. ACOSS is an interested party with expertise in poverty, employment policy and income support policy, rather than an advocate for union or employer positions. We have not advocated any specific wage increase in the past, and do not do so in this submission. The <b>last</b> minimum <b>wage</b> increase awarded by Fair Work Australia was a rise of $ 19. 40 per week (a 3. 4 % increase), bringing the federal minimum wage up to $ 589. 30 from 1 July 2011. Comparing this pay increase with inflation and community-wide wage increases {{over the same period}} (from July 2010 to June 2011) the Consumer Price Index rose by 3. 6 % per annum and the Wage Price Index rose by 3. 8 %. Thus, the minimum wage fell somewhat behind CPI inflation (by 0. 2 %) and this measure of wages growth (by 0. 4 %) through 2010 - 11. The Analytical Cost of Living Index (ALCI) for employees, a more valid measure of changes in their cost of living, rose by 4. 5 %, significantly more than the CPI. This indicates that <b>last</b> year’s minimum <b>wage</b> increase lagged by 1. 1 % the increase in the average cost of living for employees generally during that year...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{connection}} between education and wage inequality in nine European countries. We exploit the quantile regression technique to calculate returns to lower secondary, upper secondary and tertiary education at different points of the wage distribution. We find that in most countries returns to tertiary education are highly increasing when moving from the lower to the upper quantiles. This finding suggests that an educational expansion towards tertiary education {{is expected to increase}} overall within-groups inequality in Europe. In turn, returns to secondary education are quite homogeneous across quantiles, suggesting that an educational expansion towards secondary education is expected to have only a limited impact on within-groups dispersion. Using data from the last decades, we describe changes in the conditional wage distribution of the surveyed countries. A common feature in Europe is that over the <b>last</b> years <b>wage</b> dispersion increased within the high educated. ...|$|R
