5|$|During her lifetime, Sarah drafted twenty-six wills, {{the last}} of which was only written {{a few months before}} her death; and had {{purchased}} twenty-seven estates. With a wealth of over £4 million in land; £17,000 in rent rolls; and a further £12,500 in annuities, she made financial bequests to rising Whig ministers such as William Pitt, later the first Earl of Chatham, and Philip Stanhope, the fourth Earl of Chesterfield. Although she left little to the poor and even <b>less</b> <b>to</b> charity, she left her servants annuities far above the average for the time: her favourite, Grace Ridley, received £16,000, equivalent to approximately £1.32million in today's money.|$|E

For many fans, {{participating in the}} club had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> do with the game itself and more with {{being a part of}} the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E

5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds <b>less</b> <b>to</b> sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E

Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007–08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in a game, and suffering a deep bruise on his foot while blocking a shot that was initially feared to be a broken bone.|$|E
5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any <b>less</b> <b>to</b> her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E

5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece <b>less</b> <b>to</b> play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing <b>less</b> <b>to</b> metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E

In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E

During times of previous traffic congestion on weekends on the old route, the viaduct saved around 25minutes or more from the elimination of traffic congestion.

5|$|The {{practical}} {{source of}} an emperor's {{power and authority}} was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor (sacramentum). The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis. Most emperors indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive, much <b>less</b> <b>to</b> reign, without the allegiance and loyalty of the Praetorian Guard and of the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the donativum, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.|$|E

In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due <b>less</b> <b>to</b> any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee {{and the other to}} cross the Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> do with the shape of the bridge than the fact that arch was derived from arcus, meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E
