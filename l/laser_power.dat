25|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>power</b> beaming was {{envisioned by}} some at NASA as a {{stepping}} stone to further industrialization of space. In the 1980s, researchers at NASA worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space power beaming, focusing primarily {{on the development of}} a solar-powered laser. In 1989 it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from Earth to space. In 1991 the SELENE project (SpacE Laser ENErgy) had begun, which included the study of <b>laser</b> <b>power</b> beaming for supplying power to a lunar base. The SELENE program was a two-year research effort, but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high, and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration.|$|E
25|$|Thermopiles {{are used}} for {{measuring}} the intensity of incident radiation, typically visible or infrared light, which heats the hot junctions, while the cold junctions are on a heat sink. It is possible to measure radiative intensities {{of only a few}} μW/cm2 with commercially available thermopile sensors.

25|$|Results {{can also}} depend heavily on sample {{preparation}} {{and how it}} was run/introduced. An important example is the issue of which matrix is used for MALDI spotting, since much of the energetics of the desorption/ionization event is controlled by the matrix rather than the <b>laser</b> <b>power.</b> Sometimes samples are spiked with sodium or another ion-carrying species to produce adducts rather than a protonated species.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{electromagnetic}} radiation closer to the visible region of the spectrum (tens of micrometers to tens of nanometers), power can be transmitted by converting electricity into a laser beam that is then pointed at a photovoltaic cell. This mechanism is generally known as 'power beaming' because the power is beamed at a receiver that can convert it to electrical energy. At the receiver, special photovoltaic <b>laser</b> <b>power</b> converters which are optimized for monochromatic light conversion are applied.|$|E
25|$|A {{solution}} to this problem was explored in the form of efficient frequency multipliers, optical devices that combine several photons into one of higher energy, and thus frequency.

25|$|Cascaded diode and {{capacitor}} stages can {{be added}} to make a voltage multiplier (Cockroft-Walton circuit). These circuits are capable of producing a DC output voltage potential up to about ten times the peak AC input voltage, in practice limited by current capacity and voltage regulation issues. Diode voltage multipliers, frequently used as a trailing boost stage or primary high voltage (HV) source, are used in HV <b>laser</b> <b>power</b> supplies, powering devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) (like those used in CRT based television, radar and sonar displays), photon amplifying devices found in image intensifying and photo multiplier tubes (PMT), and magnetron based radio frequency (RF) devices used in radar transmitters and microwave ovens. Before the introduction of semiconductor electronics, transformerless vacuum tube receivers powered directly from AC power sometimes used voltage doublers to generate roughly 300VDC from a 100–120V power line.|$|E
25|$|Prior to firing, the Nd:glass {{amplifiers}} {{are first}} pumped {{with a series}} of Xenon flash lamps surrounding them. Some of the light produced by the lamps is captured in the glass, leading to a population inversion that allows for amplification via stimulated emission. This process is quite inefficient, and only about 1 to 1.5% of the power fed into the lamps is actually turned into laser energy. In order to produce the sort of <b>laser</b> <b>power</b> required for Nova, the lamps had to be very large, fed power from a large bank of capacitors located under the laser bay. The flash also generates a large amount of heat which distorts the glass, requiring time for the lamps and glass to cool before they can be fired again. This limits Nova to about six firings a day at the maximum.|$|E
25|$|The ABL did not {{burn through}} or {{disintegrate}} its target. It heated the missile skin, weakening it, causing failure from high speed flight stress.

The aircraft itself could have been refueled in flight, which would have enabled it to stay aloft for long periods. Preliminary operational plans called for the ABL to be escorted by fighters and possibly electronic warfare aircraft. The ABL aircraft would likely have had to orbit near potential launch sites (located in hostile countries) for long periods, flying a figure-eight pattern that allows the aircraft to keep the laser aimed toward the missiles.|$|E

As the laser excitation is increased from very low levels, the PL shows a strong red shift, {{and then a}} blue shift, such that it presents a U-shaped curve.

25|$|Phthalocyanine dye CD-Rs {{are usually}} silver, gold or light green. The patents on {{phthalocyanine}} CD-Rs {{are held by}} Mitsui and Ciba Specialty Chemicals. Phthalocyanine is a natively stable dye (has no need for stabilizers) and CD-Rs based on this are often given a rated lifetime of hundreds of years. Unlike cyanine, phthalocyanine is less resistant to UV rays and CD-Rs based on this dye show signs of degradation only {{after two weeks of}} direct sunlight exposure. However, phthalocyanine is more sensitive than cyanine to writing <b>laser</b> <b>power</b> calibration, meaning that the power level used by the writing laser has to be more accurately adjusted for the disc {{in order to get a}} good recording; this may erode the benefits of dye stability, as marginally written discs (with higher correctable error rates) will lose data (i.e. have uncorrectable errors) after less dye degradation than well written discs (with lower correctable error rates).|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{experiments}} with laser heating, temperature {{came from a}} calibration of <b>laser</b> <b>power</b> made with known melting points of various materials. When using the pulsed ruby laser this was unreliable due to the short pulse. YAG lasers quickly become the standard, heating for relatively long duration, and allowing observation of the sample throughout the heating process. It was with the first use of YAG lasers that Bassett used an optical pyrometer to measure temperatures {{in the range of}} 1000°C to 1600°C. The first temperature measurements had a standard deviation of 30°C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50°C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200°C higher than that of the brightness measurement. Spectrometry of the incandescent light became the next method of temperature measurement used in Bassett's group. The energy of the emitted radiation could be compared to known black body radiation spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by resistive heating.|$|E
25|$|Interferometric {{detectors}} {{are limited}} at high frequencies by shot noise, which occurs because the lasers produce photons randomly; one analogy is to rainfall—the rate of rainfall, like the laser intensity, is measurable, but the raindrops, like photons, fall at random times, causing fluctuations around the average value. This leads to noise at {{the output of}} the detector, much like radio static. In addition, for sufficiently high <b>laser</b> <b>power,</b> the random momentum transferred to the test masses by the laser photons shakes the mirrors, masking signals of low frequencies. Thermal noise (e.g., Brownian motion) is another limit to sensitivity. In addition to these 'stationary' (constant) noise sources, all ground-based detectors are also limited at low frequencies by seismic noise and other forms of environmental vibration, and other 'non-stationary' noise sources; creaks in mechanical structures, lightning or other large electrical disturbances, etc. may also create noise masking an event or may even imitate an event. All these {{must be taken into account}} and excluded by analysis before detection may be considered a true gravitational wave event.|$|E
