40|$|On {{the basis}} of macro data from 10 OECD countries, I find that the job vacancy rate outperforms the {{unemployment}} rate as a reliable measure of domestic inflationary pressure. Moreover, while the rate of unemployment affects inflation primarily through its difference, the vacancy rate operates through a level effect as well. In most countries, a unique equilibrium rate of vacancies seems to coexist with a drifting equilibrium rate of unemployment.

30|$|Turning to {{our main}} results, the {{estimated}} coefficients on both RERD and RERA show a positive sign, indicating {{the presence of}} qualitatively symmetric effects: while a real peso depreciation tends to increase the investment level, an appreciation does the opposite. Quantitatively, however, the effects are asymmetric: in column (3.2), for example, the estimated coefficient on RER appreciations, at 0.97, {{is more than twice}} the estimated coefficient <b>on</b> <b>depreciations.</b> Thus, while an appreciation tends to decrease investment, a depreciation tends to increase it, but to a lesser degree.
