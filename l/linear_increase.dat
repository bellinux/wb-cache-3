25|$|Aside from {{mobile phase}} surface tension (organizational {{strength}} in eluent structure), other mobile phase modifiers can affect analyte retention. For example, {{the addition of}} inorganic salts causes a moderate <b>linear</b> <b>increase</b> in the surface tension of aqueous solutions (ca. 1.5J/cm² per Mol for NaCl, 2.5J/cm² per Mol for (NH4)2SO4), and because the entropy of the analyte-solvent interface is controlled by surface tension, the addition of salts tend to increase the retention time. This technique is used for mild separation and recovery of proteins and protection of their biological activity in protein analysis (hydrophobic interaction chromatography, HIC).|$|E
25|$|For years, {{processor}} makers delivered {{increases in}} clock rates and instruction-level parallelism, so that single-threaded code executed faster on newer processors with no modification. Now, to manage CPU power dissipation, processor makers favor multi-core chip designs, and software {{has to be}} written in a multi-threaded manner {{to take full advantage}} of the hardware. Many multi-threaded development paradigms introduce overhead, and will not see a <b>linear</b> <b>increase</b> in speed vs number of processors. This is particularly true while accessing shared or dependent resources, due to lock contention. This effect becomes more noticeable as the number of processors increases. There are cases where a roughly 45% increase in processor transistors has translated to roughly 10–20% increase in processing power.|$|E

25|$|Plants acquire CO2 {{and produce}} organic {{compounds}} {{with the use}} of one of three photosynthetic pathways. The two most prevalent pathways are the C3 and C4 processes. C3 plants are best adapted to cool and wet conditions while C4 plants do well in hot and dry ecosystems. Due to the different photosynthetic enzymes between the two pathways, different carbon isotopes are acquired preferentially. Isotopes are the same element that differ in the number of neutrons, thereby making one isotope heavier than the other. The two stable carbon isotopes are 12C and 13C. The C3 pathway will discriminate against the heavier isotope more than the C4 pathway. This will make the plant structures produced from C4 plants more enriched in the heavier isotope and therefore root exudates and litter from these plants will also be more enriched. When the carbon in these structures is respired, the CO2 will show a similar ratio of the two isotopes. Researchers will grow a C4 plant on soil that was previously occupied by a C3 plant or vice versa. By taking soil respiration measurements and analyzing the isotopic ratios of the CO2 it can be determined whether the soil respiration is mostly old versus recently formed carbon. For example, maize, a C4 plant, was grown on soil where spring wheat, a C3 plant, was previously grown. The results showed respiration of C3 SOM in the first 40 days, with a gradual <b>linear</b> <b>increase</b> in heavy isotope enrichment until day 70. The days after 70 showed a slowing enrichment to a peak at day 100. By analyzing stable carbon isotope data it is possible to determine the source components of respired SOM that was produced by different photosynthetic pathways.|$|E

2500|$|Due to its mode of beta decay, iodine-131 {{is notable}} for causing {{mutation}} {{and death in}} cells that it penetrates, and other cells up to several millimeters away. For this reason, high doses of the isotope are sometimes less dangerous than low doses, since they tend to kill thyroid tissues that would otherwise become cancerous {{as a result of}} the radiation. For example, children treated with moderate dose of I-131 for thyroid adenomas had a detectable increase in thyroid cancer, but children treated with a much higher dose did not. Likewise, most studies of very-high-dose I-131 for treatment of Graves disease have failed to find any increase in thyroid cancer, even though there is <b>linear</b> <b>increase</b> in thyroid cancer risk with I-131 absorption at moderate doses. Thus, iodine-131 is increasingly less employed in small doses in medical use (especially in children), but increasingly is used only in large and maximal treatment doses, as a way of killing targeted tissues.

40|$|Machine Models for Parallel and Distributed Computing Abstract. Parallel {{machines}} are converging {{to a standard}} scalable architecture. A set of processors communicate through a network providing <b>linear</b> <b>increases</b> in bisection bandwidth, {{as the number of}} processors increase. Each processor also has a large local memory, providing <b>linear</b> <b>increases</b> in memory bandwidth. In addition, the support of uniform latencies removes the dependence of an algorithm on network locality to achieve good performance. It is widely believed that the widespread takeup of highly parallel machines can be aided by the provision of a standard computational model for the development and analysis of algorithms, leading to scalable and portable performance. This paper describes the recent research carried out using the WPRAM model. This aims to provide a small but flexible set of operations which enables the implementation of highly concurrent algorithms with good practical performance. An associated cost system, targeted at the above class of machines, enables the analysis of alternative parallelisation methods, which can subsequently be "tuned" to the particular machine in use, for optimal performance...|$|R

Bacteriol. 88 : 1672 – 1677. 1964. —Arthrobacter terregens {{was used to}} assay mycobactin, a growth factor for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. Improved techniques permit the assay of mycobactin within 3 to 4 days by agarplate or liquid-medium methods. For the agarplate method, Arthrobacter terregens gave <b>linear</b> <b>increases</b> in zonal growth at mycobactin concentrations of 0. 07 to 0. 30 μg per spot; for the liquid-medium method, <b>linear</b> <b>increases</b> in turbidimetric growth occurred at 0. 05 to 0. 27 μg/ml.

Furthermore, the response to mycobactic acid is characterized by a delayed response of 3 days.
