5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, {{manganese}} dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate, a useful <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagent.</b> By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.|$|E
5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagent</b> – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|The lead analog of the {{simplest}} organic compound, methane, is plumbane. Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic hydrogen. Two simple derivatives, tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead, are the best-known organolead compounds. These compounds are relatively stable: tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light. (Tetraphenyllead is even more thermally stable, decomposing at 270°C.) With sodium metal, lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetraethyllead. The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited: lead tetraacetate is an important <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagent</b> for oxidation in organic chemistry and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound. Other organolead compounds are less chemically stable. For many organic compounds, a lead analog does not exist.|$|E

This study assessed the distribution and stock levels of laboratory commodities used in tuberculosis control in health centers of Amhara region, Ethiopia.

Fifteen (18. 3 %) health centers had no stocks of at least one of the key items (methylene blue (11 %), carbol fuchsin (11 %), acid alcohol (8. 5 %) and sputum cups (3. 7 %)). Of the 82 health centers, 77 (93. 9 %) did not fulfill the criteria for effective distribution of tuberculosis <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> and consumables.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{study of}} {{microbial}} communities has been revolutionised {{in recent years}} by the widespread adoption of culture independent analytical techniques such as 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics. One potential confounder of these sequence-based approaches is the presence of contamination in DNA extraction kits and other <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents.</b> RESULTS: In this study we demonstrate that contaminating DNA is ubiquitous in commonly used DNA extraction kits and other <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents,</b> varies greatly in composition between different kits and kit batches, and that this contamination critically impacts results obtained from samples containing a low microbial biomass. Contamination impacts both PCR-based 16 S rRNA gene surveys and shotgun metagenomics. We provide an extensive list of potential contaminating genera, and guidelines on how to mitigate the effects of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that caution should be advised when applying sequence-based techniques to the study of microbiota present in low biomass environments. Concurrent sequencing of negative control samples is strongly advised...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} the MCM- 41 {{material}} (Mobil Composition of Matter). The MCM- 41 nanomaterial presents higher physical properties such as pore sizes, surface areas and pore volumes. This material is usually synthesized by using <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> as silicate sources and aluminium source. These <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> are still expensive and toxic for large scale production. The main aim of this work is to resolve this problem and to replace these expensive <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> by more cost effective ones. The volclay and Algerian bentonite low-cost mass clay materials are used as silicate and acuminate sources separately by adopting an alkaline fusion process to extract both silicon and aluminium (1 kg of silicium and aluminium from volclay and Algerian bentonite cost around 0. 03 and 0. 01 (sic) whereas {{the same amount of}} silicon from ludox and aluminium from sodium aluminates cost around 350 (sic)). The synthesis of MCM- 41 from bentonite was carried out by the hydrothermal method using the supernatants of bentonite (in the form of sodium silicate and sodium aluminate). On the basis of the data obtained from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N- 2 adsorption and desorption, the results revealed that the properties of MCM- 41 synthesized from Algerian bentonite and volclay separately depend on both elemental composition and mineral phase contents of the used bentonite. Pure and highly ordered hexagonal mesoporous MCM- 41 with uniform pore sizes and a high specific surface area have been successfully synthesized without any phases which exist in natural bentonite. The Algerian bentonite was chosen because of its low cost compared to volclay, another commercial clay source. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Academie des sciences...|$|R

40|$|Background Weak {{health systems}} pose many {{barriers}} to effective tuberculosis (TB) control. This study aimed at exploring health worker’s and TB control program coordinator’s perspectives on health systems challenges facing TB control in West Gojjam Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Methods This was a qualitative descriptive study. Eight in-depth interviews with TB control program coordinators and two focus group discussions among 16 health workers were conducted. Purposive sampling {{was used to}} recruit study participants. Thematic {{analysis was used to}} identify and analyse main themes. Results We found that intermittent interruptions of <b>laboratory</b> <b>reagents</b> and anti-TB drugs supplies, absence of trained and motivated health workers, poor TB data documentation, lack of adherence to TB treatment guideline, and lack of access to TB diagnostic tools at peripheral health institutions were challenges facing the TB control program performance in the study zone.
