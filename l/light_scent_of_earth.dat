I sat down, my face towards the still candles, as one who is awake, yet dreams on.

But with an increase of symptoms in the train on the way home, he had realised to the full the sentence hanging over him. To leave Irene, his boy, his home, his work--though he did little enough work now! To leave them for unknown darkness, for the unimaginable state, for such nothingness {{that he would not}} even be conscious of wind stirring leaves above his grave, nor <b>of</b> the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> and grass. <b>Of</b> such nothingness that, however hard he might try to conceive it, he never could, and must still hover on the hope that he might see again those he loved! To realise this was to endure very poignant spiritual anguish. Before he reached home that day, he had determined to keep it from Irene. He would have to be more careful than man had ever been, for the least thing would give it away and make her as wretched as himself, almost. His doctor had passed him sound in other respects, and seventy was nothing of an age--he would last a long time yet, IF HE COULD! ...|$|R

50|$|Plants {{fall into}} {{pollination}} syndromes {{that reflect the}} type of pollinator being attracted. These are characteristics such as: overall flower size, the depth and width of the corolla, the color (including patterns called nectar guides that are visible only in ultraviolet <b>light),</b> the <b>scent,</b> amount <b>of</b> nectar, composition of nectar, etc. For example, birds visit red flowers with long, narrow tubes and lots of nectar, but are not as strongly attracted to wide flowers with little nectar and copious pollen, which are more attractive to beetles. When these characteristics are experimentally modified (altering colour, size, orientation), pollinator visitation may decline.|$|R

60|$|One morning, {{not long}} after that {{interview}} between Mr. Farebrother and Mary Garth, in which she confessed to him her feeling for Fred Vincy, it happened that her father had some business which took him to Yoddrell's farm in the direction of Frick: it was to measure and value an outlying piece of land belonging to Lowick Manor, which Caleb expected to dispose of advantageously for Dorothea (it must be confessed that his bias was towards getting the best possible terms from railroad companies). He put up his gig at Yoddrell's, and in walking with his assistant and measuring-chain to the scene of his work, he encountered the party of the company's agents, who were adjusting their spirit-level. After a little chat he left them, observing that by-and-by they would reach him again where he was going to measure. It was one of those gray mornings after light rains, which become delicious about twelve o'clock, when the clouds part a little, and the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>earth</b> is sweet along the lanes and by the hedgerows.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examined}} customers’ perceived {{importance and}} performance of shopping center ambience on the examples of the Mercator shopping center and Sad Novi Bazaar shopping center in Novi Sad, Serbia. The shopping center ambience was examined through exterior and interior attributes. It was found {{that a number of}} them are very important to customers and their shopping behavior. According to the present research, the most important exterior attributes are: address and location, parking availability, congestion and traffic, exterior display windows and entrances. The most important interior attributes are: cleanliness, temperature, merchandise, <b>lighting,</b> music, <b>scents,</b> absence <b>of</b> tobacco smoke, width of aisles and P. A. usage. The paper also provided information for two studied shopping centers with ambience attributes that performed well or not and everything was presented on the importance-performance grids, which can serve managers as guidelines for further development...|$|R
60|$|He {{began by}} saying that he wished to dissociate his text in his hearers' minds from the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> the upturned <b>earth,</b> and the fall of clods upon the coffin lid, and he asked them {{to join him in}} {{attempting}} to find in it another meaning beside that which it usually carried. He believed that those words of Christ ought to speak to us of this world as well as the next, and enjoin upon us the example which we might all find in Him, as well as promise us immortality with Him. As the minister went on, Annie followed him with the interest which her belief that she heard between the words inspired, and occasionally in a discontent with what seemed a mystical, almost a fantastical, quality of his thought.|$|R
60|$|I do {{not attempt}} to define Beauty nor even to {{distinguish}} it from Power. I do not think indeed that one can effectually distinguish these aspects of life. I {{do not know how}} far Beauty may not be simply fulness and clearness of sensation, a momentary unveiling of things hitherto seen but dully and darkly. As I have already said, there may be beauty in the feeling of beer in the throat, in the taste of cheese in the mouth; there may be beauty in the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>earth,</b> in the warmth of a body, in the sensation of waking from sleep. I use the word Beauty therefore in its widest possible sense, ranging far beyond the special beauties that art discovers and develops. Perhaps as we pass from death to life all things become beautiful. The utmost I can do in conveying what I mean by Beauty is to tell of things that I have perceived to be beautiful as beautifully as I can tell of them. It may be, as I suggest elsewhere, that Beauty is a thing synthetic and not simple; it is a common effect produced by a great medley of causes, a larger aspect of harmony.|$|R
60|$|It {{was some}} little time later when a {{creaking}} wagon swung round a {{bend of the}} road, and the bronzed rancher on the driving-seat laughed softly {{to himself as he}} saw Miss Townshead sitting demurely but with downcast face {{on one end of the}} cedar, and Seaforth, who appeared suspiciously unconcerned, at least six feet away. That was not just how he had seen them when with the soft dust muffling the rattle of wheels he and his team came out of the shadows which hung athwart the bend. The wagon was old and weather-scarred, the harness rudely patched with hide, but it is possible there was room in the life of strenuous toil the bushman lived for the romance that brightens everything, and he shouted a mirthful greeting to them as he whipped his team. Then as the wagon jolted on out under the sombre archway into the brightness of the sun there came drifting back to them the refrain of a song. It was one sung often in the bush of that country at the time, and the two who sat listening in the green stillness that sunny afternoon grasped the verity that underlay its crude sentimentality. Shorn of its harshness, by the distance the voice rang bravely through the thud of hoofs and rattle, of wheels, and there was in the half-heard words and jingling rhythm what there was in the sunshine and <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> steaming <b>earth,</b> the life and hope of the eternal spring.|$|R

60|$|The pampas are, in most places, {{level as}} a billiard-table; just where we lived, however, the country {{happened}} to be undulating, and our house stood on the summit {{of one of the}} highest elevations. Before the house stretched a great grassy plain, level to the horizon, while at the back it sloped abruptly down to a broad, deep stream, which emptied itself in the river Plata, about six miles to the east. This stream, with its three ancient red willow-trees growing on the banks, was a source of endless pleasure to us. Whenever we went down to play on the banks, the fresh penetrating <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> the moist <b>earth</b> had a strangely exhilarating effect, making us wild with joy. I am able now to recall these sensations, and believe that the sense of smell, which seems to diminish as we grow older, until it becomes something scarcely worthy of being called a sense, is nearly as keen in little children as in the inferior animals, and, when they live with nature, contributes as much to their pleasure as sight or hearing. I have often observed that small children, when brought on to low, moist ground from a high level, give loose to a sudden spontaneous gladness, running, shouting, and rolling over the grass just like dogs, and I have no doubt that the fresh smell <b>of</b> the <b>earth</b> is the cause of their joyous excitement.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> developmental stability (low fluctuating asymmetry, FA) is attractive to women who are fertile (at high-conception risk points in their menstrual cycles), but not to other women or men. Prior research also indicates that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> dissimilarity in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes {{may play a role}} in human mate choice. We studied the scent attractiveness to the opposite sex of t-shirts worn for 2 nights 2 ̆ 7 sleep. Our results indicate that the two olfactory systems are independent. We repeated previous results from studies <b>of</b> the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> symmetry. We repeated previous results from MHC research in part; men, but not women, showed a preference for t-shirts with the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> MHC dissimilarity. Women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>scent</b> ratings <b>of</b> t-shirts were uncorrelated with the wearer 2 ̆ 7 s MHC dissimilarity and allele frequency, but positively correlated with the wearer 2 ̆ 7 s MHC heterozygosity. Fertile women did not exhibit any MHC trait preferences. Women 2 ̆ 7 s preference for the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men who were heterozygous for MHC alleles may be stronger in women who are at infertile cycle points. Men preferred the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> common MHC alleles, which may function to avoid mates with rare alleles that exhibit gestational drive. Men also preferred the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> women at fertile cycle points. The <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> facially attractive women, but not men, was preferred. Neither FA nor facial attractiveness in either sex correlated with MHC dissimilarity to others, MHC heterozygosity, or MHC allelic rarity...|$|R

50|$|Nature’s second {{function}} in the novel is to mirror or complement the actions or feelings {{of the characters in}} the book. Many paragraphs end with a reference to Nature, such as “the dog suddenly pounced upon the flea” or “a koel lifted itself out of the heavy torpor of the afternoon and called tentatively, as if enquiring into the existence of the evening”. This offers a parallel between what has just happened in the story and the natural world. The dog pounces on the flea immediately after Bakul tells Bim that he will marry Tara, and could represent Bim’s isolation beginning to trap her. The koel calls tentatively after Bim has come to an understanding of herself and her relationship with her family and is finally at peace. It could be seen as her uplifting rebirth. Another parallel we can find is the heat of the summer and the political heat of 1947. The most important analogy between Nature and the human world is the garden. At the beginning of the novel, the roses are said to have grown smaller and sicker; they are “dusted with disease”. At the end of the novel, there is a dust storm which mirrors the discussion Bim and Tara are having about Raja, and which leaves the garden “shrouded in dust” and everything looking “ancient and bent”. The garden, so beautiful and enjoyable in their childhood, has become old and grey as the years have progressed and the Das children have grown apart. Nature in the novel is also beautiful and dangerous at the same time. For example, mosquitoes are mentioned at the beginning as “singing and stinging”, and when the gardener waters the garden, “bringing out the green <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> watered <b>earth</b> and refreshed plants”, mynahs quarrel and parrots come, a “lurid, shrieking green”, ripping flowers to bits. This carries a warning and can be compared with human relationships, especially the relationship between Tara, Bim and Raja.|$|R
