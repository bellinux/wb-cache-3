Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst {{have no doubt}} of {{the truth of this}} answer, <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and {{immediately}} thou shalt let thyself be baptised.|$|E
500|$|Amir {{was raised}} in a court setting, where he spoke Malay until it had [...] "become his flesh and blood". From a young age he was exposed to oral and written pantuns and syair, both {{listening}} and improvisationally creating his own. As with his father before him, Amir enjoyed traditional texts, such as Hikayat Hang Tuah, Syair Siti Zubaidah, and Hikayat Panca Tanderan. He would <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> when they were read in public ceremonies, and as an adult he kept a large collection of such texts, though these were destroyed during the communist revolution.|$|E
500|$|The Pixies are {{influenced}} by a range of artists and genres; each member came from a different musical background. When he first started writing songs for the Pixies, Francis says he was listening to nothing but Hüsker Dü, Captain Beefheart, and Iggy Pop; Other influences associated with Francis include The Gun Club and The Cars. During the making of Doolittle he listened heavily to the Beatles' White Album. He has cited Buddy Holly {{as a model for}} his compressed songwriting. Francis did not discover punk rock until he was 16, saying [...] "it was good I didn't <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> hip records". As a child, he listened mainly to 1960s songs, religious music and Emerson Lake and Palmer, then Iggy Pop, Husker Du, Captain Beefheart and Talking Heads, who he says [...] "weren't punk either".|$|E

500|$|On June 5, 2017, Dylan's Nobel Lecture {{was posted}} on the Nobel prize website. The New York Times pointed out that, in order to collect the prize’s 8 million Swedish krona ($900,000), the Swedish Academy’s rules {{stipulate}} the laureate [...] "must deliver a lecture within {{six months of the}} official ceremony, which would have made Mr. Dylan’s deadline June 10." [...] Academy secretary Danius commented: [...] "The speech is extraordinary and, as one might expect, eloquent. Now that the lecture has been delivered, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close." [...] In his essay, Dylan writes about the impact that three important books made on him: Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Homer's The Odyssey. He concludes: [...] "Our songs are alive {{in the land of the}} living. But songs are unlike literature. They’re meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare’s plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, 'Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story'." [...] Alan Pasqua provided the uncredited piano accompaniment for the recorded speech.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{distinct}} {{views were}} {{run in the}} Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Writer Gideon Levy said of Grass and the writer José Saramago, another critic of Israeli policies: [...] "After we denounce the exaggeration, after we shake off the unjustified part of the charge, we must <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> great people. They are not anti-Semites, they are expressing the opinion of many people. Instead of accusing them we should consider what we did that led them to express it.|$|E
2500|$|This {{practice}} (excessive compression, {{dynamic range}} reduction, loudness level enhancement, etc.) has been condemned by several recording industry professionals including Alan Parsons, Geoff Emerick (noted {{for his work}} with the Beatles from Revolver to Abbey Road), and mastering engineers Doug Sax, Steve Hoffman, and many others, including music audiophiles, hi-fi enthusiasts, and fans. Musician Bob Dylan has also condemned the practice, saying: [...] "You <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> modern records, they're atrocious, they have sound all over them. There's no definition of nothing, no vocal, no nothing, just like—static." [...] The compact disc editions of Dylan's more recent albums Modern Times and Together Through Life are examples of heavy dynamic range compression, although Dylan himself {{might not have been}} responsible for it.|$|E

2500|$|The fictional character's name {{may have}} been derived from a jolly and {{flamboyant}} fireman named Tom Sawyer with whom Twain was acquainted in San Francisco, California, while Twain was employed as a reporter at the San Francisco Call. Twain used to listen to Sawyer tell stories of his youth, [...] "Sam, he would <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> pranks of mine with great interest and he'd occasionally take 'em down in his notebook. One day he says to me: ‘I am {{going to put you}} between the covers of a book some of these days, Tom.’ ‘Go ahead, Sam,’ I said, ‘but don’t disgrace my name.’" [...] Twain himself said the character sprang from three people, later identified as: John B. Briggs (who died in 1907), William Bowen (who died in 1893) and Twain; however Twain later changed his story saying Sawyer was fully formed solely from his imagination, but as Robert Graysmith says, [...] "The great appropriator liked to pretend his characters sprang fully grown from his fertile mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Russian Foreign Ministry accused Ukrainian {{authorities}} of [...] "blaming" [...] the Russian government {{for all its}} troubles and stated [...] "Ukrainian {{people want to get}} a clear answer from Kiev to all their questions. It's time to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> legal claims". It also stated it was [...] "carefully observing" [...] events in the east and south of Ukraine, and again called for [...] "real constitutional reform" [...] that would turn Ukraine into a federation. In a 7 April opinion piece that appeared in The Guardian, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov wrote that it was Europe and the United States, and not Russia, that was guilty of destabilising Ukraine and that [...] "Russia is doing all it can to promote early stabilisation in Ukraine". The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a stern condemnation of the [...] "criminal order" [...] by Kiev for armed aggression against Donetsk: [...] "The Kiev authorities, who self-proclaimed themselves {{as a result of a}} coup, have embarked on the violent military suppression of the protests," [...] demanding that [...] "the Maidan henchmen, who overthrew the legitimate president, to immediately stop the war against their own people, to fulfill all the obligations under the Agreement of 21 February." [...] Russian president Vladimir Putin compared the siege of the DPR and LPR-controlled cities of Donetsk and Luhansk to the Siege of Leningrad during the Second World War: [...] "Sadly, it reminds me of World War II, when German fascist forces surrounded our cities, like Leningrad, and shelled population centres and their residents".|$|E
2500|$|Victorian critics {{praised the}} poem and some {{examined}} {{aspects of the}} poem's background. John Sheppard, {{in his analysis of}} dreams titled On Dreams (1847), lamented Coleridge's drug use as {{getting in the way of}} his poetry but argued: [...] "It is probable, since he writes of having taken an 'anodyne,' that the 'vision in a dream' arose under some excitement of that same narcotic; but this does not destroy, even as to his particular case, the evidence for a wonderfully inventive action of the mind in sleep; for, whatever were the exciting cause, the fact remains the same". T. Hall Caine, in 1883 survey of the original critical response to Christabel and [...] "Kubla Khan", praised the poem and declared: [...] "It must surely be allowed that the adverse criticism on 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' which is here quoted is outside all tolerant treatment, whether of raillery or of banter. It is difficult to attribute such false verdict to pure and absolute ignorance. Even when we make all due allowance for the prejudices of critics whose only possible enthusiasm went out to 'the pointed and fine propriety of Poe,' we can hardly believe that the exquisite art which is among the most valued on our possessions could encounter so much garrulous abuse without the criminal intervention of personal malignancy." [...] In a review of H. D. Traill's analysis of Coleridge in the [...] "English Men of Letters", an anonymous reviewer wrote in 1885 Westminster Review: [...] "Of 'Kubla Khan,' Mr. Traill writes: 'As to the wild dream-poem 'Kubla Khan,' it is hardly more than a psychological curiosity, and only that perhaps in respect of the completeness of its metrical form.' Lovers of poetry think otherwise, and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> wonderful lines as the voice of Poesy itself." ...|$|E

60|$|The King {{was always}} delighted to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> grievances, {{delivering}} lenient and kingly answers, {{but as he}} always insisted, as the absolute sine qua non, that verbal complaints should be presented to him with the fullest pomp of trumpets, plumes, and halberds, only a few resolute spirits were prepared to run the gauntlet of the little boys in the street.|$|E
