5|$|The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon {{emissions}} and waste created during filming. Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, {{was a popular}} environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero-or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries. The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.|$|E

500|$|In 1709, at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, England, Abraham Darby {{began to}} fuel a blast furnace with coke instead of charcoal.

40|$|A {{simplified}} 2 D axisymmetric {{model and}} a comprehensive 3 D weld pool model, {{accounting for the}} free surface deformation and the filler metal addition, {{have been developed to}} investigate the factors that lead to asymmetric bead shapes in horizontal GTA welding of stainless steels. Buoyancy-induced flow and the sagging of the pool free surface, under the action of gravity, are found to be responsible for the weld asymmetry and the decrease in the weld penetration at the bottom sidewall. The numerical results clearly emphasized the beneficial role of the Marangoni shear stress in limiting the asymmetry of horizontal GTA welds. An additional experimental investigation showed that the asymmetry in the weld shape can be reduced when placing the <b>lowest</b> <b>sulfur</b> content component at the bottom side. © 2013 Elsevier B.

One can use dynamo scaling relations developed by Christensen and Aubert (2006) to decide whether dynamo extinction through a change in conductive heat transport is possible.

2500|$|When {{biodiesel}} is cooled below {{a certain}} point, {{some of the}} molecules aggregate and form crystals. The fuel starts to appear cloudy once the crystals become larger than {{one quarter of the}} wavelengths of visible light – this is the cloud point (CP). As the fuel is cooled further these crystals become larger. The lowest temperature at which fuel can pass through a 45micrometre filter is the cold filter plugging point (CFPP). As biodiesel is cooled further it will gel and then solidify. Within Europe, there are differences in the CFPP requirements between countries. This is reflected in the different national standards of those countries. The temperature at which pure (B100) biodiesel starts to gel varies significantly and depends upon the mix of esters and therefore the feedstock oil used to produce the biodiesel. For example, biodiesel produced from low erucic acid varieties of canola seed (RME) starts to gel at approximately [...] Biodiesel produced from beef tallow and palm oil tends to gel at around [...] and [...] respectively.

The seven-hour flight test was considered a success. The goal of the flight test program is to qualify the fuel blend for fleet use on the service's B-52s, and then flight test and qualification on other aircraft. The test program concluded in 2007.

Whereas early studies were limited to mechanically exfoliated flakes, the large-area synthesis of 2 D TMDCs has now been realized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) based on a sulfurization reaction. Since then, the optoelectronic properties of CVD grown monolayer MoS_ 2 have been heavily investigated, but the influence of stoichiometry on the electrical and optical properties has been largely overlooked. Here we systematically vary the stoichiometry of monolayer MoS_ 2 during CVD via controlled sulfurization and investigate the associated changes in photoluminescence and electrical properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is employed to measure relative variations in stoichiometry and the persistence of MoO_x species. As MoS_ 2 -δ is reduced (increasing δ), the field-effect mobility of monolayer transistors increases while the photoluminescence yield becomes non-uniform.
