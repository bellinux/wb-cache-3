25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Hazumu.|$|E
500|$|Four Swords Adventures also {{received}} criticism. Game Revolution {{said about the}} game, [...] "Graphically, Four Swords Adventures is an odd mix of cheap 2D SNES sprites and nice Gamecube particle effects. It <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> the GBA game, but now wears fancier pants and shows off upgraded visual flourishes, like Wind Waker style curly-Q air poofs. Still, much of the technology has clearly been ported over from the GBA, creating an inconsistent feel." [...] They also criticized the requirement of the link cable, saying that [...] "the required use of the GBA for multiplayer does limit the play potential." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} the March 2010 {{passage of the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Romney attacked the landmark legislation as [...] "an unconscionable abuse of power" [...] and said the act should be repealed. The antipathy Republicans felt for it created a potential problem for the former governor, since the new federal law {{was in many ways}} similar to the Massachusetts health care reform passed during Romney's gubernatorial tenure; as one Associated Press article stated, [...] "Obamacare... <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Romneycare." [...] While acknowledging that his plan was an imperfect work in progress, Romney did not back away from it. He defended the state-level health insurance mandate that underpinned it, calling the bill the right answer to Massachusetts' problems at the time.|$|E

500|$|The {{technological}} advances {{incorporated into the}} Harrier II, compared with the original Harrier, significantly reduce the workload on the pilot. The supercritical wing, hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control principle, and increased engineered [...] stability make the aircraft fundamentally easier to fly. Ed Harper, general manager for the McDonnell Douglas Harrier II development program, summarized: [...] "The AV-8B <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> the original Harrier and it uses the same operating fundamentals. It just uses them a lot better". A large cathode-ray tube multi-purpose display, taken from the F/A-18, makes up much of the instrument panel in the cockpit. It has {{a wide range of}} functions, including radar warning information and weapon delivery checklist. The pilots sit on UPC/Stencel 10B zero-zero ejection seats, meaning that they are able to eject from a stationary aircraft at zero altitude.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} met with largely {{positive}} reviews. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote positively of the episode and awarded it an [...] "A" [...] grade. He noted the entries' similarities with [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", noting that both deal with men [...] "who [...] too much about death for [...] own good". He also praised the characterization of Scully and Fellig; {{he noted that the}} former is [...] "no-nonsense" [...] and optimistic, whereas the latter is a [...] "creepy man" [...] who is jealous of those who are capable of dying. Handlen concluded that the episode [...] "doesn’t play out like a classic monster episode, it feels like one". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, comparing it favorably to [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose". He wrote, [...] "If imitation is the highest form of flattery, what is a fascinating offshoot of a previous incarnation?

[...] One such cited notes that {{it is unlikely that}} Children of Earth was intentionally homophobic since the writer (Davies) and lead actor (John Barrowman) are both openly gay. The same reviewer notes that however, [...] "especially when viewed on its own, Children of Earth <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> the same heteronormative, homophobic, biphobic and gratuitous tropes that appear in so many bad representations of [...]" [...] In response to the accusations of [...] "de-gaying" [...] Torchwood, Davies advised those people do some research into his career (creator of Queer as Folk) and [...] "stop riding on a bandwagon that they actually don't know anything about".

500|$|Foley {{accepted}} {{the failure of}} the film saying, [...] "I knew it was doomed before even filming started. The day before the first shoot, I sat in my hotel and looked to the script thinking, 'Damn, wish I could re-write this whole thing.' After the film released, my dad called me up saying 'you know The New York Times are calling it the worst film of the year." [...] He recalled that both he and Madonna chose to overlook {{the failure of the}} film, and remembered one incident when he met Madonna at a hotel lobby. [...] "She just looked to me once and said, 'So it's a flop right?' That's the only time she ever mentioned the film. Even Sean also never mentioned it in front of her." [...] In another article in The New York Times, Vincent Canby noted that Madonna's real personality is of a [...] "knowing, shrewd, pragmatic young woman, a performer of invigorating energy who still <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Marilyn Monroe, even with short hair, but who has much more in common with the enthusiastic, unembarrassed, comic tartness of Jean Harlow, somehow let loose on the streets of New York in the 80's." [...] However, he felt that Who's That Girl failed to portray that image, leading to its failure. The first half of the film showed a different personality of Madonna, trying to be comical, which was not accepted by the public.|$|E

2500|$|Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, {{evolved from}} one of Akira Toriyama's earlier {{one-shot}} series called Dragon Boy. In this story, the protagonist <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Goku but has a pair of wings. When Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West. To be creative {{with the idea of}} Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature. He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on. Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, {{it was not until the}} introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a [...] Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.|$|E

[...] Mary F. Pols of MSN Movies gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, saying, [...] "The movie finishes strong, managing to be sweet without being saccharine. It's no Toy Story 3, but Despicable Me is a solid alternative." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film two out of five stars, saying, [...] "So much is going on in this movie that, while there's nothing worth despising, there's not much to remember either." [...] Laremy Legel of Film.com gave the film an A-, saying, [...] "Despicable Me is darned cute. I know cute isn't to the lofty level of [...] "message storytelling" [...] but it can be entertaining to watch when done correctly." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Despicable doesn't measure up to Pixar at its best. Nonetheless, it's funny, clever and warmly animated with memorable characters." [...] Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times gave the film a B, saying, [...] "Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud craft a fun stretch run, wrapping the story with warm, fuzzy funnies and nothing to suggest a sequel, which is probably wise." [...] Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film a B, saying, [...] "Until the [...] "creep + orphans = happy family" [...] formula starts demanding abrupt, unconvincing character mutations, Despicable Me is a giddy joy." [...] Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars, saying, [...] "Everyone knows that the villains are usually the most interesting characters in any movie. So the makers of Despicable Me were wise to cut to the chase and make the megalomaniacal Gru the central character in this animated film." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a video titled [...] "The Jews", Voris {{explained}} {{his interpretation of}} the Catholic Church's teaching on supersessionism, saying that the Jewish faith in ancient times [...] "had a temple and offered sacrifice; the entire religion was focused on this one singular point. … Once however the Romans were done with their work, the Jews as {{the religion of the}} Covenant no longer existed. … No temple, no sacrifices, no priesthood, no Judaism. What replaced it in history is what has come down to us today: Rabbinical Judaism. This is NOT the Judaism of the Covenant. It is a man-made religion. ...the promise of [...] Covenant is fulfilled in the Catholic Church. We are the continuation of Israel. ... the worship was now made complete in the sacrifice of the Mass, the Holy Eucharist. This is why nothing was lost {{in the sense of the}} Covenant when Jerusalem was destroyed. It's not so much that the Covenant was switched to a new group, it's much more the case that only a few former members of the Covenant stayed faithful. The vast majority rejected the Covenant, as is highlighted [...] when their leaders scream out, 'We have no king but Caesar!' [...] The Covenant was continued in the few Jews who remained faithful to it by recognizing the Messiah. Then God added to their number a multiplicity of Gentiles. The Covenant was never abandoned by God. It was abandoned by the overwhelming number of people called to it, and it is continued today in the Catholic Church. We have a priesthood, THE sacrifice, THE Temple. And that is because Judaism is built on waiting for a Messiah who will come to institute his reign – that happened two thousand years ago. The Jews who accepted Him became the Church, the Jews who rejected Him – having voted themselves out of the Covenant – went off and started a man-made religion. Rabbinical Judaism, today's Jewish religion, is to authentic Judaism what Protestantism is to Catholicism. <b>Looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> it sometimes but at its core it's very different." [...] Voris went on to equate modern Judaism with Protestantism, labeling both religions originating with man.|$|E
