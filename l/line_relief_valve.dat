The change of pump speed can be achieved via an inverter which governs the speed of an induction motor. In this paper, both the pump-controlled hydraulic motor system and the inverter-controlled hydraulic motor system are studied. A microcomputer-based self-tuning adaptive controller was designed and applied to both systems. A series of simulations and experi-ments was pe&rmed.

40|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>valves</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industrial}} machinery. Due to the outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> being connected to the tank, the pressure drop of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is frequently equal to the inlet pressure. Accordingly, the energy loss of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is very high in some cases and this will worsen {{with an increase in}} the rated pressure of the hydraulic system. In order to overcome the disadvantage of overflow energy loss in a <b>relief</b> <b>valve,</b> a hydraulic energy regeneration unit (HERU) is connected to the outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> to decrease the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> The overflow loss, which is characterized by the pressure drop, can be reduced accordingly. The approach is to convert the overflow energy loss in hydraulic form and allow for release when needed. The configuration and working principle of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with HERU is introduced in this present study. The mathematical model is established to obtain the factors influencing the stability of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> The working pressure of the hydraulic accumulator (HA) is explored.
