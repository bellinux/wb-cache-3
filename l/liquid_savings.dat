40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{specific}} effect that firing costs {{can have on}} firms facing liquidity constraints. When firing costs are zero and a time gap exists between production and its associated revenues, firing allows firms {{to hold on to}} their <b>liquid</b> assets by <b>saving</b> on wages, and thus, allows firms to cope better with liquidity shocks when external financing is too costly or unavailable. I refer to this feature as labor's liquidity service. Higher firing costs reduces the value of labor's liquidity service, and thus, increases firms' incentive for hoarding liquidity and reduces firms' demand for production inputs. In addition to this negative effect at the creation margin of production, firing costs have a relatively higher positive effect on the destruction margin of production of financially restricted firms. This paper presents a model that develops these ideas and shows that the presence of firing costs has a stronger negative effect on the output of firms facing liquidity constraints. Regression analysis, based on country-industry panel data sets, provides empirical evidence consistent with the liquidity service effect of firing costs. I find a relatively stronger negative effect of firing costs on the output of industries with higher liquidity requirements and a relatively stronger negative effect of firing costs on the output of small, and more likely financially constrained, firms.

40|$|When {{a natural}} {{disaster}} hits, the affected households try to cope with its impacts. A variety of coping strategies may be employed, from reducing current consumption to disposing of productive assets. The latter strategies are especially worrisome, as they may reduce {{the capacity of the}} household to generate income in the future, possibly leading to chronic poverty. In this paper, we use the results of a household survey in rural Uganda to ask, first, what coping strategies would tend to be employed {{in the event of a}} weather disaster, second, given that multiple strategies can be chosen, in what combinations would they tend to be employed, and, third, given that asset-liquidation strategies can be particularly harmful for the future income prospects of households, what determines their uptake? Our survey is one of the largest of its kind, containing over 3000 observations garnered by local workers using smart-phone technology. We find that in this rural sample by far the most frequently reported choice would be to sell livestock. This is rather striking, since asset-based theories would predict more reliance on strategies like eating and spending less today, which avoid disposal of productive assets. It may well be that livestock are held as a form of <b>liquid</b> <b>savings</b> too, among other things, help bounce back from a weather disaster. Yet we do find that other strategies, which might undermine future prospects, are avoided, notably selling land or the home, and disrupting the children's education. Our econometric analysis reveals a fairly rich set of determinants of different subsets of coping strategies. Perhaps most notably, households with a more educated head are much less likely to choose coping strategies involving taking their own children out of education...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{consumer}} financial decision making has received considerable attention in recent years. This thesis {{contributes to the}} literature on financial literacy and measuring underlying behavioural characteristics to explain individual choice, as well as the experimental literature on the certainty effect and robustness of experimental results. The thesis is separated into three substantive chapters. The first two substantive chapters use individual level survey data of a representative sample of UK households to investigate the role of financial literacy and behavioural traits in (i) the simultaneous holding of consumer credit and <b>liquid</b> <b>savings,</b> i. e. the `co-holding puzzle', and (ii) mortgage choice. My results show that underlying individual traits are important predictors for consumer choice. Households with self-control issues are significantly more likely to co-hold substantial amounts, consistent with the notion that co-holding is a form of self-control management to limit consumption. My results also show that individuals with low levels of financial literacy and an impulsive present bias for consumption are significantly more likely to hold alternative, non-amortising, mortgage products. This suggests that these mortgages may attract consumers who are less likely to sufficiently understand their features, and who put more weight on present consumption. The third substantive chapter reports and discusses evidence from two experimental studies, motivated by evidence that people may prefer simple and/or certain options disproportionally. The first study investigates the certainty effect using a new laboratory design that goes beyond the pairwise-lottery choices typically used in the literature. The results provide little evidence of a certainty effect in this setting, where subjects can choose from eleven options. In the second study, I attempt to replicate the results of the original experiment that suggests that people are significantly more likely to prefer simple options when faced with larger choice sets. I follow the procedure of the original design, but my results provide no evidence for a disproportionate preference for simplicity. Instead, subjects choose according to their risk attitude...|$|E

The utilization of heat-exchange gas considerably reduces many problems, that arise in the design of completely dry LTS magnets. The goal was to decrease or even completely avoid the consumption of rather expensive liquid helium for testing the laboratory size Nb-Ti and Nb 3 Sn coils including their training process. Several superconducting magnets were tested by using these facilities. For example, the first facility was successfully used for testing of 13 T, 60 kg coil cooled by cryocooler in helium gas (several torr pressure) heat exchange atmosphere. The precooling time was about 45 hours. The quench current (240 A at 4. 2 K) was equal to that reached in the pool boiling LHe cryostat. The second facility with 420 mm wide access bore can be used for testing of corresponding size superconducting coils with very modest consumption of liquid helium with its level well below the lower flange of the coil.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{problems}} lying {{within the field}} of soft condensed matter: the viscous fingering or Saffman-Taylor instability and nematic liquid crystals in confinement. Whenever a low viscosity fluid displaces a high viscosity fluid in a porous medium, for example water pushing oil out of oil reservoirs, the interface between the two fluids is rendered unstable. Viscous fingers develop, grow and compete until a single finger spans all the way from inlet to outlet. Here, using a free energy lattice Boltzmann algorithm, we examine the Saffman-Taylor instability for two different wetting situations: (a) when neither of the two fluids wet the walls of the channel and (b) when the displacing fluids completely wets the walls. We demonstrate that curvature effects in the third dimension, which arise because of the wetting boundary conditions, can lead to a novel suppression of the instability. Recent experiments in microchannels using colloid-polymer mixtures support our findings. In {{the second part of the}} thesis we examine nematic liquid crystals confined in wedge-structured geometries. In these systems the final stable configuration of the liquid crystal system is controlled by the complex interplay between confinement, elasticity and surface anchoring. Varying the wedge opening angle this competition leads to a splay to bend transition mediated by a defect in the bulk of the wedge. Using a hybrid lattice Boltzmann algorithm we study the splay-bend transition and compare to recent experiments on {em fd} virus particles in microchannels. Our numerical results, in quantitative agreement with the experiments, enable us to predict the position of the defect as a function of opening angle, and elucidate its role in the change of director structure. This has relevance to novel energy <b>saving,</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal devices which rely on defect motion and pinning to create bistable director configurations.
