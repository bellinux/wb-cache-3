So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E
5|$|In August 1968, in an {{interview}} to Rolling Stone, Townsend talked about a new rock opera, which had the working title of Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy, and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages. Who biographer Dave Marsh subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album. Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint. The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, and <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> artistic control over the project.|$|E

Only Rosalie Lisa Ely (c. 1815-1904) survived to adulthood, married and had children.|$|E
500|$|Partners are {{normally}} {{allowed to talk}} to each other during the game. They can for instance ask for a specific piece, for more trades, ask to hold a piece, suggest moves or ask their partner to stall. Shouts like [...] "Knight mates!" [...] or [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> a Rook!" [...] are common, and can lead to seemingly absurd sacrificial captures on the other board. Partners are not allowed to physically act on the other board.|$|E

500|$|The phrase {{has been}} used in a number of books and films. The phrase was used in the film <b>Let</b> <b>Him</b> <b>Have</b> It by the {{character}} of Lord Goddard, however [...] "may The Lord have mercy upon your soul" [...] was used instead of the regular phrase. It was also written in Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The phrase [...] "may God have mercy on your soul" [...] was also used in the 1995 film, Billy Madison as part of an insult. In the classic The Green Mile, guards Paul Edgecomb, Brutus Howell and Percy Wetmore use this phrase before they conduct an execution.|$|E
500|$|When Earl Warren {{successfully}} ran for Governor of California in 1942, Chotiner {{served as}} his field director. However, he alienated Warren when, {{hoping for a}} favor {{in light of his}} 1942 support, he asked the newly inaugurated governor to decline to approve the extradition of one of his clients to another state. Warren had Chotiner thrown out of his office, and the future chief justice refused to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> anything to do with his re-election campaign in 1946. According to Nixon biographer Earl Mazo, Chotiner stated that while people remembered him for [...] "making" [...] Richard Nixon, [...] "the real man I created was Earl Warren".|$|E
500|$|Following Taboo Tuesday, the storyline between John Cena and Kurt Angle continued. A {{match was}} {{scheduled}} in which Cena would defend WWE Championship against Angle at November's pay-per-view event Survivor Series. In the scripted feud, Angle refused {{to compete in}} the November 7 episode of Raw due to the [...] "you suck" [...] chants from the audience. Angle finally agreed to compete that night when Eric Bischoff censored the crowd and <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> a special guest referee for his title rematch against Cena; Angle chose Daivari to be the guest referee. Before their scheduled rematch, Daivari's officiating was unfair and biased towards Angle's opponents. At Survivor Series, Cena went on to defeat Angle to retain his title.|$|E

500|$|Travelling with Irwin was Ensign Robert Dale, who {{had somehow}} {{acquired}} Yagan's head. According to the historian Paul Turnbull, Dale {{appears to have}} persuaded Irwin to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> the head as an [...] "anthropological curiosity". After arriving in London, Dale tried to sell the head to scientists, approaching a number of anatomists and phrenologists. His price of ₤20 failed to find a buyer, so he made an agreement with Thomas Pettigrew for the exclusive use of the head for 18 months. Pettigrew, a surgeon and antiquarian, was {{well known in the}} London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and autopsied Egyptian mummies. He displayed the head on a table in front of a panoramic view of King George Sound reproduced from Dale's sketches. For effect, the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the red-tailed black cockatoo.|$|E
500|$|Reports {{conflict}} {{about who}} shot first, {{but after two}} members of the mob approached the house, someone opened fire. Sarah Carrier was shot in the head. Her nine-year-old niece at the house, Minnie Lee Langley, had witnessed Aaron Carrier taken from his house three days earlier. When Langley heard someone had been shot, she went downstairs to find her grandmother, Emma Carrier. Sylvester placed Minnie Lee in a firewood closet in front of him as he watched the front door, using the closet for cover: [...] "He got behind me in the wood , and he put the gun on my shoulder, and them crackers was still shooting and going on. He put his gun on my shoulder... told me to lean this way, and then Poly Wilkerson, he kicked the door down. When he kicked the door down, Cuz' Syl <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|Another rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between John Cena and Kurt Angle, over the WWE Championship. Their feud began in August, when Bischoff chose Angle as the number one {{contender}} to the WWE Championship. Angle failed to win the title at Unforgiven, due to Cena being disqualified. The two squared off against each other again at Taboo Tuesday in a Triple Threat match that also included Shawn Michaels, and again Cena retained the title. On the November 7 edition of Raw, Angle refused {{to compete in a}} tag team match pitting him and Chris Masters against Cena and Michaels due to the [...] "you suck" [...] chants from the audience. Angle finally agreed to compete if Bischoff silenced the crowd and <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> a special guest referee. Angle chose Daivari, who favoured Angle and Masters throughout the match and ultimately disqualified Cena and Michaels for using a chair, which he had ignored earlier when it had been used by Masters.|$|E

500|$|Clamp said Syaoran {{became popular}} with male readers as a hero. After {{events of the}} Oto country where Syaoran participated in several battles {{fighting}} for the king Ashura and was at disadvantage, Clamp's editor for Tsubasa, Kiichiro Sugawara, wrote that he wondered whether [...] "anything good ever happen to Syaoran"; Clamp said that their publishing company, Kodansha had received demands from readers for Syaoran to become stronger, and advised Clamp to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> occasional good experiences. In order to make his fight scenes more entertaining, Clamp thought about giving Syaoran named sword techniques like those of Kurogane {{but in the end}} this was not added to the series. Clamp originally planned Subaru to be Syaoran's teacher. However, the group later decided to replace Subaru with Seishiro. During {{the second half of the}} manga when it was revealed Syaoran was a clone from another character who became the protagonist. Clamp aimed to make both of them equally different based on their actions despite being virtually identical.|$|E
500|$|Alongside his {{intellectual}} pursuits Cardus played and followed cricket. As {{a small boy}} {{he had begun to}} visit Old Trafford Cricket Ground to watch Lancashire matches: [...] "The first cricketer I saw was A.C. MacLaren... I can still see the swing of MacLaren's bat, the great follow-through finishing high and held there with the body poised". In 1902 he saw the Test match against Australia in which Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus's heroes. Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme; as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced off break bowler, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket. [...] "I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the crease, to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> a quick one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene".|$|E

Due to Davros' message, the missile devastates the Kaled dome, wiping out all but those in the bunker. In the Kaled bunker, Davros accuses Ronson of giving the Thals the chemical formula and then kills him, and convinces the remaining leaders to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> his Daleks attack the Thal dome. The Dalek attack kills many of the Thals, and the Doctor, his companions, and the surviving Thals and Mutos {{make their way}} to the Kaled bunker. The Doctor instructs the Thals and Mutos to find a way to destroy the bunker while he and his companions go inside to recover the Time Ring. While there, the Doctor is captured by Davros, who recognises the Doctor knows of the future of the Daleks, and forces the Doctor to record all he knows, so that Davros can program the Daleks to avoid failure in the future.|$|E

500|$|Wright was {{a skilled}} {{designer}} of mathematical instruments. According to the 1615 Caius annals, [...] "e was excellent both in contrivance and execution, {{nor was he}} inferior to the most ingenious mechanic {{in the making of}} instruments, either of brass or any other matter". For Prince Henry, he made models of an astrolabe and a pantograph, and created or arranged to be created out of wood a form of armillary sphere which replicated the motions of the celestial sphere, the circular motions of the sun and moon, and the places and possibilities of them eclipsing each other. The sphere was designed for a motion of 17,100years, if the machine should last that long. In 1613 Wright published The Description and Use of the Sphære, which described the use of this device. The sphere was lost during the English Civil War, but found in 1646 in the Tower of London by the mathematician and surveyor Sir Jonas Moore, who was later appointed Surveyor General of the Ordnance Office and became a patron and the principal driving force behind the establishment of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Moore asked the King to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>have</b> it, restored the instrument at his own expense and deposited it at his own house [...] "in the Tower".|$|E
