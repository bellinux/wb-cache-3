The first is that coherence—in a sense unusu- al in law—plays {{a crucial role in}} <b>legal</b> <b>science.</b> The second is that doctrinal <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> is a social enterprise and this should be consid- ered in attempts to understand it. Based on these, a picture of doctrinal <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> is given consisting of parallel distributed constructions of consistent, comprehensive and ex- pansive sets of legal beliefs.

2500|$|For Max Weber, a {{so-called}} [...] "legal rational form" [...] {{as a type}} of domination within society, is not attributable to people but to abstract norms. He understood the body of coherent and calculable law in terms of a rational-legal authority. Such coherent and calculable law formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism. Central to the development of modern law is the formal rationalisation of law on the basis of general procedures that are applied equally and fairly to all. Modern rationalised law is also codified and impersonal in its application to specific cases. In general, Weber's standpoint can be described as an external approach to law that studies the empirical characteristics of law, as opposed to the internal perspective of the <b>legal</b> <b>sciences</b> and the moral approach of the philosophy of law.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{offers a}} preliminary critical examination of Kelsenian <b>legal</b> <b>science,</b> {{understood as a}} distinctive theoretical and methodological project for the comprehension of positive law. The authors contend that Kelsen sought, in his initial elaboration of a <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> of public law, as a juridical theory of the state (Staatsrechtslehre), to controvert prevailing conceptions of <b>legal</b> <b>science.</b> The authors further argue that Kelsen’s subsequent articulation and refinement of a <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> of positive law structured Kelsen’s various critiques of natural law theories, {{his opposition to the}} intrusion of ethico-political value judgments in the cognition of positive law, his constitutionalism, his theories of democracy and his conception of the relationship between domestic law and international law. Preparative to an extended and extensive examination, this critical discussion contemplates the contemporary relevance of Kelsenian <b>legal</b> <b>science...</b>|$|R
40|$|This book {{critically}} {{examines the}} conception of <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> {{and the nature of}} law developed by Hans Kelsen. It provides a single, dedicated space for a range of established European scholars to engage with the influential work of this Austrian jurist, legal philosopher, and political philosopher. The introduction provides a thematization of the Kelsenian notion of law as a <b>legal</b> <b>science.</b> Divided into six parts, the chapter contributions feature distinct levels of analysis. Overall, the structure of the book provides a sustained reflection upon central aspects of Kelsenian <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> and the nature of law. Parts one and two examine the validity of the project of Kelsenian <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> with particular reference to the social fact thesis, the notion of a science of positive law and the specifically Kelsenian concept of the basic norm (Grundnorm). The next three parts engage in a critical analysis of the relationship of Kelsenian <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> to constitutionalism, practical reason, and human rights. The last part involves an examination of the continued pertinence of Kelsenian <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> as a theory of the nature of law with a particular focus upon contemporary non-positivist theories of law. The conclusion discusses the increasing distance of contemporary theories of legal positivism from a Kelsenian notion of <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> in its consideration of the nature of law...|$|R

40|$|THE <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> of Underhill Moore was {{the product}} of the twomajor {{movements}} of moder legal thought: legal realism and sociologicaljurisprudence. It demonstrates both the strength and the limitationsof these two legal theories. His work had this somewhat paradoxicalcharacter because he substituted scientifically exact methods anddeeds for the vivid but unverifiable, pseudo-descriptive prose in whichthese two movements had all too often been previously expressed. When this was done the actual capability of a <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> grounded ina realistic application of scientific methods to social and legal facts wasrevealed to be quite different from what many earlier proponents hadclaimed. Consequently, more than anyone else Underhill Mooredemonstrated precisely what legal realism and sociological jurisprudenceas traditionally conceived can and cannot do. And for this reasonhis work probably marks not merely the culmination of the jurisprudenceof the recent past but also a turning point in <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> generally. It is as important, therefore, as a clue to the <b>legal</b> <b>science</b> of theimmediate future as it is to an estimation of the remarkable originalcontributions of Underhill Moore to <b>legal</b> and social <b>science</b> that webecome clear about the aim, the method and the results of the uniquesociology of law which he created and applied...|$|R
