In 1955 Cruikshank was named director of the AFL's newly formed Department of Social Security. He continued in that role after the AFL and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) merged in 1955. Cruikshank used his position to protect and enhance Social Security as part of the union movement's commitment to a comprehensive <b>legislative</b> <b>package</b> of federal social insurance programs, including national health care insurance and income supports for the poor, people with disabilities and the unemployed. He created the AFL-CIO's Social Security Advisory Committee as a political group to press for higher and expanded benefits. In 1956, Cruikshank's efforts were instrumental in winning passage of the Social Security Disability Insurance amendments, which provided income assistance to permanently disabled workers.|$|E

500|$|Another <b>legislative</b> <b>package</b> was {{introduced}} by State Senators Armistead Boothe and Ted Dalton. The Boothe-Dalton plan was less ambitious in scope. It proposed a plan in which: 1) Student school assignments would be made on factors other than race; 2) Parents unhappy with their child's school assignment would have access to an administrative appeals system; and 3) Teachers could transfer schools only as conditions warranted. The key element of the Boothe-Dalton plan was in how it differed from the Gray Commission student assignment plan. The Gray Commission plan assigned students {{on the basis of}} student welfare, availability of facilities and transportation, health, and aptitude, whereas the Boothe-Dalton plan expanded the list of factors to include school attendance areas, academic background, student personality, and student needs. Additionally, the Boothe-Dalton plan provided for an administrative appeal process, which the Gray Commission plan did not. It also identified a very specific, time-consuming process for assignment appeals (to the local school board, the state board of education, state circuit courts, state supreme court, and eventually the U.S. Supreme Court). Finally, it contained a [...] "local option" [...] that would allow racial integration in public schools [...] "where localities are ready" [...] (according to Boothe).|$|E

There was open celebration, and no doubt some relief, amongst government members in the House of Representatives when the package of carbon pricing bills passed that chamber on October 12, 2011. Many reports described the climate change legislation as having passed the Federal Parliament. That was not strictly true of course, as the bills still needed to be passed - in the same form - by the Senate. Given that was all but assured, the Labor Government understandably wanted to give a clear message that the climate change package had been delivered. Equally understandably, the Greens want to highlight the significance of today 2 ̆ 7 s final Senate vote on the package of climate change measures.

2500|$|As vice president, Fillmore had {{presided over}} some of the most momentous and passionate debates in American history as the Senate debated whether to allow slavery in the western territories. The ongoing {{sectional}} conflict had already excited much discussion when on January 21, 1850, President Taylor sent a special message to Congress urging the admission of California immediately and New Mexico later, and that the Supreme Court settle the Texas boundary dispute. On January 29, Henry Clay introduced an Omnibus bill which combined the four diverse subjects under discussion. His <b>legislative</b> <b>package</b> included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of its conflicting northern and western territorial claims to the federal government in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. The status of slavery in the territories of the Mexican Cession would be decided by those living there; this doctrine of [...] "popular sovereignty" [...] would overturn the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had outlawed slavery in territory West of Missouri and North of the 36°30′ parallel. Taylor was unenthusiastic about the bill, and it languished in Congress.

50|$|A minimum winning {{coalition}} {{is the smallest}} number of votes required to win {{the passage of a}} piece of legislation. Minimum winning coalitions demonstrate the importance of logrolling within a democracy, because the minimal winning coalition may be overthrown with the sway of a single vote. As previously mentioned, coalitions will buy a supermajority of votes if the support for the proposed legislation sways. If a legislator logrolls a few votes beyond the minimal winning coalition to his side, he will ensure that the final vote will be in favor of his legislation. In a way, vote trading does combine positions on distinct issues to form single <b>legislative</b> votes and <b>packages</b> (Stratmann 1992).

Similarly, the academia and the media have shown interest in Civil Society in Turkey and its actors, “Civil Society Organizations (CSOs),” especially with the rising impact of the EU accession process. The transformation of civil society and its organizations in Turkey has not been enabled solely through {{the impact of the}} EU. Nevertheless, it would not be incorrect to say that the EU is the strongest variable influencing both this transformation and the rise of several other active and efficacious actors. Specifically after the Helsinki Summit 1999, which gave Turkey candidacy status, governments have been eager to conform to EU demands. Accordingly, <b>legislative</b> reform <b>packages</b> involving amendments concerning civil society, e. g., the New Associations Law and the New Civil Code have emerged. There is no EU acquis communautaire in civil society area but rather member states have the full competence to organize their related legislation. Additionally, in the EU level, there is unbinding legislation pertaining to and intensive interactions with the CSOs. The EU helps with funding and getting CSOs involved in the decision-making processes, as well. Turkish CSOs benefit from EU funds, receive support and exercise bilateral relations, even at not the level desired, with many EU institutions. Yet, it should be born in mind that the transformation of civil society is not only political or economic, but also cultural and social. Thus, it takes time for it to be internalized by the public, which actually comes to constitute civil society itself...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the EU policy on {{electricity}} markets integration by reviewing {{the experience of the}} Electricity Regional Initiatives. The regional approach to market integration delivered important results in areas such as coordination among national transmission system operators, implementation of market-based mechanisms for cross-border transmission capacity allocation and transparency. Furthermore, the inclusive governance process lead by ERGEG gave voice to all relevant stakeholders. However, there are indications that the regional model reached its limit when faced with the objective of coordinating day-ahead and real-time markets. The unanimity approach at the regional level made the intra-regional decision-making process extremely slow. Further, inter-regional integration issues have not been solved yet and attempts to tackle them by prioritising projects in some Regions weakened the pluralistic attributes of the regional model. The Third <b>Legislative</b> Energy <b>Package</b> has the potential to overcome some of these shortcomings by empowering pan-European institutions (ENTSO and ACER) and by involving Member States in the decision making process. Some weaknesses of the second-package, though, persist in the new framework. First, there are no provisions ensuring that ENTSO will have appropriate incentives to act in the interest of European consumers. Second, the Third Package perpetuates the separation between within-country congestion management – which remains a national issue – and cross-border congestion management – to be dealt with at the EU level. This two-tier approach is inconsistent with the highly meshed nature of the European network and is likely to result in inefficient market design. Further, the implementation of coordinated cross-border and national congestion management mechanisms requires considering geographically differentiated prices within countries, a politically unattractive result for most Member States. retail competition, electricity regulation...|$|R
40|$|In her paper, Professor Hannah-Moffat {{raises a}} number of {{important}} issues regarding the use of risk assessment at sentencing, including policy considerations related to theories of punishment as well as practical concerns about systematic expansion of disparity and discrimination as a consequence of implementation. She makes a compelling argument for the need for expanded research to justify the use of actuarial risk as part of the sentencing process and to test and improve the accuracy and validity of risk assessment instruments. In this policy essay, we respond by describing the experiences in two jurisdictions, Virginia and Pennsylvania, and the practical realities of developing and implementing actuarial sentencing policies within a political environment. The Commonwealth of Virginia has a determinate sentencing system, in which advisory sentencing guidelines structure decision-making by criminal courts. In 1997, in response to a statutory mandate, the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission incorporated into its sentencing guidelines an empirically-based risk assessment instrument, intended to divert 25 % of the lowest risk, prison-bound drug and property offenders from state incarceration (Kern and Farrar-Owens, 2004). In 2001, again {{as a result of a}} legislative mandate, the Commission adopted and incorporated into its sentencing guidelines a sex offender risk assessment instrument, intended " [...] . to identify those offenders who, as a group, represent the greatest risk for committing a new offense once released back into the community"(Kern and Farrar-Owens, 2004). The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has an indeterminate sentencing system, in which advisory sentencing guidelines adopted by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing structure decision-making by criminal courts, and an internally-developed parole decisional instrument established by the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole guides parole determinations. This latter instrument incorporates the use of LSI-R and Static- 99 scores, as well as weighted and non-weighted risk factors.
