40|$|New height precise Earth Geopotential Model EGM 08 made it {{possible}} to develop the value of the geoidal geopotential W 0. This value is independent on Earth’s tides and others disturbances, therefore it can b e used as basic quantity for many applications. Value W 0 represents mean sea surface. W 0 was developed from data of satellite altimetry which monitores actual ocean’s surface. This value is one of the four fundamental geodetic constants. This value has been ac cepted worldwide and is included to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service Conventions (IERS Conventions) 2003, 2007. This value defines in principle parameters of <b>level</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> which best fit to the surface defined by W 0. The body of this <b>level</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> produces normal gravity. We developed other important parameters for determination of the density deviations (VTT technology), i. e. values of normal gravity g e at the equator and g p at the pole on the elipsoid E 0 and the value of parameter β. All parameters above used for development of VTT technology are supplied by GPS/leveling data that enable to create so-called density deviation maps at any place in the World. In comparison with gravity anomalies, the density deviations represent more precise density anomalous places in the Earth’s crust. A construction of density deviation map is applied at two from geologically different regions—the Western Carpathians and the Central African Rifts. </p...|$|E
30|$|The main {{weakness}} of the BFR Algorithm resides in {{the assumption that the}} covariance matrix of each cluster is diagonal, which means that the components of the analyzed multivariate data should be uncorrelated. With such assumption, at each step of the algorithm only the means and variances of each component of the clusters centers must be retained, reducing thus the computational costs. Further, in this setting the estimated covariance matrices are invertible even in presence of clusters composed just by two p-dimensional gaussian data points. Anyway such assumptions geometrically imply that the <b>level</b> surfaces (<b>ellipsoids)</b> of the gaussians including the data points in each cluster should be oriented with main axes parallel to the reference system.|$|R

The {{signal to noise ratio}} of known tidal variability to altimeter measurement of sea <b>level</b> above the <b>ellipsoid</b> was 0. 1.

30|$|Our study {{included}} 797 patients, {{who had an}} elevated PSA level ranging from 4 to 20  ng/mL and had undergone a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy from September 2009 to January 2013 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, China. All the patients envolved in our study are Chinese men. Detail patient information, including age, PSA, free PSA (fPSA), digital rectal examination (DRE) findings and other clinical information were recorded before prostate biopsy. The information of patients’ PSA levels were provided by laboratory of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, they used a single validated assay to assess PSA <b>levels.</b> An <b>ellipsoid</b> formula (PI/ 6  × lateral × anteroposterior × superoinferior diameters) was {{used to calculate the}} prostate volume (PV) of every patient in this study by means of ultrasonoscopy, and detailed observation were carried out regarding microcalcifications and hypoechoic lesions. PSA density (PSAD) was defined as the ratio of PSA to PV. The free/total PSA ratio (f/T) was calculated by dividing the level of fPSA present by the total level of PSA.|$|R
40|$|In {{geodetic}} applications, {{three different}} surfaces or earth figures are normally involved. In {{addition to the}} earth's natural or physical surface, these include a geometric or mathematical reference surface, the ellipsoid, and an equipotential surface called the geoid (Chapter 6). In determining the WGS 84 Ellipsoid and associated para-meters, the WGS 84 Development Committee, in keeping with DMA guidance, decided quite early to closely adhere to the thoughts and approach used by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) when the latter establ i shed and adopted Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS 80) E 3. 11. Accordingly, a geocentric equipotential el 1 ipsoid of revolution was taken as the form for the WGS 84 Ellipsoid. The parameters selected to define the WGS 84 Ellipsoid are the semimajor axis (a), the earth's gravitational constant (GM), the normalized second degree zona 1 gravitational coefficient (r), and the angular velocity (w) of the 2,o earth (Table 3. 1). These parameters are identical to those for the GRS 80 Ellipsoid with one minor exception. The coefficient form used for the second degree zonal {{is that of the}} WGS 84 Earth Gravitational Model rather than the notation J 2 used with GRS 80. Accuracy estimates (one sigma) are also given in Table 3. 1 for the defining parameters. Cited references treating GRS 80 have been borrowed from freely in preparing this Chapter. 3. 2 The Ea~iDotential Elli~soid An equipotential ellipsoid, or <b>level</b> <b>ellipsoid,</b> is an ellipsoid defined to be an equipotential surface. If an ellipsoid of revolution (with semimajor axis a and semiminor axis b) is given, then it can be made an equipotential surface U = Uo = Constant of a certain potential function U, called the normal (theoretical) gravitypotential. This function is uniquely determined by means of the ellipsoid surface (semiaxes a, b), the enclosed mass (MI, and the angular velocity (a), according to a theorem of Stokes-Poincare, quite independently of the internal density distribution. Instead of the four constants, a, b, My and w, any other system of four independent parameters may be used as defining constants. However, as noted in Section 3. 1, above, the defining parameters of the WGS 84 El lipsoid are the semimajor axis (a), the earth's gravitational constant (GM), the earth's angular velocity (w), and the normalized second degree zonal harmonic coefficient (7 :) of the gravita...|$|E
