While the Lark experiments demonstrated co-segregation, the co-segregation {{may have been}} an artifact of radiation from the tritium. Although Potten identified the cycling, label-retaining cells as adult stem cells, these cells are difficult to identify unequivocally as adult stem cells. While the engineered cells provide an elegant model for co-segregation of chromosomes, studies with these cells were done in vitro with engineered cells. Some features may not be present in vivo or may be absent in vitro. In May 2007 evidence in support of the Immortal DNA Strand theory was discovered by Michael Conboy et al., using the muscle stem/satellite cell model during tissue regeneration, where there is tremendous cell division during a relatively brief period of time. Using two BrdU analogs to <b>label</b> <b>template</b> and newly synthesized DNA strands, they saw that about half of the dividing cells in regenerating muscle sort the older [...] "Immortal" [...] DNA to one daughter cell and the younger DNA to the other. In keeping with the stem cell hypothesis, the more undifferentiated daughter typically inherited the chromatids with the older DNA, while the more differentiated daughter inherited the younger DNA.|$|E

Among them, we can find the examination of persistent storage, the continuous unsupervised annotation of memories and the usage of data at high-frequency {{over long periods of}} time. We recently proposed a lifelong autobiographical memory architecture tackling some of these challenges, allowing the iCub humanoid robot to 1) create new memories for both actions that are self-executed and observed from humans, 2) continuously annotate these actions in an unsupervised manner, and 3) use reasoning modules to augment these memories a-posteriori. In this paper, we present a reasoning algorithm which generalises the robots’ understanding of actions by finding the point of commonalities with the former ones.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplify and label region of interest that contains a potential protein-binding site, ideally amplicon is between 50 and 200 base pairs in length. Add protein of interest to {{a portion of the}} <b>labeled</b> <b>template</b> DNA; a portion should remain separate without protein, for later comparison. Add a cleavage agent to both portions of DNA template. The cleavage agent is a chemical or enzyme that will cut at random locations in a sequence independent manner. The reaction should occur just long enough to cut each DNA molecule in only one location. A protein that specifically binds a region within the DNA template will protect the DNA it is bound to from the cleavage agent. Run both samples side by side on a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The portion of DNA template without protein will be cut at random locations, and thus when it is run on a gel, will produce a ladder-like distribution. The DNA template with the protein will result in ladder distribution with a break in it, the [...] "footprint", where the DNA has been protected from the cleavage agent.Note: Maxam-Gilbert chemical DNA sequencing can be run alongside the samples on the polyacrylamide gel to allow the prediction of the exact location of ligand binding site.|$|R

The traditional mental health assessment method is mainly based on questionnaire surveys, which may have some uncertainties. In this study, based {{on the relationship between}} the default mode network (DMN) and the mental health status, we proposed a human mental sub-health early warning method by utilizing twofold support vector machine (SVM) model, where seafarers’ fMRI data analysis was utilized as an example. The method firstly constructed a structural-functional DMN template by combining the anatomical automatic <b>labeling</b> <b>template</b> with the functional DMN extracted by independent component analysis. Then, it put forward a twofold SVM-based classifier, with one-class SVM utilized for the training of the initial classifier and two-class SVM utilized to refine the classification performance, to identify seafarers’ mental health status by utilizing the correlation coefficients (CCs) among the areas of structural-functional DMN as the features. The experimental results showed that the proposed model could discriminate the seafarers with DMN function alteration from the healthy control (HC) effectively, and further the results demonstrated that when compared with the HC group, the brain functional disorders of the mental sub-healthy seafarers mainly manifested as follows: the functional connectivity of DMN had obvious alteration; the CCs among the different DMN regions were significant lower; the regional homogeneity decreased in parts of the prefrontal cortex and increased in multi-regions of the parietal, temporal and occipital cortices; the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation decreased in parts of the prefrontal cortex and increased in parts of the parietal cortex. All of the results showed that fMRI-based analysis of brain functional activities could be effectively used to distinguish the mental health and sub-health status...|$|R
40|$|Label {{printing}} finds {{many applications}} in industry. However, this task is still labor intensive in many printing factories. Since each template can only accommodate a fixed number of labels, an important {{task is to}} work out the compositions of templates by allocating suitable <b>labels</b> to each <b>template</b> in order to fulfill the order requirements effectively. The template design could be rather arbitrary, which usually ends {{up with a lot of}} excessive printed <b>labels.</b> Enhancing the <b>template</b> design will significantly improve the efficiency of the printing process, and, at the same time, reduce the waste of resources. This motivates the study of more automatic design methods. In this paper, the problem is first formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem. The main variables in the formulation are the compositions and the printing frequencies of templates. For practical purpose, each type of label is confined to one template only which allows automated packing and handling. The structure of the problems is carefully analyzed and a new algorithm is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed method is a simple but effective way of generating good template designs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that females of the primitively eusocial tropical wasp Ropalidia marginata can discriminate nestmates from nonnestmates outside {{the context of their}} nests. This was accomplished by recording all behavioural interactions in a neutral arena and comparing tolerance levels. In order for these wasps to make such a discrimination, however, it was essential that after eclosion both the discriminated and the discriminating animals were exposed to their respective natal nests and nestmates. The results suggest that both recognition <b>labels</b> and <b>templates</b> are acquired by the animals from sources outside their body, perhaps from their nest or nestmates. It is thus unlikely that different genetic lines within a colony can be distinguished. We conclude, therefore, that genetic asymmetries created by haplodiploidy, but often broken down by multiple mating polygyny, are not restored by preferential altruism towards full rather than half sisters by means of kin recognition. Hence we recommend caution in ascribing the multiple origins of eusociality in the Hymenoptera to haplodiploidy...|$|R

Ants, and other social insects, have evolved advanced societies characterized by efficient social recognition systems. Colony identity is mediated by colony specific signature mixtures, a blend of hydrocarbons present on the cuticle of every individual (the “label”). Recognition occurs when an ant encounters another individual, and compares the label it perceives to an internal representation of its own colony odor (the “template”). A mismatch between <b>label</b> and <b>template</b> leads to rejection of the encountered individual. Although advances {{have been made in}} our understanding of how the label is produced and acquired, contradictory evidence exists about information processing of recognition cues.

40|$|A novel {{strategy}} {{to prepare a}} selective ultrathin molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film directly on the gold-based transducer surface for the peptide and protein detection in aqueous solution is demonstrated {{using a combination of}} epitope- and electrochemical surface imprinting approach. The synthetic peptide derived from the surface-exposed C-terminus of cytochrome c (Cyt c, residues 96104) is selected as the template for the imprinting. It is labeled with a fluorescent dye in order to quantitatively evaluate all stages of the imprinting process in terms of changes in mean fluorescence intensity. The <b>labeled</b> peptide <b>template</b> is first chemisorbed on the gold surface as an oriented submonolayer through an additional C-terminal cysteine. After electropolymerization, the template is stripped off electrochemically. To allow the imprinted sites to be confined to the surface, the film thickness is controlled to be comparable to the thickness of the peptide layer. This is achieved by the electropolymerization of scopoletin. Recognition capabilities of the films are characterized and the resulting MIP film is able to selectively capture the template peptide and the corresponding target protein. In case of the peptide recognition, the MIP film can discriminate even the single amino acid mismatched sequences of the target peptide...|$|R

Recognition cues (label) {{are thought to}} be perceived during ant–ant encounters and compared to a neuronal template that represents the colony label. Over time, the CHC-profile may change, and the template is adjusted accordingly. A phenotype mismatch between <b>label</b> and <b>template,</b> as happens with CHC-profiles of foreign workers (non-nestmates), frequently leads to aggressive behavior. We investigated the template reformation in workers of the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus by masking their antennae with postpharyngeal gland (PPG) extracts from nestmates or non-nestmates. The behavioral response of manipulated workers encountering unmanipulated workers was measured independently after 2 and after 15 h. After 2 h of incubation, workers treated with either of the two PPG-extracts showed low aggression towards nestmates and high aggression towards non-nestmates. In contrast, after 15 h of incubation, workers treated with non-nestmate PPG-extract showed low aggression towards both nestmates and non-nestmates. The slow (> 2 h) adjustment of the template indicates a reformation localized in the central nervous system rather than in chemosensory neurons. In addition, our data show that template adjustment to a new CHC-profile does not impair the assessment of the old CHC-profile as nestmate label...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Ear is a {{new class}} of {{relatively}} stable biometrics which is not affected by facial expressions, cosmetics and eye glasses. To use ear biometrics for human identification, ear detection is the first part of an ear recognition system. In this chapter we propose two approaches for locating human ears in side face range images: (a) template matching based ear detection and (b) ear shape model based detection. For the first approach, the model template is represented by an averaged histogram of shape index that can be computed from principal curvatures. The ear detection is a four-step process: step edge detection and thresholding, image dilation, connect-component <b>labeling</b> and <b>template</b> matching. For the second approach, the ear shape model is represented by a set of discrete 3 D vertices corresponding to ear helix and anti-helix parts. Given a side face range image, step edges are extracted and then the edge segments are dilated, thinned and grouped into different clusters which are the potential regions containing an ear. For each cluster, we register the ear shape model with the edges. The region with the minimum mean registration error is declared as the detected ear region; during this process the ear helix and anti-helix parts are identified. Experiments are performed with a large number of real side face range images to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

They also allowed classification of patients and healthy controls and could therefore be used as a diagnostic tool due to their ability to predict the class of an unseen sample. The main disadvantage of multivariate {{machine learning}} models is that local inference with respect to the brain neuroanatomy is complex: although linear models generate weights for each voxel, the model predictions are based on the whole pattern and therefore one cannot threshold the weights to make regional statistical inferences as in univariate analysis. In the present work, we developed a methodology based on a <b>labelled</b> anatomical <b>template</b> (e. g. AAL or Brodmann) to display a smoothed version of the model weights and compute a ranking of the regions according their contribution to the predictive model. This work is distributed in PRoNTo (Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox), a user-friendly toolbox, making machine learning models available to every neuroscientist. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel “dynamic {{learning}} ” approach for an intelligent image database system to automatically improve object segmentation and labeling without user intervention, as new examples become available, for object-based indexing. The proposed approach {{is an extension}} of our earlier work on “learning by example, ” which addressed labeling of similar objects in a set of database images based on a single example. The proposed dynamic learning procedure utilizes multiple example object templates to improve the accuracy of existing object segmentations and <b>labels.</b> Multiple example <b>templates</b> may be images of the same object from different viewing angles, or images of related objects. This paper also introduces a new shape similarity metric called Normalized Area of Symmetric Differences (NASD), which has desired properties for use in the proposed “dynamic learning ” scheme, and is more robust against boundary noise that results from automatic image segmentation. Performance of the dynamic learning procedures ha...|$|R
