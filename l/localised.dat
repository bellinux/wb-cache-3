40|$|Neurological signs {{have been}} {{described}} as “false <b>localising</b> ” if they reflect dysfunction distant or remote from the expected anatomical locus of pathology, hence challenging the traditional clinicoanatomical correlation paradigm on which neurological examination is based. False <b>localising</b> signs occur in two major contexts: as a consequence of raised intracranial pressure, and with spinal cord lesions. Cranial nerve palsies (especially sixth nerve palsy), hemiparesis, sensory features (such as truncal sensory levels), and muscle atrophy, may all occur as false <b>localising</b> signs. Awareness that signs may be false <b>localising</b> has implications for diagnostic investigation. The clinical examination of the nervoussystem is based on the premise of clinicoana-tomical correlation, with a particular neuro-logical sign indicating pathology at a specifi...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an instantaneously {{recorded}} baseline method is proposed using piezoelectric transducers for damage localisation under varying temperature. This method eliminates need for baselines required when operating at different temper- atures by mapping a baseline area onto the interrogation area. Instantaneously recorded baselines and current interrogation signals are calibrated {{based on the}} sensor mapping. This allows extraction of damage scatter signal {{which is used to}} <b>localise</b> damage. The proposed method is used to <b>localise</b> actual impact damage on a composite plate under varying temperatures. The method is also applied to a stiffened fuselage panel to accurately <b>localise</b> impact damage...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that damage in a structure may cause a discontinuity in mode shapes or their derivatives, {{which has been}} used as a basis for some damage detection approaches. However, if the severity of damage is small, the discontinuity will be diffi cult to be detected. The polynomial annihilation edge detection method improves the accuracy of <b>localising</b> discontinuity in a function by determining intervals of smoothness in the function. The feasibility of this edge detection method in <b>localising</b> and quantifying cracks in a cantilevered beam has been demonstrated (Surace et al, 2013). This study is to further validate this edge detection method on various types of structures and damages using numerical simulations. First, this method is performed on a cantilever aluminium bar under longitudinal vibrations to <b>localise</b> and quantify cracks; then, it is performed on a simply supported steel beam to detect cracks. Finally, this method is applied to a more complicated structure, a cable-stayed bridge model, to <b>localise</b> the damage occurring in girder...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo may already have been rare or <b>localised</b> before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.|$|E
