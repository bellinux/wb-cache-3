5|$|Enquiries about insect {{pollination}} led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed {{demonstration of the}} power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he would}} {{continue}} to write short poems and prose works, notably the 1963 Bottom: On Shakespeare, the completion of A was to be the major concern of the remainder of Zukofsky's writing life. As the poem progressed, formal considerations tended to be foregrounded more and more, with Zukofsky applying a wide range of devices and approaches, from the sonnet to aleatory or random composition. The final complete edition was going to press as the poet <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> deathbed in 1978. His final written work was the index to this volume.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Khurram {{received}} a broad education befitting {{his status as}} a Mughal prince, which included martial training and exposure {{to a wide variety of}} cultural arts, such as poetry and music, most of which was inculcated, according to court chroniclers, by Akbar and Ruqaiya. In 1605, as Akbar <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> deathbed, Khurram, who at this point was 13, remained by his bedside and refused to move even after his mother tried to retrieve him. Given the politically uncertain times immediately preceding Akbar's death, Khurram was in a fair amount of physical danger of harm by political opponents of his father, and his conduct at this time can be understood as a precursor to the bravery that he would later be known for.|$|E

25|$|Herrera {{turned his}} prisoners over to men in his squad, then started {{crawling}} {{toward the other}} machine gun, firing as he went. (“My M-1 was talking, and the Germans understood what it was saying,” he commented later.) The position was protected by a minefield; GIs were throwing rocks into the area {{in an effort to}} explode the mines. Herrera got up and charged the Germans anyway, but as he neared the machine-gun nest, he stepped on a mine. He was thrown to the ground, both of his feet blown off at the ankle. Though bleeding heavily, he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> stomach and fired at the Germans, forcing them to stay down and thus enabling his squad to skirt the minefield, flank the enemy, and move in for the kill.|$|E
25|$|John II succeeded {{his father}} as ruling basileus in 1118, but had already been proclaimed co-emperor by AlexiosI on September 1, 1092. Niketas Choniates alone tells of the actions by which JohnII secured his own {{accession}} to power. AlexiosI had favoured John to succeed him over his wife Irene's favourite, the Caesar Nikephoros Bryennios, who was married to their daughter Anna Komnena. Alexios resorted to dissimulation in order to avert Irene's criticism of his choice and her demands that Nikephoros should succeed. As Alexios <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> deathbed in the monastery of the Mangana on 15 August 1118, John, consorting with relatives whom he could trust, among whom was his brother, the sebastokratōr Isaac Komnenos, stole into the monastery and took the imperial signet ring from his dying father. Then, taking up arms, he rode to the Great Palace, gathering {{the support of the}} citizenry who acclaimed him emperor. Irene was taken by surprise and was unable either to persuade her son to desist, or to induce Nikephoros to act against him. Although the palace guard at first refused to admit John without proof of his father's wishes, the mob surrounding the new emperor simply forced entry.|$|E

500|$|Friends {{encouraged}} Crittenden to run {{for president}} in the 1848 election. A Nashville newspaper declared its support for him as early as 1846. A Democratic senator from Rhode Island opined that Crittenden could win support from a sizable number of Democrats in addition to the support of his own party. George B. Kinkead desired to have the Kentucky General Assembly nominate Crittenden for president in 1847. None of these overtures swayed Crittenden. [...] "For Heaven's sake don't talk to me about the Presidency," [...] he said, rebuffing one early offer. Clay hoped Crittenden would again support him, but Crittenden concluded that Clay was no longer a viable candidate and threw his support behind Kentuckian Zachary Taylor. This decision caused a rift between the two friends, and they were not reconciled until years later when Clay <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> deathbed.|$|E
500|$|In 1844 Helm {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate, where he served until 1848. That year he was the Whig {{candidate}} for lieutenant governor on a ticket with John J. Crittenden. Helm defeated Democrat John Preston Martin in the general election. The major political question in the state during Helm's time as lieutenant governor was whether to adopt a new state constitution. As a state senator in 1848, Helm had voted to allow the state's citizens to decide the matter in a referendum, but after seeing the document produced by the constitutional convention, he opposed its ratification. In an address to the state senate in 1850 he declared, [...] "I was for reform, and not for revolution. I was for amending the Constitution, and not for obliterating every vital principle in contained." [...] He especially opposed creating an elective judiciary. His antagonism to the constitution put him at odds with his father-in-law, Benjamin Hardin. The two did not reconcile until 1852, as Hardin <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> deathbed. The new constitution was adopted in 1850, and in June of that year Helm encouraged the people to accept it.|$|E

However, Wynn's records were not commercially successful, {{and he began}} working as a sideman in T-Bone Walker's band, mainly playing the baritone saxophone. By the late 1940s, Wynn had developed an innovative performance style, involving dancing, stomping, and playing the saxophone while <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back. One reviewer said: [...] "He would kick, dance, shuffle, strut, go down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees, roll and literally provide <b>his</b> own mini-show <b>on</b> stage, all the while blowing wild solos <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sax. He {{was the first of}} the Los Angeles area sax players to perform these antics on stage...". [...] Wynn himself said: [...] "Jay McNeely was a little kid when he used to come in and watch me play at weekends. Two or three years later he was <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back and playing. He's a great musician but he got the clowning from me." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{text and}} melody of Rodigast's hymn were {{published}} {{together for the}} first time in 1690 in the Nürnbergische Gesangbuch, with the composer marked as [...] "anonymous". Before that the melody with the hymn title had already been used by Pachelbel for an organ partita in 1683. Taking into account the appearance of the melody in the Klesch hymnbook and the history of the hymn given in the 1687 Nordhausen Gesangbuch, the Swiss theologian and musicologist Andreas Marti has suggested that it is plausible that, as he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sick-bed in Jena, the cantor Severus Gastorius had the melody of Fabricius spinning [...] around in his head as an [...] "earworm" [...] and was inspired to add a second half.|$|E

[...] Alexander ordered a period of mourning throughout the empire. Arrian tells us that [...] "Many of the Companions, out of respect for Alexander, dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead man..." [...] The army, too, remembered him; Alexander did not appoint anyone to take Hephaestion's place as commander of the Companion cavalry; he [...] "...wished Hephaestion's name to be preserved always in connection with it, so Hephaestion's Regiment it continued to be called, and Hephaestion's image continued to be carried before it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "But one Persian, a young man, {{riding up}} {{very close to}} the Roman army, began to {{challenge}} all of them, calling for whoever wished to do battle with him. And no one of the whole army dared face the danger, except a certain Andreas, one of the personal attendants of Bouzes, not a soldier nor one who had ever practised at all the business of war, but a trainer of youths in charge of a certain wrestling school in Byzantium. Through this it came about that he was following the army, for he cared for the person of Bouzes in the bath; his birthplace was Byzantium. This man alone had the courage, without being ordered by Bouzes or anyone else, to go out of his own accord to meet the man in single combat. And he caught the barbarian while still considering how he should deliver his attack, and hit him with his spear on the right breast. And the Persian did not bear the blow delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from his horse to the earth. Then Andreas with a small knife slew him like a sacrificial animal as he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, and a mighty shout was raised both from the city wall and from the Roman army." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the life}} of Jacob, the Qur'an narrates two {{especially}} important events. The first is the role he plays {{in the story of}} his son Joseph. [...] The Qur'an narrates the story of Joseph in detail, and Jacob, being Joseph's father, is mentioned thrice and is referenced another 25 times. In the narrative, Jacob does not trust some of his older sons (12: 11, 18, 23) because they do not respect him. (12: 8, 16–17) Jacob's prophetic nature is evident from his foreknowledge of Joseph's future greatness (12:6), his foreboding and response to the supposed death of Joseph (12: 13, 18) and in his response to the sons' plight in Egypt. (12: 83, 86–87, 96) Islamic literature fleshes out the narrative of Jacob, and mentions that his wives included Rachel. Jacob is later mentioned in the Qur'an {{in the context of the}} promise bestowed to Zechariah, regarding the birth of John the Baptist. (19:6) Jacob’s second mention is in the Qur'an’s second chapter. As Jacob <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> deathbed, he asked his twelve sons to testify their faith to him before he departed from this world to the next. (2:132) Each son testified in front of Jacob that they would promise to remain Muslim (in submission to God) until the day of their death, that is they would surrender their wholeselves to God alone and would worship only Him.|$|E
