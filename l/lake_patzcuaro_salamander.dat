50|$|Argulus ambystoma is {{a species}} of branchiuran {{parasitic}} on the <b>Lake</b> <b>Patzcuaro</b> <b>Salamander,</b> Ambystoma dumerilii, sharing that species' very limited range in Lago de Pátzcuaro, Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species has}} been {{suggested}} {{to be the same}} species as the <b>Lake</b> <b>Patzcuaro</b> <b>salamander,</b> Ambystoma dumerilii, based on genetic analysis, but their habitats have been isolated for 7-10 million years [...] A. dumerilii is also wholly neotenic, while A. ordinarium is variable but mostly terrestrial.|$|E
50|$|Recently, this {{salamander}} {{has been}} used in research as a counterpoint to the more common captive-bred Axolotl. <b>Patzcuaro</b> <b>salamanders</b> have been hybridized with axolotls, and used in mitochondrial studies for comparison.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} named after <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro,</b> at an {{altitude}} of 2035 m in Michoacán, Mexico. As well as <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro,</b> C. patzcuarensis also occurs in springs in Chapultepec, Opopeo and Tzurumutaro.|$|R
50|$|It {{has several}} <b>lakes,</b> like <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro,</b> <b>Lake</b> Cuitzeo, and Lake Zirahuén.|$|R
50|$|The {{wetlands}} {{are extremely}} important for birds, both year-round inhabitants and migrating waterfowl. Close to 200 species inhabit the wetlands, including some endemic {{species such as}} the black-polled yellowthroat (Geothlypis speciosa). Two native species have not been observed recently; the yellow rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) {{has not been seen}} since 1964 and may be locally extinct, and the endemic slender-billed grackle (Quiscalus palustris) is presumed extinct. The <b>Lake</b> <b>Patzcuaro</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma dumerilii) is endemic to the basin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> lies in an endorheic basin, {{which does}} not drain to the sea. The <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> basin is of {{volcanic}} origin.

Today, like lakes Cuitzeo and Zirahuén, it is a closed basin, although ecologists consider it a sub-basin of the Lerma-Chapala basin.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> lies in an endorheic basin, {{which does}} not drain to the sea.

The <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> watershed extends 50 kilometres east-west and 33 kilometres from north to south. <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> lies at an elevation of 1,920 metres, and {{is the center of}} the basin and is surrounded by volcanic mountains with very steep slopes. It has an average depth of 5 metres and a maximum of 11. Its volume is approximately 580 million cubic metres.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the algal growth-limiting {{nutrients}} of five lakes located on Mexico’s Mesa Central - a topic poorly known in the regional limnology of Mexico. The five case studies involved three contiguous watersheds of Michoacán State and provided a trophic state variation from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic; the case studies included <b>Lakes</b> Zirahuén, <b>Pátzcuaro,</b> Teremendo, Cuitzeo and the Cointzio Reservoir. The fieldwork involved the collection of physical and chemical data (including nutrients) from each case study during the dry and rainy seasons of 2010. Additionally, water samples (1 L) were obtained and filtered (0. 45 µm) in the laboratory to keep the nutrient content available for bioassays. The chemical analyses suggested a phosphorus (P) limitation in the Cointzio Reservoir, Lake Teremendo and Lake Zirahuén relative to an N:P> 16 : 1. There was a nitrogen (N) limitation at three sampling stations of <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro,</b> with an N:P< 16 : 1. As result of the bioassays conducted in July 2012, the Cointzio Reservoir and Lake Teremendo appeared to be P-limited and <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> appeared to be N-limited at three sampling stations. Lake Zirahuén showed seasonal variation, with an N limitation {{during the dry season}} and a P limitation during the wet season. Those cases with similar results from both methods confirmed the limiting nutrient identification. Lake Cuitzeo, Lake Zirahuén (dry season), and the shallowest sampling station in <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> produced unclear results because of divergent outcomes. In terms of the algal growth potential, the Cointzio Reservoir remained unaltered from one season to the next. However, for most of the lakes (with the exception of <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> sites 2 and 4), the rainy season provided a dilution effect. Effective lake management depends on a clear recognition of such elements that are in control of the aquatic productivity. In the area of Michoacán, both N and P may act as limiting nutrients. </p...|$|R
25|$|The main pre-Hispanic {{civilization of}} the state is that of the Purépecha, which was {{centered}} in the <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> area. Before the 13th century, both Nahua and Purépecha peoples were here, sustaining themselves by agriculture and fishing. The Purépecha are descendants of a late arrival of Chichimecas who came from the north. At <b>Lake</b> <b>Patzcuaro,</b> they came upon people with similar cultures to their own but who were more technically and socially advanced. The formation of the Purépecha state began in the 13th century, when these people started their own dominion at Uayameo, today Santa Fe de la Laguna and becoming dominant over the entire <b>Lake</b> <b>Patzcuaro</b> area by the 15th century. Conquest of neighboring tribes and territories occurred between 1401 and 1450, absorbing peoples with different cultures and languages into the empire. By the late 15th century, this state rivaled that of the Aztecs, expanding their territory over much of what is now Michoacán and into part of Colima, Nayarit, Querétaro, Guanajuato, Guerrero and Jalisco. The Aztecs attempted to invade Purépecha but were repelled. This would later cause the Purépecha to deny the Aztecs aid in the defense of Tenochtitlan against the Spanish.|$|R
50|$|After {{the conquest}} of Mexico, Vasco de quiroga {{gathered}} the Purépecha Indians into several villages around <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro,</b> and encouraged each to adopt a specific craft {{as a means to}} survival. His vision lives on years later: Capula for its rust-colored pottery.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> basin {{is home to}} the Purépecha people. Purépecha leaders {{established}} the basin as the heartland of the Tarascan state, which rivaled the Aztec Empire before the Spanish conquest. The towns of Ihuatzio, Tzintzuntzan and Pátzcuaro were important Purépecha centers.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the rest}} of Mexico, Day of the Dead commemorations are {{important}} here, and like {{the rest of}} the <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> area, the celebration is more often called Night of the Dead. In this municipality, homage to the dead in cemeteries begins the night of 1 November and continues to the morning of the 2nd with a candlelight vigil. These dates coincide with the pre-Hispanic harvest festival. Cultural festivities for this event include a parade with floats related to the Night of the Dead commemorations that take place along the edges of <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro,</b> as well as handcrafts and cooking competitions, which features atole. The name of this celebration is the Semana Artístico-Cultural de Noche de Muertos (Artistic-Cultural Week of the Night of the Dead).|$|R
50|$|The Purépechas {{occupied}} most of Michoacán's territory, {{but they}} also occupied some of the lower valleys of both Guanajuato and Jalisco. Celaya, Acámbaro, and Yurirapúndaro were all in Tarascan territory. Today Purépecha people live mostly in the highlands of central Michoacan around <b>lakes</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> and Cuitzeo.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the Feria {{originated}} with Marianne Carlson, an American expat living in Chapala, Jalisco, who went to tour seventeen craft villages around <b>Lake</b> <b>Patzcuaro</b> in 2002. There she found craft traditions unknown to most people, and which instead were only sold in local markets and fairs.|$|R
50|$|The Purépecha {{are known}} to have {{migrated}} from elsewhere to their current location, as their tradition includes stories of having traveled from the Pacific Ocean to their current locations. Ethnohistorical accounts mention them as a people dwelling in the same region of Michoacán inhabited by them today as early as the thirteenth century. According to the Relación de Michoacán the communities around <b>Lake</b> <b>Pátzcuaro</b> were gathered into the strong Purépecha state by the leader of the Uacúsecha group of Purépecha speakers, Tariácuri. Around 1300, he undertook the first conquests of other and installed his sons Hiripan and Tangáxoan as lords of Ihuatzio and Tzintzuntzan respectively, while he himself ruled from Pátzcuaro city.
