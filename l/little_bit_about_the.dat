In 1898, the U.S. Navy battleship Maine was anchored in Havana harbor to protect the Americans from a riot between Cuba and Spanish officers, and after the ship sank resulting in significant casualties, the Americans declared war against Spain, beginning the Spanish–American War. They damaged every ship in Manila Bay, This ended Spanish colonization of the Philippines, and replaced the colonizing Spaniards with Americans. When the war broke out, those football teams disbanded and abandoned the city, either to save themselves and their families from the bombardment they expected at any moment, or to cast their lot with the Filipino troops outside the city limits. After the war when peace reigned again, six football teams were formed, among them the Manila Sporting Club, the Paris Club, and the Manila Jockey Club. In 1906, the Sandow football team was established (further developed as Sandow Athletic Club in 1909).|$|E
