40|$|The {{level of}} stock prices on capital markets no longer {{reflects}} only the financial health of companies, and investors do {{not carry out}} their investment decisions based on classical fundamental analyses using accounting information. The level of the diminishing role of accounting information for investment decisions was proven by Lev and Zarowin {{with a sample of}} 1, 300 companies during the years 1976 - 1996. This paper further extends this analysis and verifies the validity of the original findings until the year 2011. The <b>low</b> <b>importance</b> and <b>impact</b> of accounting information was confirmed in the period 1994 - 2011, but the decline in importance significantly slowed down or in some cases even stopped completely. Surprisingly, the association between stock price and change in book value plus earnings {{has been found to be}} significantly improving. This trend should be subjected to further analysis...|$|R

30|$|For a <b>low</b> <b>importance</b> of coordination, {{the company}} prefers {{to use a}} {{top-down}} budgeting process instead of a participative budgeting process. In {{the case of a}} <b>low</b> <b>importance</b> of coordination, the coordination benefits are small. The additional incentive costs exceed the coordination benefits. Whereas coordination benefits are increasing in the importance of coordination the additional incentive costs are decreasing. Thus, for a high importance of coordination, the coordination benefits outweigh the additional incentive costs. Then, the participative budgeting process is preferred by the company. Hence, the managing owner affects the company’s profitability through the choice of the budgeting process.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} article we apply a growth mixture model using Mplus via STREAMS to {{delineate}} the mechanism underlying travel-mode choice. Three waves of an experimental field study conducted in Frankfurt Main, Germany, are applied for the statistical analysis. Five major questions are addressed: (1) whether the choice of public transport rather than the car changes over time; (2) whether a soft policy intervention to change travel mode choice has any effect on the travel-mode chosen; (3) whether one can identify different groups of people regarding the importance allocated to monetary and time considerations for the decision of which travel mode to use; (4) whether the different subgroups of people have different initial states and rates of change in their travel-model choices; (5) whether sociodemographic variables have an additional effect on the latent class variables and on the changes in travel-mode choice over time. We also found that choice of public transportation in our study is stable over time. Moreover, the intervention has an effect only {{on one of the}} classes. We identify four classes of individuals. One class allocates a <b>low</b> <b>importance</b> to both monetary and time considerations, the second allocates high importance to money and <b>low</b> <b>importance</b> to time, the third allocates high importance to both, and the fourth allocates a <b>low</b> <b>importance</b> to money and a high importance to time. We found no difference in the patterns of travel-mode changes over time in the four classes. We also found some additional effects of sociodemographic characteristics on the latent class variables and on behavior in the different classes. The model specification and the empirical findings are discussed in light of the theory of the allocation of time of Gary Becker...|$|R

40|$|What {{substantive}} criteria do Queensland judicial officers prefer for competence {{tests for}} non-accused child witnesses in criminal proceedings? Are competence tests for sworn and unsworn evidence distinguishable? This paper {{is the second}} reporting a suite of questions concerning competence, {{in a survey of}} Queensland judicial officers. This suite focussed on three general questions of interest: the referability of competence tests to the Queensland legislation; the substantive criteria of competence tests for sworn and unsworn evidence; and the formal framing of competence tests. Two question-types were included - judicial officers signalled, in closed-ended questions, the importance that listed criteria 'should' bear to competence tests, and, in open-ended questions, the questions they 'would' put in competence tests. Question-type seemingly affected some judicial responses. For sworn evidence, a child's understanding of an oath was assigned <b>low</b> <b>importance</b> in closed-ended questions (in two formulations), but high importance in open-ended questions. For unsworn evidence, a child's understanding of a promise was assigned extremely high importance in closed-ended questions (in two formulations), but <b>low</b> <b>importance</b> in open-ended questions. Consonant with law reform endeavours, both empirical and theoretical issues are traversed in this article. No Full Tex...|$|R
