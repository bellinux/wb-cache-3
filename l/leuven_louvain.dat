The French enjoyed an enormous numerical superiority with 40,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and 100 guns against an Austrian army counting 11,628 foot soldiers, 2,168 horsemen and 56 guns. Within one month the French armies overran {{most of the}} Austrian Netherlands, a territory known today as the nation of Belgium. On the right flank, the Army of the Ardennes led by Jean-Baptiste Cyrus de Valence advanced down the Meuse River toward Huy. On the way, Valence dropped off a force under Louis-Auguste Juvénal des Ursins d'Harville to besiege Namur. Dumouriez himself with the Army of Belgium captured Liège. The Army of the North commanded by Francisco de Miranda laid siege to Antwerp. It was joined by a column under Benôit Guérin de Berneron that marched first from Ath northeast to <b>Leuven</b> (<b>Louvain).</b>|$|E
25|$|The French {{army was}} {{composed}} of three Army Groups. The 2nd and 3rd Army Groups defended the Maginot Line to the east; the 1st Army Group under Gaston Billotte was situated {{in the west and}} would execute the movement forward into the Low Countries. Initially positioned on the left flank near the coast, the Seventh Army, reinforced by a Divisions Légères Méchanique (DLM), was intended to move to the Netherlands via Antwerp. Next to the south were the motorised divisions of the BEF, which would advance to the Dyle Line and position itself {{to the right of the}} Belgian army, from <b>Leuven</b> (<b>Louvain)</b> to Wavre. The First Army, reinforced by two light mechanised divisions and with a Division Cuirassée de Réserve (DCR, Reserve Armoured Division) in reserve, would defend the Gembloux Gap between Wavre and Namur. The southernmost army involved in the move forward into Belgium was the French Ninth Army, which had to cover the Meuse sector between Namur to the north of Sedan.|$|E
500|$|Mercator was {{a devout}} Christian {{born into a}} Catholic family {{at a time when}} Martin Luther's Protestantism was gaining ground. He never {{declared}} himself as a Lutheran but he was clearly sympathetic and he was accused of heresy (Lutheranye). He spent six months in prison but he emerged unscathed. This period of persecution is probably the major factor in his move from Catholic <b>Leuven</b> (<b>Louvain)</b> [...] to a more tolerant Duisburg where he lived for the last thirty years of his life. Walter Ghim, Mercator's friend and first biographer, describes him as sober in his behaviour, yet cheerful and witty in company, and never more happy than in debate with other scholars, but above all he was pious and studious until his dying days.|$|E

2500|$|This {{event was}} {{triggered}} by a public allocution of , a professor in thomistic philosophy at the university, on student life at Germanic universities on January 21, 1896. [...] During his student years in Bonn, Thiéry had {{become a member of}} the prestigious student fraternity K.D.St. V. Bavaria Bonn, the oldest Catholic student fraternity in the world.
