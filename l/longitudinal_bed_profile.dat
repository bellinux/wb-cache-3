40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the long term configuration attained by a tidal channel, namely its <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> and shape. Channel evolution is simulated through a one-dimensional numer-ical model, where the role of intertidal areas is neglected. The channel has a rectangular cross section and it is closed at one end. The major novelty of the work is that the width of the channel is allowed to change in time: in the present model lateral erosion is computed as a function of bed shear stress, provided it exceeds a threshold value within the cross section. The system, forced by a prescribed free surface oscillation at the seaward boundary, reaches an equilibrium profile of both bottom elevation and channel bank. The equilibrium geometry of the channel is determined for different initial and boundary conditions. Furthermore, the spatial variations of the cross section at equilibrium are analyzed in order to identify those conditions under which the commonly used exponential law of channel width variation is reproduced. Finally, a comparison is pursued between model predictions and bathymetries of real estuaries. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{many cases}} the {{response}} of a glacier to changing climatic conditions is complicated due to {{the large number of}} feedback loops that play a role. Examples are: ice thickness - mass balance feedback, nonlinearities arising from complicated geometry, dependence of ablation on glacier geometry, coupling between debris cover, ice flow and ablation etc. In this paper an attempt is made to quantify such processes by carrying out numerical experiments with an ice-flow model. Some conclusions and suggestions are: (i) The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> is very important. Apart from the well-known fact that glaciers are more sensitive when the bed slope is small, a reversed slope (slight overdeepening) creates branching of the equilibrium states, i. e., for the same climatic conditions two glaciers of different geometry can both be in a stable steady state. (ii) Due to the height-mass balance feedback, glaciers on a smaller slope react slower to climatic change. (iii) The mass balance gradient as observed on long valley glaciers is to a substantial part determined by systematic changes (along-valley) in glacier width and surface albedo. The balance gradient is thus coupled to the dynamics, and this should be studied further...|$|E
40|$|Historical {{information}} {{was used to}} study river degradation in {{a case study in}} NE Spain. The accumulation of good topographical information since the 1940 s for the Gállego river (a tributary of the Ebro river, which drains about 4, 000 km 2 of the southern slopes of the Pyrenees) enables a comparison of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> <b>profiles.</b> Historical research has also revealed the volume of gravel mined, which amounts to ≈ 1 million m 3 compared to the volume of alluvium lost due to incision in the same period, which is ≈ 2 million m 3. This unbalance is explained by a simple model based on a bedload equation and an algorithm to determine whether effective bedload transport is controlled by transport capacity or by the supply of sediment. It follows from the analysis that the incision process has changed the magnitude of the shear stresses on the bottom. This is because, as the river becomes degraded, higher discharges fit into the main channel before spilling. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Mountain glaciers {{respond to}} climatic changes by {{advancing}} or retreating, {{leaving behind a}} potentially powerful record of climate through moraine deposition. Estimates of past climate have been made based on the moraine record alone, using geometrical arguments; however, these methods necessarily ignore the effects of glacier dynamics and bed modification. Here, a one-dimensional coupled mass balance-flowline model is used to place constraints on the climate of the Late-glacial (13. 5 – 11. 6 kyr ago) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 28 – 17. 5 kyr ago) based on the well-mapped and -dated moraines at Tasman Glacier/Lake Pukaki, South Island, New Zealand. Due to the highly-dynamic nature of the system, distinct <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> <b>profiles</b> are considered {{for each of the}} glaciations modelled; the reconstructions show that terminal overdeepenings are likely present in all <b>bed</b> <b>profiles,</b> and hundreds of metres of sediment has been deposited in the glacier valley since the LGM. Using the coupled model and calculated bed topography, a 2. 2 °C temperature depression from the present is necessary to reproduce the Lateglacial ice extent, and 7. 0 °C is required for the early LGM, assuming presentday precipitation. The modelled Late-glacial ice extent is more sensitive to precipitation variability than that during the LGM, but the Tasman Glacier during both periods is primarily driven by temperature changes. While the Tasman Glacier shrank between the early and late LGM, modelling demonstrates that changes in bed topography due to erosion, transport and deposition of sediment are a major driver in reduction of glacier extent; a temperature increase of only 0. 1 °C is required to cause the transition between the two periods, which may be attributable to interannual, zero-trend climate variability. Thus, the consideration of the coupled glacier-sediment system is critical in accurately reconstructing past climate. Future work focusing on modelling this coupled system, such that the <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> can evolve interactively with glacier flow, will be critical in better resolving transient events such as the early to late LGM transition...|$|R
40|$|Tidal {{channels}} dissect {{the tidal}} landscape and exert a crucial {{control on the}} morphodynamic evolution of these landscapes. Improving our understanding of channel equilibrium morphology is therefore an important issue for both theoretical and practical reasons. We analyze {{the case of a}} tidal channel dissecting a relatively short, unvegetated tidal flat characterized by microtidal conditions and a negligible external sediment supply. The three-dimensional equilibrium configuration of the channel is determined {{on the basis of a}} hydrodynamic model, describing the cross-sectional distribution of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> shear stresses, coupled with a morphodynamic model retaining the description of the main physical processes shaping the channel and the adjacent intertidal platform. Both channel bed and width are allowed to adapt to the flow field so that an equilibrium altimetric and planimetric configuration is eventually obtained, when erosion becomes negligibly small, and asymptotically constant elevations are reached everywhere within the domain. Model results reproduce several observed channel characteristics of geomorphic relevance, such as the relationship between channel cross-sectional area and the flowing tidal prism, the scaling of the width-to-depth ratio with channel width, and the <b>longitudinal</b> distributions of <b>bed</b> elevations and channel widths. In analogy with empirical evidence fromestuaries, tidal channel funneling is usually assumed to be described by an exponential trend. Our theoretical analyses, modeling results, and observational evidence suggest that a linear relationship also provides a good approximation to describe longitudinal variations in channel width for short tidal channels. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> <b>profiles</b> characterized by a strong planform funneling tend to attain an upward concavity, whereas a low degree of convergence implies an almost linear profile. Finally, the model allows one to analyze the influence of environmental conditions (sediment characteristics, basin size, tidal amplitude, etc.) on the geomorphological features of tidal channels (equilibrium cross-sectional area and bottom profile, width-to-depth ratios, and planform shape). Wider and deeper channels develop as the width of the domain increases, as the tidal amplitude increases, or as the mean platform elevation decreases. Conversely, narrower and shallower channels result from an increase in the critical shear stress for erosion or a decrease in the flow conductance. We thus believe that this model provides a useful tool for quantitative analyses of long-term morphodynamics of tidal landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Natural rivers tend {{to adjust}} their plane shape and {{longitudinal}} profile in order to assume a configuration compatible with the changing hydraulic and man-made constraints. The causes of these bed variations are related to changes in independent river channel variables (increase in water discharge, decrease in sediment discharge, etc [...] ) or to changes in river slope. River bed degradation and aggradation, often occurring as result of river morphological changes, modify the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> {{of the river and}} the amount of sediment transported along the river until to reach the outlet. As an example, the construction of river dams produces large morphological consequences: when the stream passes through a large capacity reservoir much of the incoming sediment is trapped and practically clear water flows out. The computation of the evolution in time of the river bed variations is rather complex since it is influenced by many interrelated factors. In this work, a 1 -D numerical model recently developed is applied in order to to simulate the bed longitudinal profile variations and to quantitatively estimate the material transported by the flow at each river section as far as the outlet. For the application, data collected both in testing river reaches and in laboratory channels have been considered...|$|E
40|$|Sediment-dynamics {{modeling}} is {{a useful}} tool for estimating a dam's lifespan and its cost-benefit analysis. Collecting real data for sediment-dynamics analysis from conventional field survey methods is both tedious and expensive. Therefore, for most rivers, the historical record of data is either missing or not very detailed. Available data and existing tools have much potential and may be used for qualitative prediction of future bathymetric change trend. This study shows that proxy approaches may be used to increase the spatiotemporal resolution of flow data, and hypothesize the river cross-sections and sediment data. Sediment-dynamics analysis of the reach of the Tenryu River upstream of Sakuma Dam in Japan was performed to predict its future bathymetric changes using a 1 D numerical model (HEC-RAS). In this case study, only annually-averaged flow data and the river's <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> at 5 -year intervals were available. Therefore, the other required data, including river cross-section and geometry and sediment inflow grain sizes, had to be hypothesized or assimilated indirectly. The model yielded a good qualitative agreement, with an R 2 (coefficient of determination) of 0. 8 for the observed and simulated bed profiles. A predictive simulation demonstrated that the useful life of the dam would end after the year 2035 (± 5 years), which is in conformity with initial detailed estimates. The study indicates that a sediment-dynamic analysis can be performed even with a limited amount of data. However, such studies may only assess the qualitative trends of sediment dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Channelisation {{measures}} taken halfway the 20 th century have had destructive {{consequences for the}} diversity of the ecology in the majority of the lowland streams in countries such as the Netherlands. Re-meandering is the common practice in restoring these lowland streams. Three reconstructed streams were monitored during the initial two years after construction of a new channel. The monitoring program included morphological surveys, sediment sampling, habitat pattern surveys, and discharge and water level measurements. Adjustments of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> formed the main morphological response. These adjustments were most likely caused by a lack of longitudinal connectivity of the streams as a whole, interrupting transport of sediment at locations of weirs and culverts. Bank erosion was observed only in a limited number of channel bends, and was often related to floodplain heterogeneity. Longitudinal channel bed adjustments and bank erosion were mainly caused by exogenous influences. In channel bends, the cross-sectional shape transformed from trapezoidal to the typical asymmetrical shape as found in meandering rivers. This behaviour can be attributed to an autogenous response to the prevailing flow conditions. Due to the prevailing fine sediment characteristics, bed material is readily set in motion and is being transported during the entire year. The existing design principles fail to address the initial morphological development after reconstruction. An evaluation of pre-set targets to realise water depth and flow velocity ranges shows the current procedures to be deficient. Based on this unfavourable evaluation, and the two-dimensional nature of habitat patterns needed to improve the conditions for stream organisms, we recommend to predict morphological developments as part of the design procedures for lowland stream restoration in the Netherlands. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audience[1] The use of {{microscale}} experimental rivers (with flow {{depths of}} the order of a few millimeters) to investigate natural processes such as alluvial fans dynamics, knickpoints migration, and channel morphologies, such as meandering and braiding has become increasingly popular in recent years. This raises the need {{to address the issue of}} how to extrapolate results from the experimental microscale at which flow is laminar to the scale of natural turbulent rivers. We address this question by performing measurements of average flow velocity and sediment transport in an experimental laminar river. The average flow velocity is correctly predicted from the Navier-Stokes equation solved for a steady uniform laminar flow. Laminar sediment transport is found to be consistent with the law of Meyer-Peter and Müller (1948) commonly used to describe sediment transport in natural turbulent rivers. We also show that surface tension is important only if the microscale river width is on the order of or smaller than the capillary length. These results allow us to demonstrate that the evolution of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> <b>profiles</b> of turbulent and laminar rivers are governed by identical dimensionless equations and therefore follow the same dynamics. Differences of time and length scales at work in experimental and natural rivers are mainly encoded in the expression of two parameters, a diffusion coefficient and a threshold slope. On the basis of this analysis, we derive a set of equations allowing us to rescale bed elevation, downstream distance, time, and uplift rate from an experimental microscale river to the field scale. Finally, we show how this set of equations can be used to rescale these same parameters in the case of a temporally varying discharge. Citation: Malverti, L., E. Lajeunesse, and F.

40|$|Over {{the past}} centuries natural riverbanks have been {{transformed}} into banks with artificial revetments or sheet piles {{to protect them from}} erosion, which led to disappearance of important river features for flora and fauna. River restoration projects show that the removal of man-made bank protections may lead to the formation of bars (e. g. Van den Berghe et al., 2012; Schirmer et al., 2014). Habitat diversity in rivers may be enhanced through the formation of river bars with preferably diversity in bar height, size and location. This research aims at gaining knowledge into the effects of removing riverbank protections on bar formation to enhance habitat diversity. Mobile-bed flume experiments were performed in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of Delft University of Technology. The experiments were focussed on bar formation related to three variables of a bank protection removal; length, location and flow asymmetry. Geometrical and morphodynamic characteristics were selected for the experiment having a bar mode of one to obtain a system with alternate bars (Crosato and Mosselman, 2009) and showed gravel-bed river similarity based on bankfull river characteristics of Parker (2004). The experimental flume consisted of a 6. 2 metre long and 0. 2 metre wide straight channel with 0. 5 metre wide floodplains on the sides. On both sides of the channel, bank protection could be removed over a limited length with optionally a groyne upstream. After seven hours {{at the end of each}} test, photos of the bed topography were taken and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> was measured. Bar wavelengths and bar heights in each experimental test were determined from detrended bed profiles. The bar height was divided in two classes: low and high. The areas of low bars, high bars, floodplains and the deep channel were determined from photos of the final bed topographies. Bar types were indicated with terminology from Duró et al. (2015) as forced, free or hybrid. Removal of bank protections resulted in lateral erosion of channel banks over a limited length. The eroded bank line moved in downstream direction, which agrees with the downstream meander migration observed in field and laboratory investigations by many authors (e. g. Odgaard, 1987). Scour holes developed downstream of the widened section, due to turbulent eddies forced by the channel geometry. In the widened reach, flow decelerated which resulted in a lower sediment transport. Consequently, sediment was deposited in the widened reach and caused rising of the mean bed level along with formation of bars. In areas with higher flow velocities an increased sediment transport deepened the channel. When the riverbanks were fixed, relatively low, small, side bars were formed in the channel. In general, the total bar area and bar height increased for an increase in channel widening, due to the removal of bank protection. An increased bank protection removal length up to nine times the channel width or an upstream asymmetrical flow forcing, i. e. groyne, increased the total bar area, whereas a bank protection removal at three different locations with a total length of nine times the channel width did not significantly increased the total bar area. It is recommended to remove riverbank protections over a length of at least nine times the river width on both sides of the river with optionally a groyne upstream as a measure to enhance habitat diversity. It is also valuable to remove the bank protection on one side of the river only. It is advised to construct a groyne upstream of the bank protection removal to increase habitat diversity. This research led to results that can be used in further research. It is advised to conduct larger scale experiments and eventually move to the field.

40|$|Stream {{restoration}} efforts often aim {{at creating}} new unconstrained meandering channels without weirs and bank revetments. In reconstructed streams, the initial morphological {{response of the}} new streams is often rapid, until a dynamic equilibrium is reached. Here we report on a chute cutoff that occurred within 3 months after realization of a stream restoration project, caused by a plug bar that formed {{in response to a}} backwater effect. The temporal evolution of the morphology of both the new and the old channels was monitored over a period of nearly 8 months, including precutoff conditions. The observations can be separated into three stages. Stage 1 is the initial period leading to cutoff vulnerability, stage 2 is the actual cutoff, and stage 3 is the morphological adjustment in response to the cutoff. In stage 1, a plug bar was deposited in one of the channel bends. Hydrodynamic model results show the location of the plug bar coincides with a region where bed shear stress decreased in downstream direction due to backwater. <b>Longitudinal</b> channel <b>bed</b> <b>profiles</b> show that the channel slope decreased soon after channel reconstruction. Hence, sediment from upstream was available to form the plug bar. After the plug bar was deposited, an embayment formed in the floodplain at a location where the former channel was located (stage 2). The former channel was filled with sediment prior to channel construction. It is likely that the sediment at this location was less consolidated, and therefore, prone to erosion. The chute channel continued to incise and widen into the floodplain and, after 6 months, acted as the main channel, conveying the discharge during the majority of time (stage 3). The cutoff channel gradually continued to fill with sediment, from the moment the plug bar formed until the chute channel incised into the floodplain. Sedimentary successions of the deposited material show upward fining, which is in agreement with observations of chute cutoffs in rivers. Although the artificial setting limits the degree in which the observed processes can be projected on natural rivers, the observations prompt to investigate the role of backwater effects in natural chute cutoff initiation. </p...|$|R

The Itambi catchment basin is characterized in its upper {{part by the}} volcanic sierra with > 70 % slope, and in its lower part by lake deposits. The length of Rio Itambi is 17 km with a catchment basin of 11, 271 ha; the annual flow amounts to 0. 07 – 0. 5 m 3 /s. Stream structure is evaluated using a modification of the German “Geomorphological Structure Classification Method” with six main parameters (development of stream <b>bed,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile,</b> transversal <b>profile,</b> <b>bed</b> structure, stream bank structure, and surrounding environment).

40|$|From {{the past}} many {{numerical}} models which can predict coastal <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> updates have been developed. They are ranged from one dimensional shore line change model to three dimensional <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution models. Three dimensional <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution models include both cross shore (due to wave actions) and long shore (due to currents) sediment transports components and widely use to predict <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions from days to years. Two dimensional <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution models include only cross shore (due to wave actions) sediment transport component and widely use to predict <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution from hrs to days. One dimensional shoreline change models calculate <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions {{for months to}} years. All these models are capable of producing <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions well. However, to have detailed information on changing bed topography in short times, the effect of changing <b>bed</b> <b>profiles</b> to velocity fields and sediment concentrations in very short time periods can't be obtained using these models. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> updating model which can use to predict very short term <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions and to study {{the effect on the}} developed <b>bed</b> <b>profiles</b> on the velocity fields and sediment concentrations. For the developed model, as it is considering very short time <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions, only the cross shore sediment transport component was considered. Cross shore transport mainly governed by the wave actions specially wave breaking. The <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions due to wave breaking mainly occur due to the turbulences and complex fluid motions occurred during wave breaking. The turbulences make shear stress on the bottom which cause sediments to pick up and horizontal and obliquely descending eddies cause the picked up sediments to transport. Therefore, a model which can calculate the turbulences and eddy structures well was needed and LES was used for that purpose. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a method for resolving the time dependent structure of high Reynolds number turbulent flows. LES is an important tool in wave breaking studies where flow mixing, sediment entrainment and sediment transport are all affected by the presence of coherent vortices and their interactions with boundaries and other flow structures. However, due to the simulation costs associated, the developed model can mainly be used for academic perspective where very small-scale <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> changes are analyzed (e. g., erosion around breakwater due to a sudden flow, profile change under each wave, profileevolutions under buried obstacle, flow fields around cobble mines etc.). An existing LES code (Wijayarathne, 2000; Suzuki et al., 2007) was improved further to model <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution. The developed model consists of LES flow model, sediment pick up and advection model and a <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution model. The velocity fields, bottom shear stresses and pressure fields are calculated from the LES flow model. Navier stocks equation modified by adding a sub grid scale model to calculate the small scale eddies is used in the LES flow model. The sediment pick up and advection module calculates the sediment pick up from the bottom using Nielsen's formula which is depend on the shields parameter. When the instantaneous shields parameter value is greater than the critical shear stress, pick up occurs. The instantaneous shields parameter is mainly depend on the bottom velocities. The picked up sediments are assumed to be transported with the flow fields. A flux approach was used to calculate the sediment transport. Sediments which achieved the settling velocity, settled to the bottom. The <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution model uses the sediment continuity equation to calculate the profile update. The resultant of pick up and settled amounts caused for the <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> update. Settled sediment amount calculated considering the sediment concentrations in each cells which includes sheet flow and the settling velocity of the sediments. If the change in <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> is greater than 1 grid size, the corresponding grid is changed as a solid grid and if it is reduced more than one grid size, the corresponding grid is changed to water grid. The boundary conditions of the developed grids are changed accordingly. Mainly pressure and velocities are changed at the newly developed boundaries. The newly developed grids are updated to the domain and the next step's calculations are based on the new domain. The developed model was validated with the experimental results. Since several modifications were carried out in the existing flow module, the flow model also verified with the experimental results. Verification of the flow model was done with velocity fields and free surfaces. Particle image velocimetry was used to obtain velocity fields and wave gauge reading was used to obtain free surface distributions. With the results of free surfaces distributions, it was concluded that the numerical results are consistent with the experimental results. The non-linearity of the wave breaking region also well producedwith the model results. Results of velocity fields, both in magnitude and directions were consistent to each other. Small differences occurred due to random movements of seeded materials. The numerical model for the flow field after modifications was validated with the experimental results. The verified model was also used to simulate the flow around a stepped sea wall after wave overtopping. Several phases of a wave were considered. It was observed that the model is capable of simulating the overtopping well. The turbulence generated after wave overtopping caused high bottom shear stress and made some pick up and suspensions of sediments. Therefore, the change in <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> was observed after wave overtopping. Numerical results were compared with the experimental results for the generated <b>bed</b> <b>profiles.</b> It was observed that a considerable erosion occurs at the toe of the structure followed by a small deposition and erosion again afterwards in both experiment and numerical simulation. The <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> model results were validated with the profile evolution occurred due to wave overtopping from a stepped breakwater. The trend of profile evolutions were consistent in numerical and experimental results though numerical simulation results showed some overestimation. Some of the reasons for this discrepancy caused due to not considering the friction from the sediment clouds to the flow. This increases the velocities in the eroded cells and cause more erosion. Further, the large pressure gradient caused during wave overtopping also can cause for large erosion. Since the model can simulate the <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> change after the wave overtopping, model can be used to simulate erosion or depositions around breakwaters or some other structures during a storm surges or tsunamis where waves overtopped from the structure. The verified model was used to study the flow fields and sediment motions under different wave breaking conditions. Particularly, spilling and plunging breaking conditions. Plunging breaking where the turbulences occur mostly in the wave plume and spilling phenomena where the turbulences are concentrated on wave crest were well simulated from the model. Vertical sections of velocity fields of each wave breaking conditions were compared. It was observed that the plunging wave breaking has higher velocities as well as more turbulence than spilling breaking. Since the turbulences are concentrated on the wave plume, generation of bottom shear stresses is higher in plunging wave breaking condition...|$|R

40|$|Results are {{discussed}} of laboratory experiments on criteria determining the transition between {{the regime of}} dunes and the upper stage plane bed (UPB) regime and the transition between the UPB regime and the regime of wavy flow. The experiments were carried for 3 fractions of plastic material and two fractions of glass beads in {{a broad range of}} flow conditions (different discharges of water and solids and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> slopes) in a tilting flume. The experiments reveal that, contrary to expectations, a constant value of the Shields parameter is not an appropriate criterion for the transition between the dune regime and the UPB regime. Instead, the criterion seems to be well represented by a constant value of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bed</b> slope. The transition between the UPB regime and the wavy regime is found at a constant value of the densimetric Froude number. Relatively high values of Froude number at the threshold are due primarily to the presence of the collisional transport layer which protects the bed from an influence of undulating water surface...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{research}} {{efforts have been}} devoted to understanding estuarine morphodynamics under tidal forcing. However, the impact of river discharge on estuarine morphodynamics is insufficiently examined. Inspired by the Yangtze Estuary, this work explores the morphodynamic impact of river discharge in a 560 km long tidal basin based on a 1 -D model (Delft 3 D). The model considers total load sediment transport and employs a morphodynamic updating scheme to achieve long-term morphodynamic evolution. We analyze the role of Stokes drift, tidal asymmetry, and river discharge in generating tidal residual sediment transport. Model results suggest that morphodynamic equilibrium is approached within millennia by vanishing spatial gradients of tidal residual sediment transport. We find that the interaction between ebb-directed Stokes return flow/river flow with tides is an important mechanism that flushes river-supplied sediment seaward. Increasing river discharge does not induce continuously eroded or accreted equilibrium <b>bed</b> <b>profiles</b> because of the balance between riverine sediment supply and sediment flushing to the sea. An intermediate threshold river discharge can be defined {{which leads to a}} deepest equilibrium <b>bed</b> <b>profile.</b> As a result, the shape (concavity or convexity) of the equilibrium <b>bed</b> <b>profiles</b> will adapt with the magnitude of river discharge. Overall, this study reveals the significant role of river discharge in controlling estuarine morphodynamics by supplying sediment and reinforcing ebb-directed residual sediment transport.

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> of tidal channels dissecting {{the tidal}} flats of coastal lagoons is studied within a rational one-dimensional framework. A general analytical solution is obtained which expresses the <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> {{in terms of}} a modified longitudinal coordinate, accounting implicitly for channel convergence and adjacent shoals. For values of the relevant parameters typical of costal lagoons, inertia and friction effects as well as overtides are shown to provide minor corrections to the equilibrium <b>bed</b> <b>profile.</b> The overall shape of the profile is also shown to be slightly affected by the equilibrium condition used in its derivation, consisting in a requirement on either residual erosion/deposition fluxes or maximum velocity. In particular, the asymptotic form of the analytical solution is common to both the equilibrium requirements, thus suggesting the existence of general morphological relationships relating the depth at the channel mouth or, alternatively, the length of the channel to the tidal amplitude, to the degree of channel convergence, to the critical velocity for erosion/deposition and to the extent of intertidal storage areas. The profile shape is affected as well; for instance, nearly constant-depth channels tend to form when convergence is strong. The equilibrium configuration also implies that a power law relationship of the type proposed by O'Brien-Jarret-Marchi for tidal inlets, relating the channel cross section to the tidal prism, holds throughout the entire channel. Finally, the theoretical profile is shown to reasonably reproduce the bed configurations observed in a number of tidal channels surveyed within the Lagoon of Venice (Italy) ...|$|R
