30|$|As {{expected}} from theory and from previous measurement campaigns at 2.45 GHz [14], Figure 5 shows that on-body <b>links</b> <b>with</b> longer path lengths have higher outage probabilities {{in comparison to}} <b>links</b> <b>with</b> shorter distances (compare, e.g., the stomach-back <b>link</b> <b>with</b> the stomach-chest <b>link).</b> In addition, the link geometry and thus the channel gain {{are influenced by the}} movements of the body. The strength of this influence depends on the on-body link. An on-body <b>link</b> <b>with</b> a higher mobility experiences a wider range of outage probabilities than trunk-to-trunk <b>links</b> <b>with</b> lower mobility (compare, e.g., the stomach-wrist <b>link</b> <b>with</b> the stomach-chest <b>link).</b> These behaviors can be observed for all four antenna configurations in their forward and backward links (see Figures 6, 7 and 8).|$|R

40|$|AbstractEndometriosis, {{defined by}} the {{presence}} of viable extrauterine endometrial glands and stroma, can grow or bleed cyclically, and possesses characteristics including a destructive, invasive, and metastatic nature. Since endometriosis may result in pelvic inflammation, adhesion, chronic pain, and infertility, and can progress to biologically malignant tumors, it is a long-term major health issue in women of reproductive age. In this review, we analyze the Taiwan domestic research addressing associations between endometriosis and other diseases. Concerning malignant tumors, we identified four studies on the links between endometriosis and ovarian cancer, one on breast cancer, two on endometrial cancer, one on colorectal cancer, and one on other malignancies, as well as one on associations between endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome, one on <b>links</b> <b>with</b> migraine headache, three on <b>links</b> <b>with</b> pelvic inflammatory diseases, four on <b>links</b> <b>with</b> infertility, four on <b>links</b> <b>with</b> obesity, four on <b>links</b> <b>with</b> chronic liver disease, four on <b>links</b> <b>with</b> rheumatoid arthritis, four on <b>links</b> <b>with</b> chronic renal disease, five on <b>links</b> <b>with</b> diabetes mellitus, and five on <b>links</b> <b>with</b> cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, etc.). The data available to date support that women with endometriosis might be at risk of some chronic illnesses and certain malignancies, although we consider the evidence for some comorbidities to be of low quality, for example, the association between colon cancer and adenomyosis/endometriosis. We still believe that the risk of comorbidity might be higher in women with endometriosis than that we supposed before. More {{research is needed to determine}} whether women with endometriosis are really at risk of these comorbidities...|$|R
