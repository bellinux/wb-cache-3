5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union <b>leaders</b> <b>have</b> also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E

5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist <b>leaders</b> <b>have</b> traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as serious and determined.|$|E

5|$|Between 1996 and 1999, the {{administration}} added crucifixes to many classroom walls, {{a change that}} attracted national attention. Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such. According to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure to remove the crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community, while he and other campus faith <b>leaders</b> <b>have</b> defended their placement. The Intercultural Center is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture symbols in the lobby. In 2009, Georgetown's religious symbols were brought back to national attention after the university administration concealed the name of Jesus in preparation for President Barack Obama's speech on campus.|$|E

Hampton Roads is the second largest metropolitan area in the United States without a club in a major professional sports league, after the Austin metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|After Ernest died in 1971, Ruth succeeded him {{as their}} group's leader and primary channeler. She {{subsequently}} began publishing accounts of her experiences and revelations. In early 1974, she predicted that a space fleet of benevolent extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would land on Earth later that year, which led the Unarius Academy {{to purchase a}} property {{to serve as the}} landing site. After the extraterrestrials failed to appear, Norman said that trauma she had suffered in a past life had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Undaunted, she rented a building for Unarius' meetings and sought publicity for the movement, claiming to have united the Earth with an interplanetary confederation. She revised the Space Brothers' expected landing date several times, before finally settling on 2001. Her health declined in the late 1980s, prompting her students to try to heal her with rituals of past-life regression. Despite predicting that she would live to see the extraterrestrials land, Norman died in 1993. Unarius has continued to operate after her death, and formed a board of directors. Since the 2000s, <b>leaders</b> <b>have</b> concentrated on individual transformation leading to spiritual change in humankind.|$|E
5|$|The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) {{is one of}} the {{two major}} parties in the {{political}} system of Republic of India, the other being the Indian National Congress (INC). , it is the country's largest political party in terms of representation in the national parliament. Established in 1980, the BJP's platform is generally considered as the right-wing of the political spectrum. , 40 BJP <b>leaders</b> <b>have</b> held the position of a chief minister, out of which thirteen are incumbent. A chief minister is the head of government of each of the twenty-nine states and two union territories (UTs) (Delhi and Puducherry). According to the Constitution of India, at the state-level, the governor is de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the state legislative assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given he/she has the assembly's confidence, the chief minister's term is usually for a maximum of five years; there are no limits to the number of terms he/she can serve.|$|E
