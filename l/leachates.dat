These elements may impart a metallic taste to water, and may produce red, brown or black staining of whiteware, but are not considered a health risk. Volcanic ashfalls are not known to have caused problems in water supplies for toxic trace elements such as mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) which occur at very low levels in ash <b>leachates.</b>|$|E

Mojorejo landfill {{is the only place}} for district final processing in Sukoharjo. Mojorejo landfill has a <b>leachate</b> processing plant (IPL) which consists of 4 pieces <b>leachate</b> retention ponds, without any other processing installations. This installation is no longer functioning because most of the surface of the pool has been covered by heaps of garbage. The checking laboratory results from samples taken shortly on May 2, 2011, showed that the quality of <b>leachate</b> in the IPL exceeded the quality standard outlet. Parameters which still exceeded the quality standard is TSS (1130 mg /L), TDS (12, 700 mg /L), Ammonia (926. 8 mg /L), BOD (270 mg /L) and COD (3333. 33 mg/L). The problem increases with the presence of <b>leachate</b> drainage system is not functioning properly so that not all of the <b>leachate</b> to flow into the IPL.

The 2002 GHD report saw new regulations put in place to make industries comply with a new bylaw which stops hazardous substances entering the water system at all according to the HCC website.

Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such <b>leachates,</b> the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act.
