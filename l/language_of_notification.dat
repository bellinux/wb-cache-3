Individual notifications are now displayed on cards {{to adhere to}} the material design <b>language,</b> and batches <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> can be grouped by the app that produced them. Notifications are now displayed on the lock screen as cards, and [...] "heads up" [...] notifications can also be displayed as large banners {{across the top of the}} screen, along with their respective action buttons. A do-not-disturb feature is also added for notifications. The recent apps menu was redesigned to use a three-dimensional stack of cards to represent open apps. Individual apps can also display multiple cards in the recents menu, such as for a web browser's open tabs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{integration}} of event information from diverse event notification sources is, as with meta-searching over heterogeneous search engines, a challenging task. Due {{to the complexity}} <b>of</b> event filter <b>languages,</b> known solutions for heterogeneous searching cannot be applied for event notification In this paper, we propose the concept and design of a Meta Service for Event Notification. We define transformation rules for exchanging event filter definitions and event notifications between various event services and sources. We transform each filter defined at a meta-service into a filter expressed in the <b>language</b> <b>of</b> each event <b>notification</b> source. Due to unavoidable asymmetry in the semantics of different langues, some superfluous information may be delivered to the meta-service. These notifications are then post-processed {{to reduce the number}} of spurious messages. We present a survey and classification <b>of</b> filter <b>languages</b> for event notification, which serves as basis for the transformation rules. The proposed rules are implemented in a prototype transformation module for a Meta Service for Event Notification. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis in the City of Birmingham {{during the}} three-year period 1960 - 62 {{related to the}} population data from the Census of 1961 showed important differences between the <b>notification</b> rates <b>of</b> groups defined by their place of birth, and also differences in the age distributions <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> rates between these groups (Springett, 1964). A survey <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> throughout England and Wales during a three-month period in 1965 (British Tuberculosis Asso-ciation, 1966) showed similar differences on a national scale; the survey <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> throughout England and Wales was repeated during a four-month period {{around the time of}} the 1971 Census, and these results are being prepared for publication.

40|$|A {{field study}} in ten homes was {{conducted}} to understand what influences users’ acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home environment. The key finding is that perceived message urgency is the primary indicator <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home—if people think a message is urgent, they want the message to be shown immediately, regardless {{of what they are}} doing at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> The study also shows that the acceptability of low-urgent and medium-urgent messages could be improved by taking into account mental activity load at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> No effect <b>of</b> physical activity was found on acceptability. The results suggest that to improve the scheduling <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home, notification systems need a mechanism assessing both the message urgency and the mental activity load, whereas physical activity can be ignored. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to measure acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in a realistic setting, given the need to balance experimental control with realistic context. The present paper suggests a way to introduce controlled notifications and subjective measurements of acceptability in homes. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to extend previous reports on network analysis relating to food notifications by including an optional filter by type <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> and in cases of contamination, by type of contaminant in the notified foodstuff. Methodology/Principal Findings A filter function has been applied to enable processing <b>of</b> selected <b>notifications</b> by contaminant or type <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> to i) capture complexity, ii) analyze trends, and iii) identify patterns of reporting activities between countries. The program rapidly assesses nations' roles as transgressor and/or detector for each category of contaminant and for the key class of border rejection. In the open access demonstration version, the majority <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed were categorized by contaminant type as mycotoxin (50. 4...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{dissertation}} research {{is on the}} examination <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> systems that harness different presentation formats for notification delivery, the preferences that individuals express for these various types <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> and how these preferences are affected by contextual information surrounding notification delivery. My research is unique from other work in the literature in two primary ways. First, {{while the majority of}} prior work addressing notification delivery, both in terms of format and timing, has focused on the effects <b>of</b> a <b>notification</b> on an individual’s performance on a given task or set of tasks, my focus is the individual’s perception <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> and particularly on that individual’s preferences for different notification formats delivered within different contextual scenarios. An interest in this question is motivated by prior studies that have shown that annoyance with computer-human interactions is a primary reason behind user abandonment of interactive software systems. Second, my preliminary findings suggest that different people prefer different types <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in different contexts, which motivates a change of focus in the development of such systems toward customizing notifications not only to the features of an individual’s context but also to the individual him- or herself. An additional element of novelty in my work is that my final study was conducted in a purely naturalistic office environment, in which the notifications evaluated were precisely those notifications being delivered to study participants throughout their workday. The primary contribution of this dissertation is twofold: a detailed analysis of the methodology for the design, data collection, and analysis of a study <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> preferences in a naturalistic setting {{with a great deal of}} inherent complexity; and a set of results, based on the analysis of preference data acquired in various settings, about how an individual’s contextual environment, and the content <b>of</b> a given <b>notification,</b> can affect that individual’s preferences for notification delivery...|$|R
