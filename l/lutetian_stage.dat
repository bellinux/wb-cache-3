500|$|Individuals of Yantaromyrmex {{species have}} been found as {{inclusions}} in four different Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene amber deposits in Europe. [...] Baltic amber is approximately 46 million years old, having been deposited during the <b>Lutetian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Middle Eocene. [...] There is debate on what plant family the amber was produced by, with evidence supporting them being relatives of either Agathis or Pseudolarix. [...] Rovno amber, recovered from deposits in the Rivne region of Ukraine, is slightly younger in age, being dated to the Bartonian to Priabonian of the Late Eocene. [...] Bitterfeld amber is recovered from coal deposits in the Saxony area of Germany and the dating of the deposits is uncertain. [...] Bitterfeld represents {{a section of the}} Eocene Paratethys Sea, and the amber that is recovered from the region is thought to be redeposited from older sediments. The fossil record of Bitterfeld and Baltic amber insects is very similar with a number of shared species, and that similarity is noted in the suggestions of a single source for the paleoforest that produced the amber. [...] The amber deposits on the Danish coast, often referred to as Scandinavian amber, is of similar age to the other three European ambers, however a study of the ant fauna publushed in 2009 indicates Scandinavian amber has a fairly distinct ant assemblage. Y. constricta and Y. geinitzi are both identified from all four European ambers, while Y. samlandicus has been described from Baltic, Bitterfeld and Rovno fossils. Y. intermedius and Y. mayrianum, are each known from only a few fossils, Y. intermedius from only a single Bitterfeld amber fossil while Y. mayrianum is known from a Baltic amber and a Rovno amber fossil.|$|E

500|$|P. janzeni was {{described}} by Cesare Baroni Urbani of the University of Basel, Switzerland in 2000, based on two specimens preserved in Baltic amber from Kaliningrad, Russia. The species is from the Eocene, <b>Lutetian</b> to Priabonian <b>stage.</b> Both specimens are preserved very well, with specimen number two being larger and more visible. Specimen number one is presumed to be a worker; type material includes a holotype worker and a paratype ergatogyne, donated to the Geological-Palaecontological Institute and Museum, the University of Hamburg by palaeoentomologist Jens-Wilhelm Janzen. The ant was named after Janzen by Baroni Urbani. The estimated body length is [...] long with an elongated head, and large oval-shaped eyes are present. The antennae are long and consist of 12 segments with a bent scape. The mandibles are very long and curved, being three-quarters {{the length of the}} total size of the head. Both the legs and mesosoma are long and slender; unlike modern ants, P. janzeni has two spurs on the tibae instead of one. The petiole is high and domed shape while postpetiole is bell-shaped. The gaster is long with round sides, divided into five segments. The whole body and some portions of the legs were covered by weakly curved hairs, erect and suberect. The holotype specimen is brown in colour while the paratype is black. While P. janzeni looks similar to P. longiceps, the pubesence on the scapes of P. janzeni is absent.|$|R
40|$|This PhD-Thesis {{presents}} a new chronostratigraphy of the Paleogene sedimentary {{record of the}} SE margin of the Eastern Ebro Basin. It {{is based on a}} number of magnetostratigraphic sections and its integration with marine and continental biochronological data. A robust correlation with the geomagnetic polarity time scale is obtained and provides the record with absolute ages, spanning from chrons C 20 n to C 12 r (<b>Lutetian</b> to Rupelian <b>stages,</b> ca. 43. 0 - 31. 0 Ma). Main differences with respect to the current chronostratigraphic scheme of the Eastern Ebro Basin include the age of the uppermost marine units. While earlier schemes attributed a Bartonian age to these units regarding its biostratigraphical contents, new results supports a Lower Priabonian age, yielding an interpolated age of ca. 36. 0 Ma (within chron C 16 n. 2 n) for the continentalization process. This age is in concordance with a reinterpretation of earlier magnetostratigraphic data from the Western South Pyrenean Foreland Basin, and indicates that continentalization of the basin occurred as a rapid and isochronous event. The analysis of the observed sedimentation trends are used to evaluate the character of this process. Thus, contrasting sedimentation trends between the Western and Eastern sectors of the South Pyrenean foreland are proposed to indicate that basin closing preferentially affected those areas subjected to sediment bypass towards the ocean domain. Moreover, new results provide improved temporal constraints for the sediments of the Eocene Montserrat alluvial fan and fan-delta complex. Thus a Lutetian age is ascribed to the whole La Salut Formation and the age of the Montserrat Conglomerates spans from Upper Lutetian to Lower Priabonian. The new chronological framework is used to unravel the forcing controls on the sequential arrangement of the Montserrat area at different temporal scales, and also to revise the tectonosedimentary history. Obtained results show a correlation between (tectonic) subsidence and forelimb rotation measured on deformed strata of Montserrat. Furthermore, integration of subsidence curves from different sectors of the Eastern Ebro Basin allows estimating the variable contribution of tectonic loads from the two active basin margins: the Catalan Coastal Ranges and the Pyrenees. The results support the presence of a double flexure from Late Lutetian to Late Bartonian, associated to the two tectonically active margins. From Late Bartonian to Early Priabonian the homogenization of subsidence values is interpreted {{as the result of the}} coupling of the two sources of tectonic load. Finally, the obtained chronology contributes to the calibration of several biostratigraphic zonations to the geomagnetic polarity time scale. In the marine realm, the base of calcareous nannofossil Zone NP 19 - 20 is pinned down to an older age than its currently accepted attribution, whereas the time span assigned to Zone NP 18 is significantly reduced. A revised calibration of larger foraminifers indicates that Zone SBZ 18, formerly assigned exclusively to Late Bartonian, extends its range to the earlymost Priabonian, being the Bartonian stage almost entirely represented by Zone SBZ 17. A division of Zone SBZ 18 into two subzones is also proposed. In the continental realm, the magnetostratigraphic record of the Eastern Ebro Basin yields accurate ages for the immediately pre- and post-Grand Coupure mammal fossil assemblages found in this basin. Thus, the Grande Coupure, a major terrestrial faunal turnover recorded in Eurasia associated with the overall climate shift at the Eocene-Oligocene transition, is found to occur with a maximum allowable lag of 0. 5 Myr with respect to this boundary. Furthermore, results from this PhD-Thesis allow revisiting correlations for the controversial Eocene-Oligocene record of the Hampshire Basin (UK), and their implications for the calibration of the Mammal Paleogene reference levels MP 18 to MP 21.
