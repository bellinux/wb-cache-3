50|$|Complete {{chemical}} analysis of rocks are also widely used and important, especially in describing new species. Rock analysis has of late years (largely {{under the influence}} of the chemical laboratory of the United States Geological Survey) reached a high pitch of refinement and complexity. As many as twenty or twenty-five components may be determined, but for practical purposes a knowledge of the relative proportions of silica, alumina, ferrous and ferric oxides, magnesia, <b>lime,</b> <b>potash,</b> soda and water carry us a long way in determining a rock's position in the conventional classifications.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the notable}} places of {{interest}} is the Coloured Earths, which is about 4 km to the south west of the town. Coloured Earths is a phenomenon resulting from colour variations due to cooling of molten rock. The lava formations {{are estimated to be}} of 3.5 to 7 million years in age. These are heaps of exposed earth's crust which show up in seven colours when the sun light falls on them. Viewing them in the morning hours when sun rays and the dew mingle bring out the best of its colours. A closer view is better than the views from the timber platforms and walkways erected for the purpose. [...] The colour earth phenomenon is located downstream of the water fall on the Black River valley where the land is barren and plain which measures about 7 - 8 acre with hardly any vegetation. It gives the appearance of furrows in rows, as colors are observed in horizontal ridges known as [...] "Les Cotes de Melon" [...] ("The Melon's Slices"). An examination of the ground condition where the colours of different shades, varying from [...] "yellow and yellowish brown to bright red, purple, and coal black" [...] indicates about forty hues. The samples collected from this area have been subject to chemical analysis which reveal that the formation consists of cohesive formation of ferruginous clays without any organic matter, and devoid or with least presence of any principal elements of soil fertility. There is hardly any nitrogen but traces of <b>lime,</b> <b>potash</b> and phosphoric acid have been noted. However, the dominant percentage is of iron and alumina.|$|E

60|$|The {{soil from}} which this example was taken was twelve inches deep; it abounded to the eye in {{vegetable}} matter, and was siliceous to the touch. There were no traces of phosphates or of animal matter, and doubtful traces of <b>lime</b> and <b>potash.</b> The subsoil of clay gave only 5.7 per cent. of water, and 5.55 of organic matter. The above analysis was conducted during the rainy month of September, and the sample is an average one of the surface-soil at 6000 to 10,000 feet. There is, I think, little difference anywhere in the soils at this elevation, except where the rock is remarkably micaceous, or where veins of felspathic granite, by their decomposition, give rise to small beds of kaolin.|$|R
30|$|The {{two main}} {{compositional}} outliers (JK 20 and JK 52) were identified {{because of their}} inconsistent levels of several key oxides, including <b>lime,</b> alumina, titania, <b>potash,</b> magnesia and phosphorus. Other samples of note are JK 46, a greenish-coloured sagged bowl with relatively high titania (0.10  %), and JK 21, a green, footed bowl base, with slightly high magnesia content (0.90  %). The majority of the glasses analysed form a tight group when oxides are plotted, regardless of colour, vessel form or type.|$|R
40|$|The {{earliest}} Chinese ancient glasses {{before the}} West Han Dynasty (200 BC) from different regions are studied. The glass samples were unearthed from Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong and Xinjiang of China. The chemical composition of these glasses samples is analyzed by proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE) technique, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) method and {{inductively coupled plasma}} atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). It is shown that the glass chemical compositions belong to barium-lead silicate BaO-PbO-SiO 2, <b>potash</b> soda <b>lime</b> silicate K 2 O (Na 2 O) -CaO-SiO 2 (K 2 O/Na 2 O > 1), soda <b>potash</b> <b>lime</b> silicate Na 2 O (K 2 O) -CaO-SiO 2 (K 2 O/Na 2 O 1), soda <b>potash</b> <b>lime</b> silicate Na 2 O (K 2 O) -CaO-SiO 2 (K 2 O/Na 2 O < 1) and potash silicate K 2 O-SiO 2 glass systems, respectively. The origins of the earliest Chinese ancient glasses are discussed from the archaeological and historical points of view.

50|$|With the chemist Charles Macintosh (1766-1843) {{he helped}} {{establish}} Scotland's first alum works at Hurlet, Renfrewshire. In 1798 {{he took out}} a patent for a bleach liquor formed by passing chlorine into a mixture of lime and water. This product had the advantage of being cheaper than the one generally used at the time because it substituted <b>lime</b> for <b>potash.</b> Unfortunately when Tennant attempted to protect his rights against infringement, his patent was held invalid on the double ground that the specification was incomplete and that the invention had been anticipated at a bleach works near Nottingham. Tennant's great discovery was bleaching powder (chloride of lime) for which he took a patent in 1799. The process involved reacting chlorine and dry slaked lime to form bleaching powder, a mixture of calcium hypochlorite and other derivatives. It seems Macintosh also {{played a significant role in}} this discovery and remained one of Tennant's associates for many years.|$|R
40|$|A {{very small}} {{intrusion}} {{of a dark}} soda-minette rock occurs intermixed with a leuco-phase along Squaw Creek in the northern Black Hills. It consists of phenocrysts of pyroiene, phlogopite, and carbonate pseudomorphs of olivine(?), the latter surrounded by phlogopite, in a groundmass of aegirine, alkali feldspar, and secondary carbonate. Pyroxene phenocrysts are largely replaced by ferroan dolomite. Quartz xenocrysts show replacement rims of alkali feldspar and an inner rim of hematite. Chemically the rock is relatively low in silica and fer-rous oxide, but relatively high in magnesia, <b>lime,</b> and <b>potash,</b> with carbon dioxide as the main volatile component. The rock probably originated as a diferentiate of the alkaline magmas that produced the Tertiary phonolites in the northern Black Hills. Carbonate pseudomorphs of olivine(?), plus phenocrysts of pyroxene and phlogopite, suggest an origin in the lower crust or upper mantle. Crystallization of the phenocrysts most likely began at great depth and followed the sequence of olivine, phlogopite, and pyroxene, whereas the aegirine uoa f"tO-spar groundmass crystallizsd after injection into the lower Paleozoic section...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} the soils of Washington to provide {{nutrients}} to crop plants has been of concern to researchers at Washington State University since its establishment in 1892. Problems were initially addressed by chemists and agronomists since it was many years before soil fertility specialists were acquired. The earliest report concerning soil fertility in Washington was published by Fulmer and Fletcher (1894). They analyzed soils chemically and predicted nutrient needs. Considering the knowledge available on soil fertility and plant nutrition of that time, they made some excellent contributions {{about the nature of}} Washington soils. They stated that Il wes tern Washington soils will be greatly strengthened by application of lime", lithe average percent of <b>lime</b> and <b>potash</b> are higher, phosphoric acid lower in eastern Washington so; Is than in western Washington soils", and "lime percent is lower in regions of abundant rainfall than in drier portions of the state ll • They also said that "chemical analysis can reveal deficiences in plant food and give percentage composition but cannot show availability". At that time there were total chemical analyses of soil, but it was much later bef 9 re the concept of analyzing soils for "available nutrients " developed.

60|$|The {{weight of}} the {{nitrogenous}} protein compounds, of the oily, starchy, saccharine and woody substances contained in the full-grown plant and its seeds, will be vastly greater than the {{weight of the}} same substances contained in the bean from which it sprang. But nothing has been supplied to the bean save water, carbonic acid, ammonia, <b>potash,</b> <b>lime,</b> iron, and the like, in combination with phosphoric, sulphuric, and other acids. Neither protein, nor fat, nor starch, nor sugar, nor any substance in the slightest degree resembling them, has formed part of the food of the bean. But the weights of the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, and other elementary bodies contained in the bean- plant, and in the seeds which it produces, are exactly equivalent to the weights of the same elements which have disappeared from the materials supplied to the bean during its growth. Whence it follows that the bean has taken in only the raw materials of its fabric, and has manufactured them into bean-stuffs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Emergency {{contraception}} (EC) {{can significantly}} reduce the rate of unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the increasing awareness of EC among educated young women in Nigeria, the rate of utilisation remains low. This study therefore explores the main barriers {{to the use of}} EC among female university students by analysing their knowledge of emergency contraception, methods ever used, perceived efficacy, and its acceptability. Methods This paper brings together the findings from several focus groups (N[*]=[*] 5) and in-depth interviews (N[*]=[*] 20) conducted amongst unmarried female undergraduate students in two Nigerian universities. Results Participants considered the use of condom and abstinence as the most effective methods of preventing unplanned pregnancy. However, many participants were misinformed about emergency contraception. Generally, participants relied on unconventional and unproven ECs; Ampiclox, “Alabukun”, salt water solution, and <b>lime</b> and <b>potash</b> and perceived them to be effective in preventing unplanned pregnancies. Furthermore, respondents’ narratives about methods of preventing unwanted pregnancies revealed that inadequate information on emergency contraception, reliance on unproven crude contraceptive methods, and misconception about modern contraception constitute barriers to the use of emergency contraception. Conclusions The findings suggested that female university students are misinformed about emergency contraception and their reliance on unproven ECs constitutes a barrier to the use of approved EC methods. These barriers have serious implications for prevention of unplanned pregnancies in the cohort. Behavioural interventions targeting the use of unproven emergency contraceptive methods and misperceptions about ECs would be crucial for this cohort in Nigeria...|$|R
5000|$|Orcein, also archil, orchil, lacmus and C.I. Natural Red 28, are {{names for}} dyes {{extracted}} from {{several species of}} lichen, commonly known as [...] "orchella weeds", found {{in various parts of}} the world. A major source is the archil lichen, Roccella tinctoria. Orcinol is extracted from such lichens. It is then converted to orcein by ammonia and air. In traditional dye-making methods, urine was used as the ammonia source. If the conversion is carried out in the presence of potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, and calcium sulfate (in the form of <b>potash,</b> <b>lime,</b> and gypsum in traditional dye-making methods), the result is litmus, a more complex molecule. The manufacture was described by Cocq in 1812 [...] and in the UK in 1874. Roberts noted orchilla as a principal export of the Cape Verde islands, superior to the same kind of moss found in Italy or the Canaries, that in 1832 was yielding an annual revenue of $200,000. Commercial archil is either a powder (called cudbear) or a paste. It is red in acidic pH and blue in alkaline pH.|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of spatial variability soil properties {{is useful in}} the rational use of inputs, as in the site specific application of lime and fertilizer. The objective of this work was to map and evaluate the spatial variability of the corn and pasture, soil chemical and physical properties in crop-livestock integrated system. The {{study was conducted in}} an area of 6. 9 ha of a Typic Paleudult in Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil. The summer crop corn was sowed together with the forage crop Brachiaria brizantha in the system of crop-livestock rotation. A regular hexagon sampling grid design with 6 sub-samples was adopted for each hectare. The values of soil P, K, Ca, Mg, and CEC, basis saturation, clay and sand were analyzed by traditional soil testing in georreferenced samples collected at 0 ? 0. 2 m depth. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) was measured with a contact sensor. The site was evaluated {{at the end of the}} corn season (April) and for the forage (October) by imageries from the Landsat 5 using remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to interpret imageries. Spatial continuity of crop and soil properties was modeled using semivariograms. Maps contours of crop and forage were obtained by kriging, and maps of soil properties by using inverse distance weighting interpolation. Results from this study showed that the NDVI was associated with ECa and soil parameters indicating crop and pasture variations on crop-livestock integrated system. Sampling density adopted was insufficient for an adequate characterization of the spatial variability of soil parameters as pH, O. M., P, K, V%, CEC, clay and sand. Estimated VRT maps compared to estimated uniformly applied lime and P and K fertilizer recommendation indicate that VRT could be more adequate to <b>lime</b> and <b>potash</b> recommendation, and and would have little effect on P fertilization. 201...|$|R
50|$|In this recipe, the {{addition}} of alkali helps to increase the hardness of the surface and clarify the colour of the glaze as well. With the development of tin glazes, the significant amount of tin oxide indicates its deliberate addition as an opacifier. A recipe involving the use of three ingredients was given in Abu’l-Qasim’s treatise from Persia in the 14th century: a glass-frit of quartz and potash, a lead-tin calx and a calcination of limestone and quartz. Afterwards, with the spread of tin glazes, lead gradually became the principal background in tin glazes, though {{a small proportion of}} alkali was still introduced in order to increase the fusibility. No specific recipes alluding to tin glazes in Spain have been found in ancient archives. However, recent research has shown that, at least since the 10th century AD, most Islamic white glazes in Spain were lead-silica glazes with tin oxide as an opacifier. That is, no alkaline glazes or lead-alkaline glazes have been found. Piccolpasso recorded several glazes used in Italy in the 1550s, all variations of lead, tin, <b>lime,</b> soda and <b>potash</b> glazes. It is believed early Spanish glazes were similar.|$|R
