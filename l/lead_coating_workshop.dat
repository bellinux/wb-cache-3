The <b>lead</b> <b>coated</b> retainers {{used in this}} investigation show promise {{for use in the}} high radiation environments, where polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) based materials are not suitable.

50|$|Rifled {{guns were}} also {{developed}} elsewhere - by Major Giovanni Cavalli and Baron Martin von Wahrendorff in Sweden, Krupp in Germany and the Wiard {{gun in the}} United States.

50|$|In {{the early}} days of engine building, the poppet valve was a major problem. Metallurgy was lacking, and the rapid opening and closing of valves against {{cylinder}} heads led to rapid wear. They would need to be re-ground in a process known as a 'valve job'. Adding tetraethyllead to the petrol reduced this problem somewhat, the <b>lead</b> <b>coating</b> the valve seats would, in effect, lubricate the metal. In more modern vehicles and properly machined older engines, valve seats may be made of improved alloys such as stellite and the valves themselves of stainless steel. These improvements have generally eradicated this problem, and helped make unleaded fuel the norm.|$|R

5000|$|The gun {{incorporated}} some advanced {{features for}} its day. It {{was one of}} the first breech-loaders: shell and gunpowder propellant were loaded through the gunner's end of the barrel, rather than through the muzzle as in previous guns, allowing a higher rate of fire. The shells were <b>coated</b> with <b>lead,</b> which engaged spiral grooves cut inside the barrel ("rifling") and caused the shell to spin rapidly in flight and hence imparted far greater accuracy and range than previous guns. The <b>lead</b> <b>coating</b> effectively sealed the gap between shell and barrel and eliminated the wastage of propellant gases, previously known as [...] "windage", and hence only half the amount of gunpowder propellant as previous was required.|$|R
5000|$|The gun {{was also}} a breech-loader. Although {{attempts}} at breech-loading mechanisms had been made since medieval times, the essential engineering {{problem was that the}} mechanism couldn't withstand the explosive charge.

Another innovative feature was what Armstrong called its [...] "grip", which was essentially a squeeze bore; the 6 inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel {{and at the same time}} slightly swaged down its <b>lead</b> <b>coating,</b> reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities.|$|R

Results of tests on a β = 0. 10 split loop accelerating resonator designed for the SUNYLAC Heavy Ion Booster will be reported.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in the electrowinning of copper has lead to several modifications including anodic reactions proposed to reduce the high energy requirement. The addition of sulphurous acid to a copper sulphate electrolyte has been studied to avoid oxygen evolution at the anode which requires a potential in excess of 2 [*]V. In particular, the effect of different anode materials, concentration of sulphurous acid, current density, copper and sulphuric acid concentrations in the electrolyte have been investigated. Measurements of anode potential, cell voltage, current efficiency and energy consumption during the electrowinning of copper have been made using a diaphragm cell.

50|$|Batteries are {{typically}} made of six galvanic cells {{in a series}} circuit. Each cell provides 2.1 volts {{for a total of}} 12.6 volts at full charge. Each cell of a lead storage battery consists of alternate plates of lead (cathode) and <b>lead</b> <b>coated</b> with <b>lead</b> dioxide (anode) immersed in an electrolyte of sulfuric acid solution. The actual standard cell potential is obtained from the standard reduction potentials. This causes a chemical reaction that releases electrons, allowing them to flow through conductors to produce electricity. As the battery discharges, the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates, changing their surface to lead sulfate. When the battery is recharged, the chemical reaction is reversed: the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide. With the plates restored to their original condition, the process may be repeated.|$|R

50|$|First, {{the piece}} was rifled, which allowed for a much more {{accurate}} and powerful action. Although rifling had been tried on small arms since the 15th century, the necessary machinery to accurately rifle artillery was only available by the mid-19th century.
