A nonconcurrent cohort study of 1033 HIV-infected individuals was also conducted. Sixty-two patients were coinfected with HTLV-I, and 141 patients were coinfected with HTLV-II. HTLV-I/II coinfection was highly associated with African-American race/ethnicity, age of 136 years, higher CD 4 + T cell count at baseline and over time, and history of injection drug use. Coinfected patients were more likely to have neurologic com-plications, thrombocytopenia, respiratory and urinary tract infections, and hepatitis C. Despite having higher CD 4 + T cell counts over time, there was no difference in the incidence of opportunistic infections. Progression to both acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0. 50; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 25 – 0. 98) and death (aHR, 0. 57, 95 % CI, 0. 37 – 0. 89) were slower among HTLV-II–coinfected patients, compared with time-entry – and CD 4 + T cell count–matched control subjects.

In the course of these studies, he isolated the Gross murine leukemia virus strain as well as the first polyomavirus, so named for its proclivity to cause cancers in multiple tissue types. Gross murine leukemia virus is a retrovirus whose counterpart in humans is human T cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> I (HTLV-I), while murine polyomavirus is closely related to the human Merkel cell polyomavirus that causes most forms of Merkel cell carcinoma.

These models vary from naturally infected animals to established, engineered or xenograft models. A special attention will be given to the HTLV- 1 virus, the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and a number of inflammatory diseases such as the HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Monkeys, rabbits and rats provide an excellent in vivo tool for the study of early viral infection and transmission as well as the antiviral host immune response. However, because of their small size and the availability of reagents, mice remain the most efficient method of studying human afflictions. Murine models regroup genetically altered mice including both transgenic and knock-out mice, as well as immunodeficient mice strains. The first group offers important models to test the role of specific viral and host genes in the development of HTLV-I associated leukemia whereas the second group provides a useful and rapid tool of humanized and xenografted mice models. These later are widely used to test new drugs and targeted therapy against HTLV- 1 associated leukemia, to identify potential leukemia stem cells, and to study the innate immunity against the virus.

5000|$|While {{there is}} no present {{licensed}} vaccine, there are many factors which make a vaccine against HTLV-1 feasible. The virus displays relatively low antigenic variability, natural immunity does occur in humans, and experimental vaccination using envelope antigens {{has been shown to}} be successful in animal models. Plasmid DNA vaccines elicit potent and protective immune responses in numerous small-animal models of infectious diseases. However, their immunogenicity in primates appears less potent. In the past two decades a large initiative has been put forth to understand the biological and pathogenic properties of the human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 (HTLV-1); this has ultimately led to the development of various experimental vaccination and therapeutic strategies to combat HTLV-1 infection. These strategies include the development of envelope glycoprotein derived B-cell epitopes for the induction of neutralizing antibodies, as well as a strategy to generate a multivalent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the HTLV-1 Tax antigen. A vaccine candidate that can elicit or boost anti-gp46 neutralizing antibody response may have a potential for prevention and therapy against HTLV-1 infection.|$|E
50|$|HTLV-I is an {{abbreviation}} for human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1, also called human T-cell leukemia type 1, {{a virus that}} has been implicated in several kinds of diseases, including HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, and as a virus cancer link for leukemia (see adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).HTLV-1 has six reported subtypes (subtypes A to F). The great majority of infections are caused by the cosmopolitan subtype A. HTLV was discovered by Robert Gallo and colleagues in 1980. Between 1 in 20 and 1 in 25 infected people are thought to develop cancer {{as a result of}} the virus. HTLV-1 infection is thought to spread only through dividing cells since reverse transcriptase generates proviral DNA from genomic viral RNA, and the provirus is integrated into the host genome by viral integrase after transmission. Therefore, the quantification of provirus reflects the number of HTLV-1-infected cells. So, an increase in numbers of HTLV-1-infected cells using cell division, by actions of accessory viral genes, especially tax, may provide an enhancement of infectivity tax expression induces proliferation, inhibits the apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected cells and, conversely, evokes the host immune response, including cytotoxic T cells, to kill virus-infected cells.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Michael Simberkoff, {{chief of}} staff of the Department of Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Medical Center, was a member of the Infectious Diseases staff in 1980 and was one of the first medical {{researchers}} to treat AIDS patients.

The Infectious Diseases community began to get together on a regular basis at the VA New York Harbor Medical Center and at the New York Department of Health to share their experiences. Soon it became clear that gay men were not the only ones who had the disease; intravenous drug abusers also appeared to get infected. In 1983, the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) was identified and labeled as Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus (LAV) by Dr. Luc Montagnier at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In 1984, it was also identified by Dr. Robert Gallo of National Cancer Institute and named the Human T-cell <b>Lymphotropic</b> <b>Virus</b> (HTLV III). There was a conflict as to who first identified the virus, but it was resolved in a joint agreement. The virus was later renamed Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).|$|E

40|$|Three {{reasons that}} HTLV-I and HTLV-II {{would not be}} {{expected}} to trace human migrations over extended time periods have been examined, and none has proven fatal to the theory. Transmission of the HTLVs (human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>viruses)</b> in endemic settings highly depends on passage through breast milk, and this creates a pattern of distribution similar to that of mitochondrial DNA. The HTLVs probably evolve at variable rates, making the extent of sequence change a poor tool for dating human migrations. However, qualitative relationships between the sequence of human population separations and virus strain may be more regular. The uniqueness of viruses as markers of human rela- tionship gives this method special value as a source of novel ideas re- garding human movements and as independent confirmation of migration hypotheses that have been based on more conventional methods...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{immunological}} {{relationship between}} reverse transcriptases purified from human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>viruses</b> (HTLV-I, HTLV-II, HTLV-III) was defined using monoclonal antibodies specific for HTLV-III reverse transcriptase, secreted by a mouse/mouse hybridoma clone (4 F 8) developed in our laboratory. The viral proteins from HTLV-I and HTLV-II do not bear any cross-reactive epitope to antibodies secreted by this clone. These antibodies specifically cross-react with HTLV-III reverse transcriptase. The antibodies failed {{to neutralize the}} catalytic activity of reverse transcriptase; however, after immunoprecipitation with a magnetic conjugate of goat anti-mouse IgG, the residual activity was completely inhibited. This shows that the antibodies are not directed towards the catalytic active center of the enzyme. Using an immunoblotting technique (Western blotting), we have found two cross-reactive proteins with HTLV-III lysate with molecular masses of 53 and 66 kDa. This suggests that HTLV-III possesses two reverse transcriptase activities with a common determinant recognized by the same epitope...|$|R
50|$|The human T-lymphotropic virus, human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus,</b> {{or human}} T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV) family of viruses are {{a group of}} human retroviruses that are known to cause a type of cancer called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a demyelinating disease called HTLV-I {{associated}} myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The HTLVs belong to a larger group of primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). Members of this family that infect humans are called HTLVs, {{and the ones that}} infect Old World monkeys are called Simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLVs). To date, four types of HTLVs (human T-lymphotropic virus 1 HTLV-I, human T-lymphotropic virus 2 HTLV-II, HTLV-III, and HTLV-IV) and four types of STLVs (STLV-I, STLV-II, STLV-III, and STLV-V) have been identified. HTLV types HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 viruses are the first retroviruses which were discovered. Both belong to the oncovirus subfamily of retroviruses and can transform human lymphocytes so that they are self-sustaining in vitro. The HTLVs are believed to originate from intraspecies transmission of STLVs. The original name for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was HTLV-III. The HTLV-1 genome is diploid, composed of two copies of a single-stranded RNA virus whose genome is copied into a double-stranded DNA form that integrates into the host cell genome, at which point the virus is referred to as a provirus. A closely related virus is bovine leukemia virus BLV.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} several techniques currently available (commercial kits and in-house assays) for diagnosing human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 in {{two groups of}} patients enrolled at HIV/AIDS specialized care services in São Paulo: Group 1 (G 1), n =  1608, 1237 male/ 371 female, median age 44. 3 years old, majority using {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART); G 2, n =  1383, 930 male/ 453 female, median age of 35. 6 years old, majority HAART naïve. Enzyme immunoassays [(EIA) Murex and Gold ELISA] were employed for human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 screening; Western blotting (WB), INNO-LIA (LIA), real-time PCR pol (qPCR), and nested-PCR-RFLP (tax) were used to confirm infection. Samples were considered human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 positive when there was reactivity using {{at least one of the}} four confirmatory assays. By serological screening, 127 / 2991 samples were positive or borderline, and human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> infection was confirmed in 108 samples (three EIA-borderline) : 56 human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 [G 1 (27)  + G 2 (29) ]; 45 human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 2 [G 1 (21)  + G 2 (24) ]; one human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1  + human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 2 (G 2); six human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> [G 1 (2)  + G 2 (4) ]. Although there were differences in group characteristics, human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 prevalence was similar [3. 1 % (G 1) and 4. 2 % (G 2), p =  0. 113]. The overall sensitivities of LIA, WB, qPCR, and PCR-RFLP were 97. 2 %, 82. 4 %, 68. 9 %, and 68. 4 %, respectively, with some differences among groups, likely due to the stage of human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> infection and/or HAART duration. Indeterminate immunoblotting results were detected in G 2, possibly due to the seroconversion period. Negative results in molecular assays could be explained by the use of HAART, the occurrence of defective provirus and/or the low circulating proviral load. In conclusion, when determining the human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> infection, the findings highlight that there is a need to consider the blood samples with borderline results in screening assays.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I infects CD 4 + T {{cells and}} affects cell-mediated immunity. Cardiopulmonary bypass transiently alters {{lymphocyte}} subsets, {{resulting in a}} reduction in CD 4 + T cells {{and an increase in}} CD 8 + T cells. We proposed that cardiovascular operations and human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I infection may act synergistically, resulting in serious damage to cell-mediated immunity. Methods: A total of 517 consecutive patients who were preoperatively screened for anti-human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I antibody and underwent cardiovascular operations with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled in this study. Of the 517 patients, 82 (16 %) had positive test results for anti-human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I antibody. The surgical outcome of patients with positive and negative results for anti-human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I antibody was analyzed retrospectively. Results: There was no difference between the 2 groups with respect to early mortality. Distribution of survival curve was also not significantly different (P =. 5; mean follow-up duration, 2. 4 ± 1. 8 years [range, 0 - 9. 4 years] and 3. 2 ± 2. 8 years [range, 0 - 9. 8 years]) in the groups with positive and negative antibody results, respectively). In particular, long-term follow-up did not reveal adult T-cell leukemia or human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I–associated myelopathy, and occurrence of neoplasm did not differ between groups. Early infectious complication was, however, significantly higher in the group with positive antibody results than in the group with negative results (P =. 02). Logistic regression analysis revealed human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I infection as a significant risk for this complication (P =. 04; odds ratio, 2. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 5. 8).

No limits on publication date or language were established. Studies {{that did not have}} pain as an outcome measure or not involving human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 infected patients were excluded. Results: A total of 3013 articles (including duplicates) were found of which seven met the predetermined criteria. The most common pain region was the lower back (53. 0 %). Non-neuropathic type (ranging from 52. 6 % to 86. 8 %) was more frequent in human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 -associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis participants, and neuropathic pain was more common in human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 carriers (53. 1 %).

To assess the risk of cross-species transmissions of STLVs from nonhuman primates to humans in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a total of 330 samples, derived from primate bushmeat, were collected at remote forest sites where people rely on bushmeat for subsistence. STLV prevalences and genetic diversity were estimated by PCR and sequence analysis of tax-rex and LTR fragments. Overall, 7. 9 % of nonhuman primate bushmeat is infected with STLVs. We documented new STLV- 1 and STLV- 3 variants in six out of the seven species tested and showed {{for the first time}} STLV infection in C. mona wolfi, C. ascanius whitesidei, L. aterrimus aterrimus, C. angolensis, and P. tholloni. Our results provide increasing evidence that the diversity and geographic distribution of PTLVs are much greater than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|Aims : In HIV {{infection}}, macrophage-tropic and <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>viruses</b> {{exist in}} the host. Central nervous system (CNS) infection is an early and ongoing event, important to understand when developing strategies to treat infection. Some knowledge exists on macrophage-tropic virus interactions with the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate lymphotropic lentivirus interactions with the BBB. Methods : Interactions of the <b>lymphotropic</b> feline immunodeficiency <b>virus</b> (FIV) with an in vitro model of the feline BBB were evaluated in scenarios to mimic in vivo infections. Results : Cell-free FIV crossed the BBB in very low quantities, and in the presence of TNF-[alpha], BBB integrity was unaffected. However, cell-associated FIV readily crossed the BBB, but BBB integrity was not significantly altered. Transmigration of uninfected and infected lymphocytes increased in response to TNF-[alpha], accompanied by a moderate disruption of barrier integrity and an up-regulation of VCAM- 1 rather than ICAM- 1. Significant enhancement of migration and disruption of BBB tight junctions occurred when infected cells and TNF-[alpha] were added to the brain side of the BBB and this enhancement was not mediated through additional TNF-[alpha] production. Conclusions : Small quantities of virus in the brain together with TNF-[alpha] have the potential to stimulate greater cell and viral entry into the CNS and this is likely to involve important factors other than further TNF-[alpha] production. Lymphotropic lentivirus entry to the CNS is governed by many factors similar to macrophage-tropic strains...|$|R
40|$|A pivotal {{step in the}} {{initiation}} of T-cell immunity is the presentation of antigenic peptides by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expressed on antigen presenting cells. The expression of MHC class 11 molecules by mouse T-cells has not been shown unequivocally. In the present work, we demonstrate that activated mouse T-cells synthesize MHC class 11 molecules de novo and express them on their surface. Further, we have demonstrated that in vitro activated T-cells take up extra-cellular soluble nucleocapsid protein of a morbillivirus. The internalized antigen goes to antigen processing compartment as shown by co-localization of antigen and LAMP- 1 using confocal microscopy. We show that activated T-cells express H 2 M, a chaperone molecule known to {{have a role in}} antigen presentation. Further, we demonstrate that activated T-cells process and present internalized extra-cellular antigen to primed T-cells as shown by IL- 2 secretion and in vitro proliferation. The presentation of antigen by T-cells may have implications in immuno-regulation, control of infection by <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>viruses</b> and maintenance of immunological memory...|$|R
