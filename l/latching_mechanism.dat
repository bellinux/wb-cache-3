25|$|Constructed of {{light-gauge}} painted sheet steel, Joroleman designed his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism,</b> while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|E

5000|$|A known {{issue with}} the camera was the battery {{compartment}} door, which was made from plastic. A somewhat cumbersome dual-action <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the battery door often complicated this issue and, if operated incorrectly, could result in damage. Any damage to the battery door was troublesome, as the camera would not work at all if the door is unlatched. Fortunately, the door was and is an inexpensive part and could be replaced simply. Otherwise the (new to the 950) magnesium body proved a durable and rugged upgrade from the 900.|$|E
50|$|Analysis {{of sound}} and {{acoustics}} {{plays a role in}} such engineering tasks as product design, production test, machine performance, and process control. For instance, product design can require modification of sound level or noise for compliance with standards from ANSI, IEC, and ISO. The work might also involve design fine-tuning to meet market expectations. Here, examples include tweaking an automobile door <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism</b> to impress a consumer with a satisfying click or modifying an exhaust manifold to change the tone of an engine's rumble. Aircraft designers are also using acoustic instrumentation to reduce the noise generated on takeoff and landing.|$|E

40|$|A Docking Mechanism {{concept is}} {{described}} which {{is suitable for}} use with autonomous docking systems. The central feature of using simple cylindrical handles {{on one side and}} a type of prism seating on the other is offered as a practical method of achieving a standardized structural interface without freezing continued development of the latches, either technically or commercially. The main emphasis in docking mechanism concepts is in two directions: (1) a very simple docking mechanism, involving mainly the <b>latch</b> <b>mechanism</b> to achieve a structural link; and (2) a sophisticated Docking <b>Mechanism,</b> where the <b>latch</b> <b>mechanism</b> is designed for nonrigid spacecraft and the achievement of very low dynamic interactions between spacecraft during the docking process...|$|R
5000|$|There are no {{reasonable}} {{means by}} which the door locking and <b>latching</b> <b>mechanisms</b> could open mechanically in flight from a properly closed and locked position. If the lock sectors were in proper condition, and were properly situated over the closed latch cams, the lock sectors had sufficient strength to prevent the cams from vibrating to the open position during ground operation and flight. However, there are two possible {{means by which}} the cargo door could open while in flight. Either, the <b>latching</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were forced open electrically through the lock sectors after the door was secured, or the door was not properly latched and locked before departure. Then the door opened when the pressurization loads reached a point that the latches could not hold.|$|R
50|$|A lockset (alternatively lock set) is the {{hardware}} and components {{that make up}} the locking or <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism</b> that can usually be found on a door or other hinged object but can also include sliding doors and dividers.The components of a lockset can include (but are not limited to) the door handles (commonly both inside and outside), latchbolt, dead bolt, face plate, strike plate, escutcheon, thumbturn, push button, turn button, and other trim. The lockset and associated hardware typically defines a door's function and how a user could (or could not) access the two adjacent spaces defined by the opening associated with the lockset.|$|E
50|$|Bratenahl persisted {{and studied}} more film of Atlas {{launches}} with the frames enlarged, which revealed light flashes in the post-staging plume. Another {{phone call to}} Convair revealed that 67 lb of RP-1 were also dumped during staging and that the Atlas's sustainer engine exhaust ignited the propellant cloud, producing these flashes. Since the umbilical door on the payload shroud was only held in place with a thin <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism,</b> hot gases from igniting propellant could have contacted the electrical connector and caused a short. The inadvertent activation of the telemetry system during launch had occurred almost simultaneous with booster jettison at T+140 seconds. With that, the book could be closed on the cause of Ranger 6's failure.|$|E
50|$|The first American spacewalk was {{performed}} on June 3, 1965, by Edward H. White, II from the second manned Gemini flight, Gemini 4, for 21 minutes. White was tethered to the spacecraft, and his oxygen was supplied through a 25 ft umbilical, which also carried communications and biomedical instrumentation. He {{was the first to}} control his motion in space with a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit, which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. White found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around, contrary to Leonov's claim. However, a defect in the capsule's hatch <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism</b> caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch, which delayed the start of the EVA and put White and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to Earth alive.|$|E

40|$|A {{retractable}} {{tool bit}} assembly for a tool {{such as an}} allen key is presented. The assembly includes one or more spring loaded nestable or telescoping tubular sections together with a catch mechanism for capturing and holding the tool in its retracted position. The catch mechanism consists of a <b>latch</b> <b>mechanism</b> located in a base section and which engages a conically shaped tool head located at the inner end of the tool. The tool head adjoins an eccentric oval type neck portion which extends to a rear lip of the tool head. The <b>latch</b> <b>mechanism</b> releases when the ovular neck portion rotates about the catch members upon actuation of a rotary tool drive motor. When released, all the telescoping sections and the tool extends fully outward to a use position...|$|R

50|$|For {{the initial}} start {{up of the}} reactor neutron sources were located within the core to provide {{sufficient}} neutrons to initiate the nuclear reaction. Other aspects of the design included the use of flux flattening bars to even out (to some extent) the neutron flux density across the core. If not used, the flux in the centre would be very high relative to the outer areas making control more difficult and leading to excessive central temperatures. Each fuel channel would {{have a number of}} elements stacked one upon another to form a stringer. This required the presence of a <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism</b> to allow the stack to be withdrawn and handled. This caused some problems as the nemonic springs used contained cobalt, which became irradiated giving high gamma level when removed from the reactor. Additionally, thermocouples were attached to a number of elements and needed to be removed on fuel discharge from the reactor.|$|E
50|$|An {{intermediate}} development {{between the}} Bendix drive {{developed in the}} 1930s and the overrunning-clutch designs introduced in the 1960s was the Bendix Folo-Thru drive. The standard Bendix drive would disengage from the ring gear {{as soon as the}} engine fired, even if it did not continue to run. The Folo-Thru drive contains a <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism</b> and a set of flyweights {{in the body of the}} drive unit. When the starter motor begins turning and the drive unit is forced forward on the helical shaft by inertia, it is latched into the engaged position. Only once the drive unit is spun at a speed higher than that attained by the starter motor itself (i.e., it is backdriven by the running engine) will the flyweights pull radially outward, releasing the latch and permitting the overdriven drive unit to be spun out of engagement. In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.|$|E
50|$|The Diana is a {{very simply}} {{constructed}} box camera with a mechanical film advance, spring-loaded shutter, and a primitive plastic viewfinder. It is constructed primarily of low-quality phenolic plastics of the type commonly found in toys imported from Asia during the 1960s. Because of wide variances in production quality, combined with a poorly designed camera body <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism,</b> Diana cameras are predisposed to light leaks onto the exposed film. If not desired, such leaks can be temporarily remedied by sealing the seams with light-proof tape after loading the film. The design of the Diana incorporates a crude lens that produces an image circle which only marginally covers the diagonal of a film frame. This marginal coverage field produces images with often pronounced vignetting. The poor quality of the plastic meniscus lens results in generally low contrast and resolution, odd color rendition, chromatic aberration, and blurred images. Additionally, the film spool may become loose or out of place when winding the film {{on to the next}} frame. Finally, the crude advance and shutter mechanism can result in images that are not properly centered or exposed.|$|E

50|$|Arnold {{participated in}} two spacewalks during the mission.The first EVA by Steven Swanson and Arnold {{occurred}} on March 19, 2009 {{with a duration}} of 6 hours 7 minutes. After Canadarm2 was released S6 and moved away, the spacewalkers plugged in power and data cables to connect the new hardware. The two spacewalkers also removed launch locks, stowed a keel pin, removed and jettisoned four thermal covers, and deployed the blanket boxes that hold the solar arrays in place during launch. The first spacewalk was devoted to installing the station's new truss segment and preparing the segment's solar arrays for unfolding on the eighth day of the mission. Arnold performed his second EVA on March 23, 2009 with Joseph Acaba {{with a duration of}} 6 hours 27 minutes, to move one of the station's two Crew and Equipment and Translation Aid - or CETA - carts. The carts were moved to the port side of the station's truss during the previous mission to give the robotic arm's mobile transporter the best possible access to the starboard truss for the installation of the new truss segment and solar arrays. With that work done, one of the carts was moved back to the station's port side, leaving a cart for use {{on either side of the}} truss. The CETA-cart also got a new coupler. The EVA also included lubricating the end effector capture snares on the station's robot arm - similar to what was done to the other end on an STS-126 spacewalk in late 2008. This has been proven to prevent the snare from snagging or not returning snugly into its groove inside the <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Oscar Frederick Mossberg (1866-1937) {{was born}} on 1 September 1866 in Sweden, {{near the village of}} Svanskog in Värmland, and emigrated to the United States in 1886. Mossberg went to work at the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. While at Iver Johnson, Mossberg {{supervised}} the manufacture of revolvers and shotguns, while contributing some of his own patented designs, including a top strap <b>latching</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the Iver Johnson Safety Revolver. [...] When Mossberg left Iver Johnson, he went on to manage the small factory of the C.S. Shattuck Arms Co. in nearby Hatfield, Massachusetts, which manufactured single and double-barrel breechloading shotguns. From there he went to work for J. Stevens Arms & Tool Co., where he designed a small 4-shot novelty pistol which he patented in his name. [...] Working out of an old barn behind his house, Mossberg and his sons made about 500 of these 4-shot pistols between 1907 and 1909. [...] In 1914, Mossberg left Stevens, moving to New Haven, Connecticut in order to work for Marlin-Rockwell. In 1919, when Marlin-Rockwell went out of business (they primarily made machineguns, and World War I had just ended), the unemployed 53-year-old O.F. Mossberg and his two sons Iver and Harold started a new firearms company of their own, O.F. Mossberg & Sons. [...] Renting a small loft on State Street in New Haven, the Mossbergs began work on a simple four-shot [...]22-caliber pocket pistol, the Brownie. [...] Marketed largely to hunters and trappers for the humane dispatch of wounded or trapped animals, approximately 37,000 Brownie pistols were produced from 1920 to 1932.|$|E
