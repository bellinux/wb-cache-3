5|$|By 1923, HMBB were {{producing}} 12,000units per year. During this time, HMBB was {{the first}} company to assemble bodies for Ford Motor Company of Australia until its Geelong plant was completed. From 1924, HMBB became the exclusive supplier of car bodies for GM in Australia, with manufacturing taking place at the new Woodville plant. These bodies were made to suit a number of chassis imported from manufacturers such as Chevrolet and Dodge. In 1926 General Motors (Australia) was established with assembly plants at Newstead, Queensland; Marrickville, New South Wales; City Road, Melbourne; Birkenhead, South Australia; and Cottesloe, Western Australia using bodies produced by Holden Motor Body Builders and imported complete knock down (CKD) chassis. In 1930 alone, the still independent Woodville plant built bodies for Austin, Chrysler, DeSoto, Morris, Hillman, Humber, Hupmobile and Willys-Overland as well GM cars. The last of this <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was the assembly of Hillman Minx sedans in 1948. The Great Depression led to a substantial downturn in production by Holden, from 34,000units annually in 1930 to just 1,651units one year later. In 1931 General Motors purchased Holden Motor Body Builders and merged it with General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd to form General Motors-Holden's Ltd (GM-H). Throughout the 1920s Holden also supplied tramcars to the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board, of which several examples have been preserved in both Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

The articles of association were changed in 1927, and after this both companies shared the same management board.|$|E
25|$|Controlling {{interest}} {{level is}} the value that an investor {{would be willing to}} pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control.

This level of value generally contains a control premium over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.|$|E

Many water tariffs are uniform, i.e. the same tariff applies for each unit of consumption, if the water use is metered at all.

His precise <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> is unknown, but he is repeatedly lured into the offices of Spirou by Fantasio or Prunelle in order to sign some lucrative contracts (see below). De Mesmaeker has developed a deep loathing for Gaston and by extension his colleagues. His frequent visits allow Franquin to satirise business rituals, as Dupuis's employees shower him with attention, complimentary drinks, cigars but De Mesmaeker almost inevitably ends up storming out of the offices, swearing never to set foot in them again, passed out on the floor or even in hospital due to Gaston's catastrophic blunders.|$|E
40|$|When banking {{institutions}} can expand into other <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> some {{think they will}} diversify to reduce their total risk. Others think just the opposite. In this article, John H. Boyd and Stanley L. Graham explain the reasoning behind these two views and then test to see which one best describes the behavior of U. S. bank holding companies since 1970. They find that in 1971 - 77, when these companies were relatively free to invest in some new <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> diversification was associated with greater risk of failure. But in 1977 - 83, when the companies were more tightly regulated, that association disappeared. These findings suggest to Boyd and Graham that, {{left to their own}} devices, bank holding companies will expand into new <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> to increase their risk, but that regulation can control this risk-taking [...] at least for the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> bank holding companies are currently allowed.

A knife thrown in anger by Stephen misses Henry, but breaks the shop front's window. Gogol meanwhile asks Yvonne for her love, but she refuses.

Gogol suggests that Stephen's problem comes from childhood trauma, but later confirms to his assistant Dr. Wong (Keye Luke) that Stephen's hands had been Rollo's.|$|E
