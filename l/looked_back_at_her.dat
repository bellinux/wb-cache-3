500|$|Following the Art for Freedom initiative, Madonna {{began work}} on her {{thirteen}}th studio album, collaborating with Avicii, Diplo and Kanye West, among others. In December 2014, thirteen demos recorded for the album leaked onto the Internet. She posted in response {{that half of the}} tracks would not be used on the final release, while the other half had [...] "changed and evolved". Titled Rebel Heart, the album was released in March 2015. Introspection was also listed as one of the foundational themes prevalent on the record, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. Music critics responded positively towards the album, calling it her best effort in a decade. Rebel Heart became Madonna's first album to miss the top position of the Billboard 200 since Ray of Light, but it reached number one in other major music markets, including Australia, Canada, Germany and Italy.|$|E

[...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
