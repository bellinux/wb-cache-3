It behaves as if it consists of two components: a normal component, which behaves like a normal fluid, and a superfluid component with zero viscosity and zero entropy. The ratios of the respective densities ρn/ρ and ρs/ρ, with ρn (ρs) {{the density of the}} normal (superfluid) component, and ρ (the total density), depends on temperature and is represented in figure 3.

We use the Landau theory in which thermodynamic properties are expressed as sums over the thermal distribution of elementary excitations. The excitation dispersion curve {{is taken from}} the density functional theory developed by Dalfovo et al. To give a good description of the liquid near to the <b>lambda</b> <b>line,</b> we include {{the interaction between the}} elementary excitations using a modification of the roton liquid theory of Bedell, Pines, and Fomin. The calculated quantities include the location of the <b>lambda</b> <b>line,</b> the liquid-vapor spinodal, and lines of constant entropy in the pressure-temperature (P-T) plane. We have also calculated the line of minimum density (zero expansion coefficient) in the P-T plane. This joins the <b>lambda</b> <b>line</b> tangentially at about − 5. 3 bars. Using the critical properties near the <b>lambda</b> <b>line,</b> we find that the line of maximum density in He I also joins the <b>lambda</b> <b>line</b> tangentially at this pressure.

Particular attention is paid to the He ii <b>lambda</b> 4686 <b>line.</b> This line displays strong profile variability on time scales of a few days, changing from a P-Cygni profile with a double-peaked emission component to a pure blue-shifted emission line. It appears that the variability of most of the absorption lines present in our spectra is correlated to the deformation of the He ii <b>lambda</b> 4686 <b>line</b> and arises probably from a large scale structure in the low-velocity part of the stellar wind rather than from a photospheric phenomenon.

The effective radius of the ion, defined by Stokes' law, shows a maximum 40 mK below the triple point. This and similar behaviour observed previously by Ahlers and Gamota at saturated vapour pressure are explained by the presence of normal fluid in the immediate vicinity of the ion due to the elctrostrictive increase in pressure.

For the LWR camera, early images indicate that K should vary linearly with order. It is suggested that this represents a rotation of the observed blaze centers on the camera compared to a constant K=m <b>lambda</b> <b>line.</b> In four years of use, changes in sensitivity across the camera changed the observed blaze function, inducing a curvature in the K versus m relation. This curvature varies in time with variations in camera response. The SWP camera shows these effects to a lesser degree...|$|E

Our results are obtained by finite-size scaling analyses of high-statistics Monte Carlo simulations up to lattice size L= 128 and resummations of 22 nd-order high-temperature expansions of two improved models with suppressed leading scaling corrections.

40|$|The He I <b>lambda</b> 6678 <b>line</b> {{of early}} Be stars {{generally}} shows violet (V) and red (R) emission whenever hydrogen alpha emission is present, but its {{use as a}} diagnostic has been handicapped by a poor understanding of the processes that drive it into emission. In an attempt {{to address this problem}} we obtained three series of eschelle spectra of the first two members of the singlet and triplet 2 P-nD series of lambda Eri (B 2 e) during 1992 November 3 - 5 at Kitt Peak. During these observations lambda 6678 showed substantial emission variability in both the wings and central profile, providing an opportunity to compare its behavior with that of the lambda 4922, lambda 5876, and <b>lambda</b> 4471 <b>lines.</b> We found that the responses of the lines were different in several respects. Whereas the emissions in the V wings of all four lines scaled together, the R wing of the <b>lambda</b> 4922 <b>line</b> invariably responded with increased absorption whenever the R wing of <b>lambda</b> 6678 <b>line</b> showed increased emission. These same trends occurred within the central photospheric profiles. The R-wing behavior shows that much, but not all of the emission in lambda 6678 is caused by matter projected against the stellar disk. The excitation temperatures of the neighboring 2 (sup 1) P transitions, lambda 6678 and lambda 4922 must be greater than and less than the photospheric continuum temperature, respectively. We have investigated departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) for the He I spectrum in a variety of ad hoc, perturbed model atmospheres. We have found only one way to cause the source function of lambda 6678 to increase so strongly, namely, by increasing the atmospheric temperature in the line formation region to 30, 000 - 40, 000 K. This effect was discovered by Auer and Mihalas for O 3 -O 4 atmospheric models, but it has not been applied to active B stars. Our models suggest that lambda 6678 emission in Be stars {{can be used as a}} sensitive monitor of localized hot spots on these stars' surfaces. The energies involved in heating the active portions of the atmosphere are too high to be produced by gravitational infall. This leaves magnetically induced flares among the few known processes on the surfaces of stars capable of sustaining this energy level...|$|R
40|$|Aims. I {{study the}} {{interaction}} between young AGN and their host galaxies based on their ionized gas and radio emission, and analyze possible implications for radio galaxy evolution. Methods. The [O III] <b>lambda</b> 5007 angstrom <b>line</b> and 5 -GHz radio properties are compared and studied for a large, representative sample of GPS and CSS (i. e., young) quasars and radio galaxies, and large-scale sources using [O III] <b>lambda</b> 5007 angstrom <b>line</b> and 5 -GHz radio data from the literature and our own observations. Results. Several correlations between the [O III] <b>lambda</b> 5007 angstrom <b>line</b> and 5 -GHz radio emission were found. The main {{result is that the}} [O III] lambda 5007 angstrom emission is strongly correlated with the GPS/CSS source size, which indicates that the [O III] lambda 5007 angstrom emission is enhanced significantly by the jet expansion through the host galaxy ISM. Shocks are the most likely enhancement mechanism, although jet-induced star formation could be also, partly, responsible for the [O III] lambda 5007 angstrom emission.

40|$|Using Hubble Space Telescope {{ultraviolet}} and ground-based optical spectroscopy, {{we measure}} the C/O and N/O ratios of three metal-poor galaxies with similar metallicity but differing N/O. The C/O ratios estimated from C III] lambda 1909 and [O III] <b>lambda</b> 5007 <b>lines</b> {{are consistent with}} those measured from C II] lambda 2326 and [O II] <b>lambda</b> 3727 <b>lines.</b> We develop the use of the C^+/O^+ ratio as a reasonable substitute diagnostic of the carbon abundance in HII regions. The proximity of the C II] lambda 2326 multiplet to the [O II] <b>lambda</b> 3726, 3729 <b>lines</b> makes these transitions a potential tool for measuring the carbon abundance in high-redshift objects. Derived chemical properties are consistent with a significant correlation between N and C abundances in metal-poor extragalactic HII regions. This result is unexpected if the dispersion in N/O among galaxies of similar metallicity is caused by localized, temporary chemical enrichments from massive stars. The presence of a correlation suggests that the majority of N and C production is coupled, as expected from chemical evolution models where C is produced predominantly by low mass stars and N is produced predominantly by intermediate mass stars. Since the occurance of localized chemical "pollution" in star-forming galaxies appears to be low, the relative overabundance of N in some galaxies compared to others at similar metallicity is most plausibly interpreted as an indicator of the global, secular chemical enrichment history. The N/O and perhaps the C/O ratios {{can be used as a}} ``clock'' to estimate the time since the last major episode of star formation.

40|$|We have reanalyzed the {{numerous}} high-resolution, far-ultraviolet observations of Capella {{made by the}} International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) in its 16 yr lifetime. Our purpose was to search for long-term profile variations in Capella's ultraviolet emission lines and {{to complement the analysis}} of Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) observations of Capella, discussed in a companion paper (Linsky et al. 1995). We implemented a state-of-the-art photometric correction and spectral extraction procedure to improve S/N and control potential sources for systematic errors. Nevertheless, we were unable to find compelling evidence for any significant long-term profile variations. Previous work has shown that the G 8 primary star is only a minor contributor to the high-excitation transition region lines but is a significant contributor to the low-excitation chromospheric lines. We have found exceptions to this rule, however. We find that the G 8 star is responsible for a significant portion of Capella's N V lambda lambda 1239, 1243 emission, but is not a large contributor to the S I lambda 1296, Cl I lambda 1352, and O <b>lambda</b> 1356 <b>lines.</b> We suggest possible explanations for these behaviors.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{characteristics}} of X-ray emission from gamma Cas suggests various weaknesses with conventional scenarios that invoke Be wind interactions with a putative binary companion. To explore whether this emission might arise instead from sporadic high-energy events on the Be star itself, we have examined the temporal behavior of Voyager 1 FUV spectra and He I <b>lambda</b> 6678 <b>line</b> profiles. The FUV continuum light curves show a continuous rapid variability with a range of greater than or = 0. 2 mag over a timescale of approximately 1 hr. All indications are that this variability is real. The difference spectrum of the inferred fluctuating component is identical to the photospheric spectrum, ruling out an origin much hotter than the star's effective temperature. A histogram of flux differences formed from consecutive observations shows a flat-topped distribution out to 0. 2 mag. This result bears a striking resemblance to histograms constructed from EXOSAT and Ginga data, suggesting that the X-ray and FUV variabilities could have a common origin. Evidence is also presented of rapid variability in optical spectral lines associated with the stars photosphere. Time series of difference profiles of the <b>lambda</b> 6678 <b>line</b> confirm the existence of migrating subfeatures reported by earlier studies. The comoving average of these profiles shows that these features have a shape resembling a symmetrical 'wave-packet'. Wave packets appear to be preceeded and rejuvenated by a sharp central absorption feature. We also report a transient emission feature in lambda 6678 that is similar to brief emissions once reported by Slettebak & Snow in UV resonance line profiles of Si IV and Mg II. We argue that the FUV and optical variability may find an explanation in terms of magnetic flares. Solar white-light flares offer a possible paradigm. However, problems remain with such explanations, in particular their high mean energy, frequency, and temperature...|$|R
40|$|We present {{observational}} {{evidence of}} the effect of small scale ("microturbulent") velocities in enhancing the intensity of the He II <b>lambda</b> 304 <b>line</b> with respect to other transition region emission lines, a process we call "velocity redistribution". We first show results from the 1991 and 1993 flights of SERTS (Solar EUV Rocket Telescope and Spectrograph). The spectral resolution of the SERTS instrument was sufficient to infer that, at the spatial resolution of 5 ", the line profile is nearly gaussian both in the quiet Sun and in active regions. We were then able to determine, for the quiet Sun, a lower limit for the amplitude of non-thermal motions in the region of formation of the 304 A line of the order of 10 km/s. We estimated that, {{in the presence of the}} steep temperature gradients of the solar Transition Region (TR), velocities of this magnitude can significantly enhance the intensity of that line, thus at least helping to bridge the gap between calculated and observed values. We also estimated the functional dependence of such an enhancement on the relevant parameters (non-thermal velocities, temperature gradient, and pressure). We then present results from a coordinated campaign, using SOHO/CDS and H-alpha spectroheliograms from Coimbra Observatory, aimed at determining the relationship between regions of enhanced helium emission and chromospheric velocity fields and transition region emission in the quiescent atmosphere. Using these data, we examined the behavior of the He II <b>lambda</b> 304 <b>line</b> in the quiet Sun supergranular network and compared it with other TR lines, in particular with O III lambda 600. We also examined the association of 304 A emission with the so-called "coarse dark mottle", chromospheric structures seen in H-alpha red wing images and associated with spicules. We found that all these observations are consistent with the velocity redistribution picture...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a three-year program of coordinated X-ray and optical {{monitoring}} of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051. The rapid continuum variations observed in the X-ray spectra are not detected in the optical, although the X-ray and optical continuum fluxes are correlated on time scales of many weeks and longer. Variations in the flux of the broad H-beta line are found to lag behind the optical continuum variations by approximately 6 days (with an uncertainty of 2 - 3 days), and combining this with the line width yields a virial mass estimate of about 1. 1 e 6 solar masses, at the very {{low end of the}} distribution of AGN masses measured by line reverberation. Strong variability of He II lambda 4686 is also detected, and the response time measured {{is similar to that of}} H-beta, but with a much larger uncertainty. The He II <b>lambda</b> 4686 <b>line</b> is almost five times broader than H-beta, and it is strongly blueward asymmetric, as are the high-ionization UV lines recorded in archive spectra of NGC 4051. The data are consistent with the Balmer lines arising in a low-inclination (nearly face-on) disk-like configuration, and the high-ionization lines arising in an outflowing wind, of which we observe preferentially the near side. During the third year of monitoring, both the X-ray continuum and the He II <b>lambda</b> 4686 <b>line</b> went into extremely low states, although the optical continuum and the H-beta broad line were both still present and variable. We suggest that the inner part of the accretion disk may have gone into an advection-dominated state, yielding little radiation from the hotter inner disk.
