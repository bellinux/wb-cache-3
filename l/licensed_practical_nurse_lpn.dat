25|$|To work in {{the nursing}} profession, all nurses hold one or more {{credentials}} depending on their scope of practice and education. A <b>licensed</b> <b>practical</b> <b>nurse</b> (<b>LPN)</b> (also {{referred to as a}} licensed vocational nurse, registered practical nurse, enrolled nurse, and state enrolled nurse) works independently or with a registered nurse (RN). The most significant differentiation between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. For example, Canada requires a bachelor's degree for the RN and a two-year diploma for the LPN. A registered nurse provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health care settings. Registered nurses may earn additional credentials or degrees.|$|E

50|$|Originated in 1969 {{by staff}} nurses at the University of Minnesota, Primary Nursing {{is a system}} of nursing care {{delivery}} which emphasizes continuity of care and responsibility acceptance by having one registered nurse (RN), often teamed with a <b>licensed</b> <b>practical</b> <b>nurse</b> (<b>LPN)</b> and/or nursing assistant (NA), who together provide complete care {{for a group of}} patients throughout their stay in a hospital unit or department. For the duration of a patient’s episode of care, the primary nurse accepts responsibility for administering some and coordinating all aspects of the patient’s nursing care. When RNs supervise LPNs and NAs in the care of patients, costs associated with labor and other resources typically decrease while more attentive, well-coordinated care is provided for patients, increasing patient satisfaction and safety.|$|E

5000|$|Often, {{they provide}} basic bedside care. Many LPNs measure and record patients' vital signs such as weight, height, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and {{respiratory}} rate. A <b>licensed</b> <b>practical</b> <b>nurse</b> (<b>LPN)</b> {{in much of}} the United States and most Canadian provinces is a nurse who cares for people who are sick, injured, convalescent, or disabled. LPNs work under the direction of registered nurses or physicians. They also prepare and give injections and enemas, monitor and also perform placement of catheters, dress wounds, and give alcohol rubs and massages. To help keep patients comfortable, they assist with bathing, dressing, and personal hygiene, moving in bed, standing, and walking. They might also feed patients who need help eating. Experienced LPNs may supervise nursing assistants and aides, and other LPNs.As part of their work, LPNs collect samples for testing, perform routine laboratory tests, and record food and fluid intake and output. They clean and monitor medical equipment. Sometimes, they help physicians and registered nurses perform tests and procedures. Some LPNs help to deliver, care for, and feed infants.LPNs also monitor their patients and report adverse reactions to medications or treatments. LPNs gather information from patients, including their health history and how they are currently feeling. They may use this information to complete insurance forms, pre-authorizations, and referrals, and they share information with registered nurses and doctors to help determine the best course of care for a patient. LPNs often teach family members how to care for a relative or teach patients about good health habits.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityIncreasing {{numbers of}} <b>licensed</b> <b>practical</b> <b>nurses</b> (<b>LPN)</b> are seeking further {{education}} {{in order to}} advance to registered nurse (RN) status. This is {{in part due to}} changes in the healthcare industry and the demand for more RNs in the workforce. This has created a need for more effective LPN to RN transition courses available within nursing education programs. Attrition rates are variable among existing transition programs and more evidence based guidelines are needed in order to create successful programs. In this paper, Knowles' theory of adult learning is applied to a literature review resulting in proposed best practice guidelfes facilitating the academic and role transition of LPNs to RNs within Associate's Degree Nursing (ADN) programs...|$|R

Trinitas offers a generic program as well as a <b>licensed</b> <b>practical</b> <b>nurse</b> (<b>LPN)</b> to a registered nurse (RN) program. The LPN - to - RN Completion Program is designed for Licensed Practical Nurses who wish to return to school, but need to maintain their employment status. Classroom and clinical experiences are designed to meet the specific needs of the LPN. Trinitas had been using leased space in a converted warehouse in the Elizabethport section of the city of Elizabeth but after 1992 moved into a renovated utility building. There were 4000 full and part-time nursing students in Elizabeth in 1992. In one account, there were 2,000 nurses receiving further training at the Trinitas school in 2010. The Muhlenberg and Snyder program offers a day or evening track in nursing. Muhlenberg offers an Accelerated Program designed for individuals who have earned a BA or graduate degree in another discipline and wish to continue their studies in nursing. The nursing or clinical portion of the program can be completed in one year by attending from January to December as a full-time day student. Muhlenberg also offers an LPN - to - RN Career Ladder Program. After successful completion of an LPN transition course, the LPN program may be completed in two semesters.|$|E

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore <b>licensed</b> <b>practical</b> <b>nurses</b> (<b>LPNs)</b> views of being exposed to secondhand smoke in {{municipal}} home nursing care. Design and sample Using a qualitative approach, data were collected through three focus group interviews with 15 LPNs, smokers, and nonsmokers. Qualitative content analysis was used to interpret the interview text. Results Exposure to secondhand smoke during working hours, which presents a risk to the health and wellbeing of the LPNs, is a consequence of placing the interests of the smoking care recipients first and the employers reluctance to take action on behalf of the LPNs. These factors prompted LPNs to propose solutions aimed at resolving a major dilemma in routine home nursing care. Conclusions A combination of actions, particularly by managers, is required to improve the working environment for LPNs while concurrently respecting the care recipients right to take decisions in their own homes...|$|R

The project was framed from a constructivist worldview and Haas and Shaffir’s theory of legitimation. Participants were 27 nurses in a Post-LPN to BN program who came from across Canada to complete required practicums. Data was collected from digital recordings of four focus groups held in different cities. Transcripts were analyzed for themes and confirmed with participants through member checking. Two overarching themes were identified and are presented to explain how these unique adult learners sought to legitimize their emerging identity as Registered Nurses (RNs). First, Post-LPN to BN students need little, if any, further legitimation to affirm their identities as “nurse. ” Second, practicum interactions with instructors and new clinical experiences are key socializing agents...|$|R
