The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of <b>latex</b> <b>gloves,</b> suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes.|$|E

According to Douglas Gwatidzo, {{the chairman of the}} Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights group, Zimbabwe had only one doctor assigned to a group of 12,000 citizens. Doctors in Zimbabwe fill only 25% of the medical posts available, and even fewer specialist positions are taken.

500|$|Polonium {{is highly}} {{dangerous}} {{and has no}} biological role. By mass, polonium-210 is around 250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide (the [...] for 210Po is less than 1 microgram for an average adult (see below) compared with about 250 milligrams for hydrogen cyanide). The main hazard is its intense radioactivity (as an alpha emitter), which {{makes it difficult to}} handle safely. Even in microgram amounts, handling 210Po is extremely dangerous, requiring specialized equipment (a negative pressure alpha glove box equipped with high-performance filters), adequate monitoring, and strict handling procedures to avoid any contamination. Alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested, inhaled, or absorbed, although they do not penetrate the epidermis and hence are not hazardous as long as the alpha particles remain outside the body. Wearing chemically resistant and intact gloves is a mandatory precaution to avoid transcutaneous diffusion of polonium directly through the skin. Polonium delivered in concentrated nitric acid can easily diffuse through inadequate gloves (e.g., <b>latex</b> <b>gloves)</b> or the acid may damage the gloves.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} sensitisation to natural rubber latex in latex tappers and <b>latex</b> <b>glove</b> factory workers, and to relate this to airborne exposure to latex.  METHODS—Five hundred workers employed in three <b>latex</b> <b>glove</b> factories, 314  tappers, and 144  college students (control group) were studied. The workers in the glove factories were classified into three exposure groups; high, moderate, and low. Personal exposures to natural rubber latex aeroallergens were measured by immunoassay. Symptom questionnaires and skin prick tests with latex allergens (Stallergènes 1 : 200 w/v) and other common environmental allergens were performed. The criterion for positivity was a wheal reaction at least 3  mm in diameter greater than that to a diluent control.  RESULTS—The geometric mean (GM) concentration of latex in air was 15. 4  µg/m 3 for those employed in glove stripping, glove inspections, and packing of powdered gloves. The moderate exposure glove manufacturing group and the tappers had GM concentrations of 2. 3  and 2. 4  µg/m 3 respectively, compared with United Kingdom users of latex powdered gloves,who had GM concentrations of 0. 5  µg/m 3. The prevalence of sensitisation to latex in the tappers and <b>latex</b> <b>glove</b> factory workers was 1. 3 % and 1. 7 % respectively. No positive cases were found among the college students. Workers who showed a positive skin prick test to latex {{were more likely to}} be atopic. Work related respiratory and dermatological symptoms were found in about 20 % of each population studied, but were not related to the presence of positive latex prick tests.  CONCLUSIONS—This study suggests that in the Thai latex industries, latex sensitisation is rare despite high concentrations of airborne exposure and is less prevalent than in the healthcare sector in Europe where skin exposure is greater.    Keywords: natural rubber; latex; allergy; glove factory; healthcar...|$|R
