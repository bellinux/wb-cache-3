Intermediate-intensity land-use types {{in the form of}} complex agroforests have maintained global environmental benefits under a sustainable and profitable <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime.</b> Conver-sion to tree crop monocultures, however, poses a challenge to the environmental stakeholders and an opportunity from to stakeholders in the private economy. We quantified environ-mental indicators, as well as profitability and sustainability of a range of existing and possible production systems. Criteria and indicators were used at plot to landscape scales, taking into account local, national and global perspectives. Agro-nomic sustainability and profitability were assessed at plot level as they are of primarily local concern, while environ-mental services of forests, such as plant species and functiona...|$|E
40|$|It can be {{difficult}} to identify an optimal <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime.</b> Some researchers use monetized net benefits as the measure and conclude by summing market values. Non-market values are not often taken into account mainly because of the uncertainties in measuring quantities and the difficulty in estimating values. Consequently, total goods and services from forests are undervalued and their contribution to the national output may have been grossly underestimated. As a result, land use decisions are generally biased in favor of land-use options other than forests. This paper analyzed major issues on the valuation of community forestry, an important forest management strategy in developing countries, and then developed methods for estimating the amount of net carbon sequestration, option value of biodiversity and onsite soil protection value after the forests have been allocated to the designated communities...|$|E

Ignoring the economic value associated with wetland conservation underestimates {{the true cost of}} land development, and may lead to land-uses that do not maximize benefits to society. I conduct an economic valuation, stakeholder consultation, legal analysis and explore the relationship between land uses and the Lac La Biche aquatic ecosystem to determine the viability of establishing a natural area relative to the current <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime</b> in Lakeland County, Alberta. The analysis evaluates a variety of voluntary and mandatory land conservation techniques utilized to establish a natural area. I conclude the natural area designation is a viable policy option relative to the status quo and the collective use of voluntary and mandatory techniques will likely achieve the stated policy objectives...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} {{a method to}} reconstruct <b>land</b> <b>use</b> history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regimes,</b> while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regimes.</b> In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect {{the capacity of the}} forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984 – 2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0. 25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90 s and sub-object mixture of <b>land</b> <b>uses.</b> We conclude that the method holds great promise for <b>land</b> <b>use</b> history mapping in the tropics and beyond...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{activities}} have exerted increasingly large-scale influences on terrestrial ecological systems {{from the past}} century, primarily through agriculture; however, the impact of such changes on the groundwater risk is poorly understood.

The purpose of this study is to quantify the alterations in the <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime</b> as well as to assess the changes in groundwater risk. A conceptual hydrologic model was developed to simulate groundwater and water balance in the study basin under different land use scenarios. The simulated results illustrated different groundwater level evolution and risk in the typical hydrologic years of 2003 (normal flow year), 2001 (high flow year), and 2002 (drought year) in different land use cases that are influenced by anthropogenic activities. The produced groundwater risk simulation results can be used by the local management authorities to enhance sustainable socio-economic planning and environmental management...|$|E

One of them {{has to do with}} the land ownership and <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime</b> in Mexico. As the legislative debate on the new Ley de Petróleos and the Ley de la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (Petroleum Act and Federal Electric Utility Act) proceeded in the summer of 2014, the Mexican Congress anticipated potential land-related conflicts associated with exploration and production activities related to hydrocarbons and new energy-related infrastructure projects. These potential conflicts stem from the fact that all of these projects will necessarily require the right of way to access and work on the resources in the subsoil of privately owned as well as on so-called “socially owned” lands in regions targeted for energy development. Thus, the Mexican Congress sought to avoid land-related conflicts by including language related to land ownership and use in the new energy legislation. The legislation, however, may not be able to prevent such conflicts...|$|E

40|$|In the arid, low biomass {{producing}} {{areas of}} Ethiopia, Acacia woodlands suffered a severe degradation due to exploitation for various uses, and conversion to grazing and cultivated lands. However, {{little is known}} {{on the impact of}} agricultural <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> on soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) stocks, and other soil quality indicators. This study was planned to evaluate SOC and TN stock changes under parkland agroforestry (PAF), managed pastureland (MPL), and treeless cropland (TLCL) regimes by considering the remnant protected woodland (PWL) as a reference. We found that SOC and TN stocks were significantly higher in PWL and MPL areas. Conversion of Acacia woodlands to MPL, PAF, and TLCL resulted in the loss of SOC stock by 23, 50, and 56 %, respectively. Higher SOC and TN stocks were found under PWL (144. 3 Mg ha− 1) and MPL (108. 2 Mg ha− 1). Significant changes in available phosphorous (P), exchangeable cations, and cation exchangeable capacity were observed following the woodland conversion to different <b>land</b> <b>use</b> types.

40|$|Land use change (LUC) {{is often}} a complex process. In such a process land use systems can show {{non-linear}} behaviours caused by mechanisms such as interactions between agents and feedbacks from higher system level. Land use systems might be very sensitive to such non-linearity, for instance {{in the form of}} tipping points, which lead them to a different <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime.</b> Many models deal with the causes and consequences of LUC but few focus on the non-linear process in land use systems. Thus {{there is a need for}} an explicit treatment of interactions and feedback mechanisms in LUC models to better understand the behaviour of land use systems. Two primary mechanisms are implemented with an agent-based model (ABM) to capture 1) the social interaction between land use decision makers (farmers) and 2) the positive feedback mechanism in agricultural production, with each applied to a case study showing how such mechanism can give rise to non-linear changes in land use systems. Due to a lack of focus on feedbacks in LUC-ABMs, we propose a framework to approach feedback mechanisms in land use systems in a structured way...|$|E
40|$|A <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime</b> {{undergoes}} {{much change}} over time depending on {{the growth in the}} importance of various interest groups. Spatial conflicts repeatedly accompany this growth. The aim of the article is to determine the relationship between spatial conflicts and landscape changes. On the basis of the Silesian and Żywiec Beskid mountain ranges, it has been proven that conflicts arising between mountain grazing, agriculture, forest management, contemporary building and tourism development have significant impacts on the landscape. To this end, archive and contemporary cartographic materials, historical scientific works and archive photographs were used. The conflicts between mountain grazing and other types of human activity in the study area were analysed. Subsequently, their influence on the landscape was determined. As a result of the study, the primary sources of conflicts were indicated and correlated with historical periods and the predominant landscape use regime. The imprints of historical space conflicts and the rivalry for land use between different entities for their own purposes are still visible in the landscape. The historical conflicts have arisen between entities seeking ways to use different environmental resources occurring in the same area. Contemporary conflicts arise between entities seeking ways to use environmental resources (tourism) and between entities conscious of the hazards of the landscape sustainability resulting from the utilization of environmental resources (nature conservation services). Both historical and contemporary conflicts usually have a violent course resulting from the lack, or deficiency of, legislation concerning land management...|$|E
40|$|Digital soil {{models and}} maps have been {{developed}} for pre-European (pre-clearing) levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) over New South Wales, Australia. These provide a useful first estimate of natural, unaltered soil conditions before agricultural development, which are potentially important for many carbon-accounting schemes such as those prescribed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, carbon-turnover models such as RothC, and soil-condition monitoring programs. The modelling approach adopted included multiple linear regression and Cubist piecewise linear decision trees. It used 1690 soil profiles from undisturbed or only lightly disturbed native vegetation sites across all of eastern Australia, together with a range of covariates representing key soil-forming factors. The digital soil maps of pre-clearing SOC (% and mass) over New South Wales provide a more sophisticated alternative to currently available, equivalent maps. Independent validation of the SOC mass predictions over the top 30 cm revealed a concordance correlation coefficient of 0. 76, which was 13 % higher than the currently used map. Total pre-clearing SOC stocks amount to 4. 21 Gt in the top 30 cm, which compared with a current stock estimate of 3. 68 Gt, suggesting a total SOC loss of ∼ 0. 53 Gt over the entire state. The extent of SOC decline in both absolute and relative terms was found to be highly dependent on the climate, parent material and <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime,</b> reaching a maximum decline of 44. 3 t/ha or 50. 0 % relative loss in cooler (moist) conditions over mafic parent materials under regular cropping use.

40|$|The urban <b>land</b> <b>use</b> {{planning}} {{literature is}} rife with criticism of the deficiency of planning regimes in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, little is known {{of the magnitude of}} the economic impact of these <b>land</b> <b>use</b> planning <b>regimes,</b> leading to a lack of clear evidence to direct policy reforms. This study examines the economic benefit of Ghana’s <b>land</b> <b>use</b> planning <b>regime</b> to provide quantitative evidence of the magnitude of its benefits to contribute to the debate in the literature as well as aid policy formulation. This study found that <b>land</b> <b>use</b> planning in Ghana contributes considerable benefits in residential areas. A substantial portion of these benefits emanates from tarred roads and concrete drains, electricity, formalized titles and pipe-borne water, while worship centres generate no benefits. This implies that the former four attributes are central to generating maximum benefits from planning in residential areas in Ghana. The study recommends that Ghana’s ongoing planning reforms should place the provision of these facilities at the heart of residential neighbourhood developments, while steps are taken to review the necessity of requirements (attributes) such as community parks, schools and worship centres in residential communities. To aid the assessment of the suitability of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> planning requirements, it is further suggested that the benefit of the planning regime should be evaluated {{in the context of the}} cost of compliance with its requirements and urban dwellers’ socio-economic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Myriad {{federal and}} state {{programs}} have been promoted to incentivize {{the research and development}} of renewable energy as a means of achieving sustainability and producing more affordable alternative energy systems, and these programs could potentially have a profound impact on the way that electricity is produced and consumed in the United States. Small-scale renewable energy generation from sources such as solar and wind, that can be used at the consumer level as a source of power for homes and small businesses, {{is an important part of}} this paradigm shift. However, regardless of the fiscal incentives offered to clean-tech companies to design and market these products, as well as the fiscal incentives to homeowners and business owners to purchase and install these technologies, state and local laws can inadvertently impede their installation. These barriers may be caused by outdated statutes and municipal codes or by historic district and aesthetic regulations. Restrictive covenants and deed restrictions in homeowners association communities may further impede the goal of siting small scale renewable energy sources. In response to these problems, many state and local governments have sought to promote small-scale renewable energy development through amendments to comprehensive planning and zoning laws, as well as through utility regulations and various financial incentives. This article provides an overview of some of the strategies that have been used to increase the use of small-scale renewables, focusing on non-commercial renewable energy systems installed at the home or business level. The article begins in Part II with a discussion of various renewable energy incentives offered by the {{federal and state}} governments to promote the use of these alternative sources of electricity, including financial and permit-ting incentives. Part III continues with a detailed examination of how the land use regulatory system can be used to promote small-scale renewable energy by employing traditional zoning techniques, asserting that without an appropriate local <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime,</b> the incentives reviewed in Part II cannot be effectively utilized. Part IV concludes with a warning to local governments that if they fail to accommodate the emerging federal and state policies supporting the siting of renewable energy sources, they may face preemptive statutory measures in the area of land use regulation. This creates perhaps the greatest incentive for local governments to plan and regulate responsibly for promoting the appropriate use of small-scale renewable energy...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} {{of problems in}} the territorial management of land indicates that the system of state and municipal management {{does not meet the}} modern requirements of sustainable (balanced) development. The explanation is simple - if the planning of the development of territories of settlements takes place on the basis of approved urban planning documentation (master plans), then the territory of land tenure and land use outside their borders is notfully covered by development of land management documentation. In this regard, the importance of {{the development and implementation of}} land management regulations at the practical level as an important land-use planning tool is substantiated. Essential and meaningful signs of the concepts of "urban planning regulations", "land management regulations" for conducting researchesare found. The National Standard defines the concept of urban planning regulations, such as the use of land plots, established within the respective territorial zones and defines the types of preferential and related use of land, the limits of permitted construction, reconstruction of construction objects and is used in the design, construction and subsequent operation of Objects. The draft law of Ukraine "On zoning of land" proposed the definition of land management regulations as approved in accordance with the established procedure text materials, that determine the parameters of the permitted use of land (<b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime)</b> and acceptable changes in these parameters. However, this draft law is not harmonized during the 10 -year period at the state level, therefore the proposed terms and definitions do not fully comply with modern requirements. Therefore, it is proposed to supplement them with other terms and definitions. Based on the research carried out, the author's definition of land management regulations should be understood as the procedure for land use, which is established within the respective territorial zones, with the definition of the legal regime of the territory of land use, which specifies the boundaries of the land plot, restrictions on the land use and the types and parameters of permitted land use, types of predominant and concomitant use of land plots, which indicate prohibited activities and responsibilities in relation to taking certain actions. It’s established that land management regulations should become an integral part of the land management project on land zoning. For this purpose, a methodological approach to the formation of the legal regime of land use in land zoning according to their categories is proposed. The given division of land by types and subtypes of land use will allow to properly form territorial restrictions on land use with subsequent differentiation to land plots. A combination of urban planning and land management regulations will contribute to the achievement of sustainable (balanced) land use...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} origins, {{evolution}} and contemporary {{workings of the}} legal system that determines the use of land. In Part II, the development of zoning and comprehensive planning laws in the United States is traced, emphasizing the importance that zoning be “in conformance with” a comprehensive land use plan, a requirement meant to provide direction and purpose to land use regulation. This retrospect shows that, from the beginning, the framers of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regime</b> were indecisive. They failed to define a comprehensive plan, to detail what such a plan should contain, and to prescribe how planning should serve as the predicate for zoning. Decisions of New York 2 ̆ 7 s highest court that criticize the state legislature 2 ̆ 7 s failure to redress the enigmatic nature of the eighty year-old system are discussed, so that contemporary challenges may be addressed. Part III analyzes several New York cases that invalidate zoning regulations because of their failure to conform to a comprehensive plan. A checklist of the charges that property owners can bring successfully against land use regulations emerges from this discussion and highlights the special vulnerability of regulations that do not meet the historic “in conformance with” requirement. Part IV explores the notion that regulations can constitute “takings” in violation of the Fifth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s guarantees and then describes how conformance with comprehensive planning insulates regulations from Fifth Amendment challenges, {{as well as from the}} historic checklist of charges discussed in Part III. The failure of the statutory law to make comprehensive planning mandatory, and to tie regulations closely to it, is rectified, to a degree, by the weight of the case law explored in this part. The decisional law creates a practical necessity that local governments adopt comprehensive land use plans, a partial accommodation of the statutory law 2 ̆ 7 s failure to do so. The argument is advanced that this judicial imperative to plan before restricting land use applies to all land use regulations, not just zoning. Part V discusses two emerging land use issues. The first involves the judicial requirement that local zoning, labeled “insular” by New York 2 ̆ 7 s highest court, must consider regional needs. The second is how the rapidly increasing number of federal and state laws that affect land use are to be coordinated with local land use regulations and conformed to the comprehensive plans that local regulations are to advance. How, for example, in the absence of any formal division of the state into planning regions, and without benefit of plans for those regions, can local plans consider regional needs? Without cogent regional plans, how can the plethora of local, state, and federal land use regulations be harmonized? By concluding with an analysis of the many constituent groups whose interests are compromised by the lack of a regional solution to the land use dilemma, the article ends with the unimaginative suggestion that New York can and should address these issues and, in that process, decide “where it wants to get to” regarding the use and preservation of its land...|$|E

This study investigates the effects that different <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> have on mammal communities in northern Botswana and compares the results with previous studies from the mentioned study area and an additional area in southern Botswana. Mammals, wild and domestic, from the size of tree squirrel and larger and ostriches were recorded along 11 predetermined transects in four <b>land</b> <b>use</b> types; Communal Grazing Areas, Fenced Ranches, Wildlife Management Areas and National Parks. This study indicates that decline in species richness in an area can many times be connected to an increase in human presence. The limited number of wild species observations in the unprotected areas is an indication of how the human population and high densities of domestic animals are influencing the wildlife in those areas. The herbivores are shown to have a very evident impact on the vegetation. In this study woody vegetation of all heights are positively correlated to the areas holding large herds of domestic livestock. <b>Land</b> <b>use</b> types are shown to be the most influential environmental variables in both study areas, independent of season or patterns of precipitation. It is evident that different <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regimes</b> affect mammal communities and vegetation structures differently...|$|R

40|$|Current <b>land</b> <b>use</b> {{and climate}} change are {{prompting}} questions {{about the ability of}} plants to adapt to such environmental change. Therefore, we experimentally addressed plant performance and quantitative-genetic diversity of the common Alpine Meadow Grass Poa alpina. We asked how <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and altitude affect the occurrence of P. alpina in the field and whether its common-garden performance suggests adaptation to conditions at plant origin and differences in quantitative genetic diversity among plant origins. Among 216 candidate grassland sites of different <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and altitude from 12 villages in the Swiss Alps, P. alpina occurred preferentially in fertilized and grazed sites and at higher elevations. In a common garden at 1, 500 m asl, we grew two plants of > 600 genotypes representing 78 grassland sites. After 2 years, nearly 90 % of all plants had reproduced. In agreement with adaptive advantages of vegetative reproduction at higher altitudes, only 23 % of reproductive plants from lower altitudes reproduced via vegetative bulbils, but 55 % of plants from higher altitudes. In agreement with adaptive advantages of reproduction in grazed sites, allocation to reproductive biomass was higher in plants from grazed grasslands than from mown ones. For 53 grasslands, we also investigated broad-sense heritability H 2, which was significant for all studied traits and twice as high for grazed as for mown grasslands. Moreover, possibly associated with their higher landscape diversity, H 2 was higher for sites of villages of Romanic cultural tradition than for those of Germanic and Walser traditions. We suggest promoting diverse <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regimes</b> to conserve not only landscape and plant species diversity, but also adaptive genetic differentiation and heritable genetic variation...|$|R
40|$|Habitat fragmentation, {{the process}} by which {{relatively}} continuous habitats is broken into smaller pieces, occurs in natural systems but is to a high degree also human- induced through landscape use. Fragmentation of the landscape produces a series of habitat patches surrounded by a matrix of different habitats and/or <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regimes.</b> The major landscape consequences of fragmentation are loss of habitat, reduction in habitat patch size, and increasing isolation of habitat patches. In general, population performance declines in response to habitat loss but size of remaining area and isolation effects is known also to influence the population trend. Small mammals are well suited for examination of population responses to habitat fragmentation as they have modest spatial requirements and short generation times. In theory, organic farms could {{play an important role in}} the agricultural landscape as refuges for some small mammal species, as the lack of pesticide and fertiliser treatment, less weed control, more diversified crop structure and a general environmentalfriendly attitude, form a basis for habitats that provide cover and food for small mammals, and thus for larger predators of these species. Furthermore, density and area of small biotopes could be expected to be higher in the organic farms, thus leading to a decreased distance between optimal habitats...|$|R
40|$|Processes of land {{degradation}} and regeneration display fine scale heterogeneity often intimately linked with <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> Yet, examinations {{of the relationships}} between <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and <b>land</b> degradation often lack the resolution necessary to understand how local institutions differentially modulate feedback between individual farmers and the spatially heterogeneous effects of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> on soils. In this paper, we examine an historical example of a transition from agriculture to forest dominated <b>land</b> <b>use</b> (c. 1933 – 1941) in a highly degraded landscape on the Piedmont of South Carolina. Our landscape-scale approach examines <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and tenure at the level that individuals enact management decisions. We used logistic regression techniques to examine associations between <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> <b>land</b> tenure, topography, and market cost-distance. Our findings suggest that farmer responses to changing market and policy conditions were influenced by topographic characteristics associated with productivity and long-term viability of agricultural <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> Further, although local environmental feedbacks help to explain spatial patterning of <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> property <b>regime</b> and <b>land</b> tenure arrangements also significantly constrained the ability of farmers to adapt to changing socioeconomic and environmental conditions...|$|R

The distribution of the Giant Burrowing Frog included Sydney, and therefore, large populations were destroyed.|$|R

Answering {{this question is}} of key importance for many European cities and for older US cities, and has important implications in terms of urban sustainability and “smart growth” initiatives. This study uses conjoint choice experiments to explore {{the relative importance of}} {{economic incentives}}, regulatory relief, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and property <b>regime</b> offerings at under-utilised historic sites in Venice, Italy. Real estate developers and investors were surveyed, and asked to choose between pairs of hypothetical projects in three Venice locations, as well as between one of these projects and the alternative to do a development project elsewhere. Statistical models of the responses to these choice questions indicate that respondents were sensitive to the price of acquiring the land (and hence to any policies that influence prices), and particularly sensitive to the property regime that would be granted to developers and investors and to the allowable <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> It is concluded that the city should focus on offering <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and property <b>regimes</b> that are more in tune with developer demand. conjoint choice experiments, real estate developers, building conservation restrictions, redevelopment incentives, brownfields, infill redevelopment,...|$|R
40|$|Assessing the {{recovery}} of species diversity and composition after major disturbance is key to understanding the resilience of tropical forests through successional processes, and its importance for biodiversity conservation. Despite the specific abiotic environment and ecological processes of tropical dry forests, secondary succession has received less attention in this biome than others and changes in species diversity and composition have never been synthesised in a systematic and quantitative review. This study aims to assess in tropical dry forests 1) the directionality of change in species richness and evenness during secondary succession, 2) the convergence of species composition towards that of old-growth forest and 3) {{the importance of the}} previous <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> precipitation <b>regime</b> and water availability in influencing the direction and rate of change. We conducted meta-analyses of the rate of change in species richness, evenness and composition indices with succession in 13 tropical dry forest chronosequences. Species richness increased with succession, showing a gradual accumulation of species, as did Shannon evenness index. The similarity in species composition of successional forests with old-growth forests increased with succession, yet at a low rate. Tropical dry forests therefore do show resilience of species composition but it may never reach that of old-growth forests. We found no significant differences in rates of change between different previous <b>land</b> <b>uses,</b> precipitation <b>regimes</b> or water availability. Our results show high resilience of tropical dry forests in term of species richness but a slow recovery of species composition. They highlight the need for further research on secondary succession in this biome and better understanding of impacts of previous land-use and landscape-scale patterns...|$|R
40|$|European larch (Larix decidua) {{forests of}} the western Alps form {{extensive}} cultural landscapes whose resilience to global changes is currently unknown. Resilience describes the capacity of ecological systems to maintain the same state, i. e., the same function, processes, structure, and composition despite disturbances, environmental changes and internal fluctuations. Our aim is to explore the resilience of larch forests to changes in climate and <b>land</b> <b>use</b> in the western Italian Alps. To do so, we examined whether larch forests {{can be described as}} an alternative stable state in mountain forest ecosystems. We used tree basal area data obtained from field forest inventories in combination with topography, forest structure, <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> and climate information. We applied three different probabilistic methods: frequency distributions, logistic regressions, and potential analyses to infer the resilience of larch forests relative to that of other forest types. We found patters indicative of alternative stable states: bimodality in the frequency distribution of the percent of larch basal area, and the presence of an unstable state, i. e., mixed larch forests, in the potential analyses. We also found: (1) high frequency of pure larch forests at high elevation, (2) the probability of pure larch forests increased mostly with elevation, and (3) pure larch forests were a stable state in the upper montane and subalpine belts. Our study shows that the resilience of larch forests may increase with elevation, most likely due to the altitudinal effect on climate. Under the same climate conditions, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> seems to be the main factor governing the dominance of larch forests. In fact, subalpine larch forests may be more resilient, and natural succession after land abandonment, e. g., towards Pinus cembra forests, seems slower than in montane larch forests. In contrast, in the upper montane belt only intense <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regimes</b> characterized by open canopies and forest grazing may maintain larch forests. We conclude that similar approaches could be applied in other forest ecosystems to infer the resilience of tree species...|$|R

40|$|Macro-aggregates {{especially}} in agricultural steppe soils {{are supposed to}} {{play a vital role}} for soil organic carbon (OC) stabilization at a decadal timescale. While most research on soil OC stabilization in steppes focused on North American prairie soils of the Great Plains with information mainly provided by short-term incubation experiments, {{little is known about the}} agricultural steppes in southwestern Siberia, though they belong to the greatest conversion areas in the world and occupy an area larger than that in the Great Plains. To quantify the proportion of macro-aggregate-protected OC under different <b>land</b> <b>use</b> as function of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> intensity and time since <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change (LUC) from pasture to arable land in Siberian steppe soils, we determined OC mineralization rates of intact (250 – 2000  µm) and crushed (<  250  µm) macro-aggregates in long-term incubations over 401  days (20  °C; 60  % water holding capacity) along two agricultural chronosequences in the Siberian Kulunda steppe. Additionally, we incubated bulk soil (<  2000  µm) to determine the effect of LUC and subsequent agricultural use on a fast and a slow soil OC pool (labile vs. more stable OC), as derived from fitting exponential-decay models to incubation data. We hypothesized that (i)  macro-aggregate crushing leads to increased OC mineralization due to an increasing microbial accessibility of a previously occluded labile macro-aggregate OC fraction, and (ii)  bulk soil OC mineralization rates and the size of the fast OC pool are higher in pasture than in arable soils with decreasing bulk soil OC mineralization rates and size of the fast OC pool as <b>land</b> <b>use</b> intensity and time since LUC increase. Against our hypothesis, OC mineralization rates of crushed macro-aggregates were similar to those of intact macro-aggregates under all <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>regimes.</b> Macro-aggregate-protected OC was almost absent and accounted for <  1  % of the total macro-aggregate OC content and to a maximum of 8  ±  4  % of mineralized OC. In accordance to our second hypothesis, highest bulk soil OC mineralization rates and sizes of the fast OC pool were determined under pasture, but mineralization rates and pool sizes were unaffected by <b>land</b> <b>use</b> intensity and time since LUC. However, at one chronosequence mean residence times of the fast and slow OC pool tended to decrease with increasing time since establishment of arable use. We conclude that the tillage-induced breakdown of macro-aggregates has not reduced the OC contents in the soils under study. The decline of OC after LUC is probably attributed to the faster soil OC turnover under arable land as compared to pasture at a reduced plant residue input...|$|R
