50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: disc harrows, tine harrows (including spring-tooth harrows, drag <b>harrows,</b> and <b>spike</b> <b>harrows),</b> <b>chain</b> <b>harrows,</b> and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|R
40|$|Proteinuria {{in three}} cases of {{multiple}} myeloma was studied without prior {{concentration of the}} urine, using a simple technique of urinary protein electrophoresis. In each case a free <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> <b>spike</b> was observed in association with a glomerular, tubular or normal urine protein electrophoresis pattem. The suggestion is made that this simple procedure may become a screening test for investigation of renal diseases...|$|R
50|$|In cooler climates {{the most}} common types are the disc <b>harrow,</b> the <b>chain</b> <b>harrow,</b> the tine harrow or spike harrow and the spring tine <b>harrow.</b> <b>Chain</b> <b>harrows</b> are often used for lighter work such as {{levelling}} the tilth or covering seed, while disc harrows are typically used for heavy work, such as following ploughing {{to break up the}} sod. In addition, there are various types of power harrow, in which the cultivators are power-driven from the tractor rather than depending on its forward motion.|$|R

5000|$|Harrows may be {{of several}} types and weights, {{depending}} on their purpose. They almost always consist of a rigid frame that holds discs, teeth, linked chains, or other means of moving soil—but tine and <b>chain</b> <b>harrows</b> are often only supported by a rigid towing-bar {{at the front of}} the set.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} styles of dress within the {{hardcore}} scene, and styles {{have changed since}} the genre started as hardcore punk in the late 1970s. What is fashionable in one branch of the hardcore scene may be frowned upon in another. Personal comfort {{and the ability to}} mosh are highly influential in this style. For this reason, jewellery, <b>spikes,</b> <b>chains</b> and spiky hair are highly uncommon and discouraged in hardcore fashion.|$|R

30|$|One model, the neuroanatomically {{grounded}} Hebbian-learning model [8], establishes {{highly specialized}} functional units called “Hebbian neuronal circuits” (HNCs, see also [9]). This model {{appears to be}} especially neurobiologically realistic since it learns to associate sensory and motor speech items {{in a similar way}} to the early phases of speech acquisition in children. In order to maintain balance between neurobiological realism and computational tractability, this approach does not model single neurons and <b>spike</b> <b>chains,</b> but rather uses “cells” or “nodes” as basic neuron-like elements which represent a local set of neurons, and thus it realizes a lumped-type or mean-field type model in which the primary objects of modeling are the average activity rate of the neuron set (or cell) and cell exhibitory and inhibitory connectivity.|$|R

50|$|An anvil {{needs to}} be placed upon a sturdy base made from an impact and fire {{resistant}} material. It requires being fastened firmly to the base, so it will not move when struck with a hammer. A loose anvil is extremely unsafe, as it can fall off the base and is an ineffective forging tool. Common methods of attaching an anvil are <b>spikes,</b> <b>chains,</b> steel or iron straps, clips, bolts where there are holes provided, and cables. A smith would use whatever was at hand, {{as long as it}} held the anvil firmly in place. The anvil is placed as near to the forge as is convenient, generally no more than one step from the forge to prevent heat loss in the work piece.|$|R
40|$|We studied big {{sagebrush}} {{plant community}} {{responses to a}} two-way <b>chain</b> <b>harrow</b> and broadcast seeding of herbaceous species at eight Wyoming big sagebrush sites with the same ecological site classification; five were cultivated for dryland wheat production during the 1950 - 1980 s, then seeded with introduced forage grasses and reverted back to grazing lands, while three had not been previously cultivated. Five years after treatment, densities of sagebrush seedlings and snakeweed plants increased in cultivated sites during {{the second and third}} year after treatment. In addition, perennial forb cover increased for cultivated sites, while perennial grass biomass increased for non-cultivated sites. Plant community change after treatment also varied between non-cultivated and cultivated sites, and response to treatment was most strongly correlated with reductions in sagebrush cover, increases in the perennial grass bulbous bluegrass, and increases in 10 herbaceous species—four of which were seeded. Our results emphasize that broad variability in plant community responses to sagebrush reduction is possible within the same ecological site classification, and that cultivation history can leave long- lasting legacy effects...|$|R

40|$|The false seedbed {{technique}} {{reduces the}} weed seed {{bank in the}} topsoil and, as a result, significantly reduces competition of annual weeds in the succeeding crop. 	 •	Prepare a regular seedbed 2 to 4 weeks before the planned seeding date of the next crop. •	Let the weeds germinate and grow to the 2 - to 4 -leaf stage, the most effective stage for weed control. •	Uproot the weeds {{to a depth of}} 3 to 5 cm using a harrow comb or a flexible or <b>chain</b> <b>harrow.</b> •	If (a) weed density is high, (b) if you have 7 to 10 days available for sowing the crop, or if (c) weed competition in the following crop is very critical, repeat the procedure a second time before sowing the crop as usual. Notes •	Weed seed germination is highest in humid soil with a fine tilth. If the seedbed is too dry or cloddy, germination is reduced and the impact of the method is limited. •	Effectiveness of the method can be limited at soil temperatures below 10 °C. •	Preferably use a power take-off or friction-driven machines to avoid soil structure damages...|$|R

50|$|Elephant Biologist V Sridhar accuses, {{the temple}} boards of being greedy and co-ercing {{aggressive}} elephants not suited to such tasks {{by going to}} the extent of hobbling them even with <b>spike</b> <b>chains</b> on their forelegs. He further claims that due to the increasing work load, elephants in their prime (20-40 years of age) seem to be dying prematurely. He suspects that increase in death toll - due to intestinal obstruction and other digestive problems - is indicative of potential increase in physiological and psychological stress. He also expresses his concerns on the lack of trained mahouts - to handle the huge increase of total elephants in captivity - which is a leading reason for the cruel mis-treatment of the animals Further in his opinion, the process of taming an elephant was, historically, based on principles of dominance establishment, which needs revision by creating better awareness and training of Mahouts, but this process cannot happen overnight and it can only happen gradually.|$|R
