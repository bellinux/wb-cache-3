40|$|ABSTRACT: This study investigates {{initiation}} and {{propagation of}} damage zones in the composite plates of an adhesively bonded single-lap joint in tension at the mesoscale level. A set of material degradation rules {{is applied to}} the mechanical properties of each failed ply of the plates based on the Hashin failure criterion. The von Mises stress concentrates along the free edges of the adhesive layer and the corresponding <b>lower</b> and upper <b>plate</b> regions and peaks along the free edges of the adhesive–plate interfaces. Consequently, the damage initiates at the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> interface to the adhesive layer and propagates in the first ply along this adhesive free edge, and then spreads through the neighboring plies of the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> in a similar failure mechanism. The damage in the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> occurs in the matrix, delamination, and fiber–matrix failure modes, and the first ply-failure loads decrease significantly with increasing ply fiber angle. Tension tests showed that the adhesive joints with ply lay-ups between [0] 10 and [15] 10 fails through the adhesive layer, and the <b>lower</b> <b>plates</b> with larger fiber angles break along the free edge of the lower plate– adhesive interface whereas the adhesive layer is still intact. The adhesive failure is interfacial around the adhesive free edges and is through the adhesive {{in the middle of the}} overlap region in the joints with the ply lay-ups [0] 10.

40|$|International audienceAccommodation of collisional {{shortening}} in the Central Alps varies dramatically along strike, {{and this}} change is inferred to result from along-strike changes of rheology. In the western Central Alps, 90 % of shortening is accommodated in the thickened <b>lower</b> <b>plate.</b> In the eastern Central Alps, 90 % of shortening is accommodated in the upper plate. In the central Central Alps, shortening is almost equally partitioned between the two <b>plates.</b> The <b>lower</b> crust of the Adriatic plate forms a wedge that reaches a maximum north-south extension of almost 70 km in the Engadine section, progressively decreasing westward and disappearing along the Simplon section. This difference indicates an along-strike increase of intra-plate decoupling, limiting shortening of the Adriatic plate to {{the middle and upper}} parts of the crust. Whereas the upper plate indents into the thickened accreted <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> in the Simplon section, it is the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> that indents an intensely deforming upper plate in the Engadine section. In the west, the Ivrea mantle body increases the strength of the Adriatic upper plate, and Barrovian metamorphism weakens the <b>lower</b> <b>plate.</b> Therefore, along-strike transfer of shortening from one plate to the other appears to be a manifestation of along-strike changes in rheology deep in the crust...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{histories}} of mylonitic rocks from the footwall {{of the northern}} Snake Range decollement (NSRD), Nevada, were calculated using multiple diffusion domain analyses of potassium feldspar Arrhenius data and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age spectra in order to characterize the cooling (exhumation) history of these mylonitic rocks and thereby constrain the origin and movement history of the NSRD. The calculated thermal histories, along with reported apatite fission track ages, indicate the three following episodes of rapid cooling (10 – 55 °C/m. y.) related to extensional denudation: (1) middle Eocene (48 – 41 Ma), (2) late Oligocene (30 – 26 Ma), and (3) early Miocene (20 – 16 Ma). The first episode of rapid cooling {{may be related to}} the earliest period of normal faulting in east central Nevada and initiation of slip along the NSRD. The second episode signals a pulse of slip along the NSRD, and the third episode marks the cessation of <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> mylonitic deformation and the onset of the major pulse of uplift and rotation of <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> rocks from beneath the NSRD and/or younger east dipping normal faults. The thermal history data provide evidence for a temperature difference across the range within the same structural horizon; the northwestern flank of the range dropped below 300 °C by 46 Ma and reached 115 °C by 20 Ma, whereas <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> rocks in the eastern parts of the range were at temperatures above 300 °C until 19 Ma. If isotherms were subhorizontal, these relations suggest that either <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> units had an eastward dip prior to the onset of Tertiary mylonitic deformation or that layering dipped eastward as a result of top-to-the-east shear within an east dipping shear zone. Either case results in differential cooling (uplift) of <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> rocks from beneath the NSRD. A temperature-distance-age graph, constructed based upon the calculated thermal histories, shows differential uplift and rotation of moderately to steeply east dipping <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> units from beneath the NSRD. Furthermore, this reconstruction shows that the dip of <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> units increases and then decreases in time and space. This reconstruction implies that the NSRD initiated at moderate to steep angles that shallowed at depth, listric style, into a shallow dipping shear zone. These reconstructions provide a spectacular example of the rolling hinge/isostatic rebound model...|$|R

In THO, the tectonothermal {{evolution of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> involves (1) early thin-skinned thrusting and Harrovian metamorphism, (2) out-of-sequence thrusting and high-T metamorphism, and (3) fluid-localized reequilibration, anatexis, and leucogranite formation. The crustal evolution of the Indian <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> in HKTO involves (1) early subduction of continental crust to ultrahigh pressure (UHP) eclogite depths, (2) regional Barrovian metamorphism, and (3) widespread high-T metamorphism, anatexis, and leucogranite formation. The shallow depths of the high-T metamorphism in HKTO are consistent with early to mid-Miocene ductile flow of an Indian <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> midcrustal channel, from beneath the southern Tibetan Plateau to the Greater Himalaya. Melt weakening of the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> in THO is not observed at a similar scale {{probably due to the}} paucity of pelitic lithologies. Tectonothermal events in the upper plate of both orogens include precollisional accretion of crustal blocks, emplacement of Andean-type plutonic suites, and high-T metamorphism. Syncollisional to postcollisional events include emplacement of garnet-biotite-muscovite leucogranites, anatectic granites, and sporadic metamorphism (up to 90 Myr following the onset of collision in THO). Comparing the type and duration of tectonothermal events for THO and HKTO supports the notion of tectonic uniformitarianism for at least the later half of dated Earth history and highlights the complementary nature of the rock record in an older "exhumed" orogen compared to one undergoing present-day orogenesis.

40|$|Eclogites and blueschists {{exposed in}} Saih Hatat, Oman, record the {{subduction}} and exhumation of continental crustal material beneath the Cretaceous Semail Ophiolite during ophiolite obduction. The eclogite-bearing <b>lower</b> <b>plate,</b> originally part of Oman's distal continental margin, is exposed in two tectonic windows through the less metamorphosed upper plate by a previously mapped low angle, high strain, décollement structure.

40|$|International audienceAttempts {{to explore}} the {{dynamics}} of convergent boundaries are essentially based on the confrontation of the observed kinematics to the intrinsic dynamic properties of subduction zones. Which often mismatch. On {{the basis of the}} mantle flow model of Conrad and Behn (2010), I explore the role of the often neglected basal drag that the flowing mantle exerts underneath each plate. After computing the total torque underneath each plate, I find that (i) the net torque due to basal drag systematically drives plates away from their ridges and towards subduction zones, conformably to the plate circuit; (ii) compressive zones are found where the net drag forces from upper and <b>lower</b> <b>plates</b> are converging, and diverging for extensive zones; (iii) trench migration is dictated by the difference between the upper plate drag force and <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> drag force. In other words, trenches advance where upper plates pulls the subduction zones and the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> pushes it. These results indicate that differences in the dynamics of plate boundaries arise from the global mantle circulation more than the from the local properties of subduction zones. The often neglected drag force thus appears crucial to reconcile the kinematics and dynamics of subduction zones...|$|R

40|$|The tectonic {{evolution}} of a collisional hinterland sourcing the Haţeg Basin, a Late Cretaceous syn-orogenic sedimentary basin in the South Carpathians (Romania), is revealed through fission track thermochronology of detrital apatite and zircon grains. This basin formed on the upper plate (Getic unit) in response to Late Cretaceous collision with the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> (Danubian unit), an allochtonous continental block of the Moesian Platform, upon closure of a narrow oceanic basin (Severin Basin). The fission track results suggest that Turonian to lower Maastrichtian sediments of the Haţeg Basin have been dominantly derived from pre-Late Cretaceous sources. The age components they contain relate to pre-Cretaceous tectonothermal {{events such as the}} Variscan orogenic cycle, Jurassic rifting and Severin Basin formation, and to Early Cretaceous compressional tectonics. These results are compatible with the tectonic {{evolution of}} the upper plate that is identified as the primary source. From the onset of sedimentation (late Albian) until the early Campanian the Haţeg Basin resembles a piggy-back basin formed on the upper plate concomitant with underthrusting and internal stacking of the <b>lower</b> <b>plate.</b> In contrast, important tectonic subsidence during the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian reflects a shift to extensional tectonics causing the unroofing of the collision zone and the exhumation of <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> rocks back to the surface. Our fission track data place important constraints on the timing of <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> erosion that must have commenced during the late Maastrichtian, as documented by the completely reset Late Cretaceous age component within upper Maastrichtian sediments (Sinpetru Formation).
