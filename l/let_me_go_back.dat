6000|$|JOY. [Breathlessly.] Oh, Mother, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{home with}} you now at once---- MRS. GWYN. [Her face hardening.] Why? What on earth---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Reckon I 'ain't {{got much}} choice. Yes, I'll do it. But, Dale, are you goin' {{to take my}} word for thet an' <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Anson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} {{anything}} like it," [...] said our guest propitiatingly. [...] "And now, gentlemen, if you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Linghurst, I promise you you won't hear another word from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well! I {{came because}} I {{wanted to be}} useful, and if you won't <b>let</b> <b>me,</b> I'll <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> Then Jake {{and one of the}} boys would have to <b>go</b> down with <b>me</b> to the railroad. That would be awkward, wouldn't it?" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} your conference “Creativity and Innovation in Education: Fiji’s Future” for 2012 is {{critically}} important and one that reflects new thinking that needs to go into making future education policies in Fiji. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> briefly <b>go</b> <b>back</b> into history before I delve into the issue of creativity and innovation in education {{and what that means}} for the future of Fiji...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} is all this? What am I saying? What are you saying? Have you hypnotised me? Curse your uncanny blue eyes! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go.</b> Give <b>me</b> <b>back</b> my sense of humour. Give it me back--give it me back, I say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes. It was iniquitous. They {{corrupted}} him thoroughly, {{the poor}} old boy. Oh! why wouldn't he <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to him? But now I shall {{know how to}} grapple with this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now I {{have told}} you,' said the boy, 'will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{to my old}} man? If he has not stayed with that woman from Kulu, I am afraid he will die.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{interrupted}} him. [...] "I wish {{to speak}} to you, Mr. Mavering, and tell you that--I'm very tired, and I'm {{going back to the}} hotel. I must ask you to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you are Walsham!" [...] {{the young}} officer said. [...] "My name is Edwards. I {{am glad to}} meet you. We have been {{wondering}} when you would join us, and envying your luck, in seeing {{so much of the}} fighting out here. Our regiment is encamped about half a mile from here. If you will <b>let</b> <b>me,</b> I will <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with you, and introduce you to our fellows." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{over some}} of these {{thirteen}} points, and present {{them as if they}} formed a chain of causal relationships, starting with the Mandarin syllabary. (i) Mandarin has rather few distinct syllables: less than most other modern forms of Chinese, and considerably less than at earlier stages in its own evolution. (ii) “Because” there are fewer distinct syllables, words have got longer – if there are fewer distinct morphemes, you need more of them (there is syntagmatic compensation for paradigmatic constraint). We know from a study cited by Y.R. Chao (1972) that there is a consistent correlation whereby, given a particular passage of text rendered in different dialects, the fewer the number of distinct syllables in the dialect, the longer the version of the text. (iii) “Because” {{there is a great deal}} of homonymy among diffrerent morphemes, compound nouns tend to be formed on a strictly taxonomic principle: they are congruent rather than metaphoric (it takes more energy to decode metaphoric compounds).|$|R
60|$|With these supernatural {{moonlight}} nights I {{finish the}} story of that dark time, albeit the darkness had not yet gone; to have recalled it and related it briefly as I could once in my life is enough. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the simile of the lost wretch struggling for life in the mangrove swamp. The first sense of having set my foot on a firmer place in that slough of fetid slime, of a wholesome breath of air blown to me from outside {{the shadow of the}} black abhorred forest, was when I began to experience intervals of relief from physical pain, when these grew more and more frequent and would extend to entire days, then to weeks, and for a time I would become oblivious of my precarious state. I was still {{and for a long time}} subject to attacks, when the pain was intolerable and was like steel driven into my heart, always followed by violent palpitations, which would last for hours. But I found that exercise on foot or horseback made me no worse, and I became more and more venturesome, spending most of my time out of doors, although often troubled with the thought that my passion for Nature was a hindrance to me, a turning aside from the difficult way I had been striving to keep.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right," [...] he said, [...] "and I'm wrong, as usual. I'm {{wasting time}} and {{distressing}} you to no purpose. What folly {{to ask you}} to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back!</b> Suppose you had said yes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, any way,' said Mary, 'either he will {{be given}} back, or {{he will be}} saved this. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to him, please.' Then at the door, putting {{her hand to her}} head--'Who is here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet you {{understand}} nothing. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to what passed {{a few weeks}} ago, and I will make it all clear to you. Believe me that what I say is the absolute and exact truth.|$|E
50|$|Where my fathers repose. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go,</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go.</b>|$|R
50|$|To my father, the chief, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go,</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{the bosom}} it loves. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go,</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go.</b>|$|R
60|$|If I {{have not}} made this plain enough to any of you, my friends, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the simple, {{practical}} explanation of it which God Himself has given us in those two words--father and child.|$|E
6000|$|And Pau Amma said, 'I am ashamed! Give me back my hard {{shell and}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Pusat Tasek, and I will only stir out {{once a day}} and once a night to get my food.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} only prevail on him to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Limmeridge {{for a little while}} and stay there quietly with you, Marian, I could be almost as happy again as I was before I was married!" ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the sight}} of the child. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go,</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{my home in}} the woods, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go,</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go.</b>|$|R
60|$|THE FEMALE FIGURE [wrestling with Pygmalion] <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go,</b> {{will you}} [she bites his hand].|$|R
6000|$|... 'I didn't {{think of}} that;' {{and she stood}} up, and unfastened her hooks. 'Perhaps Dr. May would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> now!' as a {{mountain}} of mohair and scarlet petticoat remained on the floor, upborne by an over-grown steel mouse-trap.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh,' {{said the}} Priest, 'if {{you are an}} angel from heaven do let me out and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to earth again, for no place was ever so bad as this--the little fiends nip me so with their tongs.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would like}} to know, Allan," [...] he said, [...] "that I shall not bring an aching heart with me to your wedding day? If you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{for a moment to}} the past, I think I can satisfy you." ...|$|E

It was recorded in Bloomington, Indiana at The Projects by Jim Zespy during July 2004. The record was released on August 22, 2006, on Secretly Canadian Records.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, if it's shopping, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> do it!" [...] cried Mrs. Wragge. [...] "She's {{going out}} to buy her Things! Oh, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> with her--please <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> with her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Creech, I'm {{afraid he}} won't. You'd better give me up. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> I'll never tell. I don't blame you. I think you're square. My dad is.... But, oh, don't make ME suffer! You used to--to care for me, when I was little." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to my recital of {{what passed}} between us three. A strange {{lethargic}} calm {{seemed to have}} fallen upon Paul. He turned to me without even a single trace of the passion which had lit up his face a few moments before.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Dr. May {{has been}} so kind and so patient with me, I shall never forget it. Even when I scalded his fingers with {{bringing}} him that boiling water--but I always do wrong when he is there--and now he won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Leonard.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{face was}} {{suddenly}} full of nervous terror. [...] "Hush! hush!" [...] she cried. [...] "He will hear you! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go</b> now! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>go,</b> I beseech you!" ...|$|R
