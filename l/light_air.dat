5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very <b>light.</b> <b>Air</b> sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead needles and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to <b>light,</b> <b>air,</b> and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E
5|$|The player's primary {{weapon is}} a ghostly {{version of the}} Soul Reaver sword, {{referred}} to as the wraith-blade. The wraith-blade is symbiotically bound to Raziel, and can be summoned or dismissed {{at any time in the}} material world, but, if overused, the sword can turn against Raziel, siphoning his health. Other weapons include claws, swords and spears. As the game progresses, the player encounters magical forges which imbue the wraith-blade with elemental powers associated with darkness, <b>light,</b> <b>air,</b> and fire. These enhancements have various uses, but are only available in the material realm. If Raziel shifts, he loses his active elemental imbuement, and must re-forge the blade at locations scattered throughout the game world.|$|E

5|$|At first <b>light</b> <b>Air</b> America {{helicopters}} {{hovered over}} Lima Site 85 {{to start the}} evacuation, which was covered by USAF A-1 Skyraiders. Immediately, Hmong soldiers and their CIA commanders rushed the TACAN site and shouted to the U.S. technicians that help was coming. In response, the North Vietnamese Special Forces organized a defense around the TACAN site, and hid their dead and wounded comrades under the large rocks which dotted Phou Pha Thi. While U.S. fighter-bombers strafed the TACAN site, the Air America helicopter landed on the airstrip and they picked up two CIA officers, one forward air-controller, and five technicians who hid during the firefight. Later in the day, Air America was able to recover or account for eight of the dead U.S. personnel on Lima Site 85, along {{with a number of}} wounded Hmong soldiers. By midday, Lima Site 85 was fully controlled by the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion, and they held the facility until 14March when they withdrew from the area.|$|E

25|$|Infrastructure and {{services}} brought residents. Some of the 500,000 people {{who moved to}} the borough in the 1920s lived in the Concourse. The new construction to accommodate those residents was inspired by the City Beautiful movement and the 1901 Tenement House Act, which mandated <b>light,</b> <b>air,</b> and fire protection. This yielded 5- and 6- story multifamily residential buildings throughout the neighborhood built in a variety of styles from Tudor, Renaissance, and Colonial Revival to Art Deco and Art Moderne.|$|E

These facilities were overcrowded and generally intended for short-term pretrial detention; in practice {{they were often}} used for lengthy stays. Detention center authorities often arbitrarily beat or tortured detainees. These facilities usually had no toilets, mattresses, or medical care, and detainees often received insufficient amounts of <b>light,</b> <b>air,</b> and water. The centers generally operated without dedicated funding and with minimal regulation or oversight. Detention center authorities or influential individuals frequently barred visitors or severely mistreated detainees. Guards frequently extorted bribes from family members and NGOs to visit detainees or provide food and other necessities.|$|E

The LAS contract {{was developed by the}} Pentagon to supply Afghanistan’s military with 20 planes, which should ensure air superiority in the country after the majority of US forces leave. Because the contract is a foreign military sale, Nevada-based SNC and Brazil-based Embraer deliver the planes to the Air Force, which then passes them on to the Afghan military. The first of 20 A-29 Super Tucano aircraft arrived at Moody Air Force Base on September 26, 2014 in preparation for the Afghanistan pilot and maintenance training mission.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{civil and}} {{military}} intelligence had, amongst them, good information suggesting additional Japanese aggression {{throughout the summer}} and fall before the attack. At the time, no reports specifically indicated an attack against Pearl Harbor. Public press reports during summer and fall, including Hawaiian newspapers, contained extensive reports on the growing tension in the Pacific. Late in November, all Pacific commands, including both the Navy and Army in Hawaii, were separately and explicitly warned war with Japan was expected in the very near future, and it was preferred Japan make the first hostile act. It was felt war would most probably start with attacks in the Far East: the Philippines, Indochina, Thailand, or the Russian Far East; Pearl Harbor was never mentioned as a potential target. The warnings were not specific to any area, noting only that war with Japan was expected in the near future and all commands should act accordingly. Had any of these warnings produced an active alert status in Hawaii, the attack might have been resisted more effectively, and perhaps resulted in less death and damage. On the other hand, recall of men on shore leave to the ships in harbor might have led to still more being casualties from bombs and torpedoes, or trapped in capsized ships by shut watertight doors (as the attack alert status would have required), or killed (in their obsolete aircraft) by more experienced Japanese aviators. When the attack actually arrived, Pearl Harbor was effectively unprepared: anti-aircraft weapons not manned, most ammunition locked down, anti-submarine measures not implemented (e.g., no torpedo nets in the harbor), combat air patrol not flying, available scouting aircraft not in the air at first <b>light,</b> <b>Air</b> Corps aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip to reduce sabotage risks (not ready to fly at a moment's warning), and so on.|$|E
500|$|Michigan Avenue {{is named}} after Lake Michigan, which it once ran {{alongside}} at 100 east in the city's street numbering system until land reclamation for Grant Park (then Lake Park) pushed the shoreline east. [...] The one-sided street feature is {{due in large part}} to the legal battles of Aaron Montgomery Ward with the city over cleaning up the park and removing most of the structures in it. [...] Ward opposed the development of Grant Park with public buildings along the lakefront except for the Art Institute of Chicago Building. [...] Eventually, Ward's ideas were adopted by Daniel Burnham in his Plan of Chicago, which called for [...] "insured <b>light,</b> <b>air,</b> and an agreeable outlook" [...] along the Grant Park street frontage. [...] The preservation of the lakefront view has inspired architects to create an architectural cornucopia of designs along the [...] "streetwall".|$|E

40|$|One {{effort to}} {{increase}} comfort and freshness {{in the household}} is to optimize the <b>lighting</b> and <b>air</b> circulation for either natural or artificial. <b>Lighting</b> and <b>air</b> conditioning {{is a very important}} element of the work in the occupation of the building because many disciplines are involved there, namely architectural, electrical and mechanical. To construct a house to live is not necessarily all components of the planners involved because a smaller scope of work.

In this manuscript is introduced a simple concept of <b>lighting</b> design and <b>air</b> conditioning.
