40|$|This {{essay is}} based on a reading of a {{selection}} of texts that have been published around the tenth anniversary of South Africa’s much celebrated democratic election of 1994, though not necessarily for that purpose. It focuses mainly on political commentaries which have appeared since 2002 in various anthologies, journal articles, magazines and newspapers {{at a time when the}} excitement and euphoria had died down and the African National Congress (ANC) government faced an assessment of its first two terms in power, and growing problems during its third. South Africans across the board have begun to take stock of the progress (or lack of it) made in the country since the transition to majority rule. Between 2005 and 2008 journalists, sociologists, economists, political scientists and others, including rank-and-file members of the governing Alliance partners (ANC, South African Communist Party [SACP] and the Congress of South African Trade Unions [COSATU]), have taken a strident tone. The essay also visits central features of current politics in South Africa, discussing media and other reaction to Jacob Zuma’s powerful political claim to the presidency, his cultivation of the image of popular champion of the oppressed and his capitalization on growing resentment against Thabo Mbeki’s authoritarian ‘top-down’ style of governance. It examines the increasingly negative interpretations of the ANC government’s performance in key areas, especially health, <b>land</b> policy, <b>restitution</b> for apartheid human rights’ abuses recorded by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), and the economy.

40|$|Restitution {{has to be}} made in {{a highly}} {{political}} environment, making the planning and design of restitution programmes in rural, peri-urban and urban areas extremely complex. The development of governance structures for restitution programmes is influenced by policy instruments that have to consider taxation effects and their impact on economic behaviour, as well as predict outcomes that transcend the objective functions. The complexity is exacerbated by limited scientific evidence and the absence of evidence-based policy-making, culminating in policy neglect and inadequate service delivery outcomes for <b>land</b> reform and <b>restitution.</b> The article explores progress made with the implementation of the Nkumbuleni Land Claim (Kwa-Zulu Natal) and examines what prevents the restitution support programme from implementing its policy objectives (guided by the <b>Restitution</b> of <b>Lands</b> Rights Act, Act 22 of 1994). The authors conclude that the attainment of sustainable outcomes in post-settlement restitution support continues to be a challenge to policy-makers, as claims remain unsustainable. Poor communication between stakeholders, the narrow role municipalities play in restitution and conflicting governance structures between “traditional councils versus municipal councils” are seen as the main drivers of programme failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of the paper is a {{description}} of the unique valuation research exercise currently being undertaken in South Africa to reopen the issue of compensation paid by the state in it's land acquisition/redistribution programme of 30 to 40 years ago and revolves around the effects of the infamous Group Areas Act. Following the recent change of government in South Africa and the move to a new political dispensation, constitutional changes have provided for a measure of relief by way of <b>land,</b> or equivalent <b>restitution,</b> to those dispossessed of interests in property in pursuance of the previous government's racial policies. The provisions for this are embodied in the <b>Restitution</b> of <b>Land</b> Rights Act (22 of 1994).

[...] Restitution involves giving compensation to land lost to whites due to apartheid, racism, and discrimination. [...] Land tenure reform strives to provide more secure access to land. [...] Several laws have been enacted to facilitate redistribution, <b>restitution,</b> and <b>land</b> tenure reform.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{has been made}} to {{identify}} dominant forms and factors for land supply in Bulgarian farms. The New Institutional and Transaction Costs Economics framework is adapted to transitional agrarian economy. Institutional, behavioral, and transaction costs factors for evolution and sustainability of different forms of subsistent, cooperative, and commercial land supply in Bulgaria have been analyzed. Comparative efficiency of various forms for land supply in market-oriented farms of different type (unregistered, cooperatives, agro-firms) and sizes (small, middle, large) has been estimated. The study is based on original microeconomics data collected through interviews with managers of 0. 5 % of commercial farms in the country. First of all, a general characteristics and development of different kind of farms in Bulgaria has been presented. That analysis comprises: the kind of new commercial farms; the type of transactions under their management; the pace of evolution of market oriented farms; and factors for emergence of large-scale subsistent farming. Institutional and transaction costs origin of existing forms of farming has been underlined. Secondly, an analysis is made on major modes for land supply in commercial farms. It includes: the type of land supply (e. g. own land, leased land, cultivation in groups); modes of acquisition of <b>land</b> ownership (<b>restitution,</b> privatization, purchase); extend of lease-in contracts; forms for reduction of land “supply” (sell off and lease-out land). Dominating modes of land supply are found to relate to critical dimensions and costs of transacting. Thirdly, an analysis of the transaction costs in land supply has been made. In encompasses: the specific features of land supply contracts; the type of rent; extend of a third-party involvement in land transactions; and problems in land supply deals. Preferred contract forms depend on attributes of transactions and aim at protecting and minimizing costs of land deals. Finally, factors for enlargement of Bulgarian farms have been specified. It is proved that the reduction of land supply and the expansion of size of commercial farms, both have been determined by the transaction costs reasons. Presently, the high marketing, credit supply, and contract enforcement costs are the major factors restricting farms enlargement. A good part of cooperatives and middle-size farms also spend significant “time and efforts for finding partners selling or leasing-out land” On the other hand, the most important factors for farm development in the future relates to improvement of the institutional environment, and managerial experience of farm entrepreneurs. According to the farm managers there are no specific factors related to land supply which could impede farm development in the country. governing of land supply, New Institutional and Transaction Costs Economics, transitional farm organization...|$|R

Accordingly, sixteen years into the restitution process the statistics are rather disappointing. <b>Restitution</b> of <b>land</b> as a land reform mechanism is a unique temporal process that involves various role players. This contribution focuses on the role that the Land Claims Court has to play within the context of “good governance”. In this regard the legislative and policy frameworks within which <b>restitution</b> and the <b>Land</b> Claims Court operate, are first set out after which the unique characteristics of the restitution programme are highlighted. Although the main function of the Land Claims Court is to grapple with and adjudicate on legal issues, it also has a role to play in effecting good governance. This may be done by its involvement in the legal process leading up to the finalization of claims by issuing directives, acting as a review forum and by removing <b>land</b> from the <b>restitution</b> process under section 34 of the Restitution Act. However, a more pro-active role may be played by the Court by its involvement in deciding the exact form of restitution or restoration in a particular case. In this regard the Court can find that restitution has to be conditional and that certain requirements have to be met in order for the process to be effective and successful. With reference to Baphiring Community v Uys and Others (Case number LCC 64 / 1998) it is clear that a pro-active approach would require the Court to engage in difficult, often conflicting, issues and to embark on in-depth investigations and analyses where necessary...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{programmes}} {{for rural}} land reform and redistribution around the world, inequitable land distribution and rural poverty remain profound {{in much of}} the rural South. This paper suggests a new approach to land reform and rural development. “Rural territorial development” (RTD) is based on and encourages shared territorial identity (distinctive productive,historical, cultural and environmental features) amongst different stakeholders and socialgroupings. It builds on the fact that rural people’s livelihood strategies are complex and often mostly non-agricultural in nature. It works by (1) promoting collaboration between different sectoral agencies, levels and administrative units of government, and with civil society and private sector actors, within distinctive geographical spaces; and (2) creating new, inclusive multi-stakeholder fora for participatory development planning and implementation at the meso scale—working across groupings of local municipalities, which are often too small on their own to drive economic development. The paper presents case studies of RTD approaches in Brazil and South Africa. It finds that a territorial approach to land reform could potentially: • Strengthen land reform groups over wider areas by creating platforms to secure institutional support, improve productivity, tackle collective marketing needs, and negotiate with private sector interests. • Support a more integrated approach to diverse and overlapping issues of tenure security, access to seasonal pasture, indigenous rights, <b>land</b> expropriation and <b>restitution,</b> and market based land access. • Improve co-ordination among and more responsive prioritisation by state agencies. • Improve service delivery and agricultural support to land reform communities, with better prioritisation of scarce resources for social and physical infrastructure. • Create shared platforms whereby diverse social groups can debate and agree on visions and practical priorities to help steer government interventions. The Brazilian and South African experiences are at a very early stage; a variety of institutional and political problems still remain. Despite its potential, RTD is no magic bullet. The main lessons identified by the studies include that: • Follow-up development and agricultural support is needed, delivered within a more integrated, decentralised approach involving government agencies, social movements and other rural development actors. • Investing in new territorial institutional frameworks and processes can help reconcile divergent interests. New territorial institutions are needed, with legal powers and capacity to manage delivery of strategic development projects on the ground. • A genuinely enabling national policy framework for RTD will overcome weak participation by parochial local municipalities, the private sector and sectoral, top-down government agencies...|$|R
