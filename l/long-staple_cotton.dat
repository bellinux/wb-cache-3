25|$|<b>Long-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> {{had been}} invented in Cairo in the 1820s, {{becoming}} {{a staple of}} the Egyptian economy in the 19th and 20th Centuries. Cotton production used 2.1 million acres for cultivation after the Second World War and by the 1980s represented the second largest export in Egypt, after crude oil. Cotton production in Egypt nevertheless declined after its post-WWII peak as arable land was converted to cereal or clover production, and previous importers including India achieved cotton self-sufficiency.|$|E
25|$|The South {{developed}} an agricultural economy dependent on commodity crops. Its planters rapidly acquired {{a significantly higher}} number and proportion of slaves in the population overall, as its commodity crops were labor-intensive. Early on, enslaved people in the South worked primarily in agriculture, on farms and plantations growing indigo, rice, and tobacco; cotton did not become a major crop until after the American Revolution and after the 1790s. Before then <b>long-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> was cultivated primarily on the Sea Islands of Georgia and South Carolina.|$|E
50|$|The American Revolution brought divided loyalties to the lowcountry. Daufuskie {{received}} the nickname “little Bermuda” during the Revolution {{due to the}} resident’s loyalist sentiments. After the Revolution, Daufuskie thrived {{with the introduction of}} world famous sea island cotton, a variety prized by European mills. High quality, sea island cotton exceeded all other <b>long-staple</b> <b>cottons</b> in fiber length, as well as fineness and strength. It was during this period of strong economic growth that several large plantation mansions were constructed.|$|R
60|$|The seed of the <b>long-stapled</b> <b>cotton,</b> now {{cultivated}} in America, was sent there in 1786 from the Bahama Islands, {{by some of}} the royalist refugees, who had settled there. The inferior short-stapled cotton had been previously cultivated for domestic purposes. The seeds of every other variety have been tried without success. The kind now grown was first introduced into Georgia. Thus to the refugees America owes as much of her prosperity as is due to the cotton-crops, and much of whatever harm is to result from slavery.|$|R
500|$|Cotton {{produced}} {{within the}} country is of medium staple. Hence long staple cotton is imported to produce quality fabrics for export. Medium staple cotton, also called standard medium-staple cotton is American Upland type with staple length varying from about [...] <b>Long-staple</b> <b>cottons</b> have relatively longer fibre, are expensive and used mostly to make fine fabrics, yarns, and hosiery. The country's economic development is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector, and this has given a principal status to cotton in the country. Apart from use in textiles {{in the form of}} cotton lint, yarn, thread, cloth, and garments, its seeds are used for oil extraction.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} decades, the colony {{cultivated}} cotton on plantations {{of the sea}} islands and Low Country, along with rice, indigo and some tobacco as commodity crops, all worked by African slaves, most from West Africa. In the 19th century, invention of the cotton gin enabled profitable processing of short-staple cotton, which grew better in the Piedmont than did <b>long-staple</b> <b>cotton.</b> The hilly upland areas, where landowners were generally subsistence farmers with few slaves, were much poorer; a regional conflict between the coastal and inland areas developed in the political system, long dominated by the Low Country planters. With outspoken leaders such as John C. Calhoun, the state vied with Virginia as the dominant political and social force in the South. It fought federal tariffs in the 1830s and demanded that its rights to practice slavery be recognized in newly established territories. With the 1860 election of Republicans under Abraham Lincoln, who vowed to prevent slavery's expansion, the voters demanded secession. In December 1860, the state seceded from the Union; in February 1861, it joined the new Confederate States of America.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1700–70 era, {{the colony}} possessed many {{advantages}} - entrepreneurial planters and businessmen, a major harbor, {{the expansion of}} cost-efficient African slave labor, and an attractive physical environment, with rich soil and a long growing season, albeit with endemic malaria. Planters established rice and indigo as commodity crops, based in developing large plantations, with <b>long-staple</b> <b>cotton</b> grown on the sea islands. As the demand for labor increased, planters imported increasing numbers of African slaves. [...] The slave population grew as they had children. [...] These children were also regarded as slaves as they grew up, as South Carolina used Virginia's model of declaring all children born to slave mothers as slaves, regardless of the race or nationality of the father. So the majority of slaves in the colony came to be native-born. This {{became one of the}} wealthiest of the British colonies. Rich colonials became avid consumers of services from outside the colony, such as mercantile services, medical education, and legal training in England. Almost everyone in 18th-century South Carolina felt the pressures, constraints, and opportunities associated with the growing importance of trade.|$|E
60|$|The Tobes and sashes of Harar are {{considered}} {{equal to the}} celebrated cloths of Shoa: hand-woven, they as far surpass, in beauty and durability, the vapid produce of European manufactories, as the perfect hand of man excels the finest machinery. On the windward coast, one of these garments is considered a handsome present for a chief. The Harari Tobe consists of a double length of eleven cubits by two in breadth, with a border of bright scarlet, and the average value of a good article, even in the city, is eight dollars. They are made of the fine <b>long-stapled</b> <b>cotton,</b> which grows plentifully upon these hills, and are soft as silk, whilst their warmth admirably adapts them for winter wear. The thread is spun by women with two wooden pins: the loom is worked by both sexes.|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, new {{businesses}} in Statesboro included stores and banks built along the town's four major streets, each named Main.

Sales of cotton bales in Statesboro outnumbered those sold in Savannah by a 10:1 ratio.|$|R
50|$|General Pinckney was a {{commander}} during the Revolutionary War, a signer of the United States Constitution, and, in 1804 and 1808, {{a presidential candidate}} for the Federalist Party. After he inherited the islands from his father, Pinckney was an absentee landowner until 1804, {{when he moved to}} the island and began managing the property. The Pinckney family developed the islands into a plantation, removing much of the maritime forest and draining and tilling the fertile soil. By 1818, over 200 slaves labored to produce fine quality <b>long-staple</b> Sea Island <b>Cotton</b> on 297 acre; 386 slaves lived on the island by 1840.|$|R

50|$|The first {{tracts of}} land, called plantations, were granted on Edisto Island before 1700.

Cotton gradually became the principal crop, {{and after the}} American Revolution, Edisto Island planters became wealthy and famous from their production of <b>long-staple</b> Sea Island <b>cotton.</b> The labor done by hundreds of enslaved Africans who developed the creole Gullah language and culture on the islands and in the Lowcountry, distinctive for its African traditions.|$|R
5000|$|In 1943, after {{extensive}} {{testing in}} the swamplands and jungles of Florida and Panama, the U.S. Army determined that an experimental tropical uniform made of Byrd Cloth (known in Britain as Grenfell Cloth), would best protect soldiers from insects and disease while cooling the body and minimizing losses from perspiration. [...] Byrd Cloth, as used in the Experimental Tropical Uniform, was a single-layer uniform of untreated OD <b>long-staple</b> Egyptian <b>cotton,</b> made in a tightly woven herringbone twill to prevent mosquito bites. In use, the uniform was intended to cool the wearer even when continuously wetted, {{as might be expected}} in a humid, rainy jungle environment. [...] The uniform featured a short-tailed shirt, trousers with cuffs fitted with half-inch boottop fastening tapes, and a flap-protected fly to keep out crawling insects such as leeches, ticks, and chiggers. [...] Pockets were shallow and kept to a minimum to increase cooling; users carried all their gear in load-bearing belts, suspenders, or in low-mounted field packs designed to minimize body contact (jungle packs). The uniform, always in short supply because of a shortage of Byrd Cloth, was used in combat by members of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the Mars Task Force (Army 5332nd Brigade-Provisional) in Burma.|$|R

40|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century American cotton-producing areas rapidly {{expanded}} beyond the 2 ̆ 2 Old South 2 ̆ 2 cotton belt, an area extending from Virginia to East Texas. By the 1920 s farmers had plowed fields and established new cotton centers in western Oklahoma, the High Plains of Texas, and among the large irrigated farms of California, Arizona, and New Mexico. By the 1940 s the dominant areas of American cotton production were California and West Texas.;While historians have examined many aspects of cotton production in the South, the same cannot be said of the western cotton belt. This study profiles the newer cotton farming areas from Central Texas to California and their evolutionary development into the 2 ̆ 2 Cotton West. 2 ̆ 2;Several conditions influenced the establishment and expansion of the Cotton West. Water and irrigation were key ingredients. New settlers in many areas produced relatively little until the federal government built a major irrigation system through the reclamation program; other farmers depended on underground water to sustain their crops.;Central players {{in the development of the}} western cotton industry were the researchers and scientists of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and their partners in state land-grant colleges and agricultural experiment stations. The USDA was particularly eager to establish a new cotton industry in the West [...] -one that would supplement instead of duplicate that of the South. Researchers sought and improved varieties of <b>long-staple</b> and Acala <b>cottons,</b> which they bred to suit each region of the Cotton West.;With appropriate varieties of cotton available to farmers, the march toward mechanization became the next important area of study for farmers and researchers alike. Changes in technology and the available labor force were constant challenges for western cotton producers needing seasonal, sometimes migratory, labor at particular times of the year. Federal immigration policy affected which ethnic groups were available. The shift to mechanical harvesting after World War II marked a significant step toward completing mechanization and shifting the labor needs for cotton growing. Once the Cotton West became well established, the contrasts between the West and the South began to disappear...|$|R

50|$|Production of {{short-staple}} in the Deep South soon superseded <b>long-staple</b> <b>cotton,</b> grown {{primarily on}} the Sea Islands and in the Low Country.
