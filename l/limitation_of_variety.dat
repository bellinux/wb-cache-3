60|$|Values of the Weights.--After preparatory trials, I adopted 1000 grains as {{the value}} of W and 1020 as that of R, but I am now {{inclined}} to think that 1010 would have been better. I made the weights by filling blank cartridges with shot, wool, and wads, so as to distribute the weight equally, and I closed the cartridges with a wad, turning the edges over it with the instrument well known to sportsmen. I wrote the corresponding value of the index of R on the wad by which each of them was closed, {{to serve as a}} register number. Thus the cartridge whose weight was WR4 was marked 4'. The values were so selected that there should be as few varieties as possible. There are thirty weights in all, but only ten varieties, whose Register Numbers are respectively 0, 1, 2, 3, 3-1/2, 4-1/2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12. The reason <b>of</b> this <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> was to enable the weights to be interchanged whenever there became reason to suspect that the eye had begun to recognise the appearance of any one of them, and that the judgment might be influenced by that recognition, and cease to be wholly guided by the sense of weight.|$|R

We argue that the Kongish phenomenon is interesting for two main reasons: first it reveals certain aspects of language use under conditions of late modernity, including computer mediation, the relationship between language and identity, and the presence of a dynamic multilingual language ecology.

40|$|Accurate power {{characterization}} {{is important}} in computing platforms for several reasons ranging from poweraware adaptation to power provisioning. Power characterization is typically obtained through either direct measurements enabled by physical instrumentation or modeling based on hardware performance counters. We show, however, that linear-regression based modeling techniques commonly used in the literature work well only in restricted settings. These techniques frequently exhibit high prediction error in modern computing platforms due to inherent complexities such as multiple cores, hidden device states, and large dynamic power components. Using a comprehensive measurement framework and an extensive set of benchmarks, we consider several more advanced modeling techniques and observe limited improvement. Our quantitative demonstration <b>of</b> the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> modeling techniques highlights the challenges posed by rising hardware complexity and variability and, thus, motivates the need for increased direct measurement of power consumption. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Space and {{airborne}} sensors {{have been}} used to map area burned, assess characteristics of active fires, and characterize post-fire ecological effects. Confusion about fire intensity, fire severity, burn severity, and related terms can result in the potential misuse of the inferred information by land managers and remote sensing practitioners who require unambiguous remote sensing products for fire management. The objective of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive review of current and potential remote sensing methods used to assess fire behavior and effects and ecological responses to fire. We clarify the terminology to facilitate development and interpretation of comprehensible and defensible remote sensing products, present the potential and <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> approaches for remotely measuring active fires and their post-fire ecological effects, and discuss challenges and future directions of fire-related remote sensing research...|$|R

40|$|A {{plethora of}} genetic {{abnormalities}} {{has been described}} in B-cell lymphomas, some of which arise when physiologic mechanisms involved in the generation of immunologic diversity go awry. Several different lymphoma types, such as follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and Burkitt lymphoma (BL), are associated with hallmark translocations that occur {{as a consequence of}} these errors (t(14; 18) (q 32;q 21), t(11; 14) (q 13;q 32), and t(8; 14) (q 24;q 32), respectively); however, none of these associations is absolute and none is completely diagnostically specific or sensitive.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} OptIC {{project is}} to {{comparatively}} evaluate several parameter estimation and data assimilation methods for the task of determining parameters in biogeochemical models from multiple sources of noisy data. Particular foci are (1) ability to handle data inadequacies such as noise, correlations and gaps; (2) ways to optimise the model-data synthesis process {{in the absence of}} good error specifications for the data; and (3) ways to handle multiple data sources with quite different properties. The intention of OptIC is to focus specifically on the intercomparison of model-data synthesis methods, rather than biogeochemical models or data sources. This is the reason for the use of a transparently simple test model which embodies only the essential features of a real biogeochemical model, and artificially generated data for which "true " parameters are known. The anticipated outcomes of OptIC are • Better understanding of the strengths and <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> model-data synthesis methods, especially with regard to handling noisy and incomplete data; • Iterative improvement of methods by systematically tackling a sequence of progressively more challenging problems in terms of data inadequacies...|$|R
40|$|Procedures are {{described}} {{for evaluation of}} the thin-layer and gas chromatographic properties of new raw material drug substances over {{a broad spectrum of}} conditions. Chromato-graphic profiles are established for each drug, and these are used as starting points for analytical procedures for the drug, its synthetic precursors, and its degradation products. Thin-layer chromatography is performed initially by use of three adsorbents and a series of six solvents. Gas chromatography is performed initially by temperature programming on a series of six different columns, followed by isothermal experiments. Evaluation of resulting chromatograms from both techniques determines whether more experiments are necessary or whether an analytical method can be developed based directly on one {{of the results of the}} initial screening. qualitative and quantitative analysis is, when properly applied, excellent. With the explosive advances lately in GC applica-tions, a formidable array of stationary phase-solid support combinations has appeared.

40|$|Background: Data {{of quality}} {{are needed to}} {{identify}} ethnic disparities in health and healthcare and {{to meet the challenges}} in governance of race relations. Yet concerns over completeness, accuracy and timeliness have been long-standing and inhibitive with respect to the analytical use of the data. Aims: To identify incompleteness of ethnicity data across routine health and healthcare datasets and to investigate the utility of analytical strategies for using data that is of suboptimal quality. Methods: An analysis by government office regions of ethnicity data incompleteness in routine datasets and a comprehensive review and evaluation of the literature on appropriate analytical strategies to address the use of such data. Results: There is only limited availability of ethnically coded routine datasets on health and healthcare, with substantial variability in valid ethnic coding: although a few have high levels of completeness, the majority are poor (notably hospital episode statistics, drug treatment data and non-medical workforce). In addition, there is also a more than twofold regional difference in quality. Organisational factors seem to be the main contributor to the differentials, and these are amenable-yet, in practice, difficult-to change. This article discusses the strengths and <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> analytical strategies for using data of suboptimal quality and explores how they may answer important unresolved questions in relation to ethnic inequalities. Conclusions: Only by using the data, even when of suboptimal quality, and remaining close to it can healthcare organisations drive up quality. ...|$|R
40|$|Selected {{results from}} {{experiments}} conducted {{over the past}} several years involving simultaneous multiscalar point measurements in turbulent nonpremixed flames are reviewed in this paper. In these experiments, spontaneous Raman scattering and Rayleigh scattering measurements of the major species and temperature were combined with laser-induced fluorescence measurements of minor species. The most important feature of these experiments is that they provide detailed data on the instantaneous relationships among species concentration, temperature, and derived scalar quantities that reflect the state of mixing or the progress of reaction. The data allow quantitative comparisons of the thermochemical states in turbulent flames with those in idealized representations, such as steady strained laminar flames, perfectly stirred reactors, or adiabatic equilibrium. The data may also be compared with results (measured or calculated) from unsteady laminar flames and from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent reacting flows. such comparisons provide insights into the fundamental nature of turbulence-chemistry interactions, and they allow one to examine the validity of some of the basic assumptions that turbulent combustion models are built upon.

The earliest conceptual developments have embedded the responsibility of humans to regulate within limits into sustainability understanding; therefore, they have repeatedly highlighted the need for better governance. In addition to explicit discussions on sustainable governance (Adger and Jordan 2009; Jäger 2009), there are also other significant branches such as global governance (Lövbrand et al. 2009), governing commons (Ostrom 1990, 2007, 2010), adaptive governance (Folke et al. 2005), and reflexive and path-dependent governance (Voß and Kemp 2006; Leach et al. 2010).
