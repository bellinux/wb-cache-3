40|$|Abstract— Direct drive systems, {{including}} <b>lift,</b> <b>hoist,</b> winch and crane, yield lower cost, reduced {{spaces and}} negligible maintenance. The {{requirement of the}} lifting application is a motor with high torque and low speed, so that the direct drive motor {{seems to be a}} suitable solution. By means of a direct drive system, there is the possibility to eliminate the elevator room. The paper includes an analytical approach to the design, a comparison with the ﬁnite element analysis and a test on a ﬁnal realization of this kind of motor...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of the utilization of cranes in construction operations {{has resulted in the}} development of structured methods for crane selection. Most of these methods are for crane model selection and require the user to stipulate the type of crane to be used for the construction operation under consideration. Availability of a structured method for crane type selection will greatly benefit the overall crane selection process. This paper describes a prototype integrated crane selection tool, called IntelliCranes, designed to assist in both crane type and crane model selection. The key feature of IntelliCranes is the systematic incorporation of subjective and qualitative criteria in crane type and model selection.

40|$|Operational or {{remediation}} activities {{associated with}} existing underground high-level waste storage tank structures at the Hanford Site often require the installation/removal of various equipment items. To gain tank access for installation or removal of this equipment, large concrete cover blocks {{must be removed}} and reinstalled in existing concrete pits above the tanks. An accidental drop of the equipment or cover blocks while being moved over the tanks that results in the release of contaminants to the air poses a potential risk to onsite workers or to the offsite public. To minimize this potential risk, the use of critical <b>lift</b> <b>hoisting</b> and rigging procedures and restrictions on lift height are being considered during development of the new tank farm Basis for Interim Operation and Final Safety Analysis Report.

The purpose of this project is to design a systemthat would enable the managers and employees of construction companies to efficiently track and manage the <b>hoist</b> <b>lifts</b> at their sites. Efficient tracking and management of the lifts would result in savings of cost, time, and energy for the construction companies. Such improvements would also help boost worker morale, which would consequently boost productivity.

40|$|Increased {{body mass}} has {{occurred}} in many countries {{over the past two}} decades. Morbidly obese individuals are prone to higher rates of cardiovascular, endocrine and malignant disease requiring hospitalization and medical care. A review of problems encountered by ambulance services, hospitals, forensic facilities and funeral service reveals common problems in examination, transport and handling. Strategies used in one area of health to deal with bariatric cases can be adapted for use in other areas. Forensic facilities may require the use bigger body bags, reinforced trolleys and vehicles, with larger refrigerator bays and CT scanning machines. The best option is for purpose built mortuaries designed with <b>lifting</b> <b>hoists</b> and passages, doorways, machinery and autopsy tables that can cope with morbidly obese bodies. Unnecessary handling and lifting of these bodies should be minimized, and so the admissions area, cool room storage and dissection theatre should be in close proximity to each other.

50|$|The celebrated {{mechanical}} engineer Harry Ricardo {{began his career}} by working in his grandfather, Alexander Rendel's, civil engineering practice. At {{the time they were}} involved in the construction of bridges in India, which required hydraulic <b>lifting,</b> <b>hoisting</b> and riveting equipment. As the existing transport infrastructure was poor, all plant used on site needed to be lightweight and easily portable. Machines also needed to be connected to their hydraulic power source by flexible tubing, which limited their working pressure to around 500 psi. At this time, modern shipyard equipment was using pressures of up to 2000 psi. This high-pressure equipment was smaller and lighter than the bulkier low-pressure variety, a desirable feature for this construction work. Ricardo's innovation was to specify the use of portable hydraulic intensifiers for these tools, permitting the use of the improved high-pressure form, even where their supply was at low-pressure, through flexible hose. These intensifiers were so successful that eventually several hundred were supplied and used.|$|R

2500|$|Special <b>lifting</b> <b>hoists</b> {{attached}} to the suspenders or from the main cables are used to lift prefabricated sections of bridge deck to the proper level, provided that the local conditions allow the sections to be carried below the bridge by barge or other means.

Arched suspension spans also give the structure more rigidity and strength.|$|R
50|$|Coaling the {{locomotives}} {{could be}} carried out in various ways. Many Betriebswerke ferried the coal from the bunkers using small narrow gauge tub wagons on rails to a rotating crane which then lifted them and tippled their contents into the tender of the locomotive. Large Betriebswerke had coaling stages or large coaling plants that had four filled hopper-like bunkers which were equipped with locking devices. When these were removed, the coal ran down into the locomotive tender. With this type, coal {{was transferred to the}} four small bunkers from the main bunkers using a large crane. Because these two variants needed rather a lot of space, small and medium-sized Betriebswerke had an overhead chute. The coal was transported in tub wagons again; these were then placed in a <b>lift,</b> <b>hoisted</b> up and then tippled down the chute, allowing the coal to run into the tender of the steam locomotive.Next to the coaling station there were often water cranes and works buildings. In addition, there were often store rooms for these facilities nearby.|$|R

5000|$|Drum hoists are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in North America, South Africa and South America. When using a drum hoist the {{hoisting}} cable is wound around the drum when the conveyance is <b>lifted.</b> Single-drum <b>hoists</b> can be used in smaller applications, however double-drum hoists easily allow the hoisting of two conveyances in balance (i.e. one skip being lifted while a second skip is being lowered). [...] Drum hoists are mounted on concrete slabs within a hoistroom, the hoisting ropes run from the drum, up to the top of the headframe, over a sheave wheel and down where they connect to the conveyance (cage or skip).|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} of two coronial autopsy populations aged >or= 17 years in Adelaide, South Australia in 1986 and in 2006 {{to determine whether}} there had been any increase in body mass index over the intervening 21 years. In 1986 there were 689 cases; M:F= 2. 8 : 1. The average BMI was 25. 1, with a range from 12. 5 to 55. 5. 47 % of cases had a normal BMI (18. 5 - 24. 9), 14. 8 % were obese (BMI >or= 30), with a subset of 1. 3 % of cases classified as morbidly obese (BMI >or= 40). In 2006 there were 1176 cases; M:F= 1. 9 : 1. The average BMI was 27. 1 with a range from 10. 5 to 80. 6. 32. 1 % of cases had a normal BMI, 27. 2 % were obese, with a subset of 4. 8 % of cases classified as morbidly obese. This study has confirmed {{that there has been a}} marked relative and absolute increase in numbers of obese individuals undergoing coronial post-mortem examinations in South Australia, with 218 more autopsies in 2006 involving obese bodies, including 47 more cases where morbid obesity was documented. This trend is undoubtedly occurring in other countries. Significant problems exist in trying to handle obese and particularly morbidly obese individuals in mortuaries designed for bodies with normal BMIs. Lifting, transport, transfer, storage and autopsy dissection are all difficult. Obesity enhances putrefaction that further complicates handling. Unless mortuaries are modified to deal with the increasing numbers of morbidly obese individuals, with reinforced and robust equipment including <b>lifting</b> <b>hoists,</b> the autopsy examination of such cases may be compromised, and staff will be confronted with ongoing and increasing risk of injury.
