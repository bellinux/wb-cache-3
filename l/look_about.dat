5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them <b>look</b> <b>about</b> as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E
500|$|Batman's {{design was}} heavily {{influenced}} {{by the work of}} comic artist Jim Lee, who drew Batman as a strong, muscular character who could believably take part in extreme combat. His black and dark gray costume was based on modern versions, and has military influences and an industrial <b>look.</b> <b>About</b> 13 concept designs were produced before his final appearance took form. Artists avoided film interpretations of the Joker, partly because the developers only had access to the rights to the original Batman license. Alan Moore's 1988 graphic novel [...] influenced the character's design. Harley Quinn underwent a drastic redesign, removing her black and red full-body outfit and jester's hat, and replacing them with a costume with design elements from a nurse's outfit and a schoolgirl's uniform. WildStorm, Lee's now-defunct comic book publishing company, produced concept art for the game.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the novel, Balzac {{declares}} (in English): [...] "All is true". Although the characters and situations are fictions, the details employed– and their reflection of the realities of life in Paris at the time– faithfully render the world of the Maison Vauquer. The rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève (where the house is located) presents [...] "a grim <b>look</b> <b>about</b> the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls". The interiors of the house are painstakingly described, from the shabby sitting room ("Nothing can be more depressing") to the coverings on the walls depicting a feast ("papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained")– an ironic decoration in a house known for its wretched food. Balzac owed the former detail to the expertise of his friend Hyacinthe de Latouche, who was trained in the practice of hanging wallpaper. The house is even defined by its repulsive smell, unique to the poor boardinghouse.|$|E

5000|$|Wullie's age has {{not been}} consistent, in the early Watkins scripts he <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> 5 or 6, in later Watkins scripts he <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> 10 or 11, more {{recently}} he has become slightly younger. His catchphrases are of [...] "Jings", [...] "Crivvens", [...] "Braw" [...] and [...] "Help ma Boab".|$|R
2500|$|State motto: Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam circumspice (Latin: [...] "If {{you seek}} a {{pleasant}} peninsula, <b>look</b> <b>about</b> you") adopted in 1835 on the coat-of-arms, but never {{as an official}} motto. This is a paraphrase of the epitaph of British architect Sir Christopher Wren about his masterpiece, St. Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{director}} Steven Spielberg cast Fanning in {{the lead}} child role of Allison [...] "Allie" [...] Clarke/Keys in the science fiction miniseries Taken. By this time, she had received positive notices by several film critics, including Tom Shales of The Washington Post, who wrote that Fanning [...] "has the perfect sort of otherworldly <b>look</b> <b>about</b> her, an enchanting young actress called upon ... to carry a great weight." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to biographer Robert Windeler, her 1947–49 films neither made nor {{lost money}} but [...] "had a cheapie B <b>look</b> <b>about</b> them and {{indifferent}} performances from her". Selznick {{suggested that she}} move abroad, gain maturity as an actress and even change her name. He warned {{her that she was}} typecast and her career was in perilous straits. After auditioning for and losing the role of Peter Pan on the Broadway stage in August 1950, Temple took stock and admitted that her recent movies had been poor fare. She announced her retirement from films on December 16, 1950.|$|E

2500|$|It is a {{difficult}} and dangerous thing in a democracy to prevent {{a substantial part of}} the population from doing things they do not regard as wrong. ... The freedom with which a person can walk about and look around is a very useful guide to the civilized quality of an urban area ... judged against this standard, many of our towns now seem to leave a great deal to be desired ... there must be areas of good environment where people can live, work, shop, <b>look</b> <b>about</b> and move around on foot in reasonable freedom from the hazards of motor traffic.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Young of English Heritage said, [...] "The Long Wall {{presents}} an enormous opportunity for research, careful conservation and sustainable use". At a 27 March {{conference at the}} site of the wall, EU ambassadors deemed the wall a [...] "unique architectural monument not only of Vietnam but also of the world". Hardy asserted that the wall [...] "is the evidence of goods transaction between the people in the lowland and upperland". French Ambassador to Vietnam Jean-François Girault said, [...] "In the world, there are walls to separate communities but the Truong Luy Wall in Quang Ngai gives us a new <b>look</b> <b>about</b> the mutual-assistance of difference communities".|$|E
2500|$|The Hawthornes {{had three}} children. Their first was {{daughter}} Una, born March 3, 1844; {{her name was}} a reference to The Faerie Queene, to the displeasure of family members. Hawthorne wrote to a friend, [...] "I find it a very sober and serious kind of happiness that springs from {{the birth of a}} child... There is no escaping it any longer. I have business on earth now, and must <b>look</b> <b>about</b> me for the means of doing it." [...] In October 1845, the Hawthornes moved to Salem. In 1846, their son Julian was born. Hawthorne wrote to his sister Louisa on June 22, 1846: [...] "A small troglodyte made his appearance here at ten minutes to six o'clock this morning, who claimed to be your nephew." [...] Daughter Rose was born in May 1851, and Hawthorne called her his [...] "autumnal flower".|$|E

2500|$|Smallwood {{claims that}} Rupert Perry, EMI's then {{managing}} director, {{came up with}} the idea that Eddie could become a more active part of the band's concerts, originally portrayed by Smallwood himself, wearing an Eddie mask and a leather jacket. The classic [...] "walk-on" [...] Eddie was created for The Beast on the Road tour by Dave Beasley after seeing a pantomime version of Jack and the Beanstalk, which used similar giants, consisting of [...] "basically a bloke on stilts but dressed up to <b>look</b> <b>about</b> [...] tall." [...] As the band's stage show expanded, an additional gigantic Eddie was also incorporated at the back of the set during [...] "Iron Maiden", which, like the [...] "walk-on" [...] Eddie, would match the theme of the current tour, such as the , mummified version used during the World Slavery Tour, which shot sparks from its eyes.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Andrew Graham-Dixon {{finds the}} {{painting}} [...] "in its quiet, understated way, {{one of the}} masterpieces of erotic painting"; Robert's [...] "clothes are almost falling off him, they are so loose and floppy" [...] while Frances [...] "has a melted, langourous <b>look</b> <b>about</b> her". [...] For Erica Langmuir it is [...] "the most tartly lyrical picture {{in the history of}} art. Mr Andrew's satisfaction in his well-kept farmlands is as nothing to the intensity of the painter's feeling for the gold and green of fields and copses, the supple curves of fertile land meeting the stately clouds". [...] She notes the visual [...] "rhymes and assonances" [...] that link elements of the composition: the skirt with the bench back, Mrs Andrews' shoes with its feet and Mr Andrews' with the tree roots, and [...] "the lines of gun, thighs, dog, calf, coat". His hanging coat tail relates to the ribbon hanging from his wife's hat.|$|E
2500|$|Since his {{departure}} Greg {{has become an}} iconic villain on the soap. His romance with Caroline {{has been described as}} one of Shortland Streets most memorable couples. Writer, Rachel Lang, thought Balme was perfect for the role, stating:"I was at the bank and there was this guy over at the counter and I thought, 'ooh he looks dodgy', he had that kind of <b>look</b> <b>about</b> him, he's quite a chameleon." [...] A reviewer of the soap stated in 2000 that Greg should be brought back because he made the show addictive with his [...] "badboy" [...] ways. Balmes portrayal was so realistic, a pharmacist refused him service whilst he was on the show fearing he was drug seeking. In 2012, the character was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years. His final scene with Caroline has been voted by fans as one of the show's most iconic moments.|$|E

2500|$|As emo pop coalesced, the Fueled by Ramen label {{became a}} center of the {{movement}} and signed Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, and Paramore (all {{of whom had been}} successful). Two regional scenes developed. The Florida scene was created by Fueled by Ramen; midwest emo-pop was promoted by Pete Wentz, whose Fall Out Boy rose to the forefront of the style during the mid-2000s. Cash Cash released Take It to the Floor (2008); according to AllMusic, it could be [...] "the definitive statement of airheaded, glittery, and content-free emo-pop ... the transformation of emo from the expression of intensely felt, ripped-from-the-throat feelings played by bands directly influenced by post-punk and hardcore to mall-friendly Day-Glo pop played by kids who <b>look</b> <b>about</b> as authentic as the [...] "punks" [...] on an old episode of Quincy did back in the '70s was made pretty much complete". You Me at Six released their 2008 debut album, Take Off Your Colours, described by AllMusic's Jon O'Brien as [...] "follow the 'emo-pop for dummies' handbook word-for-word." [...] The album was certified gold in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|The 1953–1954 Chevrolet range had {{a unique}} and {{somewhat}} awkward <b>look</b> <b>about</b> it and much of this stemmed from {{its role as a}} transitional model to introduce a raft of changes that were necessary {{to pave the way for}} the introduction of the 1955–1957 range that really established the Bel Air as a cultural icon. The pre-war technology, such as torque tube drive, six-cylinder splash feed engines, knee action suspension, split windshields, etc., of the early models was phased out and the foundations for the first post war modern Chevrolet passenger car were finalized in this 1953–1954 model. The Bel Air series featured a wide chrome strip of molding from the rear fender bulge to the rear bumper. The inside of this stripe was painted a coordinating color with the outside body color, and [...] "Bel Air" [...] scripts were added inside the strip. Lesser models had no model designation anywhere on the car, only having a Chevy crest on the hood and trunk. 1953 was the first year for a curved, one-piece windshield.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{organizations}} {{today have}} Latin mottos, such as [...] "Semper paratus" [...] (always ready), {{the motto of}} the United States Coast Guard, and [...] "Semper fidelis" [...] (always faithful), the motto of the United States Marine Corps. Several of {{the states of the}} United States also have Latin mottos, such as [...] "Qui transtulit sustinet" [...] ("He who transplanted still sustains"), the state motto of Connecticut; [...] "Ad astra per aspera" [...] ("To the stars through hardships"), that of Kansas; [...] "Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam, circumspice" [...] ("If you seek a pleasant peninsula, <b>look</b> <b>about</b> you"), that of Michigan; [...] "Salus populi suprema lex esto" [...] ("The health of the people should be the highest law"), that of Missouri; [...] "Esse quam videri" [...] (To be rather than to seem), that of North Carolina; [...] "Sic semper tyrannis" [...] (Thus always for tyrants), that of Virginia; and [...] "Montani semper liberi" [...] (Mountaineers are always free), that of West Virginia. Another Latin motto is [...] "Per ardua ad astra" [...] (Through adversity/struggle to the stars), the motto of the Royal Air Force (RAF). Some schools adopt Latin mottos, for example Harvard University's motto is [...] "Veritas" [...] meaning (truth). Veritas was the goddess of truth, a daughter of Saturn, and the mother of Virtue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} Leipziger Platz has been {{inextricably}} linked {{with that of}} its neighbour almost since its creation. Yet their respective stories have in many ways been very different. The future Potsdamer Platz was most definitely outside Berlin, and therefore {{not subject to the}} planning guidelines and constraints that would normally be expected in a city keen to show itself off as the capital of an empire. It grew very rapidly in a piecemeal and haphazard way, and came to epitomise wildness and excess in a manner that contributed much to its legendary status. Leipziger Platz however, was inside the city (and had a name almost a century before its neighbour did), and always had an orderly, disciplined <b>look</b> <b>about</b> it. After all, it had been planned and built all in one go by Johann Philipp Gerlach. [...] One late 18th-century artistic depiction shows a range of buildings relentless in their uniformity. Indeed, this, together with the grid pattern of the streets, is what one would expect in Prussia’s chief garrison city. One writer of the time said that a stroll round Friedrichstadt was like walking round military barracks. In this respect the Potsdam Gate was a dividing line between two different worlds. It was not until later on that many of these buildings began to be replaced by important historical palaces and aristocratic mansions.|$|E
