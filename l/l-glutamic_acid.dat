The substrate specificity of the remaining transport system, termed the general transport system, has been fully characterized with regard to the contributions to binding of the side chain, the α-amino group, and the carboxylate group. The positively charged α-amino group is necessary for binding; the negatively charged carboxylate group is of less importance, since its replacement by a neutral carbonyl functional group does not completely abolish binding. The greatest structural latitude for binding was found in the side chain; affinity for α-amino acids was uniformly high except for l-aspartic and <b>l-glutamic</b> <b>acids,</b> l-asparagine, and l-proline. Thus, this transport system is “general” with these restrictions...|$|R

40|$|Neurones {{from the}} ventral half of mouse embryo spinal cord were grown in tissue culture and voltage clamped with two micro-electrodes. The current-voltage {{relation}} of responses evoked by brief pressure applications of excitatory amino acids was examined over a membrane potential range of - 100 to + 70 mV. Three types of current-voltage relation were observed. Responses to kainic and quisqualic acids were relatively linear within +/- 20 mV of the resting potential. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and L-aspartic acid responses {{had a negative}} slope conductance at membrane potentials more negative than - 30 mV. In contrast, over the same potential range the slope conductance of responses evoked by <b>L-glutamic</b> and L-homocysteic <b>acids</b> was close to zero. The membrane potential-chord conductance relation of the ionic mechanism activated by excitatory amino acids, derived using the driving force for ionic current, showed two types of behaviour. The conductance linked to NMDA receptors was highly voltage sensitive and increased on depolarization; a much weaker voltage sensitivity was observed for responses evoked by kainic and quisqualic <b>acids.</b> <b>L-glutamic</b> and L-homocysteic <b>acid</b> responses behaved as though due to simultaneous activation of both NMDA and either kainate or quisqualate receptors. In {{the presence of the}} NMDA receptor antagonist (+/-) - 2 -aminophosphonovaleric acid (2 -APV) the response to L-glutamate became less voltage sensitive and resembled responses evoked by kainate or quisqualate. Simultaneous activation of both conductance mechanisms by mixtures of kainate and NMDA produced current-voltage and membrane potential-chord conductance relations similar to those of L-glutamate. The voltage sensitivity of the L-glutamate response was inversely related to the dose; for low doses of L-glutamate the slope conductance of responses recorded near the resting potential was close to zero. However, larger doses of L-glutamate evoked responses with a voltage sensitivity similar to that of kainate. We suggest that L-glutamate acts as a mixed agonist at both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. This can explain the results of previous experiments that failed to demonstrate a membrane resistance change during L-glutamate-induced depolarizations...|$|R

25|$|Clark has {{suggested}} that homochirality may have started in outer space, as the studies of the amino acids on the Murchison meteorite showed that L-alanine {{is more than twice}} as frequent as its D form, and <b>L-glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> was more than three times prevalent than its D counterpart. Various chiral crystal surfaces can also act as sites for possible concentration and assembly of chiral monomer units into macromolecules.

During 1988 to 1990, Ryszard Andruszkiewicz, a visiting research fellow, synthesized a series of molecules for Silverman. One looked particularly promising. The molecule was effectively shaped for transportation into the brain, where it activated <b>L-Glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> decarboxylase, an enzyme. Silverman hoped that the enzyme would increase production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and block convulsions. Eventually, the set of molecules were sent to Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals for testing. The drug was approved in the European Union in 2004. The US received FDA approval for use in treating epilepsy, diabetic neuropathic pain, and postherpetic neuralgia in December 2004. Pregabalin then appeared on the US market under the brand name Lyrica in fall of 2005.|$|E

40|$|Part I. New {{class of}} {{nucleoside}} analogs have been synthesized in comparable yields. The lactam based nucleoside analogs have been synthesized from D- and <b>L-Glutamic</b> <b>acids</b> in 7 and 8 steps.

The synthesis involved {{the construction of the}} key intermediate alcohols, 6 -Hydroxy- 3 -phenyl-tetrahydro-pyrrolo[1, 2 -O] oxazol- 5 -one (shown below, 1 [...] 4). Antipodes of the key intermediate alcohol (1 [...] 4) were synthesized from enantiomerically pure D- and L- glutamic acid. * ^ Both antipodes of 3 -adeninyl- 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -pyrrolidinon and carbovir analogue partially protected 3 -guaninyl- 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (23) were synthesized. Adenine and guanine heterocycles were successfully attached to the lactam ring through coupling of antipode 2 with adenine, and 4 with adenine and properly protected guanine under Mitsunobu conditions (DIAD, PPh 3). Stereochemical integrity was maintained throughout the synthetic steps. The biological activity (particularly the anti HIV- 1 activity) of the synthesized lactam based nucleoside analogs will be evaluated. ^ Part II. Soluble epoxide hydrolase catalyzes a hydrolytic epoxide ring opening reaction to yield vicinal diols {{and at the same time}} its N-terminal domain was recently implicated to have a distinctive phosphatase function. The biological impacts of the recently discovered phosphatase function of the N-terminal domain is still under investigation, thus developing inhibitors to selectively block this function will be invaluable to shed some light on detailed aspects of this function. Along the same lines, potent phosphatase inhibitors might provide an explanation for the existence of these two distinct and chemically irrelevant functions at the same enzyme. ^ Interestingly, a phosphatase (and/or pyrophosphatase) that is structurally similar to the N-terminal domain of sEH, is believed to contribute to the biosynthesis of insect juvenile hormone (JH). JH is required to ensure growth and maturation of larva and for the production of eggs in female insects in addition to the vital developmental and physiological functions. Subsequently, potent phosphates and/or pyrophosphatase inhibitors might provide powerful means to control insect development. ^ Careful analysis of the sEH N-terminal domain architectural and structural features combined with preliminary results obtained by Grant and coworkers on farnesol derivative inhibitors, allowed us to design potential inhibitors for the catalytic function of this part of the enzyme. For this purpose several alcohols were targeted for synthesis and designed to have a long hydrophobic chain that will fit into a 25 Å long cleft, situated along the active site lined with extensive hydrophobic surface that can interact with hydrophobic substrates. ^ *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams. ...|$|R

40|$|Acidizing {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{techniques}} for well productivity enhancement during oil and gas production. However, the treatment method is not very effective when the wellbore penetrates through multiple layers of heterogeneous reservoirs. Uneven acid distribution always results in productivity enhancement under expectation. When such a well is drilled, the temperature of the well could be too high to keep the acid reaction under control. The acid used in the treatment fluid, most commonly HCl, would react with the tubular and the formation at a very high rate. Rather than creating long wormholes to bypass the damaged area, face dissolution, loss of pipelines, and potential damage are the outcomes after the treatment. Thus, several new techniques were proposed in this study to solve the issues discussed above. To address the heterogeneity of the reservoir, viscoelastic surfactants (VES) were used as diverting agents during acidizing treatments. A recently developed chelating agent, <b>L-glutamic</b> acid-N,N-diacetic <b>acid</b> (GLDA), was evaluated as a possible alternative for the traditional HCl. Coreflood tests and measurements of rheology properties of the treatment fluids were used to investigate the performance of the treatment fluids based on the two new systems. In total, two VES were evaluated for their diverting abilities. The first VES was based on amine oxide. It was found that the live VES-based acids had the highest apparent viscosity when the concentration of HCl was 5 wt%. During the coreflood tests, the VES-based acid was only able to build up pressure drop across the core at injection rates less than 1 cm_(3) /min. A significant amount of the VES was left inside the core after the treatment, which reduced the efficiency of production enhancement. The other VES, based on carboxysulfobetaine, can tolerate high temperatures up to 325 ?F. According to the viscosity measurements of the spent VES-based acid, the addition of various corrosion inhibitors lowered the fluid viscosity at temperatures above 150 ?F. Mutual solvent was able to break the wormlike micelles formed by the VES in the presence of calcium chloride. The diverting ability of the VES was proved through coreflood tests. For the GLDA-based treatment fluids, two additives were added into the system in effort to improve the efficiency of the treatments. Polymers and VES were added into the GLDA to achieve even fluid distribution during treatment. A significant viscosity increment was observed with the help of the viscosifier, which could expand the application of the GLDA...|$|R

The development of a rapid and sensitive method for the quantification of EAAs may provide a novel means for clinical management of patients affected by head trauma. Of the amino <b>acids</b> <b>L-glutamic</b> (Glu) and L-aspartic acid (Asp), the concentration of Glu is more indicative of injury to the central nervous system. This study explores the detection limit of Glu using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) on aqueous silver colloids. This study examines methods to monitor the colloidal reactions for the calibration of the enhancement observed. Thirty second Raman spectral scans were taken utilizing a 50 mW argon laser. Isolated aqueous Glu was quantifiable from 0. 4 []mol/L - 5 []mol/L from an examination of a unique spectral feature at 830 cm??. Asp exhibits a unique but comparable shifted spectral feature at 785 cm?? using the same probing parameters. In order to test this technique in vivo, rat extracellular brain fluid microanalysis samples were collected before and after a localized brain infarct was produced using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). SERS spectral analysis of these samples showed an intriguing correlation with expected changes in EAA levels as influenced by the MCAO damage model. We show that SERS techniques may have the promise of providing the sensitivity and selectivity required to quantify EAAs in a phantom medium at physiological concentrations. Compared with conventional detection techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography, this research employs no sample preparation techniques, thus reducing assay time. The controlled studies and limited animal studies suggest that the SERS technique described here may become a viable prelude for providing diagnostic information about nervous system injury in anticipation of clinical intervention...|$|R
