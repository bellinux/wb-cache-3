It assumed a liability of NZ£15,000 (being {{part of the}} Waiapu County's main road and bridges loan) and another of £1,200 {{in connection with the}} Te Araroa jetty. Anticipating that the wharfage dues that would be provided by a freezing works that had just been built at Hicks Bay would meet the <b>loan</b> <b>charges,</b> it borrowed £30,000 and built a wharf there. However, the works was closed after the 1925-6 season. By then, the county had also raised several small loans for road works.|$|E

The Latchford route {{continued}} in use until 28 August 1935, which was the last day of tram operation, with a replacement bus service operating from the following day. The last journey of the day was operated by Tram No. 1, which left Rylands Street carrying 136 passengers as opposed to its nominal capacity of 55. This tram is estimated to have carried a total of 9,652,000 passengers and operated 777,600 miles during its 33 years of service. The total mileage operated by all trams was about 15,000,000, carrying a total of 225,000,000 passengers with only one fatality. Unlike many other tramway systems, a profit had been made in every financial year bar one, all <b>loan</b> <b>charges</b> had been paid off, and additionally over £35,000 of relief in rates was handed over.|$|E

40|$|In October 2003, the Budget and Financial Policies Committee (BUFIPOL) {{proposed}} that the Board of Directors approve a new capital adequacy policy and methodology for the calculation of <b>loan</b> <b>charges</b> for ordinary capital loans and guarantees. The Committee agreed that OVE should conduct {{an evaluation of the}} performance of the new capital adequacy model and policy two years after its approval, assessing how well it has fulfilled its objectives, and reporting on its financial and operational effects. This document (RE- 322) fulfills that requirement by evaluating the performance of both the model and the policy, as well as reporting its main financial and operational effects. The findings of the evaluation are tentative and preliminary because both the model and the policy were only very recently implemented. ...|$|E
40|$|Countries {{can make}} a clean exit from {{financial}} assistance, or enter a new programme or a precautionary programme, depending on the sustainability of their public debt and their vulnerability to shocks. • Ireland made a clean exit in December 2013, supported by significant budgetary and current-account adjustment and signs of economic recovery. But Irish debt sustaina-bility is not guaranteed and prudence {{will be needed to}} avoid future difficulties. • A clean exit for Portugal is not recommended when its programme ends in May 2014, because compared to Ireland it faces higher interest rates, has poorer growth pros-pects and has probably less ability to generate a consistently high primary surplus. A precautionary arrangement would be advisable. In case debt sustainability proves dif-ficult to achieve later, some form of debt restructuring may prove necessary. • It is unlikely that Greece will be able to exit its programme in December 2014. A third programme should be put in place to take Greece out of the market until 2030, accom-panied by enhanced budgetary and structural reform commitments by Greece, a Euro-pean boost to economic growth in the euro-area periphery and willingness on the part of lenders to reduce <b>loan</b> <b>charges</b> below their borrowing costs, should public debt levels prove unsustainable despite Greece meeting the loan conditions. • Even assuming all goes well, the three countries will be subject to enhanced post-pro-gramme surveillance.

40|$|Measures {{of problem}} loans at {{commercial}} banks declined {{over much of}} the period since the trough of the last recession in 1991. Bank supervisors have expressed concern, however, about increases in problem business loans at large banks in recent quarters. The tables provide perspective on recent trends in problem-loan ratios by presenting measures of problem commercial and industrial loans since 1991. One measure of problem loans is the percentage of loans that are nonperforming. Nonperforming loans include those that are 90 days or more past due or no longer accruing interest. Another measure is the net charge-off rate: <b>loans</b> <b>charged</b> off as losses, minus recoveries by banks on <b>loans</b> previously <b>charged</b> off, as a percentage of loans...|$|R

40|$|Several bank {{supervisors}} {{have expressed}} concern {{during the past year}} about the risks assumed by banks. Measures of problem loans provide one indication of whether banks are taking increased risks, though the risks assumed by banks during recent years may not be evident in measures of problem loans until some time in the future when the pace of economic activity slows. Still, an increase in problem loan rates during the current period of strong economic growth would suggest that banks generally have tended to make riskier loans during recent years. One measure of problem loans is the percentage of loans that are nonperforming: loans past due 90 days or more and nonaccrual loans. Another measure is the net charge-off rate: <b>loans</b> <b>charged</b> off as losses...|$|R

We divided the participants into three groups: lower low, low, and upper low income. We found that predatory loan was preferable especially for lower low and low income group. Result also confirmed that even if the predatory <b>loan</b> <b>charge</b> was increased, the lower low- and low-income groups still prefer to ease their financial distress through predatory loans. Moreover, the longer the duration of the predatory loan, the higher its probability to be chosen as a funding source in times of household financial distress...|$|R

If interest is allowed, the rich will exploit the poor". In contrast, Taqi Usmani is concerned about [...] "rich industrialists" [...] who borrow [...] "huge" [...] amounts for [...] "their huge profitable projects" [...] and exploit lenders by only paying interest and not sharing their huge profits. On the other hand, he states elsewhere that [...] "the intrinsic nature" [...] of interest and not the [...] "financial position of the parties" [...] make <b>loans</b> <b>charging</b> interest invalid, (so that not-so-rich industrialists with smaller, marginally profitable projects are just as forbidden).|$|R

Much of money loaned was used to buy company stock, but executives were not barred from simultaneously selling shares they already owned, and could delay disclosure of their sales of company stock (useful when executive knew the price would fall) for far longer than it could normal sales by selling stock to the company to pay off loans.|$|R
