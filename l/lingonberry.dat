25|$|Wild berries {{are also}} {{gathered}} or, even {{more frequently than}} mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. Bilberries (mėlynės) and lingonberries (bruknės) {{are the two most}} abundant species of wild berries. Cranberries (spanguolės) are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to Čepkeliai Marsh. Sour cranberry or <b>lingonberry</b> jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (blynai). <b>Lingonberry</b> jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. Wild strawberries (žemuogės) are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.|$|E

25|$|Pine forests (with Pinus sylvestris) are {{the most}} {{widespread}} and occupy 51% of the forested area of the Karelian Isthmus, followed by spruce forests (with Picea abies, 29%) and birch forests (with Betula pendula and B. pubescens, 16%). Stands on more fertile soils and in more favorable locations are occasionally dominated by Norway maple, black alder, grey alder, common aspen, English oak, grey willow, dark-leaved willow, tea-leaved willow, small-leaved lime or European white elm. Common vegetation of various types of pine forests includes heather, crowberry, common juniper, eared willow, <b>lingonberry,</b> water horsetail, bracken, graminoids (i.e. grasses in the wider sense) Avenella flexuosa and Carex globularis, mosses Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium and S. russowii, and lichens Cladonia spp. Prominent in various spruce forests are wood horsetail, common wood sorrel, bilberry, <b>lingonberry,</b> graminoids Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis arundinacea, Carex globularis, and mosses Polytrichum commune and Sphagnum girgensohnii. Prominent vegetation of various birch forests include meadowsweet, common wood sorrel, bilberry and graminoids Calamagrostis arundinacea and C. canescens.|$|E

2500|$|Lüchow's menu was German {{oriented}} {{throughout its}} existence, with dishes including Wiener Schnitzel and various wild game. [...] "Knackwurst and Sauerkraut", Bratwurst, red cabbage and beets, Sauerbraten and pumpernickel bread were perennial staples. Pfannkuchen mit Preiselbeeren, (flambéed thin pancakes with <b>lingonberry</b> sauce) and Sachertorte, a recipe {{borrowed from the}} famous Sacher Hotel in Vienna, were favorites of the dessert selection. Apparently the German orientation was relaxed somewhat {{in the years after}} 1923 when August Lüchow died, putting the restaurant under control of his sister's husband Victor Eckstein. Even during Lüchow's lifetime it was necessary to make compromises: during the First World War anti-German sentiment ran so high that by 1917 he thought it prudent to remove the umlaut over the [...] "u" [...] of Lüchow's in all public occurrences of the name.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe liver is a {{critical}} organ for regulation of energy homeostasis and fatty liver disease is closely associated with obesity and insulin resistance. We have previously found that <b>lingonberries,</b> blackcurrants and bilberries prevent, whereas açai berries exacerbate, the development of hepatic steatosis and obesity in the high-fat (HF) -fed C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse model. In this follow-up study, we investigated the mechanisms behind these effects. Genome-wide hepatic gene expression profiling indicates that the protective effects of <b>lingonberries</b> and bilberries are accounted for by several-fold downregulation of genes involved in acute-phase and inflammatory pathways (e. g. Saa 1, Cxcl 1, Lcn 2). In contrast, açai-fed mice exhibit marked upregulation of genes associated with steatosis (e. g. Cfd, Cidea, Crat) and lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, which {{is in line with}} the exacerbation of HF-induced hepatic steatosis in these mice. In silico transcription factor analysis together with immunoblot analysis identified NF-κB, STAT 3 and mTOR as upstream regulators involved in mediating the observed transcriptional effects. To gain further insight into mechanisms involved in the gene expression changes, the HELP-tagging assay was used to identify differentially methylated CpG sites. Compared to the HF control group, <b>lingonberries</b> induced genome-wide hypermethylation and specific hypermethylation of Ncor 2, encoding the corepressor NCoR/SMRT implicated in the regulation of pathways of metabolic homeostasis and inflammation. We conclude that the beneficial metabolic effects of <b>lingonberries</b> and bilberries are associated with downregulation of inflammatory pathways, whereas for blackcurrants, exerting similar metabolic effects, different mechanisms of action appear to dominate. NF-κB, STAT 3 and mTOR are potential targets of the health-promoting effects of berries...|$|R

40|$|Scope: <b>Lingonberries</b> {{have been}} shown to reduce the {{detrimental}} effects of high-fat diet (HFD) on weight gain, plasma glucose, and inflammation. However, the extent of effects was recently shown to vary between different batches of berries. Here, we examine the metabolic response to two independent batches of <b>lingonberries.</b> Methods and results: Alterations in the phenotype and circulating metabolome elicited by three matched HFDs, two of which containing <b>lingonberries</b> (L 1 D and L 2 D) from different sources, were investigated. Glycemia was improved only in mice fed L 1 D, whereas liver function was improved and inflammation reduced in mice fed both L 1 D and L 2 D, compared to mice fed HFD. The unique improvement in glycemia elicited by L 1 D was associated with a 21 % increase in circulating levels of fatty acids. Increased levels of phosphatidylcholines (62 %) and lysophosphatidylcholines (28 %) and decreased levels of serine (− 13 %) and sphingomyelins (− 26 %) were observed in mice fed L 1 D and L 2 D, as compared to HFD. Conclusion: The unique improvement in glycemia in mice fed L 1 D was associated with a normal metabolic control with an altered set point. Moreover, the batch-independent reduction in liver steatosis and inflammation, was associated with an altered sphingomyelin metabolism...|$|R
