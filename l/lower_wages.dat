5|$|Republicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized {{and argued}} for {{abolition}} {{as a necessary}} step in national progress. Amendment supporters also argued that the slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the <b>lower</b> <b>wages</b> resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First Amendment and other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.|$|E
5|$|The Rock Springs massacre, {{also known}} as the Rock Springs Riot, {{occurred}} on September 2, 1885, in the present-day United States city of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The riot, between Chinese immigrant miners and white immigrant miners, was the result of racial tensions and an ongoing labor dispute over the Union Pacific Coal Department's policy of paying Chinese miners <b>lower</b> <b>wages</b> than white miners. This policy caused the Chinese to be hired over the white miners, which further angered the white miners and contributed to the riot. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes resulting in approximately US$150,000 in property damage ($ in present-day terms).|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of DNL. It also applied, {{though the}} sister company Braathens Helikopter, for {{concessions}} for helicopter services from Stavanger to offshore oil platforms. As a reaction, the incumbent, Helikopter Service, applied for Braathens SAFEs West Coast routes. At this point, SAS bought 15% of Helikopter Service. In 1984, Braathens SAFE introduced services to Farsund Airport, using wet leased F-27s from Busy Bee. The same arrangement {{was used to}} connect Haugesund to Bergen and Stavanger. In Haugesund, this was in competition with Norving. Busy Bee-operated planes were also used on routes from Sandefjord in competition with Norsk Flytjeneste. The same year, the cabin crew had a 14-day strike, halting all flights. It {{was caused by the}} company paying <b>lower</b> <b>wages</b> than SAS and Busy Bee. In 1985, a new booking system was introduced, that allowed overbooking. This gave increased revenue, but the company had to start compensating rejected passengers with a full refund and a free seat on the next flight. On 16 December 1985, the airline's administration moved into the a new building, the Diamond, located at Fornebu. The frequent flyer program Bracard was launched in September 1985. It was a cooperation with Inter Nor Hotels, and gave special privileges to travelers that made 25 full-price trips per year with Braathens.|$|E
30|$|The {{ideas of}} labor {{monopsony}} were first formulated by Pigou (1924) and Robinson (1933). A monopsony employer lacks {{competition from other}} firms in the demand for labor. The measure of monopsony power {{is related to the}} wage elasticity of labor supplyâ€”the extent that workers respond to a <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> by leaving the market. In a labor market with perfect competition, a firm faces a labor supply with infinite wage elasticity, meaning that if the firm decreases wages below the market wage, workers will quit and look for work at a higher-paying competitor. A monopsonistic firm, on the other hand, faces a labor supply elasticity that is much lower; if the firm <b>lowers</b> <b>wages,</b> not all workers will leave the firm. The <b>lower</b> the <b>wage</b> elasticity of supply, the more likely workers are to stay with the firm at a <b>lower</b> <b>wage.</b>|$|R

5|$|Worsening {{economic}} conditions had put further pressure on industrial relations, with unemployment rising and employers seeking to cut costs. Strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, and intervention by the Bruce government {{failed to produce}} a settlement. Notably, in March 1929 Newcastle-based mine owner John Brown locked out workers from his mines at Pelaw Main and Richmond Main to try to force acceptance of <b>lower</b> <b>wages.</b> Attorney-General John Latham pursued legal action against Brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics, but Bruce intervened to stop the prosecution, believing the case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give the government a chance to negotiate {{an end to the}} dispute. The mine-owners refused to accede to government-brokered negotiations anyway, and the government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying double standards, undermining Bruce's own credibility as an impartial leader and law-and-order prime minister.|$|E

40|$|The {{human capital}} {{explanation}} of {{sex differences in}} wages is that, owing to specialization in household production, women intend {{to work in the}} labor market more intermittently than men, and therefore invest less, leading to <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> growth. An alternative "feedback" hypothesis is that women experience labor market discrimination and respond with career interruptions, less investment, and <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> growth. This paper explores the relationship between self-reported discrimination and subsequent labor market outcomes to test this alternative hypothesis. Some of the evidence is consistent with the feedback hypothesis. Working women who report discrimination are more likely subsequently to change employers, to have children, and to marry. However, the evidence is not consistent with the two implications of the feedback hypothesis that most directly challenge the human capital explanation of sex differences in wages; women who report discrimination do not accumulate less experience, nor do they have <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> growth. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{test whether}} older {{individuals}} who report that their firms favor younger workers in promotion decisions are harmed by this often-cited discriminatory practice. Using the Health and Retirement Study, I determine whether such workers {{are more likely}} to experience <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> growth, to separate from their employer, or to retire early, in comparison with workers with similar demographic and job characteristics. The evidence is consistent with <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> growth and a greater likelihood of early retirement. Much of the effect, however, is likely to stem from a high correlation between delayed-payment contracts and promotion practices. ...|$|R

25|$|The unions of the AFL were {{composed}} primarily of skilled men; unskilled workers, African-Americans, {{and women were}} generally excluded. The AFL saw women as threatening the jobs of men, since they often worked for <b>lower</b> <b>wages.</b> The AFL provided little to no support for women's attempts to unionize.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, a {{contractor}} employed African-American workers from Alabama {{to build a}} Veterans' Bureau hospital {{in the district of}} Congressman Bacon.

25|$|Reduction of the {{unemployed}} has been threatened by illegal immigration from Bangladesh. This {{has increased the}} workforce without a commensurate increase in jobs. Immigrants compete with local workers for jobs at <b>lower</b> <b>wages,</b> particularly in construction, domestics, Rickshaw-pullers, and vegetable sellers. The government has been identifying (via NRC) and deporting illegals. Continued immigration is exceeding deportation.|$|E

25|$|The miners {{maintained}} resistance for a {{few months}} before being forced, by their own economic needs, to return to the mines. By the end of November, most miners were back at work. However, many remained unemployed for many years. Those still employed were forced to accept longer hours, <b>lower</b> <b>wages</b> and district wage agreements. The strikers felt that they had achieved nothing.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{there are}} large {{differences}} in wages and employment associated with different degrees. Medical doctors and lawyers are generally the highest paid workers, and have among the lowest unemployment rates. Among undergraduate fields of study, science, technology, engineering, math, and business generally offer the highest wages and best chances of employment, while education, communication, and liberal arts degrees generally offer <b>lower</b> <b>wages</b> and a lower likelihood of employment.|$|E
25|$|In {{part because}} of the {{credential}} issue, many immigrants are forced to find work below their education level and at <b>lower</b> <b>wages.</b> However, even for doing work of the same skill level, immigrants are much less well compensated than their native born counterparts. Immigration scholar Jeffrey Reitz calculated that in 2001 native Canadian employers were benefiting from, and immigrant employees were losing out on, between $2 and 3 billion per year due to this imbalance.|$|E

30|$|In TableÂ  3, we {{also present}} the {{significance}} of these differences across tenure categories and to what extent there is some variation across the business cycle. In this regard, differences in wage cyclicality between new-hired, job movers, and low tenure (less than 2 Â years) workers tend to be non significant, while long-tenure workers tend to exhibit a significantly <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> sensitivity to unemployment. Interestingly, downward wage rigidities seem to be playing a relevant role protecting wage falls for workers with a tenure higher than two years in the most adverse cyclical situation (recessions with high unemployment), while, by contrast, in expansionary periods only long tenure workers (more than 6 Â years) show a significantly <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> reaction to unemployment.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the returns to promotions and separations from firms using Portuguese linked employer-employee data. More than 90 % {{of the total}} variation in wages can be ex- plained by observed and unobserved characteristics of workers and firms. Taken together, worker and firm unobserved effects explain {{more than half of}} the variation of wages for all types of job mobility. Our results suggest that promoted workers are high wage workers in high wage firms. Movers are inherently <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> workers, in <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> firms. However, on average, workers that find a new job within one year enter firms that pay higher wages. This is not true for workers that take more than a year to find a new job. ...|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} the season, {{other members}} of the team â€“ Paul Robinson, Dominic Matteo, Mark Viduka and Alan Smith â€“ were transferred, and even Milner, who Leeds had been intent on keeping, had to be sold.

25|$|Maersk {{was struck}} by a series of labor {{disputes}} in 1998 and 1999. The company experienced high turnover amongst cabin crew, due to <b>lower</b> <b>wages</b> and longer working hours that at SAS. The airline was therefore forced to hire English-speaking crews. However, these were limited to one per flight. The airline had a revenue of DKK3.5 billion and made a profit of DKK124 million in 2000. That year the airline opened a route from Billund to Dublin.|$|E
25|$|The first {{criticism}} is that, following Say's {{law and the}} related circle of ideas, if demand slackens, prices will fall (barring government intervention), and the resulting lower price will stimulate demand (though at lower profit or cost â€“ possibly even <b>lower</b> <b>wages).</b> This criticism in turn has been questioned by New Keynesian economists, who reject Say's law and instead point to evidence of sticky prices as a reason why prices do not fall in recession; this remains a debated point.|$|E

25|$|Government and {{corporate}} policies deliberately shift immigrants to secondary sector occupations. These are jobs characterized by high instability, hazardous work environments, and low pay. Inherently {{those involved in}} these sectors will have <b>lower</b> <b>wages</b> and more periods of unemployment. In several European countries the immigration system is almost fully designed to try to fill these positions. This is less the case in Canada, but significant recruitment programs for sectors such as agriculture and oil and gas recruit many workers to perilous jobs.|$|E
25|$|King {{traveled}} to Memphis, Tennessee, {{in support of}} striking African American city sanitation workers. The workers had staged a walkout on February 11, 1968, to protest unequal wages and working conditions imposed by then-mayor Henry Loeb. At the time, Memphis paid black workers significantly <b>lower</b> <b>wages</b> than whites. Several sanitation workers had been killed on the job due to unsafe working conditions. In addition, unlike white workers, black workers received no pay if they stayed home during bad weather; consequently, most blacks were compelled to work even in driving rain and snowstorms.|$|E
25|$|Union busting in the United States dates {{at least}} to the 19th century, when a rapid {{expansion}} in factories and manufacturing capabilities caused a migration of workers from agricultural work to the mining, manufacturing and transportation industries. Conditions were often unsafe, women worked for <b>lower</b> <b>wages</b> than men, and child labor was rampant. Because employers and governments did little to address these issues, labor movements in the industrialized world were formed to seek better wages, hours, and working conditions. The clashes between labor and management were often adversarial and were deeply affected by wars, economic conditions, government policies, and court proceedings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wages</b> {{in these}} <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> {{industries}} {{are generally not}} subsistence wages, and {{this leads to a}} large amount of families with working family members making less than subsistence wages. This led to welfare rolls for employed workers and to multiple family members working jobs.|$|R
30|$|Nevertheless, {{the effect}} is {{different}} if the dispersion of existing firms is invariant. If existing firms are already located on the circle, and the new one is inserted between two old firms, then firms are no longer uniformly distributed around the circle {{and the distribution of}} market power changes. The market power of firms in the neighborhood of the new entrant falls, whereas that of firms further away rises. The former consequently fix a <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> than do the others. Indeed, firms do not differentiate workers located on the right side from workers of the other side. As the market is asymmetrical, firms further away could take over workers of their neighbors, which set a <b>lower</b> <b>wage</b> to compete against the new firm.|$|R
30|$|This dual {{labour market}} and the {{restrictions}} imposed by a stringent system of collective bargaining hinder firms to react to changes in economic conditions by adjusting wages. 4 Workers under permanent contracts benefit from wage indexation policies and high firing costs. Therefore, {{it is not surprising}} that temporary workers take most of the burden of labour market adjustments. According to the wdn survey, when Spanish firms were asked about ways to reduce costs in response to potential demand shocks, a notable share of 58 Â % responded they would adjust by reducing temporary employment while only 10 Â % by <b>lowering</b> <b>wages</b> (Izquierdo and Cuadrado 2009). The corresponding averages across firms in European countries show that only 22 Â % of firms would react by reducing employment and 13 Â % by <b>lowering</b> <b>wages</b> (Bentolila etÂ al. 2010).|$|R
