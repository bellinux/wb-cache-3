50|$|A metal-semiconductor {{junction}} is formed between a metal and a semiconductor, creating a Schottky barrier (instead of a semiconductor-semiconductor junction as in conventional diodes). Typical metals used are molybdenum, platinum, chromium or tungsten, and certain silicides (e.g., palladium silicide and platinum silicide), whereas the semiconductor would typically be n-type silicon. The metal side {{acts as the}} anode, and n-type semiconductor acts as the cathode of the diode.

40|$|Abstract. The {{reaction}} and phase {{formation of the}} Ti/SiC Schottky contact {{as a function of}} the annealing temperature (400 ~ 700 oC) were investigated. The Schottky barrier height (φb) and the crystal structure of the samples annealed at the different temperature were measured by the forward current-voltage (IV) characteristics and the x-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. XRD measurements were performed in the ω- 2 θ scan and the pole figure measurement for Ti (101) diffraction peak. The φb was changed as a function of temperature. It was concluded that the φb variation and non-uniformity of the samples annealed at 400 oC, 500 oC, 600 oC and 700 oC was caused by changing the condition at the interface between SiC substrate and Ti.

40|$|The {{superior}} {{characteristics of}} silicon carbide, compared with silicon, have suggested considering this {{material for the}} next generation of power semiconductor devices. Among the different power switches, the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) can provide a very <b>low</b> <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>drop,</b> a high current capability and a fast switching speed. However, in order to compete on the market, it is crucial to a have high current gain and a breakdown voltage close to ideal. Moreover, the absence of conductivity modulation and long-term stability has to be solved. In this thesis, these topics are investigated comparing simulations and measurements. Initially, an efficient etched JTE has been simulated and fabricated. In agreement with the simulations, the fabricated diodes exhibit the highest BV of around 4. 3 kV when a two-zone JTE is implemented. Furthermore, the simulations and measurements demonstrate a good agreement between the electric field distribution inside the device and the optical luminescence measured at breakdown. Additionally, an accurate model to simulate the forward characteristics of 4 H-SiC BJTs is presented. In order to validate the model, the simulated current gains are compared with measurements at different temperatures and different base-emitter geometries. Moreover, the simulations and measurements of the on-resistance are compared at different base currents and different temperatures. This comparison, coupled with a detailed analysis of the carrier concentration inside the BJT, indicates that internal forward biasing of the base-collector junction limits the BJT to operate at high current density and <b>low</b> <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> simultaneously. In agreement with the measurements, a design with a highly-doped extrinsic base is proposed to alleviate this problem. In addition to the static characteristics, the comparison of measured and simulated switching waveforms demonstrates that the SiC BJT can provide fast switching speed when it acts as a unipolar device. This is crucial to have low power losses during transient. Finally, the long-term stability is investigated. It is observed that the electrical stress of the base-emitter diode produces current gain degradation; however, the degradation mechanisms are still unclear. In fact, the analysis of the measured Gummel plot suggests that the reduction of the carrier lifetime in the base-emitter region might be only one of the causes of this degradation. In addition, the current gain degradation due to ionizing radiation is investigated comparing the simulations and measurements. The simulations suggest that the creation of positive charge in the passivation layer can increase the base current; this increase is also observed in the electrical measurements. QC 2012052...|$|E

The Baliga’s figure of merit, 3400, is at least ten times larger than that of 4 H-SiC and four times larger than that of GaN [1]. Furthermore, the large single crystal and low-cost β-Ga 2 O 3 substrate can be fabricated with melt-growth methods such as floating-zone (FZ) [2] and edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG) [3, 4]. The electron density can be controlled over a wide range from 1016 to 1019  cm− 3 by doping with Sn, Si, or Ge [5 – 7].

40|$|With {{the growing}} demand of low and medium voltage {{switch-mode}} power supplies (SMPS) {{for use in the}} state-of-the-art integrated circuits, the development of output rectifiers with <b>low</b> <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> and low reverse leakage current becomes essential. In low voltage SMPS applications (1 to 5 V), the on-state loss of the fast recovery p-i-n diode or the Schottky diode contributes greatly to the total power loss in power supplies. This is due to their forward threshold voltage. One possible way to achieve low on-state losses is to reduce or remove the forward threshold voltage. The first part of this thesis is mainly devoted to a novel Regenerative diode structure based on Silicon material. Its main advantages are reduction or removal of forward threshold voltage and much improved reverse characteristics without the necessity of a gate control like in synchronous rectifiers. The silicon unipolar device application is, however, restricted to relatively low voltages because of on-state and blocking problems at device blocking capabilities above 200 V. For high voltage applications (> 200 V), SiC Schottky or JBS rectifiers have demonstrated a good differential on state resistance and reasonable blocking behavior. In principle, one could try to construct a Regenerative diode like device based on SiC material, but poor hole mobility and much less developed integrated device technology seem to discourage such efforts. However, the second part of this thesis work presents a simulation study on a Si/ 6 H-SiC heterojunction. The p-Si/N- 6 H-SiC heterojunction diode behaves like a Schottky diode but with much lower threshold voltage than that of the 6 H-SiC SBD.

Transient tests evaluated the switching performance of the diodes in either a hard-switched DC to DC buck converter or a half-bridge boost converter. For evaluation and comparison purposes, the same tests were performed with current state-of-the-art ultra fast silicon (Si) pn-junction diodes of similar ratings and also a Si Schottky diode. The comparisons made were <b>forward</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> at rated current, reverse current at rated voltage, and turn-off peak reverse recovery current and reverse recovery time.
