5000|$|... 1988: Several locals {{report the}} same {{sighting}} from water and land, a <b>large</b> black <b>fish</b> <b>with</b> a <b>fin</b> swimming near the surface. These {{are just a}} few of the sightings that have occurred since the outbreak in the 40’s and 50’s. Most of the sightings in recent times take place near Pedro Bay and the fishing village of Iliamna, like the events of 1977 and 1988. With the lack of recent sightings, many have begun to doubt the monster's existence although TV networks such as the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet have managed to feature the monster on episodes of popular series.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Celestial breed, described above, {{is still}} bred and exported by Chinese and Japanese breeders and is commercially available to fanciers, {{though they are}} not as commonly stocked by aquarium shops and dealers as some other goldfish varieties. It is this 240+ year old form that is described in the American standard adopted by the American Goldfish Association and the Goldfish Society of America. British fanciers prefer their Celestials to have deeper bodies and shorter fins, and have selectively bred for these features as required by the British standard. In recent decades, the Chinese have crossed Celestials with several other breeds, most commonly Lionheads, Ranchus and Hana fusas (Pompoms), producing much <b>larger</b> <b>fish</b> <b>with</b> short ranchu-like <b>fins</b> and very deep, blocky bodies, often with narial 'bouquets' (pompoms) and rudimentary headgrowths.|$|R

50|$|Nahmanides {{believed}} that the restrictions against certain fish also addressed health concerns, arguing that <b>fish</b> <b>with</b> <b>fins</b> and scales (and hence ritually clean) typically live in shallower waters than those without fins or scales (i.e., those that were ritually impure), and consequently the latter were much colder and more humid, qualities he believed made their flesh toxic.|$|R
5000|$|Pescetarianism (provided {{the fish}} is ruled kosher - i.e., <b>fish</b> <b>with</b> <b>fins</b> and scales, and usually caught without bloodshed) {{conforms}} to Jewish dietary laws, as kosher fish is [...] "pareve" [...] (or [...] "parve") - neither 'milk' nor 'meat'. In Sephardic Jewish homes, fish is never served with foods made with milk products. All non-fish seafood is non-kosher.|$|R

50|$|Whitefish {{or white}} fish is a {{fisheries}} term referring to {{several species of}} demersal <b>fish</b> <b>with</b> <b>fins,</b> particularly Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Caspian kutum (Rutilus kutum), whiting (Merluccius bilinearis), and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), but also hake (Urophycis), pollock (Pollachius), or others.

He {{said that the}} plaintiffs {{would be able to}} provide many examples of school board members wishing to balance the teaching of evolution with creationism. He attacked prior defense claims that it was a minor affair by saying {{that there is no such}} thing as a [...] "little" [...] constitutional violation. He also provided the definition of creationism given by an early draft of Pandas: [...] "Creation is the theory that various forms of life began abruptly, with their distinctive features already intact: <b>Fish</b> <b>with</b> <b>fins</b> and scales, birds with feathers and wings, mammals with fur and mammary glands."
