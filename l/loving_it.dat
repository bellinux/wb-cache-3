I do music based on how I feel from my heart and that is typically New Guy. New Guy is like a heart fulfilling type of record and to me, I think it actually hit the major impact that I wanted it to hit and people are <b>loving</b> <b>it</b> [...] My fans love it.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2010 when {{recording}} {{her third}} album, Here I Am (2011), Rowland credited both Guetta {{and the song}} for inspiring her to pursue a new sound. Rowland relates: [...] "I spent about a year {{of my life in}} Europe really listening to a whole bunch of Europeans DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really <b>loving</b> <b>it.</b> 'When Love Takes Over' it was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." [...] In 2010, following the success of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] and the duo's musical chemistry, Guetta was asked to work on Rowland's third studio album. He co-produced a couple of the songs including the album's first single, [...] "Commander".|$|E

500|$|Devin Brown of CBS News {{called it}} her best video from Femme Fatale, {{and added that}} unlike [...] "Piece of Me", I Wanna Go' offers a bevy of pop culture {{references}} meant to ridicule the rumors about the star – and finally no 'dancing. An editor from Rolling Stone said [...] "The weirdness seems very calculated, but that doesn't make the video any less delightful." [...] Another critic from Rolling Stone noted that the press conference [...] "is hysterical because she's {{one of the least}} media-accessible singers in the world. It's easier to get a sit-down with Bob Dylan than it is with Britney." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator called the video [...] "delightful" [...] and [...] "flat out funny", explaining that Spears [...] "focuses her energy on being too darn cute (and deliciously naughty) instead of having to worry about dancing, [...] is in on the joke and <b>loving</b> <b>it</b> all." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott Meslow of The Atlantic stated while Titanic {{initially}} {{seems to}} need no defense, given its success, {{it is considered}} a film [...] "for 15-year-old girls" [...] by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing Titanic as fodder for 15-year-old girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: [...] "that [...] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys." [...] Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males {{under the age of}} 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like Iron Man, it is common for boys and men to deny liking Titanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly <b>loving</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe," [...] he stated. [...] "Titanic has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Newman spelt out his {{theology}} of friendship in a sermon he preached on the Feast of St John the Evangelist, traditionally {{thought to be}} the same person as the disciple John, [...] "whom Jesus loved". In the sermon, Newman said: [...] "There have been men before now, who have supposed Christian love was so diffuse as not to admit of concentration upon individuals; so that we ought to love all men equally. ...Now I shall maintain here, in opposition to such notions of Christian love, and with our Saviour's pattern before me, that the best preparation for loving the world at large, and <b>loving</b> <b>it</b> duly and wisely, is to cultivate our intimate friendship and affection towards those who are immediately about us". For Newman, friendship is an intimation of a greater love, a foretaste of heaven. In friendship, two intimate friends gain a glimpse of the life that awaits them in God. Juan R. Vélez writes that someday Newman [...] "may well earn a new title, that of Doctor amicitiae: Doctor of the Church on Friendship. His biography is a treatise on the human and supernatural virtues that make up friendship".|$|E

2500|$|Terry Jones – who co-directed the {{original}} film with Gilliam – expressed his opinions forthrightly in May 2005: [...] "Spamalot is utterly pointless. It's full of air…Regurgitating Python is not high {{on my list}} of priorities." [...] However, when asked whether he liked Spamalot during an interview with Dennis Daniel on 98.5 WBON-FM The Bone shortly after the musical's opening on Broadway, Jones said, [...] "Well, I thought it was terrific good fun. [...] It's great to see the audience <b>loving</b> <b>it.</b> I suppose I had reservations as far as…well…the idea of doing scenes from a film on stage. I just don’t get the point of it. They do them terribly well…I mean, they really are good…but I just quite don’t understand what that's about. [...] It isn’t really 'Python.' It is very much Eric." [...] Jones went on to say, [...] "...I think {{the best parts of}} the musical are the new things. For instance, when they do the Andrew Lloyd Webber take-off and this girl comes in and sings 'Whatever Happened to My Part' since she hasn’t appeared since the opening number and she's really furious! That {{is one of the great}} moments where the show really comes alive for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two records she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it... And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which {{led her to the}} realisation that she [...] "needed refreshing". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted {{to make sure it was}} a look that was all me, you know?." [...] She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel [...] "completely intoxicated!." [...] In July 2010, Rowland said during {{an interview}} with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that [...] "I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really <b>loving</b> <b>it.</b> 'When Love Takes Over' was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 April 2009, while {{preparing}} {{to board a}} British Airways flight at London's Gatwick Airport bound for a concert appearance in Bologna, François Ravard, accompanying Faithfull, was detained and then later arrested. In a statement, British Airways said: [...] "A male customer became aggressive and abusive at check-in when he was refused travel on a flight from Gatwick to Bologna. He appeared to be intoxicated on arrival at check-in. In such circumstances, an assessment is made {{as to whether the}} passenger is fit to travel. When he was refused travel, he became physically and verbally abusive. Police were called and he was arrested. Such behaviour will not be tolerated." [...] Faithfull, however, had not been drinking and was allowed to board. The pair was flying to Italy on a leg of her world tour promoting Easy Come, Easy Go. According to her spokesperson, [...] "Marianne was at Gatwick airport but was not involved in any way in the situation that occurred and she managed to travel on to Bologna as planned. Her gig tonight there will go ahead as planned, and Francois travelled from Britain to join her yesterday. Marianne hadn't been drinking {{at the time of the}} incident and she does not drink alcohol. She is enjoying life and <b>loving</b> <b>it</b> as she is sober and clean." [...] Faithfull revealed that although Ravard was still her manager, their 15-year relationship had ended some months ago. Faithfull stated, [...] "I'm all right but I have had a bit of an adventure – my relationship broke up. I felt very betrayed and lonely. I am much, much better now, but it is not good for your self-esteem." [...] On 3 May 2009, she was featured on CBS News Sunday Morning and interviewed by Anthony Mason in the [...] "Sunday Profile" [...] segment. Both in-studio and on-the-street (New York City) interview segments with Faithfull and Mason were interspersed with extensive biographical and musical footage.|$|E
