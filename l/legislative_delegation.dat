5|$|Mobile's city {{commission}} form {{of government}} was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in City of Mobile v. Bolden, which was remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the district court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission {{form of government}} in 1911 and at-large positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the {{three members of the}} city commission should be elected from single-member districts, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state <b>legislative</b> <b>delegation</b> in 1985 finally enacted a mayor-council form of government, with seven members elected from single-member districts. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice. Since the change to single-member districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.|$|E

25|$|The 1895 state {{constitution}} overturned this, reducing {{the role of}} counties and strengthening the relative {{role of the state}} legislature; essentially the counties were agents of the state and ruled by the General Assembly through the <b>legislative</b> <b>delegation</b> for each county. They are geographically comprehensive; all areas of the state are included in counties. As each county had one state senator, that position was particularly powerful. This status continued until 1973, when the {{state constitution}} was amended to provide for home rule for the counties. During this time the state had changed, with increasing urbanization, but rural counties retained proportionally more power as the legislature was based in representatives elected from counties rather than population districts.|$|E

2500|$|The state {{legislature}} has retained power over local governments {{by refusing to}} pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission. <b>Legislative</b> <b>delegations</b> retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in Baker v. Carr (1964) required that both houses have districts established {{on the basis of}} population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of [...] "one man, one vote". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the {{state legislature}}, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.|$|R
50|$|Despite Birmingham's {{powerful}} {{industrial growth}} and its {{contributions to the}} state economy, its citizens, {{and those of other}} newly developing areas, were underrepresented in the state legislature for years. The rural-dominated legislature refused to redistrict state House and Senate seats from 1901 to the 1960s. In addition, the state legislature had a senate based on one for each county. The state <b>legislative</b> <b>delegations</b> controlled counties. This led to a stranglehold on the state by a white rural minority. The contemporary interests of urbanizing, industrial cities {{and tens of thousands of}} citizens were not adequately represented in the government. One result was that Jefferson County, home of Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state. It received back only 1/67th of the tax money, as the state legislature ensured taxes were distributed equally to each county regardless of population.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the relative importance of}} regional and national forces in shaping the behavior of Brazilian legislators at the national level.

2500|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{population}} and {{wealth of the}} city, Birmingham residents were markedly underrepresented in the state legislature. Although the state constitution required redistricting in accordance with changes in the decennial census, the state legislature did not undertake this {{at any time during}} the 20th century until the early 1970s, when forced by the United States Supreme Court in the landmark decision Reynolds v. Sims. Birmingham-area voters had sued to force redistricting, and the Court in its ruling cited the principle of [...] "one man, one vote". The Court found that the geographic basis of the state senate, which gave each county one senator, gave undue influence to rural counties. Representatives of rural counties also had disproportionate power in the state House of Representatives, and had failed to provide support for infrastructure and other improvements in urban centers such as Birmingham, having little sympathy for urban populations. Prior to this time, the General Assembly ran county governments as extensions of the state through their <b>legislative</b> <b>delegations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{local governments}} in South Carolina have been fairly weak. The 1867 {{constitution}} established home rule for counties. This was changed under the 1895 Constitution, which made {{no provision for}} local government and effectively reduced counties to creatures of the state. Each county's delegation to the General Assembly also doubled as its county council. Under this system, the state senator from each county exercised the most power. [...] Reynolds v. Sims required reapportionment according {{to the principle of}} [...] "one man, one vote", which resulted in legislative districts crossing county lines. However, it was not until 1973 that the constitution was amended to provide for limited home rule at the county level. The Home Rule Act in 1975 implemented this. [...] This law provided for elected councils in each county. Nonetheless, the legislature still devotes considerable time to local issues, and county <b>legislative</b> <b>delegations</b> still decide many matters that are handled at the county level in most other states.|$|R

40|$|According to {{a widely}} held view of Brazilian politics, {{part of the}} {{difficulty}} Presidents experience in governing the country {{stems from the fact}} that national legislators respond to pressures from the States rather than from the national government. Based on the argument, governors use their institutional position not only to influence national debates, but also to determine outcomes via the control they exert over their States' <b>legislative</b> <b>delegations.</b> In this paper we examine an extensive data set composed of all roll-call votes taken in the Chamber of Deputies from 1989 to 2006 in order to separate and evaluate the impact of local pressures on the behavior of national legislators. The data span five Presidencies and four different legislatures and show that, although present, the local influence is weaker than that of the national government in the voting decisions of individual legislators We argue that there are institutional resources that allow the central government to counter the centrifugal pressures exerted by federalism and other aspects of Brazil's current institutional system...|$|R
40|$|Executive {{turnover}} influences agency performance, policy implementation, {{and ultimately}} the success of <b>legislative</b> <b>delegations.</b> We argue that turnover intention {{is a function of}} labor market opportunities—specifically, outside employment opportunities and the acquisition of nontransferable, agency-specific human capital—as well as perceptions about the way in which political decisions have affected federal executive influence over policymaking. Statistical evidence for these claims is provided using data from the 2007 – 2008 Survey on the Future of Government Service, the largest ever survey of US federal executives. Agency-specific human capital drives down turnover intention in our estimates. The avail-ability of outside options has the opposite effect except in cases where the executive has invested a lot in agency-specific human capital. Turnover intention increases when an agency’s senior executives have little influence over policy. We draw out the implications of these findings for our understanding of federal labor markets, the construction of civil service systems, and the politicization of executive branch agencies.

50|$|Connecticut {{had very}} strong state parties, with the GOP led by leaders, such as A. Searle Pinney. John Bailey {{was the state}} {{chairman}} of the Democrats from 1946 to his death in 1975; {{he was also the}} party's national chairman, 1961 until 1968. These party leaders controlled their <b>legislative</b> <b>delegations</b> and ran the state conventions that selected nominees for the top offices. The old WASP element was still a factor in rural Connecticut, but Catholics comprised 44% of the state's population and dominated all of the industrial cities. With the ethnics loyal to the Democratic Party, and labor unions at their peak, the Democratic Party strongly endorsed the New Deal coalition and its liberalism. The Republican Party was mildly liberal, typified by Senator Prescott Bush, a wealthy Yankee whose son and grandson were later each elected as president from their new conservative base in Texas. Connecticut had some difficulty in projecting its identity, with no big-league sports teams and its media markets dominated by outside television stations in New York, Providence, Rhode Island and Springfield, Massachusetts. Bailey's contact with the liberal element that dominated the Democratic Party was Ella Grasso. He promoted her from the legislature, to Secretary of State, to Congress, and finally to the governorship.|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutionality}} of legislative preclusion {{of judicial review}} has received considerable attention from constitutional and administrative law scholars. We join this debate by proposing a new approach: a standards-based theory of judicial review based on two fundamental principles. First, whenever government officials make decisions involving the application of legal standards, {{the rule of law}} – and hence the rule of law safeguards of due process and judicial review – attach. Second, with the exception of those cases in which the Constitution itself contemplates standardless official discretion, <b>legislative</b> <b>delegations</b> of authority to government actors must contain legal standards that guide and control discretion. Because the availability of judicial review is tied to the existence of standards and standards are in most instances constitutionally required, the standards-based approach supports a broad right to Article III judicial review that would encompass most administrative decisions, including decisions concerning government benefits. We are not the first scholars to argue that the Constitution requires Article III review of government benefit decisions (or other agency action), but the standards-based approach offers a novel and, we believe, more coherent and workable approach to these fundamental constitutional issues. In support of these conclusions, we demonstrate how Court’s current approach to preclusion is plagued by doctrinal incoherence that ultimately permits Congress to curtail or dispense with this essential rule of law safeguard. We also explain how a standards-based approach can be reconciled with constitutional text and Supreme Court authority, noting in particular that Marbury v. Madison, the seminal opinion concerning the rule of law, indicates that Article III review of the government benefit decisions of the Executive Branch is constitutionally compelled...|$|R
