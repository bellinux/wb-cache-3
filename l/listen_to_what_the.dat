[...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, {{increasing the amount of}} conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue {{at the drop of a}} hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, I had more time, and I focused more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E
2500|$|The {{director}} {{found his}} cinematic style during {{the making of}} this film. According to Rivette, [...] "With improvisation, you automatically listen" [...] and an author is an [...] "analyst, a person who must <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> people say—all words are important. You must listen to all and not have any preconceived ideas as a director". Invigorated by his new filmmaking technique, Rivette invited over forty actors (including Jean-Pierre Leaud, Juliet Berto, Michael Lonsdale and Bulle Ogier) to each develop a character for a new film without a plot or interaction with each other. He then developed the basic structure for what would become Out 1. From April to June 1970, Rivette shot over 30 hours of 16mm footage as his cast improvised a story involving conspiracy theories and theatrical rehearsals.|$|E

60|$|Presently {{a shower}} came up, and this drove the {{passengers}} to {{the cars and}} the station. I got aboard the train at first to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> train hands might have to say. I found one of the brakemen quite a friendly fellow, and willing to talk.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{guess they}} are not," [...] replied Maxton, smiling; [...] "but justice is strangely {{administered}} in these parts. Judge Lynch usually presides, {{and he is}} a stern fellow to deal with. If you <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hunter, there, is saying just now, you will hear a case in point, if I mistake not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is prejudiced," [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. McLean warmly, prejudice being {{a failing}} which all women marvel at. [...] "Just <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> boy said to Elspeth to-day. He said to her, 'When I am away, {{try for a}} whole day {{to be better than}} you ever were before, and think of nothing else, and then when prayer-time comes you will see that you have been happy without knowing it.'

60|$|The constable {{made a note}} of {{this and}} {{presently}} called on Hardie, who had just returned to town after visiting a sick farmer. <b>The</b> former <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> minister had <b>to</b> say, but was not much impressed.

60|$|Having {{acquired}} {{a large number}} of the names of objects, Roger, for a time, came to a standstill. Then it struck him that by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> old woman said to the girls, and by watching what they did, he might make a step farther.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{sat down}} to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> old oil man might have to say. Mr. Ogilvie {{remained}} {{the best part of}} an hour, and then went off, stating that he would be around again the next day. As soon as he had departed the boys, making sure that no one else was within hearing, told Jack's father of all they had learned concerning Carson Davenport and the men associated with him. Dick Rover listened with intense interest, his face clouding as they proceeded.|$|E
6000|$|Let us {{listen to}} what God Himself says. Let us <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Lord Jesus Christ, the Word of God, says.

What did the Lord Jesus Christ say that eternal life was? ...|$|E
60|$|Two grey eyes lurked {{deep within}} this agent's head, {{but one of}} them had no sight in it, and stood stock still. With that side of his face he seemed to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> other side was doing. Thus each profile had a {{distinct}} expression; and when the movable side was most in action, the rigid one was in its coldest state of watchfulness. It was like turning the man inside out, to pass to that view of his features in his liveliest mood, and see how calculating and intent they were.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you've {{made some}} enemies {{as well as}} some friends, eh?" [...] remarked Songbird Powell, after he had been registered, taken up to his room, and had <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Rover boys had to tell.

"Not he; {{or if he}} does, no {{decent man}} would think of posting himself before a lady's window to do such a thing.--Orlando Furioso," [...] calling to her eldest son, a boy of eleven, [...] "run over to Mr. Jones's store, and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> people are talking about, and bring me back the news, as soon as any thing worth hearing drops from any body; and stop as you come back, my son, and borrow {{neighbour}} Brown's gridiron.

"Content you, my friend," [...] said Simon, [...] "with knowing that, if {{you judge}} Father Clement {{by what you}} see him do and hear him say, you will {{think of him as}} the best and kindest man in the world, with a comfort for every man's grief, a counsel for every man's difficulty, the rich man's surest guide, and the poor man's best friend. But if you <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Dominicans say of him, he is--Benedicite!--(here the glover crossed himself on brow and bosom)--a foul heretic, who ought by means of earthly flames to be sent to those which burn eternally." ...|$|E
60|$|The thunder, {{which seemed}} in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his {{face from the}} table, bent forward to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> woman should say. The faces of the three nearly touched, {{as the two men}} leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible. The sickly rays of the {{suspended}} lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme.|$|E
6000|$|But the fisherman's {{wife had}} <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{old man had}} said about paying for the job, and she was of a {{different}} mind from her husband.

60|$|They were landed. Could {{it be that}} Berenger {{was only}} two miles--only half an hour's walk form Eustacie? The bound his heart gave as he touched the shore seemed to stifle him.

60|$|Then, {{here comes}} the worshipful Captain Curwen, sheriff of Essex, on horseback, {{at the head of}} an armed guard, escorting a company of {{condemned}} prisoners from the jail to their place of execution on Gallows Hill. The witches! There is no mistaking them! The witches! As they approach up Prison Lane, and turn into the Main Street, let us watch their faces, as if we made a part of the pale crowd that presses so eagerly about them, yet shrinks back with such shuddering dread, leaving an open passage betwixt a dense throng on either side. <b>Listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> people say.|$|E
60|$|But Verkimier's anticipations {{in regard}} to that paradise {{were not to be}} realised. The evil passions of a wicked man, with whom he had {{personally}} nothing whatever to do, interfered with his plans. In {{the middle of the night}} a native Malay youth named Babu arrived at the village and demanded an interview with the chief. That worthy, after the interview, conducted the youth to the hut where his visitors lived, and, rousing Van der Kemp without disturbing the others, bade him <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> young man had to say. An expression of great anxiety overspread the hermit's usually placid countenance while Babu was speaking.|$|E

He sought {{to have an}} organic feeling to the score and explored implementing orchestral and electronic elements that would have [...] "a real human element to them that breathes". Contrary to most films' scores composed in post-production, Mansell's score was composed concurrently with the film's production; he created a mood that flourished as the film progressed. The composer described the parallel process, [...] "It's instinct and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> film is telling you it needs".|$|R
