2500|$|In machine <b>learning,</b> <b>support</b> vector {{machines}} (SVMs, {{also support}} vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. [...] Given {{a set of}} training examples, each marked as belonging to {{one or the other}} of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.|$|E

40|$|Given {{that more}} than $ 170 Billion is {{invested}} annually on employee learning and development in the U.

In any organization, workers require new knowledge and skills to become productive and maintain performance over time. Millennials, who comprise the latest employee generation, are age 18 - 34 (Tyler, 2007) and share the same performance requirements and expectations of the generations that precede them in the workforce. The organizational <b>learning</b> <b>supports</b> to help millennials improve their learning in the workplace remain largely undefined. For the purposes of this research effort, organizational <b>learning</b> <b>supports</b> are the tools and resources provided by an organization to promote knowledge transfer. To efficiently and effectively meet the learning goals set forth for millennials in workplace settings, scholars must research, and learning practitioners must consider the organizational <b>learning</b> <b>supports</b> that millennials prefer for learning. This study utilized an interpretative qualitative design (Merriam, 2002), that uncovered the experiences millennials had with organizational <b>learning</b> <b>supports</b> to understand which supports they prefer. Data was analyzed inductively using a constant-comparative method and yielded three themes: (a) millennials appreciate big-picture understanding, new information, and rapid application to help them learn and perform on the job, (b) millennials prefer having the option to learn independently or in small groups to deepen their understanding of new knowledge, and (c) millennials want resources that provide answers to questions that fill knowledge gaps...|$|R

ABSTRACT: The thesis work has {{resulted from the}} systematization of theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge {{in the field of}} e-learning education both in the context of adult education. Its target was a complex conception of e-learning education in its wider view with focus on lifelong education, gradually zooming in on the particularities of co-directing of learning satisfying adult learners' education needs with elaborate online <b>learning</b> <b>supports</b> and a tutor's support. It presents a row of arguments and reasons for the need of pursuing the e-learning education especially in the context of lifelong education and also seeking the advantages, regularly following and evaluating as well as improving the design of online <b>learning</b> <b>supports</b> and tutors' activities in this education sphere. Based on the empiric data gained in a questionnaire research the work tries to penetrate the field of learning aspects of the online <b>learning</b> <b>supports</b> and tutoring and to follow some aspects of the respondents' behaviour which influence their perception of the learning aspects. The lack of systematic studies focused on finding the correlations is the main [...] ...|$|R
