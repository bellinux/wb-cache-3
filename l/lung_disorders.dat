Methods: Data were obtained from a sample of 6, 726 subjects aged 40 + from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured using spirometry. Gender-, ethnicity-, and age-specific equations were {{used to calculate the}} lower limit of normal (LLN) to define obstructive <b>lung</b> <b>disorder</b> as: observed FEV 1 /FVC ratio and FEV 1 below respective LLN. Zinc intake was assessed by questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate the associations of interest. Results: The analyses showed that an increased prevalence of obstructive <b>lung</b> <b>disorder</b> was observed among individuals with low zinc intake regardless of smoking status. The adjusted odds of <b>lung</b> <b>disorder</b> are approximately 1. 9 times greater for subjects in the lowest zinc-intake tertile than those in the highest tertile (odds ratio = 1. 89, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 22 - 2. 93). The effect of smoking on lung function decreased considerably after adjusting for urinary cadmium. Protective association between the zinc-to-cadmium ratio (log-transformed) and respiratory risk suggests that zinc {{may play a role in}} smoking-associated <b>lung</b> <b>disorder</b> by modifying the influence of cadmium.

25|$|Gene therapy {{involves}} supplying {{a functional}} gene to cells lacking that function, {{with the aim}} of correcting a genetic disorder or acquired disease. Gene therapy can be broadly divided into two categories. The first is alteration of germ cells, that is, sperm or eggs, which results in a permanent genetic change for the whole organism and subsequent generations. This “germ line gene therapy” is {{considered by many to be}} unethical in human beings. The second type of gene therapy, “somatic cell gene therapy”, is analogous to an organ transplant. In this case, one or more specific tissues are targeted by direct treatment or by removal of the tissue, addition of the therapeutic gene or genes in the laboratory, and return of the treated cells to the patient. Clinical trials of somatic cell gene therapy began in the late 1990s, mostly for the treatment of cancers and blood, liver, and <b>lung</b> <b>disorders.</b>|$|E
