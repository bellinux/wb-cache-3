5|$|Until 1500 the legates met most of {{the time}} in Lucerne, but also in Zürich, Baden, Bern, Schwyz etc., but {{sometimes}} also at places outside of the confederation, such as Constance. From the Swabian War in 1499 onwards until Reformation, most conferences met in Zurich. Afterwards the town hall at Baden, where the annual accounts of the common people had been held regularly since 1426, became the most frequent, but not the sole place of assembly. After 1712 Frauenfeld gradually dissolved Baden. From 1526, the Catholic conferences were held mostly in Lucerne, the Protestant conferences from 1528 mostly in Aarau, the one for the <b>legitimation</b> of the French Ambassador in Solothurn. At the same time the syndicate for the Ennetbirgischen Vogteien located in the present Ticino met from 1513 in Lugano and Locarno.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{identify}} the dominant <b>legitimations</b> of literature study in five literature textbooks for the upper secondary school in Sweden and how these <b>legitimations</b> are realized textually and visually. Focusing on paratexts (covers and preface), text–image relations, the representation of authorship and genre the analysis draws theoretically and methodologically upon multimodality, discourse analysis and genre theory. The result indicates several similar legitimations: the study of literature is associated with personal growth, pleasure and how history affects the present. It also shows how Visual resources as well as specific voices are used to underpin interpersonal relations in order to convey the <b>legitimations.</b> However the <b>legitimations</b> are realized differently in textbooks with different disposition. In predominantly chronologically organized textbooks the <b>legitimations</b> emphasize images depicting historical artifacts, the cultural value of the authorship and genre discussions. Thematically organized textbooks concentrate on <b>legitimations</b> concerning contemporary literature and images, identification and the interplay of the reader and the text. One conclusion is that albeit all textbooks in this research are intended for the theoretical programs at the upper secondary school the textbooks convey different discourses of literature and thus provide different conditions for the teaching of literature which {{raise the question of}} equivalence. A second conclusion is that the interplay between the textbook author and the reader is emphasized although {{there is a lack of}} critical and analytical perspective. For example there are generally few references to contemporary theory, and male/female authorships are treated unequally. All in all the textbooks seem to be more concerned with convincing students, in text and images, to read literature than actually provide them with substantial analytical tools...|$|R

40|$|Since the Canadian {{government}} became legislatively {{involved in}} sport in 1961, it has increasingly privileged high performance sport (HPS) initiatives over {{those associated with}} participatory sport and physical activity (PSPA). The emergence of Bill C- 12, The Physical Activity and Sport Act (PASA), in 2003 brought with it many suggestions that government priorities could be shifting toward PSPA. An examination of selected policies, the legislative process that preceded the passage of PASA, and PASA itself reveals that HPS priorities continue to dominate the federal agenda. Additionally, utilizing an established framework for critical policy analysis, dominant <b>legitimations</b> and attributions were identified. Findings suggest that the most common attributions - a sport dispute resolution centre, access and equity for francophone athletes, and public financial resources for HPS - do not sufficiently address the most common <b>legitimations</b> - reproducing values and maintaining the health, fitness, and physical abilities of Canadian citizens...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – “Contending legitimations” (Meyer and Scott) {{in cities}} – and {{especially}} multiple conflicting institutional pressures on decision makers – {{have not received}} sufficient accounting study. Therefore this paper aims to analyse the multiple institutional pressures on the performance measurement (PM) practices of two Finnish cities and answer why the developments and the coupling of budget or PM rules and routines were different in these relatively similar case cities. Design/methodology/approach – In this interpretive study, a comparative case setting (e. g. including several semi-structured interviews) was used. Findings – Contending <b>legitimations</b> affect the coupling of city budgeting and PM rules and routines. It was found that a city is likely to experience decoupling of formal PM rules and routines if there are conflicting normative institutional pressures among decision makers (especially among City Board members). Research limitations/implications – As case studies cannot be generalized, further research on the institutional pressures on accounting PM in cities is encouraged. Practical implications – Noting the contending <b>legitimations</b> may facilitate the management of projects for accounting change in cities. Originality/value – The paper contributes to accounting literature by illustrating the multiple institutional pressures and their effects on PM developments and on PM coupling in the case cities. As a refinement to the works by Abernethy and Chua, Granlund, and Ribeiro and Scapens contending <b>legitimations</b> can explain some complexities of PM related decision making {{as well as the}} will of key actors to promote or postpone changes.

40|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} {{texts from}} 'Dark Age' Britain is De Excidio Britanniae (DEB), 'The Fall of Britain', by Gildas. The traditional placing of this text within an insular sixth-century British Church has influenced a construct of Gildas as a 'Dark Age' monk or cleric, monastically educated and isolated from classical tradition and continental orthodoxy. This construct has been challenged by textual analyses from Franyois Kerlouegan, Thomas O'Sullivan, Neil Wright, Michael Lapidge et al. The intention of this thesis is to re-examine the literary context of the DEB {{in order to further}} refine the cultural <b>legitimations</b> used by Gildas in shaping his critical letter to the leaders of a divided Britannia. These cultural <b>legitimations</b> will argue that the author of the DEB draws on romanitas, prophecy and an ascetic tradition resistant to the authority of Augustine to articulate a harsh critique of the behaviour of political leaders and clergy. In doing so, Gildas appears to legitimate his text with cultural, literary and religious themes more appropriate to the late-fifth century than the mid-sixth century...|$|R
40|$|A {{case study}} of Gymnastics Canada Gymnastique aided in {{creating}} a contemporary framework for youth sport policy development. Youth involved in elite sport are in a subsidiary position to those who control the sport environment, and therefore {{are in need of}} certain levels of protection. High performance youth athletes may be subject to numerous problems such as competitive anxiety, disrupted family life, and excessive physiological and psychological stress. In order to explore these issues in relation to federal sport policy, the following sub-problems were identified: (a) What are the process(es), <b>legitimation(s)</b> (rationale) and attribution(s) (strategies for action) of federal government sport policies (1961 [...] 2000) in relation to youth, elite athletes, and youth elite athletes? (b) What structure currently exists within Gymnastics Canada Gymnastique (GCG) in relation to youth elite athletes? (c) What issues are relevant to those affected by policy (i. e., coaches and athletes) ?

Here, moving beyond Bourdieu and utilizing the recent writings of Latour, we seek to elucidate the on-going value of the notion of habitus for articulating the complex relations between culture and religion today by reconceptualising it as something reflexively re-made, or instaured, through the active cultivation of a particular mode of embodied subjectivity; a reconceptualization we develop with reference to Christian Pentecostalism and the Islamic piety movement...|$|R
