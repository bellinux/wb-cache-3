25|$|In {{the lower}} leg, the {{anterior}} tibial enters the extensor compartment near the upper {{border of the}} interosseus membrane to descend between the tibialis anterior and the extensor hallucis longus. Distal to the superior and extensor retinacula of the foot it becomes the dorsal artery of the foot. The posterior tibial forms a direct continuation of the popliteal artery which enters the flexor compartment of the lower leg to descend behind the medial malleolus where it divides into the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>arteries,</b> of which the posterior branch {{gives rise to the}} fibular artery.|$|R
50|$|The lateral tarsal artery (tarsal artery) {{arises from}} the dorsalis pedis, as that vessel crosses the navicular bone; it passes in an arched {{direction}} lateralward, lying upon the tarsal bones, and covered by extensor hallucis brevis and extensor digitorum brevis; it supplies these muscles and the articulations of the tarsus, and receives the arcuate over {{the base of the}} fifth metatarsal. It may receive contributions from branches of the anterior lateral malleolar and the perforating branch of the peroneal artery directed towards the joint capsule, and from the <b>lateral</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>arteries</b> through perforating arteries of the foot.|$|R
40|$|Unusual {{course and}} {{branching}} {{pattern of the}} tibial arteries were discovered during routine anatomical dissection of the right lower extremity of a 61 -year-old female cadaver. The arteries of the crural region arose from the popliteal artery, as usual. However, the anterior tibial artery was hypoplastic and supplying the anterior calf muscles ended above the ankle joint. Instead, the posterior tibial artery gave off a large anterior branch, which crossed the lowest portion of the interosseous membrane and prolonged as the most distal continuation of the anterior tibial artery –the dorsalis pedis artery. The rest of the posterior tibial artery continued its course distally and divided into the usual medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>arteries.</b> We briefly review the reported variations of the tibial arteries and discussed their clinical relevance...|$|R

50|$|The deep plantar artery (ramus plantaris profundus; {{communicating}} artery) descends {{into the}} sole of the foot, between the two heads of the first Interosseous dorsalis, and unites with the termination of the <b>lateral</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery,</b> to complete the plantar arch.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{report a}} {{retrospective}} analysis of our experience in bypass vein graft surgery to <b>lateral</b> tarsal, medial <b>plantar,</b> and <b>lateral</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>arteries</b> for treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI). MethodsBetween January 1991 and February 2010, we performed 137 inframalleolar bypass graft surgeries; of these, 25 (18 %) were conducted using foot branch arteries for distal implant. All patients were treated for CLI and most had extensive infrapopliteal atherosclerotic disease (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus D). Mean follow-up was 46. 32 months (range, 0 - 144 months). Main end points analyzed were cumulative patency, limb salvage, and survival. Statistic analysis of all end points was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. ResultsThere was a predominance of men (64 %), and the group mean age was 66. 3 years. Diabetes mellitus was the main associated disease. Eighty percent of ulcers or gangrene were restricted to the midfoot (Rutherford V CLI classification). There was a predominance of short-length grafts using the great saphenous vein as the main conduit (72 %). The medial <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> was the main outflow artery (52 %). Early graft occlusion occurred in four patients (primary failure rate, 16 %). Secondary patency at 1 and 3 years was 49 % and 36. 8 %, respectively, and limb salvage was 81. 7 % and 69 %, respectively. Nine major amputations occurred, and 10 other minor amputations were necessary. Survival rate at 3 years was 65. 4 %, and 67 % of patients maintained ambulation. Surgical mortality was 8 %. No condition was associated with worse results with regard to secondary patency, limb salvage, or survival. ConclusionsLong-term results for developed foot branch bypass demonstrated good results for limb salvage, {{and it is an}} acceptable surgery for patients with extensive atherosclerotic disease...|$|R

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether limb-salvage bypass operation improves outcomes in patients with critical infrapopliteal ischemia and poor or no distal arterial flow on angiography. Methods: Forty-nine patients with severe tibial and peroneal occlusive disease and poor distal arterial flow on angiography were included in this prospective study. The age ranged from 57 to 82 years in the surgical group and 63 to 80 in the medical group. Patients had class III or IV disease according to Fontaine classification. Preoperative arterial Doppler ultrasonography and arteriography were performed in all patients. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was calculated preoperatively and postoperatively {{in all of the}} cases. Twenty-three patients underwent distal bypass operation. Other 26 patients were followed with medical therapy. The outflow distal anastomoses were performed on posterior tibial, dorsal pedal, anterior tibial, peroneal, and <b>lateral</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>arteries.</b> All patients were followed-up for 3 years and clinical outcomes were recorded. The statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t, Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon tests. Results: There were 3 early and 2 late graft failures. Limb salvage rates were 84. 2 %, 84. 2 %, 73. 7 % in the surgical group, and 82. 8 %, 69. 9 %, 64. 3 % in the medical group respectively in 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years. According to statistical analysis; the levels of the amputations tend to be lower in the surgical group than in the medical group but it was not significant statistically. Surgical treatment reduced the amputation ratio (p 0. 05). The difference between preoperative mean ABI [0. 26 ± 0. 06] and postoperative mean ABI [0. 80 ± 0. 24] was significant (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: We think that limb-salvage bypass operation may be preferred for patients with critical limb ischemia and poor distal flow on angiography. Infrapopliteal bypass will provide limb salvage and a functional extremity...|$|R

40|$|Vascular injury {{resulting}} in pseudoaneurysm {{formation in the}} plantar aspect of the foot is an uncommon injury after trauma. Such injuries are more often reported in the <b>lateral</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> rather than the medial plantar artery, most likely because of its more superficial location. Traditional modalities in diagnosis have included ultrasound and digital subtraction angiography. We present a case of traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the <b>lateral</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> following a foot laceration.

40|$|The pedicled medial plantar (MP) flap is {{an optimal}} {{solution}} for defects involving the weight-bearing {{areas of the}} foot. However, venous congestion is a frequently encountered complication, especially with the reverse-flow variants of the flap, and several strategies {{have been reported in}} literature both to prevent and to manage it. In this article, we present the use of a medial plantar flap based distally on the <b>lateral</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> with the adjunct of an extra metatarsal perforator from the dorsalis pedis artery as a vascular enhancement to avoid the venous congestion and to improve the overall circulation. This bipedicled flap was successfully advanced to cover a 5 × 3 cm soft-tissue defect located {{at the level of the}} first and second metatarsal heads of the right foot resulting from the excision of a squamous cell carcinoma in an 80 -year-old male patient with a history of cardiovascular disease. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged 7 days after the operation and was able to walk after 6 weeks wearing normal shoes.
