50|$|The {{large scale}} model of {{materials}} {{is based on}} the fact that crack deflection is an important toughening mechanism of nacre. This deflection happens because of the weak interfaces between the aragonite tiles. Systems on the macroscopic scales are used to imitate these week interfaces with <b>layered</b> <b>composite</b> ceramic tablets that are held together by weak interface “glue”. Hence, these large scale models can overcome the brittleness of ceramics. Since other mechanisms like tablet locking and damage spreading also play a role in the toughness of nacre, other models assemblies inspired by the waviness of microstructure of nacre have also been devised on the large scale.|$|E

It has been suggested that the degreasing and then scratch brushing of surfaces create a strong bonding between the layers. Bonding mechanisms, in which the film theory is expressed as the major mechanism in CRB, as well as bonding theoretical models, have also been reviewed. It has also been showed that it is easy for fcc structure metals to bond compared with bcc and hcp structure metals. In addition, hardness on bonding same metals plays an important part in CRB.

40|$|Ceramic {{materials}} have through their brittle-elastic fracture behaviour today often disadvantages {{in terms of}} technical applicability. Inspired by nacre it is attempted to address this fundamental disadvantage and to push the development of ceramic-polymer <b>layer</b> <b>composites.</b> The objective {{is to provide a}} novel material with improved fracture toughness compared to previously known ceramic composite materials. Due to the task, this paper is divided into the part of an extensive characterization of nacre and into the section of the development of a ceramic-polymer <b>layer</b> <b>composite.</b> Nacre shows a regular structure of individual aragonite platelets, which are covered by an organic matrix. The different mechanical studies of the natural model show that the enormous increase in fracture toughness compared to the values of the individual components and the large ductility are affected by the intermediate polymer layers. By varying the temperature and humidity conditions of the organic matrix this result is further confirmed. The production of ceramic-polymer <b>layer</b> <b>composites</b> is done by gluing individual thin ceramic sheets with high performance characteristics. The properties of the used polymers plus the material and shape of the ceramic sheets are varied thereby. Tolerant fracture behaviour can be achieved with this new material by a suitable stiffness ratio between polymer and ceramic. The fracture mechanical investigations indicate a significant increase in fracture toughness compared to the single ceramic components. The material develops with increasing crack length even an increase of the crack resistance. With the combination of high hardness and strength of the engineering ceramic and the large elasticity of the adhesives it is possible to develop a ceramic-polymer <b>layer</b> <b>composite,</b> which exhibits improved fracture toughness and is therefore highly resistant to mechanical stress...|$|R
