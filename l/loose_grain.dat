60|$|When Mrs. McKinstry hurled her denial {{from the}} barn, {{he had taken}} {{advantage}} of the greater surprise to leap to one of the trusses of hay that projected beyond the loft, and secure a footing from which he quickly scrambled through the open scantling to the interior. The master who, startled by his voice, had made his way through the <b>loose</b> <b>grain</b> to the rear, reached it as Seth half crawled, half tumbled through. Their eyes met in a single flash of rage, but before Seth could utter an outcry, the master had dropped his gun, seized him around the neck and crammed a thick handful of the soft hay he had hurriedly snatched up into his face and gasping mouth. A furious but silent struggle ensued; the yielding hay on which they both fell deadened all sound of a scuffle and concealed them from view; masses of it, already loosened by the intruder's entrance, and dislodged in their contortions began to slip through the opening to the ground. The master, still uppermost and holding Seth firmly down, allowed himself to slip with them, shoving his adversary before him; the maddened Missourian detecting his purpose, made a desperate attempt to change his position, and succeeded in raising his knee against the master's chest. Ford, guarding against what seemed to be only a wrestler's strategy, contented himself by locking the bent knee firmly in that position, and thus unwittingly gave Seth the looked-for opportunity of drawing the bowie-knife concealed in his boot leg. He knew his mistake only as Seth violently freed his arm, and threw it upward for the blow. He heard the steel slither like a scythe through the hay, and unlocking his hold desperately threw himself on the uplifted arm. The movement saved him. For the released body of Seth slipped rapidly through the opening, upheld for a single instant on the verge by the grasp of the master's two hands on the arm that still held the knife, and then dropped heavily downward. Even then, the hay that had slipped before him would have broken his fall, but his head came in violent contact with some farming implements standing against the wall, and without a cry he was stretched senseless on the ground. The whole occurrence passed so rapidly and so noiselessly that not only did McKinstry's challenge fall upon his already unconscious ears, but the loosened hay which in the master's struggles to recover himself still continued to slide gently from the loft, actually hid him from the eyes of the spectators who sought him a moment afterwards. A mass of hay and wild oats, dislodged apparently by Mrs. McKinstry in securing her defences, was all that met their eyes; even the woman herself was unconscious of the deadly struggle that had taken place above her.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} the motion of diamond grains on the material removal rate and surface roughness in the lapping of Mn-Zn polycrystalline ferrite using a Sn lapping plate and 0. 3 μm diamond abrasives. The diamond grains can be classified into fixed and <b>loose</b> <b>grains.</b> The grains fixed to a lapping plate were confirmed by SEM and AFM observations. Among many experimental parameters, the change of the pitch of fine grooves on a lapping plate formed by the facing operation has a significant effect on the removal rate. This agrees well with the calculated number of <b>loose</b> <b>grains</b> under various pitches of groove. The average removal rate with fixed and <b>loose</b> <b>grains</b> was found to be about 2. 7 times higher than that with only fixed grains. These results indicate that during lapping, the material is mainly removed by <b>loose</b> <b>grains.</b> It is evident from AFM images that the lapped surface with material removed by fixed grains differs very much from that with material removed simultaneously by fixed and <b>loose</b> <b>grains...</b>|$|R

30|$|Analyzing the {{achieved}} results, {{the first}} comment, {{related to the}} loose grains packing density is that, {{in the range of}} α typical of these HEXs (i.e., between 0.7 and 0.4), the difference in COP is ranging between 1 and 3 %, comparing γ[*]=[*] 0.74 and γ[*]=[*] 0.64. In the same α range, comparing the most effective foam solution (ZF- 70) with the high packing density <b>loose</b> <b>grain</b> solution, the foam one is always more efficient, reaching a COP increase of 7 % when α[*]=[*] 0.4. The beneficial effect of the foam on the adsorber efficiency is even more pronounced for low α values (i.e., below 0.4). On the contrary, the <b>loose</b> <b>grain</b> solution is more efficient when the empty HEX volume is higher. This behavior can be justified by the fact that, when there is a big available volume, the effect of the packing density is less relevant.|$|E
30|$|The {{parameter}} γ, {{representing the}} package {{density of the}} solid between the HEX fins, varies passing from the <b>loose</b> <b>grains</b> configuration to the composite foam. Indeed, for the latter, this parameter is equal to 1.0, since the whole volume can be filled with the foam itself. On the contrary, the packing density of SAPO- 34 grains, assumed as spheres, is not a uniquely defined problem. Indeed, {{it is known that}} the theoretical maximum achievable packing density is about 0.74, but typical values obtained randomly dispersing mono-sized spheres in a confined volume are in the range of 0.64 [42]. Accordingly, the cooling COP was calculated for two <b>loose</b> <b>grains</b> configurations (with γ equal to 0.74 and 0.64) and for five foam configurations (i.e., ZF- 70, ZF- 66, ZF- 60, ZF- 50 and ZF- 40).|$|R

In the second trial two anticoagulant baits, chlorophacinone 0. 005 % on rolled oats and embedded in paraffin, and diphacinone 0. 0052 % on various grains and embedded in paraffin, were compared to strychnine-treated 0. 29 % whole wheat grain bait.

The degree of correspondence of these various planar measurements to the volume measurements was determined by regres-sion analysis. Results of the analysis indicate that the best estimator of the size of a <b>loose</b> <b>grain</b> is the projected area of the grain.

40|$|Suffusion is {{one major}} reason for {{dysfunctions}} of earth dams and embankments. Suffusion as a self-filtration process occurs when loose grains are mobilised and transported {{through a series of}} pores interconnected by pore constrictions formed by the skeleton. For the assessment of suffusion, the grain size distribution is divided into two parts: (i) skeleton, which transfers the load and forms the basic soil skeleton; and (ii) loose grains, which can be mobilised and removed by seepage flow. To date, most suffusion assessment methods based on self-filtration criteria assume that there is a sharp boundary in grain size distribution between soil skeleton and loose grains fraction. This paper suggests a new self-filtration criterion for suffusion assessment which was developed on a numerical approach on the grain scale.

30|$|Prior to the Younger Dryas, {{wild rice}} {{had only a}} very tenuous {{presence}} in certain caves {{to the south of}} the Yangzi (Nakamura 2010). But fairly soon after the Younger Dryas, by at least 7, 000 BC, the inland basin archaeological site of Shangshan in northern Zhejiang contained a small settlement of wooden pile dwellings with rice husk tempered red-slipped pottery, polished stone axes, and grindstones (Jiang and Liu 2006). The rice was morphologically wild, but for the first time, we witness the possibility of human cultivation of rice and its deliberate threshing—the pottery contained chaff, not unprocessed whole grains (Zhao 2010). Similar evidence, also dating back to about 7, 000 BC and including residue analysis in pottery as well as stable isotope dietary analysis of human bone, indicates rice consumption at the site of Jiahu in the Huai Valley, a northern tributary of the Yangzi in Henan Province (McGovern et al. 2004; Hu et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2007).

To that end, a composition of emulsified acrylic resins is used, as well as a penetrating agent – usually isopropyl alcohol – and water. The process examined consists in the application of acrylic polymers in an aqueous emulsion that, because of their structure, size, and properties no longer require the use of the isopropyl alcohol contained in the penetrating agents. The use of this alcohol causes adverse effects on the health of workers that are exposed to emanations of isopropanol vapors (irritant to eyes, respiratory tract, and skin) in the work environment. Effects from prolonged exposition and inhalation may lead to headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and, ultimately, to unconsciousness.

The direct measurements clearly indicate that the bed shear stress comprises of a fluid shear stress component and a grain shear stress component. The grain shear stress increases linearly with sediment load and is significantly larger for the coarse <b>loose</b> <b>grain</b> bed tests due to the much larger normal stress compared to that for fine grain loose bed tests with the same number of grain layers.

El paisaje actual resulta fundamentalmente de la influencia del período húmedo del Estadio Isotópico 3 (EIO 3; 64 - 36 ka) y de la actividad eólica durante un clima seco del Holoceno tardío (3, 5 - 1, 4 ka). La secuencia de eventos sedimentológicos y geomorfológicos fue la siguiente: Durante el período húmedo del EIO 3 se desarrolló una red fluvial de llanura, que {{actualmente}} forma la alta cuenca del Río Salado de Buenos Aires, labrada sobre sedimentos de la Fm Carcarañá. Posteriormente se depositó la Formación Teodelina, por sedimentación eólica. Esta tiene 10 a 12 m de espesor típico y unos 5 m en áreas sometidas a erosión; está compuesta por limo grueso arenoso y arena fina limosa, con modas principales entre 125 - 250 y 53 - 62 &# 956;m, color 10 YR 6 / 4 (marrón amarillento) y similares. La composición mineralógica de la fracción entre 53 y 62 &# 956;m está dominada por vidrio volcánico, con feldespato, cuarzo y alteritas como accesorios. La redondez y esfericidad de los granos varían entre bajas y moderadas, con dos poblaciones. En el Pleistoceno final ocurrió un episodio eólico predominantemente erosivo, dominado por vientos del oeste que labraron cientos de depresiones de miles de metros de extensión. Ocurrió una sedimentación discontinua de loess arenoso de hasta 2 m de espesor con granulometría bimodal. El período Hypsithermal del Holoceno Medio (8, 5 - 3, 5 ka) estuvo caracterizado por un clima cálido y húmedo con régimen údico, que generó un suelo en los terrenos loéssicos y produjo el ascenso del nivel del agua en las lagunas y pantanos. El Holoceno tardío, entre 3, 5 y 1, 4 ka, estuvo dominado por un clima seco, con formación de campos de dunas denominadas aquí Formación San Gregorio. Está formada por arena muy fina a fina, suelta, masiva, color marrón amarillento, y compuesta por trizas vítreas, alteritas y feldespatos como componentes principales y cuarzo como componente secundario; los minerales pesados son de procedencia serrana. La época actual está caracterizada por un exceso de agua en el paisaje; el proceso sedimentológico más relevante es la movilización de grandes volúmenes de sales disueltas, particularmente cloruros y sulfatos. The geomorphology, Late Quaternary stratigraphy, sedimentology and hydrology of {{the upper}} basin of the Salado River were investigated. The study area is located in S Santa Fe and NW Buenos Aires provinces (11. 000 km²) and comprises the NE sector of the Pampean Sand Sea (defined by Iriondo and Kröhling, 1995; Figures 1 and 2). The methodology applied in this study produced conclusions of stratigraphic and paleoclimatic nature. Works were performed in photographic and images cabinet, {{in the field and}} laboratory. In cabinet, the geological cartography produced by the first author in former projects was issued, particularly the geological map of Santa Fe province, in 1 : 500. 000 scale (Iriondo, 1987; Figure 3), the map of the South American plains (Iriondo, 1990 a; Petit Maire et al., 1999) and the map of the Pampean Sand Sea in scale 1 : 1. 000. 000 (Iriondo, 1992). That was complemented with satellite images and photomosaic analyses, integrated with classical topographic quadrangles of IGM. Field works made in the region covered a period of two decades. The first expedition was done in the year 1985, during a dry inter-annual period which favored the description of geological profiles and collection of fossils in the bottom of channels. Further expeditions were made in the 1990 's, resulting in the elaboration of the regional stratigraphy (Figure 4; Kröhling, 1998; Iriondo and Kröhling, 1995). The last three field surveys, between the years 2001 and 2004 (during the present humid period), were focused on the studies of dune fields, with areal sampling (about 50 samples) and the recovering of sedimentary cores (41 m drilled). Four stratigraphic boreholes were made in the study area and a complementary one outside it, with recovering of undisturbed samples and complemented with geotechnical S. P. T. tests. The main boreholes were drilled in Teodelina (34 ° 11 ´lat. S; 61 ° 31 ´long. W; 88 m a. s. l.; Santa Fe; Figure 5) and in San Gregorio (34 ° 17 ' lat. S y 61 ° 55 ´ long.

Complementary, morphoscopic determinations were carried out in the 74 &# 956;m fraction. Two geological formations of eolian origins are widespread in the region, Teodelina Fm (Late Pleistocene) and San Gregorio Fm (Late Holocene), which are formally defined here. The Teodelina Fm has a typical thickness of 10 to 12 m and has been eroded up to 5 m in some areas; it is composed of sandy coarse silt and silty fine sand, with main modes at 125 - 250 &# 956;m and 53 - 62 &# 956;m; the colour is yellowish brown and similar ones. The mineral composition of the 53 - 62 &# 956;m fraction is dominated by volcanic glass, with feldspars, quartz and alterites as accessory minerals. Roundness and sphericity of the grains vary from low to moderate, with two populations. The San Gregorio Fm is more than 7 m thick. It is composed of loose, massive, yellowish brown in color, very fine to fine sand (Figures 7 a and 7 b). The mineral composition is dominated by vitreous shards, alterites and feldspars as its main components and quartz as a secondary component; main heavy minerals were originated in the Pampean Ranges. The geomorphology of the area and the present hydric dynamics are controlled by eolian geoforms generated during the Late Quaternary. The exception is the fluvial collector in S Santa Fe which is a paleochannel of the Tercero river, controlled by tectonics (Figure 8). The study area underwent a sequence of dry and humid episodes during the Late Quaternary. Basically, the present landscape {{is the result of the}} influence of a humid climate which took place in the Oxygen Isotopic Stage 3 (OIS 3; 64 - 36 ka) and the eolian activity produced by a dry climate in the Late Holocene (3. 5 - 1. 4 ka). The sequence of sedimentary and geomorphic events deduced from the data of this research was the following: during the humid OIS 3, a fluvial net developed; it forms at present the upper basin of the Salado River of Buenos Aires, and is carved in the Carcarañá Formation (OIS 3; Kröhling, 1999). In a subsequent dry episode (Late Pleistocene), the Teodelina Formation was sedimented by eolian and associated processes. A largelly erosive eolian phase occurred after Teodelina Fm accumulation; it was characterized by Western winds that carved hundreds of large deflation hollows. A discontinuous sedimentation of a sandy loess up to 2 m thick with bimodal grain size distribution covered the minor accidents of the landscape. The humid period of the Middle Holocene (8. 5 - 3. 5 ka) was characterized by a warm and humid climate with an udic soil regime, which generated a soil profile on the loessic terrains and provoked the water level rising in lakes and swamps. The Late Holocene, from 3. 5 to 1. 4 ka BP, was characterized by a dry climate that produced the development of parabolic dune fields, named here as the San Gregorio Formation. An interesting geomorphological feature of the study area is represented by numerous shallow lakes occupying large deflation hollows generated by W winds. That indicates a shift of the Westerlies to the N up to 34 ° lat. S at the Upper Pleistocene-Lower Holocene interval (Figure 9). During the Little Ice Age the studied area underwent an arid climate with dominance of SW winds that produced a general mobilization of sand to the NE (Figure 10); the inherited shallow lakes were transformed in playas (Dangavs and Mormeneo, 2006). The present dynamics is dominated by an excess of water in the landscape as a consequence of the Present humid climate and the morphosedimentological control referred above. The significant sedimentological process is the mobilization of large volumes of dissolved salts, mainly chlorides and sulphates...|$|E

Stones which form part of a building or monument on site with this type of deterioration present a particular problem where replacement is unjustified and no intervention objectionable, especially when seen in light of a holistic conservation project. The desirable intervention in this case would call for a reduction in powdering through consolidation of the <b>loose</b> <b>grains</b> {{to each other and to}} the parent stone beneath while also slowing down further damage. This would need to be achieved in the presence of naturally-occurring salt mixtures, while still retaining the various properties of the stone including visual, physical and chemical aspects.|$|R
