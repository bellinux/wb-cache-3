50|$|Arterial <b>chemical</b> <b>receptors</b> are {{stimulated by}} {{exposure}} to a low partial pressure and hence increase alveolar ventilation, up {{to a maximum of}} 1.65 times. Almost immediately, compensation for the higher altitude begins with an increase of pulmonary ventilation eliminating a large amount CO2. Carbon dioxide partial pressure reduces and corporal fluids pH increase. These actions inhibit the respiratory center of the encephalic trunk, but later this inhibition disappears and the respiratory center responds to the stimulation of the peripheral <b>chemical</b> <b>receptors</b> because of the hypoxia increasing ventilation up to six times.|$|R

50|$|Oftentimes the {{presence}} or density of certain <b>chemical</b> <b>receptors</b> on cranial structures like the brainstem determine their importance in one species-typical behavior or another. Consider voles. prairie voles are monogamous; {{they also have a}} high density of oxytocin receptors (OTRs) in a brain structure called the nucleus accumbens. Non-monogamous meadow voles, on the other hand, do not. Likewise, monogamous pine voles have a high-density of OTRs; non-monogamous meadow voles do not.|$|R
50|$|Insect {{olfaction}} {{refers to}} the function of <b>chemical</b> <b>receptors</b> that enable insects to detect and identify volatile compounds for foraging, predator avoidance, finding mating partners (via pheromones) and locating oviposition habitats. Thus, {{it is the most}} important sensation for insects. Most important insect behaviors must be timed perfectly which is dependent on what they smell and when they smell it. For example, olfaction is essential for hunting in many species of wasps, including Polybia sericea.|$|R

25|$|A neuron affects other neurons by {{releasing}} a neurotransmitter that binds to <b>chemical</b> <b>receptors.</b> The effect upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined {{not by the}} presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter, but {{by the type of}} receptor that is activated. A neurotransmitter {{can be thought of as}} a key, and a receptor as a lock: the same type of key can here be used to open many different types of locks. Receptors can be classified broadly as excitatory (causing an increase in firing rate), inhibitory (causing a decrease in firing rate), or modulatory (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).|$|R
30|$|Solâ€“gel-derived {{materials}} have received particular interest as <b>chemical</b> <b>receptor</b> matrices {{because of their}} optical transparency, mechanical stability, chemical resistance and flexibility in sensor morphological configurations.

The combination of these factors makes these materials desirable for use in the pharmaceutical, food and chemical industries [1].|$|R

30|$|The RR {{interval}} {{is influenced}} by various factors, such as arterial pressure <b>receptors,</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>receptors,</b> cardiac receptors, and stretch receptors in the lungs and thoracic cavity (Wheeler and Watkins 1973; Horiguchi et al. 2006; Cooke et al. 1998; Clynes 1960; Angelone and Coulter 1964). Respiration is the most influential factor for the RR interval; upon inhalation, a negative intrathoracic pressure increases venous return and HR (Clynes 1960). However, although HR increases for 4 Â s, it is also known to decrease for 10 Â s afterwards; this may explain the behavior of HR during breath hold (Clynes 1960). Although the HRtest and HRscan {{in the present study}} were recorded to be approximately 4 Â s after the breath hold instruction, patients started holding their breaths after the inhalation instruction that came before the breath hold. Therefore, we consider that breath hold duration was actually longer than 4 Â s.|$|R
50|$|Chemoreception is {{important}} for the detection of food, habitat, conspecifics including mates, and predators. For example, the emissions of a predator's food source, such as odors or pheromones, may be in the air or on a surface where the food source has been. Cells in the head, usually the air passages or mouth, have <b>chemical</b> <b>receptors</b> on their surface that change when in contact with the emissions. It passes in either chemical or electrochemical form to the central processor, the brain or spinal cord. The resulting output from the CNS (central nervous system) makes body actions that will engage the food and enhance survival.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, in {{response}} to growing concerns {{about the impact of}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on human health, a variety of environmental forensics and geochemical techniques have emerged for studying organic pollutants. These techniques include <b>chemical</b> fingerprinting, <b>receptor</b> modeling, and compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA). Chemical fingerprinting methodology involves the use of diagnostic ratios. Receptor modeling techniques include the chemical mass balance (CMB) model and multivariate statistics. Multivariate techniques include factor analysis with multiple linear regression (FA/MLR), positive matrix factorization (PMF), and UNMIX. This article reviews applications of <b>chemical</b> fingerprinting, <b>receptor</b> modeling, and CSIA; comments on their uses; and contrasts {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each methodology.

40|$|An active {{electrical}} response, the hyperpolarizing activation or H. A. response, {{is characteristic}} of L cells (a continuous line of fibroblasts) and is transmitted in a decremental manner between contiguous cells. Direct electrical coupling between pairs of L cells occurs occasionally, but transmission of the active electrical response is not dependent on such electrical connections. Some L cells are sensitive to acetylcholine but the transmitted response is not dependent on a cholinergic mechanism. 5 -Iodosalicylate blocks the active electrical response. The response can be elicited readily by mechanical stimuli, and thus can serve both as a mechanical and <b>chemical</b> <b>receptor</b> mechanism and {{as a means of}} communication between cells...|$|R

No perioperative mortality and stroke occurred. During a mean follow up of 2. 2 years, no deaths related to CBT occurred. Surgical treatment for CBT is relatively safe.

50|$|One type of {{pluripotent}} cell, {{called a}} hematopoietic stem cell, can differentiate {{into a large}} variety of cells with different functions. This stem cell can produce red blood cells, platelets, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Each of these cells has a different function, but they all work together {{as part of the}} immune system. Monocytes can differentiate into either dendritic cells or macrophages. Macrophages are covered with <b>chemical</b> <b>receptors</b> and phagocytose foreign particles, but are specific about what immune responses to be involved in. Dendritic cells phagocytose invaders; then they present the antigen on their surface to stimulate the acquired immune system (lymphocytes) as backup.|$|R
50|$|The {{stages of}} {{mimivirus}} replication {{are not well}} known, but as a minimum {{it is known that}} mimivirus attaches to a <b>chemical</b> <b>receptor</b> on the surface of an amoeba cell and is taken into the cell. Once inside, an eclipse phase begins, in which the virus disappears and all appears normal within the cell. After about 4 hours small accumulations can be seen in areas of the cell. 8 hours after infection many mimivirus virions are clearly visible within the cell. The cell cytoplasm continues to fill with newly synthesised virions, and about 24 hours after initial infection the cell likely bursts open to release the new mimivirus virions.|$|R

Besides the discovery of new genes for the use of pollen and nectar, researchers found that, in comparison with other insects, Apis mellifera has fewer genes for immunity, detoxification and the development of the cuticula.The population genetic analysis showed Africa as the origin and hypothesized that the spread into Europe happened in at least two independent waves.|$|R

40|$|Biodiversity of {{secondary}} lichen metabolites by the epiphytic and lithophilic lichens {{of the genus}} Collema is reported. The most abundant fatty acids were a-linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3), oleic acid (18 : 1 n- 9), and palmitic acid (16 : 0), but a great variation of the ester composition {{from one to another}} was found. A comparison of neutral lipids, glycolipids, polar lipids and fatty acid composition of four species was done. DGTS, DGTA, PC, and PI were found as major components among polar <b>lipids.</b> <b>Chemical</b> constituents were characterized by GC-MS, HPLC, HR-TLC, and other chemical methods.

50|$|Anacardic acids are {{phenolic}} <b>lipids,</b> <b>chemical</b> compounds {{found in}} the shell of the cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale). An acid form of urushiol, they also cause an allergic skin rash on contact, known as urushiol-induced contact dermatitis. Anacardic acid is a yellow liquid. It is partially miscible with ethanol and ether, but nearly immiscible with water. Chemically, anacardic acid {{is a mixture of}} several closely related organic compounds. Each consists of a salicylic acid substituted with an alkyl chain that has 15 or 17 carbon atoms. The alkyl group may be saturated or unsaturated; anacardic acid is a mixture of saturated and unsaturated molecules. The exact mixture depends on the species of the plant. The 15 carbon unsaturated side chain compound {{found in the}} cashew plant is lethal to Gram positive bacteria.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>receptors</b> for {{glutamate}} {{fall into}} three major classes, known as AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Many synapses use multiple types of glutamate receptors. AMPA receptors are ionotropic receptors specialized for fast excitation: in many synapses they produce excitatory electrical responses in their targets {{a fraction of}} a millisecond after being stimulated. NMDA receptors are also ionotropic, but they differ from AMPA receptors in being permeable, when activated, to calcium. Their properties make them particularly important for learning and memory. Metabotropic receptors act through second messenger systems to create slow, sustained effects on their targets. A fourth class, known as kainate receptors, are similar in many respects to AMPA receptors, but much less abundant.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{rules for}} {{allowable}} pericyclic reactions {{indicate that the}} photoisomerizations of retinals in rhodopsins can be formally analogous to thermally promoted Diels-Alder condensations of monoenes with retinols. With little change in the seven-transmembrane helical environment these latter reactions could mimic the retinal isomerization while providing highly sensitive chemical reception. In this way archaic progenitors of G-protein-coupled <b>chemical</b> quantal <b>receptors</b> such as those for pheromones might have been evolutionarily plagiarized from the photon quantal receptor, rhodopsin, or vice versa. We investigated whether the known structure of bacteriorhodopsin exhibited any similarity in its active site {{with those of the}} two known antibody catalysts of Diels-Alder reactions and that of the photoactive yellow protein. A remarkable three-dimensional motif of aromatic side chains emerged in all four proteins despite the drastic differences in backbone structure. Molecular orbital calculations supported the possibility of transient pericyclic reactions as part of the isomerization-signal transduction mechanisms in both bacteriorhodopsin and the photoactive yellow protein. It appears that reactions in all four of the proteins investigated may be biological analogs of the organic chemistsâ€™ chiral auxiliary-aided Diels-Alder reactions. Thus the light <b>receptor</b> and the <b>chemical</b> <b>receptor</b> subfamilies of the heptahelical receptor family may have been unified at one time by underlying pericyclic chemistry...|$|R
5|$|Once a neuron is in place, {{it extends}} {{dendrites}} and an axon {{into the area}} around it. Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone, studded with <b>chemical</b> <b>receptors.</b> These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding.|$|R
