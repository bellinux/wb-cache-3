In this paper, the normalization of <b>location</b> <b>indicators</b> and treating morphology of <b>location</b> <b>indicators</b> for geographic information retrieval (GIR) within the system GIRSA (Geographic Information Retrieval by Semantic Annotation) are explored.

Results for this experiment are compared to results for experiments with normalized <b>location</b> <b>indicators.</b> Additionally, the latter approach was combined with an approach using semantic networks for retrieval (an extension of an experiment performed for GeoCLEF 2005).

40|$|Com o advento da Internet e o crescente número de informações disponíveis torna-se necessária a definição de estratégias especiais que permitam aos usuários o acesso rápido a informações relevantes. Como a Web possui grande volume de informações {{principal}}mente com o foco geográfico torna-se necessário recuperar e estruturar essas informações de forma a poder relacioná-las com o contexto e realidade das pessoas através de métodos e sistemas automáticos. Para isso uma das necessidades é possibilitar o georreferenciamento dos textos, ou seja, identificar as entidades geográficas presentes e associá-las com sua correta localização espacial. Nesse sentido, os topônimos (ex: nomes de localidades como cidades, países, etc.), devido à possibilidade de identificar de forma precisa determinada região espacial, apresentam-se como ideais para a identificação do contexto geográfico dos textos. Essa tarefa, denominada de Resolução de Topônimos apresenta, no entanto, desafios importantes principalmente do ponto de vista lingüístico, já que uma localidade pode possuir variados tipos de ambigüidade. Com relação a isso {{a principal}} estratégia para superar estes problemas compreende a identificação de evidências que auxiliem na identificação e desambiguação das localidades nos textos. Para essa verificação são utilizados geralmente os serviços de um ou mais dicionários toponímicos (Gazetteers). Como são criados de forma manual eles apresentam, no entanto deficiência de informações relacionadas principalmente a entidades que podem identificar, embora de forma indireta, determinados tipos de lugares como ruas, praças, universidades etc., as quais são definidas como Indicadores de Localidade. O presente trabalho propõe uma abordagem para a recuperação dessas entidades aproveitando para isso o caráter geográfico das informações jornalísticas. Para ilustrar a viabilidade do processo diferentes tipos de corpora de notícias foram testados e comparados pela habilidade de criação de Gazetteers com os Indicadores recuperados, sendo os Gazetteers avaliados então pela capacidade de identificação das cidades relacionadas às notícias testadas. Os resultados demonstram a utilidade da abordagem para o enriquecimento de Gazetteers e consequentemente para a recuperação de Indicadores de Localidade com maior simplicidade e extensibilidade que os trabalhos atuaisGeoreferencing of texts, that is, {{the identification of}} the geographical context of texts is becoming popular in the Web due to the high demand for geographical information and due to the raising of services for query and retrieval like Google Earth (geobrowsers). The main challenge is to relate texts to geographical locations. These associations are stored in structures called gazetteers. Although there are gazetteers like Geonames and TGN, they fail in coverage, lacking information about some countries, and they also fail by weak specialization, lacking detailed references to locations (fine granularity) as for example names of streets, squares, monuments, rivers, neighborhoods, etc. This kind of information that acts as indirect references to geographical locations is defined as <b>Location</b> <b>Indicators.</b> This dissertation presents an approach that identifies <b>Location</b> <b>Indicators</b> related to geographical locations, by analyzing texts of news published in the Web.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present and rigorously analyze topological {{sensitivity}} based algorithms for detection of diametrically small inclusions in an isotropic homogeneous elastic formation using single and multiple measurements of the far-field scattering amplitudes. A $L^ 2 -$cost functional is considered and a <b>location</b> <b>indicator</b> is constructed from its topological derivative. The performance of the indicator is analyzed in terms of the topological sensitivity for location detection and stability with respect to measurement and medium noises. It is established that the <b>location</b> <b>indicator</b> does not guarantee inclusion detection and achieves only a low resolution when there is mode-conversion in an elastic formation. Accordingly, a weighted <b>location</b> <b>indicator</b> is designed to tackle the mode-conversion phenomenon. It is substantiated that the weighted function renders the location of an inclusion stably with resolution as per Rayleigh criterion. Comment: 31 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

GIRSA-WP (GIRSA for Wikipedia) is a fully-automatic, hybrid system combining methods from question answering (QA) and geographic information retrieval (GIR). It merges results from InSicht, a deep (text-semantic) open-domain QA system, and GIRSA, a system for textual GIR. For the second participation (the first participation was for the pilot task GikiP 2008), the GIR methods were adjusted by switching from a sentence-based retrieval to an abstract-based retrieval. Furthermore, geographic names and <b>location</b> <b>indicators</b> in Wikipedia articles were annotated before indexing. The QA methods were extended by allowing more general recursion with question decomposition. In this way, complex questions, which are frequent in GikiCLEF, can be answered by first answering several depending questions and exploiting their answers. Two new resources of structured information from Wikipedia were integrated, namely the categories assigned to articles and the infobox file from DBpedia, which is an automatic information extraction approach for Wikipedia data.
