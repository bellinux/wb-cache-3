500|$|In 2007, Levine had {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Maroon 5 was reaching its peak and might make one more album before disbanding. He was quoted explaining: [...] "Eventually I {{want to focus on}} being a completely different person because I don't know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond". But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:"I <b>love</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do and think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [...] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon". He has also turned down {{the idea of having a}} solo career, stating that [...] "there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Upgrade U" [...] was shot during the two-week filming for the B'Day Anthology Video Album. It was {{directed}} by Melina and Knowles herself. The video was shot between those of [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] and [...] "Green Light", and took about one and half days of filming. Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did in [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character that people think I am. I was pretending to be Jay, and he was there, and I told him he had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — it was way too embarrassing. I think I did a pretty good job. I had the lip curl down!" [...] The video premiered on February 28, 2007, on BET's 106 & Park, with the video for Knowles' other single release, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] (2007) featuring Shakira, premiering the same day on Total Request Live (TRL).|$|E

[...] He is said to be [...] "obsessed" [...] with the technological aspects of his acts, insisting on calculating every detail himself. [...] When asked why he risks his life on the high-wire, he replied [...] "I do this because I <b>love</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do... If I won the lottery tomorrow, I'd still be doing what I do."

2500|$|In January 2011, TobyMac {{stated that}} a reunion tour would {{probably}} happen [...] "sooner or later". He mentioned talking with Michael and Kevin about [...] "when it should be" [...] and [...] "what it could look like." [...] Fans {{hoping for a}} reunion tour {{in the near future}} may be disappointed: [...] "Right now, I think we're really just enjoying the mountain we're climbing, each of us individually. It's never been a completely closed door. We've always sort of laughed about it, smiled about it. It's timing, I guess." [...] On May 28 and 29, 2011, at the Big Church Day Out in Wiston, UK, TobyMac joined the Newsboys twice to perform [...] "Jesus Freak", and Michael sang [...] "In the Light" [...] on both days with Toby's band, Diverse City. In June 2011 Toby admitted that he thought about Kevin and Michael for every song that he writes. His song [...] "Wonderin'" [...] is about his past with Kevin and Michael in DC Talk. [...] "It's just a warm look back at DC Talk," [...] says Toby, almost wistfully. [...] "It's reminiscing about Michael and Kevin and what we did together, and recognizing their influence on me. I <b>love</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do today, but there are times when I wonder, What if we stayed together? I've got these dreams I'm pursuing now, but are they stealing me from you?" [...] On June 7, 2011, Back 2 Back Hits, featuring songs off Jesus Freak and Supernatural, was released.|$|E

50|$|Katie's philosophy, as {{described}} in her book <b>Loving</b> <b>What</b> <b>Is,</b> is that often when people think they are being rational, their own thinking is often interfering. This, she says, puts people into painful positions that lead to suffering, as she recognized {{to be the case}} with herself. Through self-questioning, she describes how a different, less-known capacity of the mind can reduce this suffering.|$|R
