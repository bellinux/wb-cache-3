500|$|Ficus rubiginosa, {{commonly}} known as the rusty fig or Port Jackson fig (damun in the Dharug language), is a species of flowering plant native to eastern Australia in the genus Ficus. Beginning as a seedling that grows on other plants (hemiepiphyte) or rocks (<b>lithophyte),</b> F.rubiginosa matures into a tree [...] high and nearly as wide with a yellow-brown buttressed trunk. The leaves are oval and glossy green and measure from [...] long and [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|Ficus obliqua, {{commonly}} known as the small-leaved fig, is a tree in the family Moraceae, native to eastern Australia, New Guinea, eastern Indonesia to Sulawesi and islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Previously known for many years as Ficus eugenioides, it is a banyan of the genus Ficus, which contains around 750 species worldwide in warm climates, including the edible fig (Ficus carica). Beginning life as a seedling, which grows on other plants (epiphyte) or on rocks (<b>lithophyte),</b> F.obliqua can grow to [...] high and nearly as wide with a pale grey buttressed trunk, and glossy green leaves.|$|E
500|$|A spreading, densely-shading tree when mature, F.rubiginosa {{may reach}} [...] {{or more in}} height, {{although}} it rarely exceeds [...] in the Sydney region. The trunk is buttressed and can reach [...] in diameter. The bark is yellow-brown. It can also grow as on other plants as a hemiepiphyte, or [...] high <b>lithophyte.</b> Alternately arranged on the stems, the ovate (egg-shaped), [...] (reverse egg-shaped) or oval-shaped leaves are anywhere from [...] long and [...] wide, on -long petioles (stalks that join the leaves to stems). They are smooth or bear tiny rusty hairs. There are 16 to 62 pairs of lateral veins that run off the midvein at an angle of 41.5–84.0°, while distinct basal veins run off the midvein at an angle of 18.5–78.9°. As with all figs, the fruit (fig) is actually an inverted inflorescence (compound flower) known as a syconium, with tiny flowers arising from the fig's inner surface into a hollow cavity. F. rubiginosa is monoecious—both male and female flowers are found on the same plant, and in fact in the same fruit, although they mature at different times. Often growing in pairs, the figs are yellow initially and measure [...] across. Ripening to red in colour, they are tipped with a small nipple and on a [...] stalk. Fruits ripen throughout the year, although more so in spring and summer. Some trees have ripe and unripe fruit at the same time.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Lithophytes</b> are {{plants that}} grow in or on rocks.

2500|$|Leptotes bicolor is {{the species}} with more flowers per {{inflorescence}} {{and with a}} wider distribution.

2500|$|Bifrenaria species inhabit three {{different}} environments. The large species generally live in well illuminated areas, occasionally epiphyte on trees of sparse foliage, more often as lithophytes, in campos rupestres, montane rocky areas that exist mostly in Rio and Minas Gerais States of Brazil, or over rocks in jungle's clearances.

2500|$|It {{is often}} found in {{lowlands}} in Madagascar at altitudes below 400–500ft, near {{the east coast of}} the island, and on trees that are at the edge of forests. Usually it is attached to trees with fewer leaves and to areas of the branch or trunk that are driest. This allows the plant to obtain a great deal of light and air movement. Larger plants are usually found growing within 12–20ft from the ground, whereas smaller plants are often found higher up in the canopy. Rarely A.sesquipedale is also found growing as a <b>lithophyte</b> and sometimes even as a semi-terrestrial. The orchid lives in an environment with heavy rainfall, up to [...] per year. There is no dry season so the growing season is continuous.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{observations}} on pathways of water movement {{are discussed in}} relation to anatomical and micromorphological features of five moss species from Signy Island, South Orkney Islands. Significant internal uptake of water was recorded only in the mesic species Polytrichum alpinum (internal=> 60 % of total) and Bartramia patens (internal=c. 30 % of total), in experiments in which uptake by cut shoots was compared in individuals with the external pathway blocked, and others with both external and internal pathways open. Internal uptake maintained shoot water content close to full turgor in P. alpinun and at 30 % of full tugor in B. patens, whereas water content fell to 12 - 15 % dry wt. in the <b>lithophytes</b> Andreaea gainii and Schistidium antarctici and in the mesic/hydric species Drepanocladus uncinatus, with the external pathway blocked. Where both pathways were open water uptake from below maintained water content at or above full turgor in shoots of all five species. External water uptake by capillarity occurred most rapidly in the <b>lithophytes,</b> and was slower in initially air-dry than in hydrated shoots of the other species. The spreading limbs of leaves in B. patens and P. alpinum are water-repellent, as are the bright green leaves in the apical 1 - 2 mm of dry shoots of the <b>lithophytes.</b> A central strand of hydroids is well-developed only in B. patens and P. alpinum. These two species have deposits of surface wax on parts of the leaves, and surface wax also occurs on the green apical leaves in some specimens of S. antarcticum and other <b>lithophytes</b> from Signy Island...|$|R
