In the 1830s and 1840s, France, Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned {{by the end of}} the 1840s, because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> out of shape than wood.|$|E
5|$|They used a {{cladistic}} {{analysis to}} examine its relationships within Oryzomyini, also including {{two species of}} Holochilus, Lundomys, and five other oryzomyines. They found that Noronhomys appeared closest to Holochilus, with Lundomys more distantly related. Eighteen shared characters (synapomorphies) supported the grouping of Noronhomys with Holochilus. Another form described as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus primigenus, may also be related, but is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> outside the Holochilus–Noronhomys clade.|$|E
5|$|In {{every other}} {{transaction}} of life no man's wits {{could be more}} regular than those of Smart, for this prevalence of one idea pertinaciously keeping the first place in his head had in no sense, except in what immediately related to itself, perverted his judgement at all; his opinions were unchanged as before, nor did he seem more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> {{into a state of}} distraction than any other man; less so, perhaps, as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer.|$|E

5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E

5000|$|A {{support level}} is a level where the price tends to find support as it falls. This {{means that the}} price is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> [...] "bounce" [...] off this level rather than break through it.

25|$|Skiers missing an arm use a {{technique}} that corrects lateral balance issues resulting from the missing arm. A skier with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation.

It may be considered unlucky because the number resembles a wicket without bails (a batsman is out if the bails are knocked off their wicket).|$|E
50|$|Bonding {{allows a}} dyad to {{demonstrate}} to society that they are connected, such as through a marriage ceremony. Differentiation allows for individuals in the couple to maintain their personal space, such as through having their own friends, hobbies, or careers.

25|$|As {{this class}} {{includes}} skiers with paralysis, amputations and cerebral palsy, a variety of skiing techniques and training types are needed. Skiers in this classification who have paralysis {{as a result of}} hemiplegia, stroke or polio tend to initially favour a strong side of their body when they learn to ski, which sometimes results in overskiing. Ski-bras and bungie cords are used in training to correct this. If this is not corrected, skiers are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> over when their skis cross in front of them. Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the ski lift using the same technique as able-bodied skiers.|$|E
25|$|The key {{symptom of}} a glacier in disequilibrium is {{thinning}} along {{the entire length of}} the glacier. For example, Easton Glacier (pictured below) will likely shrink to half its size, but at a slowing rate of reduction, and stabilize at that size, despite the warmer temperature, over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier (pictured below) will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with shallow slopes such as Grinnell Glacier are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> into disequilibrium if there is a change in the local climate.|$|E
25|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has {{produced}} several reports that have assessed {{the scientific literature}} on climate change. The IPCC Third Assessment Report, published in 2001, concluded that the poorest countries would be hardest hit, with reductions in crop yields in most tropical and sub-tropical regions due to decreased water availability, and new or changed insect pest incidence. In Africa and Latin America many rainfed crops are near their maximum temperature tolerance, so that yields are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> sharply for even small climate changes; falls in agricultural productivity of up to 30% over the 21st century are projected. Marine life and the fishing industry will also be severely affected in some places.|$|E
50|$|Two folk {{groups had}} their territories divided by highland, {{to the west}} of Hilton, the Pencersæte and Tomsæte, and Hilton is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>fallen</b> within the {{territory}} occupied by the Tomsæte. According to Domesday Book, the minster that had been founded or re-founded at Wolverhampton by the lady Wulfrun, a Mercian noblewoman, in the 10th century held the vills of Ogley Hay and Hilton in this region, these estates almost interlocking with other vills held by Lichfield in 1086 - Wyrley and Norton Canes.|$|R
50|$|Gilbert de Gant {{spent much}} of his life {{in the power of the}} Earl of Chester and Grimsthorpe is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>fallen</b> into his hands in 1156 when Gilbert died, though the title 'Earl of Lincoln' reverted to the crown. In the next {{creation}} of the earldom, in 1217, it was Ranulph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester (1172-1232) who was ennobled with it. It seems that the title, if not the property was in the hands of King John during his reign; hence perhaps, the name of the tower.|$|R
5000|$|IRRI is {{well known}} for its {{contribution}} to the [...] "Green Revolution" [...] movement in Asia during the late 1960s and 1970s, which involved the breeding of [...] "semidwarf" [...] varieties of rice that were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lodge (<b>fall</b> over). IRRI's semi-dwarf varieties, including the famous IR8, saved India from famine in the 1960s. The varieties developed at IRRI, known as IR varieties, are well accepted in many Asian countries. In 2005, it was estimated that 60% of the world's rice area was planted to IRRI-bred rice varieties or their progenies.|$|R
25|$|The {{launch of}} Dawn was rescheduled for September 26, 2007, then September 27, due to bad weather delaying fueling {{of the second}} stage, the same problem that delayed the July 7 launch attempt. The launch window {{extended}} from 07:20–07:49 EDT (11:20–11:49 GMT). During the final built-in hold at T4 minutes, a ship entered the exclusion area offshore, the strip of ocean where the rocket boosters were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> after separation. After commanding the ship to leave the area, the launch was required {{to wait for the}} end of a collision avoidance window with the International Space Station. Dawn finally launched from pad 17-B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a Delta 7925-H rocket at 07:34 EDT, reaching escape velocity {{with the help of a}} spin-stabilized solid-fueled third stage. Thereafter, Dawn's ion thrusters took over.|$|E
25|$|Although {{trampoline}} {{competitors are}} highly trained, {{they are also}} attempting to perform complex manoeuvres {{which could lead to}} accidents and falls. Trampolines used in competitions have their springs covered in pads to reduce the chance of injury when landing off the bed. They also have padded end decks, which are the locations that athletes are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> off the trampoline. The rules for international competitions (updated by FIG in 2006) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling {{off the side of the}} trampoline bed. The floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full; for example in the UK the requirement for National & Regional competition is still 2m but only of 20–25mm matting.|$|E
25|$|The stirrup, {{which gives}} greater {{stability}} to a rider, {{has been described}} {{as one of the most}} significant inventions in the history of warfare, prior to gunpowder. As a tool allowing expanded use of horses in warfare, the stirrup is often called the third revolutionary step in equipment, after the chariot and the saddle. The basic tactics of mounted warfare were significantly altered by the stirrup. A rider supported by stirrups was less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> off while fighting, and could deliver a blow with a weapon that more fully employed the weight and momentum of horse and rider. Among other advantages, stirrups provided greater balance and support to the rider, which allowed the knight to use a sword more efficiently without falling, especially against infantry adversaries. Contrary to common modern belief, however, it has been asserted that stirrups actually did not enable the horseman to use a lance more effectively (cataphracts had used lances since antiquity), though the cantled saddle did.|$|E
5000|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has {{compiled}} certain known risk {{factors that have}} been found responsible for STFs in the workplace setting. While falling can occur at any time and by any means in the workplace, these factors have been known <b>to</b> cause same-level <b>falls,</b> which are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> occur than <b>falls</b> <b>to</b> a lower level.

50|$|Deforestation {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{contributors}} to climate change. It is the second largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, after fossil fuel combustion. Deforestation and forest degradation contribute to atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions through combustion of forest biomass and decomposition of remaining plant material and soil carbon. It used to account for more than 20% of carbon dioxide emissions, but it’s currently somewhere around the 10% mark. By 2008, deforestation was 12% of total , or 15% if peatlands are included. These proportions are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>fallen</b> since given the continued rise of fossil fuel use.|$|R
25|$|For example, assume an {{investor}} {{had to choose}} between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, {{with a standard deviation of}} 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, {{an investor}} may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to −10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).|$|E
25|$|Using the {{deactivation}} enhanced strategy, {{a relatively}} small instantaneous kinetic chain length limits the number of vinyl groups that {{can be added to}} a propagating chain end during each activation/deactivation cycles and thus keeps the polymer chains growing in a limited space. In this way, unlike what happens in free radical polymerization (FRP), the formation of huge polymer chains and large-scale combinations at early reaction stages is avoided. Therefore, a small instantaneous kinetic chain length is the prerequisite for further manipulation of intramolecular cyclization or intermolecular crosslinking. Based on the small instantaneous kinetic chain length, regulation of different chain dimensions and concentrations would lead to distinct reaction types. A low ratio of initiator to monomer would result in the formation of longer chains but of a lower chain concentration, This scenario would no doubt increases the chances of intramolecular cyclization due to the high local/spatial vinyl concentration within the growth boundary. Although the opportunity for intermolecular reactions can increase as the polymer chains grow, the likelihood of this occurring at the early stage of reactions is minimal due to the low chain concentration, which is why single chain cyclized/knotted polymers can form. However, in contrast, a high initiator concentration not only diminishes the chain dimension during the linear-growth phase thus suppressing the intramolecular cyclization, but it also increases the chain concentration within the system so that pendent vinyl groups in one chain are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> into the growth boundary of another chain. Once the monomers are converted to short chains, the intermolecular combination increases and allows the formation of hyperbranched structures with a high density of branching and vinyl functional groups.|$|E

50|$|While {{the islands}} may have {{provided}} more freshwater habitat due to better tree {{cover in the}} past, the Ibiza rail's habitat was probably brackish swamps in the coastal lowland. Extinction was most probably due to overhunting by the expanding human population. Most other extinct island rails which were unable to escape hunters due to flightlessness, but this species is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>fallen</b> victim <b>to</b> its small population size: Ibiza is not large, and available habitat was densely populated by various species of birds, which would leave little resources for a large population of any particular species. Thus, the Ibiza rail was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succumb to an amount of hunting {{which could have been}} tolerated by a larger population of island rails, flightless or not.|$|R
