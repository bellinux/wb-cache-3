30|$|Post-hysterectomy vaginal {{shortening}} is a {{risk factor}} for vaginal rupture in patients subsequently undergoing sacrocolpopexy, as the shortened vagina lies directly in the plane of the genital hiatus unsupported by the levator plate and prolapses more readily, making it more prone to rupture. Further, short vagina requires a relatively greater <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>mesh.</b> This may increase the risk of vaginal stretching and avulsion of the mesh from the vault secondary to tension from the mesh as it shrinks and retracts. It has been shown that polypropylene meshes shrink to about 30 – 50 % of their original size after 4  weeks of insertion in animal models [6] and also when removed after abdominal hernia repair [7].|$|E

To overcome this disadvantage, a new way based on cross-section method is presented to calculate the deformation of helical tooth tip. First, the tooth is divided into copies of cross-section along face width and the moment of inertia for each section is calculated. Also, the load is distributed according to <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the contact line, {{and the effect of}} deflected load is taken into account as well. Based on these works, a general formula of helical tooth tip deformation is deduced. Then, this formula is applied to calculate the adden-dum modification width ac.
