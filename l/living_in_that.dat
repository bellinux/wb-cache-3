Adjacent Edgewater has also developed an active Japanese American community, particularly after the construction of the largest Japanese-oriented commercial center on the U.S. East Coast in this borough. As of March 2011, about 2,500 Japanese Americans lived in Fort Lee and Edgewater combined; this is the largest concentration of Japanese Americans in New Jersey. The remainder of Bergen County's Japanese residents are concentrated in northern communities, including Ridgewood. The Japanese-American Society of New Jersey is based in Fort Lee.|$|E
25|$|The same territories were {{claimed by}} those nations <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> region {{that had already}} risen their {{national}} development to independent statehood: Shkodër vilayet was claimed by the Serbs and Montenegrins, Kosovo vilayet by the Serbs, Montenegrins and Bulgarians, Monastir vilayet by the Serbs, Greeks and Bulgarians and Janina Vilayet by the Greeks. A {{few weeks after the}} beginning of the First Balkan War, the biggest part of the territories intended for the Albanian Vilayet was in the hands of Balkan League member states, as a condominium. Final frontiers between the Balkan League members and the new Principality of Albania were decided by the treaties of London and Bucharest, and ignored the frontiers of the proposed Albanian Vilayet, leaving substantial Albanian populations living outside the newly established Albanian nation-state.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} of the city, in 1462 Sultan Mehmet II (r. 1444–1446; 1451–1481) {{fortified}} the harbour, now known as Kadırga Limanı ("Harbour of the Galleys"), building several towers. However, {{the beginning of the}} construction in 1515 of a new arsenal on the Golden Horn, the Tersâne-i Âmire, protected from the storms provoked by the southwest wind, and the enormous growth of the Ottoman navy, caused the decay of the Kadırga Limanı. The 16th-century French traveller Pierre Gilles reports that around 1540 the women <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> neighbourhood used to wash their clothes in the basin. However, in some 18th-century maps, the harbour is still shown in active use. The end of the port was accelerated by the erection of the Nuruosmaniye Mosque, started in 1748, since the excavated earth was partly thrown in the harbour. The basin and the arsenal have since long time disappeared, and today they are partly built up.|$|E

25|$|The Etruscans had a rich literature, {{as noted}} by Latin authors. Livy and Cicero were both aware that highly {{specialized}} Etruscan religious rites were codified in several sets of books written in Etruscan under the generic Latin title Etrusca Disciplina. The Libri Haruspicini dealt with divination from the entrails of the sacrificed animal, while the Libri Fulgurales expounded the art of divination by observing lightning. A third set, the Libri Rituales, might have provided a key to Etruscan civilization: its wider scope embraced Etruscan standards {{of social and political}} life, as well as ritual practices. According to the 4th century Latin writer Maurus Servius Honoratus, a fourth set of Etruscan books existed; dealing with animal gods, but it is unlikely that any scholar <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> era could have read Etruscan. However, only one book (as opposed to inscription), the Liber Linteus, survived, and only because the linen on which it was written was used as mummy wrappings. By AD 100, Etruscan had been replaced by Latin. Around 180, the Latin author Aulus Gellius mentions Etruscan alongside the Gaulish language in an anecdote.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time as the Balkan Muslim experiment, {{divisions}} were raised from Ukrainian, Russian and Hungarian men, demonstrating that racial exclusivity was no longer an entry requirement for the Waffen-SS. In April 1943, a recruiting campaign began among Ukrainians <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> part of General Government (Polish) territory that had been in Austrian Galicia prior to 1919. These Ukrainian nationalists had been referred to by Himmler as [...] "sub-human" [...] only a matter of months before. The resulting division was the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician). After a brief period of desperate fighting in mid-1944 during the Soviet Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive, only 3,000 escaped encirclement and destruction from an original strength of 14,000. Less than outstanding in combat, the division never saw action again.|$|E

But she's <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> place {{out of fear that}} she won't be able to control herself." [...] Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as [...] "a punk-rock vegan pacifist", with inspiration drawn from Debbie Harry, Greta Garbo, and the artwork of Dan Flavin. Burton said that the White Queen's appearance was inspired by Nigella Lawson.|$|E

500|$|After {{several months}} in Oklahoma they {{proceeded}} to the area around Ashland, Oregon, where Anderson claimed to have befriended Hawaiian and Haitian migrant families who were working as fruit pickers. Anderson often claimed {{that he had been}} instructed in the magical practices of Hawaiian Kahuna and Haitian Vodou, with his later wife referring to him as both [...] "one of the last Kahuna" [...] and [...] "a priest of Voudou". He claimed to have been instructed in Vodou by Haitians who were working in southern Oregon. While <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> state he attended a school for the blind, although despite this was largely self-educated. The family moved around the state in the coming years; in August 1928 they were living in Pinehurst, where Hilbert was recorded as working as an engineer at a lumber mill in the 1930 census. By the 1940 census, the family were recorded as living in East Phoenix, Jackson county, Oregon, with Higbert adding that he had also been living there in 1935. At this point, Hilbert was working as a millwright and Mary as a trained nurse. In 1942 they were recorded as living in Ashland, and it was here that they attended the First Baptist Church, before relocating to Bend prior to 1944.|$|E
500|$|Clearly, Charles' interim {{solution}} could not continue. He ordered a general Diet in Augsburg {{at which the}} various states would discuss the religious problem and its solution. He himself did not attend, and delegated authority to his brother, Ferdinand, to [...] "act and settle" [...] disputes of territory, religion and local power. At the conference, Ferdinand cajoled, persuaded and threatened the various representatives into agreement on three important principles. The principle of cuius regio, eius religio provided for internal religious unity within a state: The religion of the prince became {{the religion of the}} state and all its inhabitants. Those inhabitants who could not conform to the prince's religion were allowed to leave, an innovative idea in the 16th century; this principle was discussed at length by the various delegates, who finally reached agreement on the specifics of its wording after examining the problem and the proposed solution from every possible angle. The second principle covered the special status of the ecclesiastical states, called the ecclesiastical reservation, or reservatum ecclesiasticum. If the prelate of an ecclesiastic state changed his religion, the men and women <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> state did not have to do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post, although this was not spelled out in the agreement. The third principle, known as Ferdinand's Declaration, exempted knights and some of the cities from the requirement of religious uniformity, if the reformed religion had been practiced there since the mid-1520s, allowing for a few mixed cities and towns where Catholics and Lutherans had lived together. It also protected the authority of the princely families, the knights and some of the cities to determine what religious uniformity meant in their territories. Ferdinand inserted this at the last minute, on his own authority.|$|E
