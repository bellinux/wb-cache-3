30|$|The {{submersible}} {{pumping unit}} {{is a new}} type of pumping system for <b>lifting</b> <b>formation</b> fluids from onshore oil wells, and the identification of its working condition has an important influence on oil production. In this paper we proposed a diagnostic method for identifying the working condition of the submersible pumping system. Based on analyzing the working principle of the pumping unit and the pump structure, different characteristics in loading and unloading processes of the submersible linear motor were obtained at different working conditions. The characteristic quantities were extracted from operation data of the submersible linear motor. A diagnostic model based on the support vector machine (SVM) method was proposed for identifying the working condition of the submersible pumping unit, where the inputs of the SVM classifier were the characteristic quantities. The performance and the misjudgment rate of this method were analyzed and validated by the data acquired from an experimental simulation platform. The model proposed had an excellent performance in failure diagnosis of the submersible pumping system. The SVM classifier had higher diagnostic accuracy than the learning vector quantization (LVQ) classifier.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor {{the past}} few years, LATMOS has been {{involved}} in the development of micro-ARES, an electric field sensor part of the science payload (DREAMS) of the ExoMars 2016 Schiaparelli entry, descent and landing demonstrator. It is dedicated to the very first measurement and characterization of the Martian atmospheric electricity which is suspected to be at the very basis of various phenomenon such as dust <b>lifting,</b> <b>formation</b> of oxidizing agents or Schumann resonances. Although the data collection will be restricted to a few days of operations, these first results will be of importance to understand the Martian dust cycle, the electrical environment and possibly relevant to atmospheric chemistry. The instrument, a compact version of the ARES instrument for the ExoMars Humboldt payload, is composed of an electronic board, with an amplification line and a real-time data processing DSP, which handles the electric signal measured between the spherical electrode (located {{at the top of a}} 27 -cm high antenna) that adjusts itself to the local atmospheric potential, and the lander chassis, connected to the mechanical ground. Since the electric fields on Mars have never been measured before, we can rely on two sources in order to know their expected order of magnitude. The first one is the measurement of the atmospheric electric fields on Earth, at the surface (in dust storms or the so-called dust-devils) or in the high atmosphere (closer to the Martian temperature and pressure conditions). The second one is the computer simulation of the phenomenon, that we obtained by combining two models. On the one hand, the mesoscale PRAMS model, developed at SwRI, which has the ability to simulate the dust transportation, and on the other hand the implementation made at LATMOS of Farell's 2005 dust-triboelectricity equations. Those models allowed us to simulate electric fields up to tens or even hundreds of kilo-volts per meter inside dust devils, which corresponds to the observations made on Earth and transposed to the Martian atmospheric parameters. Knowing the expected electric fields and simulating them, the next step in order to evaluate the performance of the instrument is to determine its sensitivity by modelling the response of the instrument. The last step is to confront the model of the instrument, and the expected results for a given signal with the effective outputs of the electric board with the same signal as an input. To achieve this end-to-end test, we use a signal generator followed by an electrical circuit reproducing the electrode behaviour in the Martian environment, in order to inject a realistic electric signal in the processing board and finally compare the produced formatted data with the expected ones...|$|E

5000|$|Airflow at {{supersonic}} speeds generates <b>lift</b> {{through the}} <b>formation</b> of shock waves, {{as opposed to}} the patterns of airflow over and under the wing.

40|$|The {{inclined}} {{impact test}} is an efficient method for characterizing the fatigue strength of interfaces of nanocrystalline diamond coatings (NCD). During this test, an oscillating oblique load induces repetitive shear stresses into the region between film and its substrate. Inclined impact tests were conducted on NCD coated specimens with a thickness of ca. 5 mu m at forces up to 850 N and 1. 5 million loading cycles. The related imprints were evaluated by confocal microscopy measurements and EDX micro-analyses. Dependent on the applied load, after {{a certain number of}} impacts, damages in the film interface region develop resulting in coating detachment In this way, residual stresses of the film are released leading to its <b>lifting</b> (bulge <b>formation).</b> The bulges are destroyed by further repetitive impacts and the coating is totally removed. The geometry of the developed NCD coating's bulges can be effectively described by appropriate Finite Element Method (FEM) supported calculations. Based on the attained impact test results, Woehler-like diagrams were developed for monitoring the fatigue failure or endurance of NCD coatings at various impact conditions. Employing such diagrams, the fatigue strength of NCD coatings can be assessed.

This alternative method aims to overcome {{the limitations of the}} well-established and mature screen-printing (SP) technique. Such limitations are for instance restrictions in the grid pattern design, high-temperature steps, and limited aspect ratio of the line contact (Poulain et al. in Appl Surf Sci 257 : 5241 - 5244, 2011). Although different new front contact metallization concepts have been studied, most of them require a second print step to increase the volume of the contact (Gao et al. in Proceedings of 25 th EU PVSEC conference, 2010; Beaucarne and Schubert in Energy Proc 67 : 2 - 12, 2015; Lossen and Matusovsky in Energy Proc 67 : 156 - 162, 2015; Green in Phys E 14 : 65 - 70, 2002; Lennon et al. in Prog Photovolt Res Appl V 21 : 1454 - 1468, 2012).

Moreover, the altitude of their bases can be higher than the level of condensation by convection or even higher than the level of free convection; it depends on the altitude where the forcing occurs. This phenomenon may occur when a cumulonimbus is in the vicinity. The latter will produce an outflow downstream of the cumulonimbus. The outflow boundary behaves like a pseudo cold front that generates a mechanical forcing where the outflow meets the surrounding air.

In contrast, liquid-origin cirrus has both LWC and IWC along their backward trajectories; it forms via lifting from the lower troposphere and freezing of mixed-phase clouds. This classification is applied to 12 years of ERA-Interim ice clouds in the North Atlantic region.

In the present study some analysis is taken up at first on the details of the flow quantities in the core region of the vortical flows, it being the essential part of the vortex, while the surrounding outer region, as accompanying field, retains its usual potential flow character. In case of <b>lifting</b> wings vortex <b>formation</b> at the wing- and flap-edges is a common feature. When high aspect ratio wings with high-lift devices in the landing phase are concerned, they give rise to strong multiple vortices. It is observed that the wing-tip vortex spirals around the stronger flap-edge vortex, with continual decrease of the radial distance between them. Hence, it is essential to analyze the physics and kinematics of such vortex motion.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of pressure and flow rate on momentum-dominated methane laminar flames’ flickering and radiation characteristics were experimental studied {{to provide a}} focused description of diffusion flame behavior at sub-atmospheric pressure of 50 - 100 kPa. Measurement system consisted of CCD camera, high speed camera and schlieren system, radiation flux meter. Parameters including flame length, liftoff height, flickering frequency, and radiation intensity were compared and analyzed over the pressure range of 50 - 100 kPa in a low pressure combustion cabin. The controlled fuel mass flow rates provided diffusion flames of 5. 95 - 23. 81 mg/s stable at all ambient pressures considered. Experiment results indicated that for momentum-dominated jet flame, flame lengths were not dependent on pressure but linearly dependent on mass flow rate. As soot volume fraction was strongly influenced by pressure, when pressure descended, the radiation intensity declined resulted from reduction of soot <b>formation.</b> <b>Lift</b> off phenomenon of diffusion flames was not significant, however, liftoff heights also increased with increasing pressure and mass flow rate gradually.

40|$|The flow at low Reynolds number around {{rectangular}} cylinders {{of varying}} chord-to-thickness ratios under transverse periodic forcing is studied numerically. Although of relatively low amplitude, the forcing locks the shedding {{from both the}} {{leading and trailing edges}} to the applied frequency. The base suction, and the lift and the drag on the cylinders are found to be complex functions of the forcing frequency. At low Reynolds numbers and without applied forcing, the flow is controlled by a global instability with the leading- and trailing-edge shedding locked; moreover, the reduced frequency of shedding varies in a stepwise manner with the chord-to-thickness ratio. This global instability is still evident in the flows under external forcing examined in this paper. While previous researchers have conjectured that the trailing-edge shedding plays a dominant role in the preferred frequency selection in the natural shedding case, the important role of trailing-edge shedding when the flow is forced is confirmed in the present study. In particular, the individual contributions from leading- and trailing-edge vortices on the perturbation to the leading-edge shear layer are examined. In addition, it is shown that the base suction is maximum when the forcing frequency is close to the global instability frequency observed in unforced flows, thereby strengthening the argument that the unforced, forced, and duct resonant cases are strongly influenced by the same global instability. The variations of the <b>lift,</b> drag and <b>formation</b> length with chord-to-thickness ratio are quantified. 1...|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo {{assess the}} {{suitability}} of a new 345 nm ultraviolet (UV) femtosecond laser for refractive surgery. SettingDepartment of Ophthalmology, University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany. DesignExperimental study. MethodsTwenty-five porcine corneas were used for stromal flap or lamellar bed creation (stromal depth, 150 μm) and 15 rabbit corneas for lamellar bed creation near the endothelium. Ultraviolet femtosecond laser cutting-line morphology, gas formation, and keratocyte death rate were evaluated using light and electron microscopy and compared with a standard infrared (IR) femtosecond laser. Endothelial cell survival was examined after application of a laser cut near the endothelium. ResultsFlaps created by the UV laser were <b>lifted</b> easily. Gas <b>formation</b> was reduced 4. 2 -fold compared with the IR laser (P =. 001). The keratocyte death rate near the interface was almost doubled; however, the death zone was confined to a region within 38 μm ± 10 (SD) along the cutting line. Histologically and ultrastructurally, a distinct and continuous cutting line was not found after UV femtosecond laser application if flap lifting was omitted and standard energy parameters were used. Instead, a regular pattern of vertical striations, presumably representing self-focusing induced regions of optical tissue breakdown, were identified. Lamellar bed creation with standard energy parameters 50 μm from the endothelium rendered the endothelial cells intact and viable.

40|$|On {{continental}} {{to regional}} scales feedbacks between landuse and landcover change and climate {{have been widely}} documented over the past 10 ¿ 15 years. In the present study we explore the possibility that also vegetation changes over much smaller areas may affect local precipitation regimes. Large scale (105 ha) irrigated plantations in semi-arid environments under particular conditions may affect local circulations and induce additional rainfall. Capturing this rainfall `surplus¿ could then {{reduce the need for}} external irrigation sources and eventually lead to self-sustained water cycling. This concept is studied in the coastal plains in South West Saudi Arabia where the mountains of the Asir region exhibit the highest rainfall of the peninsula due to orographic lifting and condensation of moisture imported with the Indian Ocean monsoon and with disturbances from the Mediterranean Sea. We use a regional atmospheric modeling system (RAMS) forced by ECMWF analysis data to resolve the effect of complex surface conditions in high resolution (¿x = 4 km). After validation, these simulations are analysed with a focus on the role of local processes (sea breezes, orographic <b>lifting</b> and the <b>formation</b> of fog in the coastal mountains) in generating rainfall, and on how these will be affected by large scale irrigated plantations in the coastal desert. The validation showed that the model simulates the regional and local weather reasonably well. The simulations exhibit a slightly larger diurnal temperature range than those captured by the observations, but seem to capture daily sea-breeze phenomena well. Monthly rainfall is well reproduced at coarse resolutions, but appears more localized at high resolutions. The hypothetical irrigated plantation (3. 25 105 ha) has significant effects on atmospheric moisture, but due to weakened sea breezes this leads to limited increases of rainfall. In terms of recycling of irrigation gifts the rainfall enhancement in this particular setting is rather insignificant...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which cloud {{immersion}} provides water in addition to rainfall, suppresses transpiration, and sustains tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) during rainless periods is not well understood. Climate and land use changes represent a threat to these forests if cloud base altitude rises {{as a result of}} regional warming or deforestation. To establish a baseline for quantifying future changes in cloud base, we installed a ceilometer at 100  m altitude in the forest upwind of the TMCF that occupies an altitude range from ∼[*] 600  m to the peaks at 1100  m in the Luquillo Mountains of eastern Puerto Rico. Airport Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) ceilometer data, radiosonde data, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite data were obtained to investigate seasonal cloud base dynamics, altitude of the trade-wind inversion (TWI), and typical cloud thickness for the surrounding Caribbean region. Cloud base is rarely quantified near mountains, so these results represent a first look at seasonal and diurnal cloud base dynamics for the TMCF. From May  2013 to August  2016, cloud base was lowest during the midsummer dry season, and cloud bases were lower than the mountaintops as often in the winter dry season as in the wet seasons. The lowest cloud bases most frequently occurred at higher elevation than 600  m, from 740 to 964  m. The Luquillo forest low cloud base altitudes were higher than six other sites in the Caribbean by ∼[*] 200 – 600  m, highlighting the importance of site selection to measure topographic influence on cloud height. Proximity to the oceanic cloud system where shallow cumulus clouds are seasonally invariant in altitude and cover, along with local trade-wind orographic <b>lifting</b> and cloud <b>formation,</b> may explain the dry season low clouds. The results indicate that climate change threats to low-elevation TMCFs are not limited to the dry season; changes in synoptic-scale weather patterns that increase frequency of drought periods during the wet seasons (periods of higher cloud base) may also impact ecosystem health...|$|R
40|$|Cold chamber high {{pressure}} die casting, (HPDC), {{is an important}} commercial process {{for the production of}} complex near net shape aluminium and magnesium alloy castings. The work presented in the thesis was aimed at investigating the microstructure formation in this type of casting. The solidification characteristics related to the process and the alloys control the formation of grains and defects. This again has {{a significant impact on the}} mechanical properties of the castings. The investigations were carried out mainly using the AM 60 magnesium alloy and the A 356 aluminium alloy. Two different casting arrangements were used: the cold chamber HPDC and the gravity die casting methods, which allowed for different flow and solidification conditions. The microstructures in the castings were investigated using optical microscopy, image analysis, scanning electron microscopy, electron back scatter diffraction measurements and electron probe microanalysis. In the HPDC experiments, the shot sleeve solidification conditions were investigated primarily by changing the melt superheat on pouring. This significantly affected the microstructures in the castings. The fraction of externally solidified crystals (ESCs) was consistently found to be largest near the gate in both the AM 60 and the A 356 die castings. This was attributed to the inherent shot sleeve solidification conditions and the flow set up by the plunger movement. When the superheat was increased, a lower fraction of ESCs was found in the castings. Furthermore, a high superheat gave ESCs with branched dendritic/elongated trunk morphology whilst a low superheat generated coarser and more globular ESCs, both in the AM 60 and the A 356 castings. The ESCs typically segregated towards the central region of the cross sections at further distances from the gate in the die castings. When a thin layer of thermal insulating coating was applied on the shot sleeve wall in the production of AM 60 die castings, it nearly removed all ESCs in the castings. Using an A 356 alloy, (and no shot sleeve coating), with no Ti in solution gave a significantly lower fraction of ESCs, whereas AlTi 5 B 1 grain refiner additions induced an increase in the fraction of ESCs and a significantly finer grain size in the castings. The formation of globular ESCs was enhanced when AlTi 5 B 1 grain refiner was added to the A 356 alloy. In controlled laboratory gravity die casting experiments, typical HPDC microstructures were created by pouring semi-solid metal into a steel die: The ESCs were found to segregate/migrate to the central region during flow, until a maximum packing, (fraction of ESCs of ~ 35 - 40 %), was reached. The extent of segregation is determined by the fraction of ESCs, and the die temperature affects the position of the ESCs. The segregation of ESCs was explained to occur during flow as a result of <b>lift</b> forces. The <b>formation</b> of banded defects has also been studied: the position of the bands was affected by the die temperature and the fraction of ESCs. Based on the nature of the bands and their occurrence, a new theory on the formation of defect bands was proposed: During flow the solid distribution from the die wall consists of three regions: 1) a solid fraction gradient at the wall; 2) a low solid fraction region which carries (3) a network of ESCs. A critical fraction solid exists where the deformation rate exceeds the interdendritic flow rate. When the induced stress exceeds the network strength, deformation can occur by slip, followed by liquid flow. The liquid flow is caused by solidification shrinkage, hydrostatic pressure on the interior ESC network, and gaps forming which draw in liquid. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|With {{the quest}} for {{permanent}} advances in semiconductor devices, increased interest in other semiconductor materials, like germanium, has arisen in the last years. Compared to silicon, which is currently the key constituent in microelectronic devices, the physics and chemistry of germanium and its natural oxide is considerably less studied and numerous scientific challenges are yet to be met. A particular example is the systematic investigation of surface related phenomena such as the adsorption of foreign atoms or molecules on the germanium surface. Thorough knowledge about adsorption mechanisms {{is in fact the}} key for a fundamental understanding of various physical and chemical processes such as oxidation, passivation, film growth etc. In this thesis we discuss the adsorption of oxygen and sulfur on Ge(100) surfaces and the specific chemical, atomic and electronic structure of these O/Ge and S/Ge systems. In particular, the adsorption of oxygen from a gas phase and the adsorption of sulfur from a liquid phase are studied using complementary surface-sensitive experimental techniques combined with theoretical calculations. The first part of this study discusses the intrinsic surface properties of clean Ge surfaces, with special emphasis on surfaces cleaned in an HF solution. Unlike in situ cleaning methods, this wet-chemical treatment resulted in a hydrophilic OH/Ge(100) surface with high atomic disorder and an increased surface roughness. Applying concepts of fractal scaling to quantitatively assess variations in surface profiles, we were able to identify the impact of temperature induced atomic processes (e. g. desorption, diffusion) on the sub-micrometer roughness of the Ge surface. These results demonstrate that chemically clean surfaces may exhibit defects that increase the surface roughness at the atomic scale. In contrast, on a large scale no pronounced changes in the surface roughness were observed. The information about the Ge surface chemical composition and morphology after cleaning forms the basis for the subsequentadsorption studies. In the second part of this thesis we study the high-coverage adsorption of oxygen on a Ge(100) -(2 × 1) surface. The O 2 -exposed surface exhibits a local (1 × 1) surface reconstruction. This implies that Ge dimer bonds are destroyed during oxygen adsorption, consequently the (2 × 1) dimer reconstruction is <b>lifted.</b> Yet, the <b>formation</b> of an ideal O-overlayer is inhibited by the creation of Ge adatoms during the oxidation process. Our experimental results indicate that the insertion of oxygen atoms into Ge backbonds is not favored at room temperature. The adsorption of oxygen on the dimer site passivates electronic surface states, which are originating from Ge dangling bonds. Remarkably, the Ge adatoms induce distinctly different electronic properties compared to the well-ordered, oxidized surface regions. In other words, the O/Ge(100) system exhibits site-specific surface properties. Finally, the adsorption of sulfur from an (NH 4) 2 S solution was investigated. It was found that the adsorption mechanisms and the properties of the S/Ge system are drastically affected by surface GeOx present before and after sulfur adsorption. In particular, these oxides inhibit the adsorption of a full monolayer of sulfur, disturb the long-range atomic order and reduce the S-Ge bond length. Similar to the adsorption of oxygen from a gas phase, sulfur adsorbs in the bridge sites forming Ge-S-Ge bonds. The Ge-S bonds have partial ionic character, causing depletion of majority charge carriers near the surface. Yet, the density of electronic surface states is significantly reduced upon sulfur adsorption. Despite the passivation of surface states, the S/Ge system is only for limited time periods chemically passivated. Prolonged exposure to ambient conditions leads to the oxidation of sulfur and eventually to the degradation of the S-overlayer. The S/Ge(100) system likewise exhibits laterally inhomogeneous surface properties. In general, we conclude that both similarities and differences are observed between the adsorption of O and S on Ge(100) surfaces and that in neither case an ideal overlayer is formed. This study significantly improved the atomicscale understanding of these specific adsorption processes, which is the key for a profound fundamental understanding of the oxidation and sulfidation mechanisms of Ge surfaces.
