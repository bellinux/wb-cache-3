Co-stars include Ray Romano, Olivia Wilde, Juno Temple, Andrew Dice Clay, Ato Essandoh, Max Casella, and James Jagger. On December 2, 2014, Vinyl was picked up by HBO.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{adaptation}} of the recently proposed graph-shifts algorithm for labeling MRF problems from low-level vision. Graph-shifts is an energy minimization algorithm that does labeling by dynamically manipulating, or shifting, the parent-child relationships in a hierarchical decomposition of the image. Graph-shifts was originally proposed for labeling using relatively small <b>label</b> <b>sets</b> (e. g., 9) for problems in high-level vision. In the low-level vision problems we consider, there are much larger <b>label</b> <b>sets</b> (e. g., 256). However, the original graph-shifts algorithm does not scale well {{with the number of}} labels; for example, the memory requirement is quadratic in the number of labels. We propose four improvements to the graph-shifts representation and algorithm that make it suitable for doing labeling on these large <b>label</b> <b>sets.</b> We implement and test the algorithm on two low-level vision problems: image restoration and stereo. Our results demonstrate the potential for such a hierarchical energy minimization algorithm on low-level vision problems with large <b>label</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R

500|$|Tricky asked Mark Saunders to co-produce Maxinquaye {{after being}} {{impressed}} by his previous work with English rock band The Cure on their albums Mixed Up (1990) and Wish (1992). They recorded Maxinquaye {{in the first half}} of 1994 at Tricky's home studio in Kilburn; further recording later took place at the Loveshack and Eastcote studios in Notting Hill. Island Records, 4th & B'Way's parent <b>label,</b> <b>set</b> up equipment in the home studio at Tricky's request, including an Akai S1000 sampler, an Atari 1040 computer with Logic software, an Alesis ADAT recorder, an AKG C3000 microphone, a Behringer Composer compressor, and a Mackie 1604 mixing desk. The recording sessions were somewhat chaotic, and Saunders, who had the impression he would only perform engineering duties, often found himself serving as a DJ and programmer. Tricky instructed him on what to sample, regardless of different tempos and pitches, and asked him to piece the results together, something Saunders achieved by pitch-shifting the respective samples until the combination sounded satisfactory. The samples they experimented with were taken from the many vinyl records that Saunders recalled were [...] "littered" [...] all over Tricky's floor. Influenced by dub music's production techniques, Tricky exhaustively altered borrowed sounds on his sampler, mixed tracks as they were being recorded live in the studio, and preserved sounds that otherwise would have been unwanted in the final mix, including glitches and crackles.|$|E

40|$|Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) {{have been}} applied with {{considerable}} success {{to a number of}} natural language processing tasks. However, these tasks have mostly involved very small <b>label</b> <b>sets.</b> When deployed on tasks with larger <b>label</b> <b>sets,</b> the requirements for computational resources mean that training becomes intractable. This paper describes a method for training CRFs on such tasks, using error correcting output codes (ECOC). A number of CRFs are independently trained on the separate binary labelling tasks of distinguishing between a subset of the labels and its complement. During decoding, these models are combined to produce a predicted label sequence which is resilient to errors by individual models. Error-correcting CRF training is much less resource intensive and has a much faster training time than a standardly formulated CRF, while decoding performance remains quite comparable. This allows us to scale CRFs to previously impossible tasks, as demonstrated by our experiments with large <b>label</b> <b>sets.</b> ...|$|R
