5|$|In {{addition}} to the two new cups, {{it is also possible}} to create custom cups. The disk can save up to a hundred tracks and up to three ghost racers per course. IGN singled out the track creator as the F-Zero X Expansion Kits strongest feature since it is virtually the same tool the designers of F-Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits. The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle. Using a set of pre-existing parts, the player must balance their creations' settings and performance abilities before the machine is finished and named. The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout of the track and also add points to it to create track elements such as curves and hills. Furthermore, numerous different properties <b>like</b> <b>half</b> pipes and cylinders, as well as numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones, can be added. The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps.|$|E

[...] Like Jeffery, he said the visual effects were [...] "generally pretty good" [...] but criticised the CGI used for Jennifer's special abilities. Keith Phipps on The A.V.

His complaint was that it [...] "truly [...] <b>like</b> <b>half</b> a story in the way the best Doctor Who two-parters don't", though he said it managed to plant intriguing strands for the conclusion.|$|E

500|$|He {{was offered}} the chance to direct Iron Man 3 for Marvel Studios but {{declined}} and instead signed on to direct Les Misérables for Working Title Films, which he had first heard about while discussing a different project with screenwriter William Nicholson in 2010. Hooper {{had not seen the}} musical, so watched a performance of it in London's West End. Adapted from the musical, the film starred Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Eddie Redmayne. As the film required the actors to sing and dance, they were auditioned in front of Hooper, producers and composers. The role of Fantine was hugely contested; Hooper said, [...] "It was <b>like</b> <b>half</b> a dozen of the biggest female movie stars on the planet wanted to play the role".|$|E
500|$|The two-storey {{house is}} built in coursed stone with steep, Welsh slate roofing. Its {{asymmetrical}} design incorporates an eclectic range of Gothic elements, including tall, polygonal chimney stacks, a four-centred arch doorway, dragon motifs and carved pinnacles. The eastern façade includes two gables {{with a tall}} four-centred arch window. To the right is a tower of three-storeys with a pointed roof which connects to a projecting bay of two storeys. The bay incorporates a stack of three square windows topped with a Flamboyant arch, two hipped roofs with decorative spikes, and three chimneys. The rear is more simple; the windows are mullioned and most are square, except for three bay windows. It has two wings laid out <b>like</b> <b>half</b> an [...] "H", which each have a gable and embattled parapets.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the music}} on Ecstasy has been criticised as being [...] "directionless and floundered about within the {{framework}} of songs which appeared to be only half formed ideas," [...] which was due to the band's in-studio experimentation with different aspects of their guitar sound. In hindsight, Shields said that [...] "even when we'd finished it we didn't <b>like</b> <b>half</b> the songs we'd done. The record never came out right and it made us realise that we were still too twee". In response to the band's [...] "unwanted reputation for jangly feyness", My Bloody Valentine later incorporated elements of American indie rock music and Shields customised his guitars' tremolo systems, resulting in the band pioneering an alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing. The term [...] "shoegazing", which was considered derogatory, was coined by Sounds journalists in the early 1990s to describe certain bands' [...] "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor".|$|E

500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems <b>like</b> <b>half</b> of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I think that was a curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Josh Modell of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode was [...] "boring" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and was particularly disappointing following the episode [...] "Fishsticks" [...] the previous week. Modell said, [...] "South Park episodes don't get much lazier or uninspired than this one. It was <b>like</b> <b>half</b> an idea stretched out forever and ever, and {{with very little}} payoff." [...] Carlos Delgado of If Magazine said the episode plot was too silly and lacked laughs: [...] "All in all, I was left feeling a little cheated. [...] "Pinewood Derby" [...] wasn’t funny, it was just weird." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said the episode was told with [...] "the warp-speed storytelling style that is making this season one of South Parks best". Travis Fickett of IGN said {{he was happy to}} see an episode centered on Randy Marsh, who he said is an excellent character; Fickett said of [...] "Pinewood Derby", [...] "This isn't a great episode but its fast-paced lunacy in the South Park tradition and most of the genre tropes it riffs on are dead on." ...|$|E

In February and March 2010, the band participated in the Soundwave festival in Australia. On this tour, the band performed sideshows with Enter Shikari. After returning home, Rubano sent {{the rest of the}} band song ideas, which were ignored: [...] "No responses to <b>like</b> <b>half</b> a dozen songs being sent out. Just, very weird." [...] Following two weeks of no communication with the band, three members of the band and their manager held a conference call with Rubano. During the call, the band stated their intention of continuing without him. Likewise, Fazzi received a call saying that the group were letting him go. On March 29, statements by Fazzi and Rubano announcing their departure from the group were posted on the band's website. Two days later, it was announced that former members guitarist John Nolan and bassist Shaun Cooper had re-joined the band.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his work on}} Trouble in Mind, Divine again became involved with a John Waters project, the film Hairspray (1988). Set in Baltimore during the 1960s, Hairspray revolved around self-proclaimed [...] "pleasantly plump" [...] teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local television show and rallies against racial segregation. As he had in Waters's earlier film Female Trouble, Divine took on two roles in the film, {{one of which was}} female and the other male. The first of these, Edna Turnblad, was Tracy's loving mother; Divine would later note that with this character he could not be accurately described as a drag queen, proclaiming [...] "What drag queen would allow herself to look like this? I look <b>like</b> <b>half</b> the women from Baltimore." [...] His second character in the film was that of the racist television station owner Arvin Hodgepile. In one interview, Divine admitted that he had hoped to play both the role of mother and daughter in Hairspray, but that the producers had been [...] "a bit leery" [...] and chose Ricki Lake for the latter role instead. Divine went on to state his opinion on Lake, jokingly telling the interviewer that [...] "She is nineteen and delightful. I hate her." [...] In reality they had become good friends while working together on set. Reviews of the film were predominantly positive, with Divine in particular being singled out for praise; several commentators expressed their opinion that the film marked Divine's breakthrough into mainstream cinema. He subsequently took his mother to the film's premier in the Miami Film Festival before she once more accompanied him to the Baltimore premier, this time also with several of his other relatives. After the screening, a party was held at the Baltimore Museum of Art, where Frances Milstead granted an impromptu interview to the English film critic Jonathan Ross, a friend and fan of Divine's.|$|E

[...] As a teenager, Yeston had seen the film, about a film director suffering a midlife crisis and a creativity drought, and he was intrigued by its themes. [...] "I looked at the screen and said 'That's me.' I still believed in all the dreams and ideals of what it was to be an artist, and here was a movie about... an artist in trouble. [...] It became an obsession," [...] Yeston told The New York Times in 1982. [...] Yeston called the musical Nine (the age of the director in his flashback), explaining that if you add music to 8½, [...] "it's <b>like</b> <b>half</b> a number more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Forbes's directorial debut {{came with}} Whistle Down the Wind (1961), again {{produced}} by Attenborough, a critically acclaimed film about three northern children who conceal a criminal in their barn, believing {{him to be}} a reincarnated Jesus Christ. It starred child actor Hayley Mills and Alan Bates, in one of his earliest film roles. The film was nominated for four BAFTA awards, including Best Film from any Source. It was the basis for a 1996 musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The L-Shaped Room (1962), his next film as director, with Leslie Caron in the female lead, led to her gaining a nomination for an Oscar, and winning the BAFTA (Best British Actress) and Golden Globe awards. Comments Phil Wickham: [...] "It feels <b>like</b> <b>half</b> a new wave film – a mid-point between the innovation of the Woodfall Films and the mainstream of the British film industry." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band partly {{returned}} to the creative process used {{in the creation of}} The Warning in that some parts of songs were written and recorded in Goddard's bedroom, with Taylor also writing from his house and recording in the room he designated as a [...] "music room". These parts were then built upon in a studio where the band had more space, enabling them to [...] "expand on things". Goddard used Cubase to record at his house whilst Logic Pro was used in the studio as well as GarageBand to create parts of songs. Of the latter Taylor said, [...] "that's what I use for recording, and that's <b>like</b> <b>half</b> of the record is going through that program". In regards {{to the creation of the}} music, Taylor stated that everyone had involvement in aspects of all of the tracks. Taylor stated that the group felt as though they had exhausted their home studio sound and the possibilities of the instruments they could use at home. Despite this, Taylor explained that he and Joe have a similar work aesthetic and that ideas would [...] "come [...] any time of the day or night"; working on material at home would enable them to [...] "record at home whenever ideas come". However Taylor stated, [...] "even the studio we worked in, it's not like a professional studio that is like, top of the range. It's just a big basement with a desk and various synthesisers and a drum kit." ...|$|E
