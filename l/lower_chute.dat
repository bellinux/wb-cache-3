40|$|IN MANY FACTORIES, {{the feed}} chute {{of the first}} mill is {{operated}} with a high chute level {{for the purpose of}} maximising the cane rate through the mill. There is a trend towards trying to control chute level within a small control range near the top of a chute that can result in rapid changes in cane feeding rate to maintain the chute level set point. This paper reviews the theory that predicts higher cane rate with higher chute level and discusses the main weakness in the theory that it does not consider the beneficial effect on capacity of cane falling {{from the top of the}} chute to the top surface of the cane mat. An extension to the chute theory model is described that predicts higher capacity with <b>lower</b> <b>chute</b> level because of the effect of the falling cane. The original model and this extended model are believed to be the upper and lower limits to the true effect. The paper reports an experiment that measured the real effect of chute level on capacity and finds that increasing chute level does lead to higher capacity but that the trend is only about one-third as strong as the original theory predicted. The paper questions whether the benefits of slightly greater capacity outweigh the costs of operating with the small control range near the top of the chute...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJennifer Minick-BormannCattle {{temperament}} {{has historically}} influenced selection decisions due to ease of handling. However, temperament may also influence economically relevant traits. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate relationships between temperament, Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) incidence, and resulting carcass merit in feedlot steers. Across a two year period, 2, 870 crossbred steers were shipped from a single ranch source to a feedlot. At the time of feedlot placement, as well as at the time of reimplantation, temperament was measured via chute score (CS) and exit velocity (EV). Blood samples were taken upon arrival to the feedlot to determine circulating concentrations of interleukin 8 (IL- 8) and cortisol, both of which are involved in immune function. Performance traits, including weight and gains, were measured at feedlot placement (d 0), reimplantation (d 73 - 100), and again 59 to 70 days later. Recorded carcass data included HCW (HCW), USDA yield grade (YG), marbling score (MS), ribeye area, and lung scores. Phenotypic statistical analysis was performed with SAS statistical software (SAS Inst., Inc., Cary, NC) and genetic parameters were estimated using ASREML (Ver. 3. 0, VSN International, Ltd., Hemel Hempstead, UK). The pedigree file included records of 7, 177 animals with up to 7 generation of pedigree. Contemporary group (CG, n= 11) included initial ranch unit, date of arrival to the feedlot, feedlot pen, and processing dates. Fixed effects included in the model were pre-feedlot entry BRD treatment and CG. Cattle with higher CS at placement subsequently had more BRD incidence (P < 0. 01). There was a positive phenotypic correlation between placement CS and blood cortisol concentrations (r = 0. 07; P< 0. 01), and cattle with higher cortisol concentration contracted BRD more often than their calmer peers (P < 0. 05). Circulating IL- 8 concentration had no influence on feedlot health. At the time of reimplantation, cattle that had been treated for BRD in the feedlot had <b>lower</b> <b>chute</b> scores (P < 0. 001). Heritability estimates for CS at placement, EV at placement, CS at reimplantation, and EV at reimplantation were 0. 23, 0. 17, 0. 19, and 0. 27, respectively. BRD incidence had a negative genetic correlation with all measures of temperament recorded at the second processing period...|$|E

50|$|One {{example of}} the {{expansion}} of the Water Regale network was the optimisation of several ditch courses (the Dam Ditch, Upper and <b>Lower</b> Rosenhof <b>Chutes),</b> mainly during the 19th century, by the construction of so-called Wasserläufen (also Wasserüberleitungsstollen) or water tunnels. These enabled the distance travelled by the water to be significantly shortened. It also guaranteed winter working, because the water running underground did not freeze up. In addition the maintenance cost of a short section of tunnel was much cheaper than that of a long ditch run. But a particularly important advantage was the higher discharge capacity. The tunnels descended the same height difference over a shorter distance and therefore had a steeper incline. Initially the underground sections were laboriously hewn out with hammer and chisel. Later gunpowder was used as an explosive, making the construction of water tunnels considerably easier and faster.|$|R
5000|$|The Double Diamond was {{the first}} {{pinsetter}} invented for five-pin. This pneumatic machine was characterized by a sweep that did not stay descended while the pin table was moving. The pin table {{is similar to a}} candlepin tube board with a protective front plate that was often used for advertising. This machine was known for many peculiar sounds; including a hiss on the descent of the pin table and a [...] "clang" [...] when the pin table is hit by a pin. The elevator and pit floor is similar to the Brunswick GSX. The pins and balls are elevated to an upper carousel, where the balls are separated from the pins. When five pins are aligned in the carousel, they are <b>lowered</b> into five <b>chutes</b> leading to each pin position. The machine is loaded with 21 to 22 pins.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} process {{began with the}} awarding of contracts. The first one was awarded in March 1931 when the Lake Shore Engine Works of Marquette was contracted to construct 150 hoists for raising and <b>lowering</b> the dock <b>chutes.</b> The second contract was let out on 1 April, to the Merritt-Chapman & Whitney Corporation of Duluth. This company was the successor to Whitney Bros. which specialized {{in the building of}} docks, bridges, heavy construction work of all kinds as well as river and harbor improvements. They would bring their experience to this project. The fabricated steel for the dock including the large steel ore chutes would be furnished by McClintick, Marshall Corporation of Chicago. Jernstad Electric of Ishpeming would install the electrical work and the Worden—Allen Company of Chicago was given the contract for furnishing all of the reinforced steel for the dock and its approach.|$|R
2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an inclined shaft which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} cross-cut at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a ladderway was put in at the side. The skip was a large steel container with small wheels running on wooden guides. It was <b>lowered</b> to a <b>chute</b> below a working level and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into other wagons to be taken along the cross-cut to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level. It worked well, {{but there was no way}} to get horses down to the lower levels, so tramming had to be done by hand. So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still [...] short of the 120Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|R
