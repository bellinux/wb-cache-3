50|$|The three board {{levels are}} denoted 1 (White's board), 2 (the middle board), and 3 (Black's board). Moves are {{recorded}} {{in the same manner}} as chess, using algebraic notation, with the only difference that each square is prefaced by its <b>level</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{board is}} a 6x6 grid with grooves in the tiles to allow cars to slide, card tray {{to hold the}} cards, current active card holder and an exit hole. The game comes with 16 {{vehicles}} (12 cars, 4 trucks) which each are colored differently and 40 puzzle cards. Additionally the cars take up 2 squares each and the trucks take up 3 squares each. Also all vehicles can only be moved within a straight line along the grid and they cannot be rotated. Lastly, the puzzle card shows which colored cars and trucks get placed {{on the board and}} where they should be placed. In addition to that, each card has a different <b>level</b> <b>number.</b> The higher the <b>level</b> <b>number,</b> the more difficult the challenge is.|$|E
5000|$|The {{player is}} {{presented}} with a 6x6 board of multi-colored fuzzballs called [...] "Chuzzles" [...] in order, which removes those Chuzzles and allows new Chuzzles to drop onto the board.

This [...] "wrapping" [...] of the grid can {{be a source of}} difficulty because some moves may require the player to drag edge Chuzzles to the middle. Eliminated Chuzzles' eyes fly into a flask {{to the left of the}} board.

50|$|In this mode, stage {{progression}} {{depends on}} player performance. If the player performs {{well in a}} stage, the next stage will have a higher <b>level</b> <b>number,</b> allowing the player to reach the real levels (Phase 1 and Phase 2) earlier. In other cases, the next stage will have a lower <b>level</b> <b>number,</b> or the stage loop ends early. The most advanced stages in the game, Real Mission (in which the player repels a terrorist attack) can only be reached by performing extremely well and not continuing. Real Mission Phase 2 has two bosses; the second true final boss (called the XTB-1(An experimental aircraft)) {{can be reached by}} not dying in Phase 1.
