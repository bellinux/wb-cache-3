Noble metal nanoparticles (NMNPs) are known for excellent nonlinear absorption properties, superior {{to that of the}} best organic optical limiters such as fullerenes or phthalocyanines. However, NMNPs lose much of these properties after few intense laser pulses due to photoinduced fragmentation. During the investigation of optical limiting (OL) in colloidal solutions, we found that {{a blend of}} AuNPs and ZnPcs in tetrahydrofuran (THF) shows the ability of self-heal photofragmented AuNPs simultaneously to laser irradiation. This self-repairing ability results in enhanced OL performances, that is, lower light <b>limitation</b> <b>threshold</b> and longer durability.

We used meta-analysis and an enzyme-driven biogeochemical model to explore the drivers and biogeochemical consequences {{of changes in the}} fungal-to-bacterial ratio (F : B). In our meta-analysis data set, F : B increased with soil C : N ratio (R 2 = 0. 224, P 3 ̆c 0. 001), a relationship predicted by our model. We found that differences in biomass turnover rates influenced F : B under conditions of C limitation, while differences in biomass stoichiometry set the upper bounds on F : B once a nutrient <b>limitation</b> <b>threshold</b> was reached. Ecological interactions between the two groups shifted along a gradient of resource stoichiometry. At intermediate substrate C : N, fungal N mineralisation fuelled bacterial growth, increasing total microbial biomass and decreasing net N mineralisation.

Though typically constructed {{as a set of}} dynamical equations, crop models are not often analyzed from a specifically dynamical systems point of view, despite its potential to elucidate the roles of feedbacks and internal and external forcings on system stability and the optimization of control protocols (e. g., irrigation and fertilization). Here we develop a minimal dynamical system, based in part on the widely known AquaCrop model, consisting of a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE's) describing the evolution of canopy cover, soil moisture, and soil nitrogen. These state variables are coupled through canopy growth and senescence, the evapotranspiration and percolation of soil moisture, and the uptake and leaching of soil nitrogen. The system is driven by random hydroclimatic forcing. Important crop model responses, such as biomass and yield, are calculated, and optimal yield and profitability under differing climate scenarios, irrigation strategies, and fertilization strategies are examined within the developed framework.

For the future ITS, massive information flows in different forms of service type, such as audio, video, as well as data burst will be exchanged not only for enriching passengers’ driving experience, but also for providing safe high-effect transportation guarantee in modern traffic communication system. Therefore, in the proposed system, after the first scheduling, packets with different traffic safety importance weights will be further classified based on their service type characteristics and delivered into corresponding buffer queues in a sequence by service type mapper. There are two kinds of buffer queues defined in our paper, which are real-time service type and non-real-time service type, respectively. Every service type buffer’s HOL packet will be once again associated with corresponding service type importance weight, which adaptively decided by: HOL packet’s service type QoS requirements, such as transmission delay <b>limitation</b> <b>threshold,</b> target packet error rate, etc.; the instant practical QoS performance of information flow which that HOL packet belongs to, such as HOL packet’s instant waiting time in its service type buffer, HOL packet instant data transmission rate, etc. At every scheduling time, the second level scheduler will adaptively decide the scheduling order of every service type buffer queue’s HOL packet: HOL packets with lager importance weights related to traffic safety and service type are always delivered to the target VS terminals prior to that with smaller importance weights.|$|E

We apply this result to establish an almost optimal lower bound of Ω(n 2 /ln 2 n) on the number of edges of any depth- 2 threshold circuit with polynomially bounded weights that computes the parity function. We also prove that any depth- 3 threshold circuit with polynomially bounded weights requires Ω(n 1. 2 /ln 5 / 3 n) edges to compute parity. On the other hand, we give a construction of a depth d threshold circuit that computes parity with n 1 + 1 /Θ(φd) edges where φ = (1 + √ 5) / 2 is the golden ratio.

In a previous study, the induction of pristinamycins production by Streptomyces pristinaespiralis as well as product concentrations were correlated with power dissipation per unit of volume (P/V) in shaking flasks. In this study, detailed kinetics of growth, substrate consumption, oxygen transfer rate and pristinamycins production under varying P/V conditions have been obtained and analyzed. Our results showed that higher P/V resulted in a higher concentration of biomass and promoted an earlier nutrient limitation and ultimately an earlier induction of pristinamycins production. The maximal specific growth rate, specific oxygen consumption rate and specific consumption rate of glutamate increased with P/V while influence was less marked with specific consumption rate of glucose, arginine, ammonium ions and phosphate.

The optimal MSE and average MSE of CBTS are 0.09 and 0.96202, respectively. The optimal MSE of the proposed method in low threshold are evidently lower than CBTS and threshold based method. Taking the MSEs achieved if threshold is 30 as an example, the optimal MSE of the proposed estimator is 0.44, while that of CBTS is 3.68. The average MSE of the proposed is 5.026, and that for CBTS is 79.522, which is about 15 times of the proposed one. In the situation of larger threshold, the proposed estimator and CBTS are nearly the same, for the number of samples derived after the correlation difference are limited, sometimes even without any sample. Therefore, these two algorithms have to choose an optimal result from the limited samples. Average MSEs of the proposed method are better than those of CBTS, especially in small threshold condition, which indicates that the proposed estimator has a better stability. For TFC 3, the proposed estimator also performs better than CBTS in general. The average MSEs of the proposed estimator demonstrate its better stability.
