5|$|Silver {{is usually}} {{found in nature}} {{combined}} with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally {{in the form of}} sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process. Lead melts at 327°C, <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> at 888°C and silver melts at 960°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960°C to 1000°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} coating able {{to change}} color was tested on Royal Navy submarines. On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> {{was applied to the}} hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation. For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea water would be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>oxides</b> are a {{group of}} {{inorganic}} compounds with formulas including lead (Pb) and oxygen (O).|$|R
50|$|Lead bromide was {{prevalent}} in the environment {{as the result of}} the use of leaded gasoline. Tetraethyl lead was once widely used to improve the combustion properties of gasoline. To prevent the resulting <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> from fouling the engine, gasoline was treated with an organobromine compound that converted <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> into the more volatile lead bromide, which was then exhausted from the engine into the environment.|$|R
5000|$|PbO may be {{prepared}} by heating lead metal in air at approximately 600 °C. At this temperature {{it is also}} the end product of oxidation of other <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> in air: ...|$|R
5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are {{mechanically}} weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties. While {{each of them}} will react with air, the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or a mixture of <b>lead</b> <b>oxide,</b> carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E
5|$|Known {{since the}} Middle Ages {{by the name}} plumb dulcis, the {{production}} of lead(II) nitrate from either metallic lead or <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> in nitric acid was small-scale, for direct use in making other lead compounds. In the 19th century lead(II) nitrate began to be produced commercially in Europe and the United States. Historically, the main use was as a raw material {{in the production of}} pigments for lead paints, but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on titanium dioxide. Other industrial uses included heat stabilization in nylon and polyesters, and in coatings of photothermographic paper. Since around the year 2000, lead(II) nitrate has begun to be used in gold cyanidation.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{compounds}} {{are used}} as, or in, coloring agents, oxidants, plastic, candles, glass, and semiconductors. Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% <b>lead</b> <b>oxide,</b> changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|E
50|$|With this method, tube diameters between 1.5 and 70 mm can be generated; The {{throughput}} {{is higher}} {{than it would have}} been with the Danner method. Furthermore, it is possible here to use glasses with highly volatile components, such as borates (borosilicate glass) and <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> (<b>lead</b> glass), since the temperatures at the drawing nozzle are lower than in the Danner muffle.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, flint {{glasses were}} lead glasses {{containing}} around 4-60% lead(II) oxide; however, the manufacture {{and disposal of}} these glasses were sources of pollution. In many modern flint glasses, <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> are replaced with other metal oxides such as titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide without significantly altering the optical properties of the glass.|$|R
50|$|The {{recycling}} smelter at Boss, Missouri, handles old batteries, scrap {{lead and}} lead-bearing hazardous waste. It {{is permitted to}} produce 152,410 metric tons of lead annually and in 2005 produced only 123,800 metric tons of secondary lead due to a tight scrap market. Fabricated Products produces value-added lead products such as <b>lead</b> <b>oxides,</b> <b>lead</b> sheet and lead pipes at facilities in Arizona and Washington. The Herculaneum smelter, the last remaining primary lead smelter in the United States, ceased operations on December 31, 2013.|$|R
25|$|Glasses with <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> content first {{appeared}} in Mesopotamia, {{the birthplace of the}} glass industry. The earliest known example is a blue glass fragment from Nippur dated to 1400 BC containing 3.66% PbO. Glass is mentioned in clay tablets from the reign of Assurbanipal (668–631 BC), and a recipe for lead glaze appears in a Babylonian tablet of 1700 BC. A red sealing-wax cake found in the Burnt Palace at Nimrud, from the early 6th century BC, contains 10% PbO. These low values suggest that <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> may not have been consciously added, and was certainly not used as the primary fluxing agent in ancient glasses.|$|E
25|$|Lead may be {{introduced}} into glass either as an ingredient {{of the primary}} melt or added to preformed leadless glass or frit. The <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> used in lead glass could be obtained {{from a variety of}} sources. In Europe, galena, lead sulfide, was widely available, which could be smelted to produce metallic lead. The lead metal would be calcined to form <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> by roasting it and scraping off the litharge. In the medieval period lead metal could be obtained through recycling from abandoned Roman sites and plumbing, even from church roofs. Metallic lead was demanded in quantity for silver cupellation, and the resulting litharge could be used directly by glassmakers. Lead was also used for ceramic lead glazes. This material interdependence suggests a close working relationship between potters, glassmakers, and metalworkers.|$|E
25|$|Lead crystal {{glassware}} {{was formerly}} used to store and serve drinks, {{but due to}} the potential health risks of lead, this has become rare. One alternative material is crystal glass, in which barium oxide, zinc oxide, or potassium oxide are employed instead of <b>lead</b> <b>oxide.</b> Lead-free crystal has a similar refractive index to lead crystal, but it is lighter and it has less dispersive power.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{electrokinetic}} (EK) {{technique is}} applied to separate lead and sulphate from the sludge of used/spent lead acid battery. XRD reveals that the sludge {{is a mixture of}} (PbO) 4 [Pb(SO 4) ], Pb 2 O 3, PbSO 4, Pb(S 2 O 3) and Pb 2 (SO 4) which upon DC voltage application in a EK cell employing either titanium electrodes or titanium substrate insoluble anode as electrodes caused migration of sulphates and lead ions respectively into anode and cathode compartments, and accumulation of insoluble <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> at the central compartment. The insoluble <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> accumulated at the central compartment in the ratio 1 : 3, respectively for the high oxygen over-voltage Ti-anode (Ti-EK cell) and low oxygen over-voltage TSIA-anode (TSIA-EK cell) shows the superiority of Ti anode over TSIA anode. Also thermal investigation reveals Pb deposited at Ti-cathode is superior to that from TSIA cathode.

25|$|The barium {{source was}} either {{witherite}} (BaCO3) or baryte (BaSO4). The rarity of witherite may favor baryte {{as the most}} likely source. Baryte has a slower decomposition rate and so favors Han blue production. Witherite conversely favors Han purple. In the use of baryte, lead salts (lead carbonate or <b>lead</b> <b>oxide)</b> would have been needed to increase yield. Lead has been detected in association with Han purple and Han blue.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{protective}} respiratory equipment {{can be traced}} back as far as the first century, when Pliny the Elder (circa A.D. 23-79) described using animal bladder skins to protect workers in Roman mines from red <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> dust. In the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci suggested that a finely woven cloth dipped in water could protect sailors from a toxic weapon made of powder that he had designed.|$|E
25|$|Planté's {{first model}} {{consisted}} of two lead sheets separated by rubber strips and rolled into a spiral. His batteries were first used to power the lights in train carriages while stopped at a station. In 1881, Camille Alphonse Faure invented an improved version that consisted of a lead grid lattice into which a <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> paste was pressed, forming a plate. Multiple plates could be stacked for greater performance. This design was easier to mass-produce.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stoichiometry}} of the {{end product}} can be controlled by changing the temperature - for example, in the above reaction, the first step occurs at 290 °C, second at 350 °C, third at 375 °C and fourth at 600 °C. In addition, Pb2O3 {{can be obtained by}} decomposing PbO2 at 580-620 °C under an oxygen pressure of [...] Therefore, thermal decomposition of lead dioxide is a common industrial way of producing various <b>lead</b> <b>oxides.</b>|$|R
40|$|Mechanism of {{residual}} stresses generated in anodic oxidized film on lead alloy substrate was investigated using CrO 3 solution with {{the influence of}} electric field. The stresses formation process, their relationship with surface morphology and structure of oxidation film were discussed in details {{based on the results}} of SEM, XRD and Raman tests. It is indicated that Cr 2 O 7 2 - and HCrO 4 - ions are absorbed on lead alloy surface in the initial formation process of oxidation film. Then PbCrO 4 is formed on the interface of Cr 2 O 7 2 - and Pb. HCrO 4 - oxidizes Pb into PbO under electric field. At the same time, the stresses are generated gradually in the oxide film and increase quickly with current density increase. However, enhanced oxygen evolution promotes the formation of PbO or β-PbO 2 with the increase oxidation time. Meanwhile, the growth of crystalline grain for <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> is believed to be mismatched with the developing inner stresses, releasing inner stresses, which lead to residual stresses decreasing in oxidation film. The film is cracked because stresses gradient increases remarkably in oxidized film due to the crystal lattice difference in different <b>lead</b> <b>oxides...</b>|$|R
5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; <b>lead</b> and <b>lead</b> <b>oxides</b> react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|R
25|$|By 1795 {{the former}} Templar mills {{were being used}} for {{preparing}} lead. Sheets of lead were placed in clay pots and submerged in urine, then heated by decaying cow dung. The process converted the lead to <b>lead</b> <b>oxide,</b> {{and it was then}} finely ground to form a pigment for white, yellow and red lead paint. A new watermill was established on the marshes by Prince Rupert for an improved method of boring guns, however the secret died with him in 1682 and the enterprise collapsed.|$|E
25|$|These {{could be}} applied in three {{different}} ways. Lead could be added directly to a ceramic body {{in the form of}} a lead compound in suspension, either from galena (PbS), red lead (Pb3O4), white lead (2PbCO3·Pb(OH)2), or <b>lead</b> <b>oxide</b> (PbO). The second method involves mixing the lead compound with silica, which is then placed in suspension and applied directly. The third method involves fritting the lead compound with silica, powdering the mixture, and suspending and applying it. The method used on a particular vessel may be deduced by analysing the interaction layer between the glaze and the ceramic body microscopically.|$|E
25|$|Addition of lead(II) oxide lowers melting point, lowers {{viscosity}} of the melt, {{and increases}} refractive index. <b>Lead</b> <b>oxide</b> also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides {{and is used}} in colored glasses. The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glasses); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders. The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (108.5 vs 106.5Ω⋅cm, DC at 250°C). For more details, see lead glass.|$|E

50|$|The {{lead from}} the blast furnace, called lead bullion, then {{undergoes}} the drossing process. The bullion is agitated in kettles then cooled to 700-800 degrees.

25|$|The Hoa were {{notoriously}} enterprising entrepreneurs that traded {{and manufactured}} {{a myriad of}} good and services of value ranging from fine Chinese silk to black incense. The monopolized gold export trade was entirely in Chinese hands in addition to Chinese domination of local trade in paper, tea, pepper, arms, sulphur, lead, and <b>lead</b> <b>oxide.</b> The economic clout held by the Hoa coupled with repeated attempts by China to conquer and dominate Vietnam inflamed anti-Chinese hostility, bitterness, and resentment from the indigenous Vietnamese Kinh majority. Hostility against the ethnic Chinese minority resulted in violence, including the infamous 1782 massacre of some 2000 Hoa in Cholon, Saigon's Chinatown. By the time the French arrived in the mid-18th century, Hoa held a controlled and dominated the indigenous Vietnamese majority in trade, mining, and every urban market sector in addition to prospering under the colonial laissez faire market policies enshrined by the French colonialists. In addition, Hoa also served as intermediaries operating as agents for the French {{as well as their}} own. Hoa also collaborated with the French and other European capitalists in tapping the natural riches and exploiting the native Kinh Vietnamese via the laissez faire economic system to become wealthy. Under French rule, the collection of paddy in the Mekong delta was completely under Chinese hands who resold it to French companies for export. Industrial commodities imported from France by French companies in Vietnam were retailed to the rural population in the South by Hoa merchants, with some of them holding exclusive distribution rights. By the 1930s, gaps between the large-scale manufacturing, commercial, and financial enterprises held by the French were filled by smaller businesses controlled by the Chinese. Favorable economic policies attracted a rapid influx of Chinese immigrants seeking their financial destiny through business success until the mid-twentieth century. Between 1925 to 1933, some 600,000 Han Chinese immigrants settled in Vietnam. Hoa merchants delved into the rice, liquor, opium and spice trade, where they set up plantations in the rural hinterlands of the Mekong delta and sold its products in Cholon. In the north, the Hoa were mainly rice farmers, fishermen, and coal miners, except for those residing in cities and provincial towns. The French regularly worked with Chinese businessmen in the agriculture and heavy industry sectors, and the latter often served as middlemen to liaise between themselves and the French in the domestic trade.|$|E
