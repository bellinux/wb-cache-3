Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the <b>land</b> <b>distribution</b> in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} <b>land</b> <b>distribution</b> and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political class, social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E
5|$|In 1537, Francisco de Montejo was {{appointed}} governor. As {{soon as he}} arrived in Honduras, he cancelled the <b>land</b> <b>distribution</b> carried out by Alvarado. In that year, a great native uprising spread throughout Honduras, led by the Lenca ruler Lempira. Lempira held out for six months at his formidable stronghold at the Peñol de Cerquín ("Rock of Cerquín") before he was killed, during which time the uprising across Honduras threatened {{the existence of the}} Spanish colony. After Lempira's death, Montejo and his captain Alonso de Cáceres rapidly imposed Spanish dominion across most of Honduras; the main phase of the Spanish conquest was complete by 1539, although Olancho and the east were not brought within the Spanish Empire for some decades to come.|$|E

25|$|The Shona staged {{unsuccessful}} revolts (known as Chimurenga) against encroachment {{upon their}} lands, by clients of BSAC and Cecil Rhodes in 1896 and 1897.

25|$|The {{relatively}} simple system of <b>land</b> <b>distribution,</b> {{made possible by}} applying {{the expression of the}} East India Company, allowed the landowners to dispose with legal measurement units: each owner could guess the extent of his property by looking at nature.

25|$|The {{expansion}} and {{escalation of the}} armed conflict since the 1980s has greatly contributed to the consolidation of inequality in <b>land</b> <b>distribution,</b> through the illegal dispossession of land, forced displacement and re-concentration of ownership.

25|$|The {{main reason}} for wealth {{disparity}} is unequal <b>land</b> <b>distribution.</b> Pakistan {{is home to a}} large feudal landholding system where landholding families hold thousands of acres and do little work on the agriculture themselves.

50|$|Nomadic {{pastoralism}} declined as {{a result}} of several political and economic forces. Sedentarization was a means of imposing political control over various tribal groupings in the Arabian Peninsula. New legal structures such as the 1968 Public <b>Lands</b> <b>Distribution</b> Ordinance created novel land relations and spurred the dissolution of the Bedouin way of life. The establishment of an activist modern state provided incentives for large numbers of Saudi citizens to enter the regular, wage-based, or urban commercial employment. Moreover, modern technology and new transport networks undermined the primitive services that the Bedouin offered the rest of the economy.|$|R

25|$|The government's <b>land</b> <b>distribution</b> {{is perhaps}} the most crucial and most bitterly contested {{political}} issue surrounding Zimbabwe. It has been criticised for the violence and intimidation which marred several expropriations, as well as the parallel collapse of domestic banks which held billions of dollars worth of bonds on liquidated properties. The United Nations has identified several key shortcomings with the contemporary programme, namely failure to compensate ousted landowners as called for by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the poor handling of boundary disputes, and chronic shortages of material and personnel needed to carry out resettlement in an orderly manner.|$|E
25|$|Political {{repression}} and fraud, {{as well as}} huge income inequalities exacerbated by the <b>land</b> <b>distribution</b> system based on latifundios, in which large haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of underpaid peasants living in precarious conditions, led to the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), an armed conflict that drastically transformed Mexico's political, social, cultural, and economical structure {{during the twentieth century}} under a premise of social democracy. The war itself left a harsh toll on the economy and population, which decreased over the 11-year period between 1910 and 1921.

The duty ran from 75 cents on the $100 to $5 on the $100, if the legacy or share in question did not exceed $25,000. On those over that value, the rate was multiplied 11 times on estates up to $100,000, twofold on those from $100,000 to $200,000, 21 times on those from $500,000 to a $1 million, and threefold for those exceeding a million.

Such declines are likely to affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.’ In addition, the report noted that ‘highly-unequal <b>land</b> <b>distribution</b> has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity, while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so.|$|E
