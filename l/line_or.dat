5|$|In basketball, {{points are}} used {{to keep track of}} the score in a game. Points can be {{accumulated}} by making field goals (worth two points from within the three-point <b>line</b> <b>or</b> three points from beyond the three-point <b>line)</b> <b>or</b> free throws (worth one point). The team that records the most points at the end of a game is declared the game's winner. If the game is still tied at the end of regulation play, additional overtime period(s) are played in order to determine the winner.|$|E

25|$|In {{the real}} plane, a {{degenerate}} conic can be two <b>lines</b> that may <b>or</b> {{may not be}} parallel, a single line (either two coinciding <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> the union of a line and the line at infinity), a single point (in fact, two complex conjugate <b>lines),</b> <b>or</b> the null set (twice the <b>line</b> at infinity <b>or</b> two parallel complex conjugate lines).|$|R

The next point {{we have to consider}} is, how we may unite these <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> processions themselves, so as to make groups of them.|$|R
5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the <b>line,</b> <b>or</b> if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5|$|All races must {{be started}} by {{the report of the}} starter's gun or {{approved}} starting apparatus fired upwards after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position.

5|$|Amtrak, the {{national}} passenger rail system, provides service to Denver, operating its California Zephyr daily {{in both directions}} between Chicago and Emeryville, California, across the bay from San Francisco. Amtrak Thruway service operated by private bus companies links the Denver station with Rocky Mountain points. In 2017 a bill was introduced into the state legislature to connect towns and cities along the Front Range with an additional Amtrak <b>line</b> <b>or</b> state-funded alternative.|$|E

5|$|Despite often {{playing in}} the half forward <b>line</b> <b>or</b> midfield, Muldoon has {{consistently}} been a high scorer for Derry. He finished the 2001 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship with 2-10 (16) and the 2004 Championship with 3-24 (33). He finished the 2006 campaign with 1-07 (10) from two matches.

5|$|In a {{collaboration}} with Kliment Voroshilov, Molotov contributed both musically and lyrically to the 1944 {{version of the}} Soviet national anthem. Molotov asked the writers to include a <b>line</b> <b>or</b> two about peace. Molotov's and Voroshilov's role {{in the making of}} the new Soviet anthem was, in the words of historian Simon Sebag-Montefiore, acting as music judges for Stalin.|$|E

There were also alternate plans for the Nostrand Avenue Line to continue down Nostrand Avenue to Sheepshead Bay.|$|E

5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies in a straight <b>line</b> <b>or</b> chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E
5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard <b>line,</b> <b>or</b> accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius {{problem is}} to {{construct}} one or more circles tangent to three given objects in a plane, which may be circles, points, or lines. This gives rise to ten types of Apollonius' problem, one corresponding to each combination of circles, lines and points, which may be labeled with three letters, either C, L, or P, to denote whether the given elements are a circle, <b>line</b> <b>or</b> point, respectively (Table 1). As an example, the type of Apollonius problem with a given circle, line, and point is denoted as CLP.|$|E
