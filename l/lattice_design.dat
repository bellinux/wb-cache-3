The palace is built in four levels with elegant architectural features of both Muslim and Rajput architecture. Its layout is a symmetrical square built in the inner courtyard of the fort and has eight large domes. It has a plethora of rooms with arcaded openings, projecting platforms and windows with <b>lattice</b> <b>design</b> work. The roof above top floor of this Mahal is accessed through a steep stairway. It provides picture perfect views of the temples and the Betwa River outside the fort complex. The palace also houses a small archaeological museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the {{reactors}} for plutonium production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the <b>lattice</b> <b>design</b> had advantages over the homogeneous type, {{and so it was}} chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as well. For a neutron moderator, graphite was chosen {{on the basis of its}} availability compared with beryllium or heavy water.|$|E
500|$|Bull's Bridge is a single-lane {{vehicular}} wooden covered {{bridge across}} the Housatonic River {{in the town of}} Kent, Connecticut, close to the state border with New York. The first instance of a bridge at this location was constructed by Jacob and Isaac Bull in 1760, which gave the bridge its name. [...] Popular legend suggests that George Washington crossed the bridge with the Bulls' assistance while still under construction. The current bridge was built in 1842 from timber, with additional supports added in the 19th and 20th centuries. Built with a Town <b>lattice</b> <b>design,</b> the bridge has reinforced trusswork visible on the interior. At the time of its nomination to the National Register of Historic Places the roof had wood shingles. It is historically significant as one of three surviving covered bridges in Connecticut, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.|$|E

40|$|Two modes {{are being}} {{considered}} for a 50 on 50 -GeV muon collider: one being a high-luminosity ring with broad momentum acceptance (dp/p of {approximately} 0. 12 %, rms) and the other lower luminosity with narrow momentum acceptance (dp/p of {approximately} 0. 003 %, rms). To reach the design luminosities, the value of beta at collision in the two rings must be 4 cm and 14 cm, respectively. In addition, the bunch length must be held comparable {{to the value of}} the collision beta to avoid luminosity dilution due to the hour-glass effect. To assist the rf system in preventing the bunch from spreading in time, the constraint of isochronicity is also imposed on the lattice. Finally, the circumference must be kept as small as possible to minimize luminosity degradation due to muon decay. Two <b>lattice</b> <b>designs</b> will be presented which meet all of these conditions. Furthermore, the <b>lattice</b> <b>designs</b> have been successfully merged into one physical ring with mutual components; the only difference being a short chicane required to match dispersion and floor coordinates from one lattice into the other...|$|R
