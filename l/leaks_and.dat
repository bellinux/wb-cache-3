5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the <b>leaks</b> <b>and</b> two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the <b>leaks</b> <b>and</b> said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E

5|$|In the Cayman Islands, gusts to 51mph (82km/h) {{stirred up}} rough seas with 810ft (2.53m) waves, which caused some light erosion along {{southern}} and western shores. Rainfall {{over the region}} was heavy and widespread, although the greatest quantities fell over Grand Cayman; the Owen Roberts International Airport recorded 9.02in (229mm) over a two-day period. Overall damage to the islands was limited: The blustery rains flooded low-lying areas, caused roof <b>leaks,</b> <b>and</b> knocked out the power in eastern Grand Cayman.|$|E

5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant <b>leaks,</b> <b>and</b> excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E
5|$|Ra.One was {{initially}} scheduled to release on 3 June 2011, but delays {{due to a}} lengthy post-production process and escalating costs pushed back the release date. The film also faced controversies involving plagiarism, content <b>leaks</b> <b>and</b> copyright challenges. Consequently, Ra.One was theatrically released on 26 October 2011, {{the beginning of the}} five-day Diwali weekend, in 2D, 3D and dubbed versions, with three international premieres being held between October 24 & 26, 2011. The film witnessed the largest international theatrical release for an Indian film as of 2011, and was preceded by high audience and commercial expectations.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS is {{classified}} into two main types, cranial <b>leaks</b> <b>and</b> spinal leaks. The {{vast majority of}} leaks are spinal. Cranial leaks occur in the head. In some of these cases, CSF can be seen dripping out of the nose, or ear. Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both cranial and spinal spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the cranium. While referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low-volume CSF. For this reason SCSFLS {{is referred to as}} CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension.|$|E

5|$|Strong ground motions {{caused many}} {{secondary}} effects, including gas <b>leaks</b> <b>and</b> widespread soil liquefaction. Consequently, sand boils emerged from asphalt roads, toppling a few cars and sinking another. Several {{houses in the}} hill suburbs of Sumner and Redcliffs were affected by falling boulders from hillsides. Following its occurrence, much of Christchurch lost water pressure; residents were thus urged to conserve water use. In {{some parts of the}} Heathcote Valley, previously dormant or non-existent natural springs surfaced {{as a consequence of the}} sudden rise in the water table, flooding some properties.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid <b>leaks</b> <b>and</b> occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E
5|$|Curing the <b>leaks</b> <b>and</b> {{cleaning}} up the contamination delayed the tunnel's completion by a year, and it was finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was further complicated by conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing the leaks, but the report claimed that this was to a large extent a waste of money, resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary additional costs for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E

5|$|In December 2016, a {{week before}} the line's opening, the MTA hosted open houses at 96th Street and 86th Street. The {{entrance}} to the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station at Third Avenue, which was completed as part of Phase 1, opened on December 30. The ceremonial first train, with several prominent officials in attendance, ran on New Year's Eve, and trains began serving the line in regular passenger service at noon the next day. About 48,200 passengers entered the new stations on January 1, excluding passengers who toured the line by entering at a station {{in the rest of the}} system. During the opening week of operation, trains were running every six minutes during peak hours, and there was no service between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. The overnight shutdown allowed finishing touches to be placed to avoid <b>leaks</b> <b>and</b> other major issues like those found in the new 34th Street–Hudson Yards station, which had opened a year prior. Overnight service began on January 9, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} turned into {{floating}} AA batteries {{over the next}} several months although it availed them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July. On the 24th Ise was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded. The bombs started numerous <b>leaks</b> <b>and</b> Ise began to settle by the bow, although she was returned to an even keel after three days pumping. Hyūga was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses. She was badly damaged with some 200-odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack. She slowly foundered over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later. This time it was Ises turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list. The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war.|$|E
5|$|Underwood trails Dunbar in the polls, {{eventually}} {{losing the}} New Hampshire primary. Realizing {{that he needs}} Claire to win, he persuades {{her to come back}} by promising to support her run for a congressional district in Texas. However, he sandbags her prospective candidacy by endorsing a political ally's daughter, in order to keep Claire focused on his campaign. On the day of the South Carolina primary, Claire retaliates by arranging for two compromising photos to be leaked: one of Underwood's father with a Klansman, and one of Underwood posing with a Confederate Civil War re-enactor. Underwood deduces that Claire was behind the <b>leaks,</b> <b>and</b> confronts her. Claire calmly admits what she did, and puts forth a proposition: that she run as his vice president. He angrily rejects the idea.|$|E

40|$|This {{project was}} carried out as a study of pipe leak source {{location}} using single channel acoustic emissions (AE) technique. The objectives of this project are to study a reliable and affordable system capable of monitoring pipe <b>leak</b> <b>and</b> also to locate {{the source of the}} pipe leak using AE technique. A test rig consists of the pipe without <b>leak</b> <b>and</b> the pipe with leak was developed using circumferential of a galvanized steel pipe to run the experiments. The fluid used was water throughout the experiments. The flow of the water was controlled by a ball valve. The source of the AE signals was from the <b>leak</b> <b>and</b> it was captured using AE sensor with the help of Acoustic Emission Detector 2. 1. 3 software. For all pipe conditions, the values of hits, counts and RMS (average, maximum and minimum) were recorded and analyzed. All the values recorded were compared between the pipe without <b>leak</b> <b>and</b> the pipe with leak (full open valve and full close valve). The results were gained from 8 marked points each for all pipe conditions. The results showed that there was no AE activities on the pipe without leak while for the pipe with leak, the AE activities are greater for full close valve than full open valve. In addition, two equations for locating the source of the pipe leak were introduced from the RMS against distance graft. For the pipe with <b>leak</b> <b>and</b> full open valve, the equation is y = 0. 011 x + 0. 249. For the pipe with <b>leak</b> <b>and</b> full close valve, the equation is y = 0. 017 x + 0. 199...|$|R
