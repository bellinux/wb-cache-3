500|$|Spencer McIlvaine at Nintendo Life was {{disappointed}} {{in how the}} Wii version only had a single use for motion controls, and how <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> from handheld versions of the game were used. Dan Whitehead at Eurogamer similarly thought that the motion controls were only a minor addition, and {{was disappointed}} in how little effort Capcom had put into the port compared to LucasArts' remake of The Secret of Monkey Island. Craig Harris at IGN called it [...] "incredibly lazy", wishing that it had included improved art and sharper text. Cara Ellison at Eurogamer called the Trilogy HD port [...] "perfunctory", saying that animations are slow at times, that the high-definition graphics {{take away from the}} charm of the pixel art in previous versions, {{and that there is a}} delay after button presses.|$|E
5000|$|Functions PDL (...) to {{read the}} analog controllers, and SCRN (...) {{to read the}} <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> screen (both {{accessing}} system ROM routines) ...|$|E
50|$|I'm O.K is a side-scrolling {{game with}} 16-bit era <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> that shares (to a degree) the basic {{gameplay}} (and somewhat lowbrow humor) of the Metal Slug series.|$|E
5000|$|The TRS-80 home {{computer}} additions included 64 semigraphics characters (0x80 through 0xAF) that implemented <b>low-resolution</b> block <b>graphics.</b> (Each block-graphic character displayed as a 2x3 grid of pixels, with each block pixel effectively controlled {{by one of}} the lower 6 bits.) ...|$|R
50|$|The remastered version {{adds the}} option to play a remote two-player game through Steam. There is also a global high score list, and two {{optional}} graphics effects: a softening filter to alleviate the <b>low-resolution</b> pixelated <b>graphics</b> and a bloom effect on selected parts of the game graphics.|$|R
5000|$|Tiny BASIC, {{a version}} of BASIC offered by Tom Pittman, {{could be used to}} write small BASIC {{programs}} on the Elf that could display through the Pixie <b>low-resolution</b> monochrome <b>graphics</b> display or TV-Typewriter hardware. Pittman also wrote a small booklet about the 1802 titled [...] "A Short Course In Programming", which he has allowed to be published and made available online free of charge.|$|R
5000|$|The Sinclair ZX80 and ZX81 {{relied on}} block {{graphics}} characters for a <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> of 64×48 pixels black-and-white or 32×48 in black, white, and dithered gray {{as seen in}} the ZX80 character set and ZX81 character set.|$|E
5000|$|Observe Dock Yards: Another <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> display appears, {{depicting}} oil tankers {{arriving at}} the docks. The queue length at each dock is {{an indicator of the}} oil supply at the current purchase price and the time it takes for each dock to service each tanker.|$|E
5000|$|Kango Shicyauzo was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reception. The first game localized by G-Collections, and arguably its best-selling title, Japan based distributor JList called it a [...] "landmark for English bishoujo games." [...] Less than acclaimed aspects of the game generally included a lack of plot, <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> and predictable endings.|$|E
5000|$|The PC {{version of}} the game {{garnered}} harsher scores, with GameSpot giving the version a lower 4.7 out of 10 'Poor' rating, giving praise to the same areas as the PlayStation version, but cited issues with the multiplayer portion of the game, noting that [...] "Our Righteous 3D machine chugged along at an unplayable pace, even with <b>low-resolution,</b> flat-shaded <b>graphics</b> enabled. The Obsidian system ran just as slowly, which made the two-player session boring, frustrating, and as far from fun as possible.".|$|R
25|$|Different graphic {{styles are}} used throughout. The game is usually {{displayed}} in a top-down perspective, showing representations of the different locations while the player {{is represented by the}} # symbol. Several segments of the game make use of all-text screens with limited ASCII animation, while other segments use either the Apple II's <b>low-resolution</b> or high-resolution <b>graphics</b> modes.|$|R
5000|$|Vector art {{is ideal}} for {{printing}} since the art is made {{from a series of}} mathematical curves, it will print very crisply even when resized. For instance, one can print a vector logo on a small sheet of copy paper, and then enlarge the same vector logo to billboard size and keep the same crisp quality. A <b>low-resolution</b> raster <b>graphic</b> would blur or pixelate excessively if it were enlarged from business card size to billboard size. (The precise resolution of a raster graphic necessary for high-quality results depends on the viewing distance; e.g., a billboard may still appear to be of high quality even at low resolution if the viewing distance is great enough.) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{review in}} Computer Gaming World {{described}} {{the game as}} exceedingly frustrating, from the task of climbing stairs to identifying objects from their <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics.</b> The hint guide was highly recommended {{as a way to}} alleviate some of that frustration. The reviewer suggested gamers new to the series play King's Quest I instead, it being much easier.|$|E
50|$|Rescue is a <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> action game {{in which}} the player uses game paddles move his {{spaceship}} to intercept with a damaged ship randomly floating around the screen. The program was offered in both disk and cassette stand-alone versions, {{as well as in}} a compendium, along with War, called Rescue/War, but was dropped from Edu-Ware's catalog by 1980.|$|E
50|$|The Apple II {{started out}} using a simple BASIC interpreter, known {{originally}} as Apple BASIC {{and later as}} Integer BASIC. It can only handle integer numbers ranging from −32,768 to +32,767 (16-bit binary values) and only has built-in support for <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics.</b> But {{it was the first}} version of BASIC available for the Apple II and is what the earliest BASIC programs use.|$|E
50|$|There are 11 block {{graphics}} characters, counting code point 0 which also doubles as space. Together with the 11 inverse video versions these 22 code points provide every {{combination of the}} character cell divided into 2×2 black-and-white block pixels for <b>low-resolution</b> 64×48 pixel <b>graphics,</b> or into 1×2 black, white or dithered gray wide block pixels for a 32×48 resolution. The 2×2 versions of these are also present in the Block Elements Unicode block.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{flow cytometry}} has been {{revolutionized}} via {{the introduction of}} digital data acquisition and analysis tools that facilitate simultaneous investigation of ten or more parameters. At the same time, some data presentation tools offered by commercial suppliers have remained surprisingly “antiquated”. This leads to the ironic fact that high-quality data is often represented by poor-quality illustrations: namely pixelated plots. In particular, data obtained using FACSDiva software is frequently exported into figures as <b>low-resolution</b> pixel <b>graphics</b> resulting in low-quality images. Additionally, even the newest version, Diva_ 6. 1. 2, is still unable to generate histogram overlays, a popular and convincing tool for direct data comparison. We hereby present an easy and down-to-earth Diva-Figure-improvement toolbox (Diva-Fit), which facilitates the generation of high-resolution graphs based on data acquired with FACSDiva software. Moreover, Diva-Fit allows the easy removal of unwanted quadrant labels without impairing the quality of FACS plots. Finally, we show that Diva-Fit supports straightforward composition of histogram overlays. All software tools necessary are freely available. We believe that the proposed toolbox may be very useful for many researchers working with flow cytometry...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{to adapt}} and extend graphic arts {{printing}} techniques for demanding device applications in electronics, biotechnology and microelectromechanical systems have grown rapidly in recent years. Here, we describe the use of electrohydrodynamically induced fluid flows through fine microcapillary nozzles for jet printing of patterns and functional devices with submicrometre resolution. Key aspects of the physics of this approach, which has some features in common with related but comparatively <b>low-resolution</b> techniques for <b>graphic</b> arts, are revealed through direct high-speed imaging of the droplet formation processes. Printing of complex patterns of inks, ranging from insulating and conducting polymers, to solution suspensions of silicon nanoparticles and rods, to single-walled carbon nanotubes, using integrated computer-controlled printer systems illustrates some of the capabilities. High-resolution printed metal interconnects, electrodes and probing pads for representative circuit patterns and functional transistors with critical dimensions as small as 1 mu m demonstrate potential applications in printed electronics. close 38036...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the slow}} modem speeds common in 1988, early {{versions}} of Earthweek {{were limited to}} <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics.</b> Subscribing newspapers maintained a library of individual icons and the base map, which were used by the [...] "wire frame" [...] of the Pagemaker document distributed to them each week. Earthweek is now created in QuarkXPress with Adobe Illustrator graphics, and is delivered as a complete, integrated package.|$|E
50|$|The coarse, <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> {{display mode}} worked differently, {{as it could}} output a pattern of dots per pixel to offer more color options. These {{patterns}} were stored in the character generator ROM and replaced the text character bit patterns when the computer was switched to low-res graphics mode. The text mode and low-res graphics mode used the same memory region and the same circuitry was used for both.|$|E
5000|$|Observe Service Stations: A <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> display appears, showing six service stations, two {{of which}} are under the player's control, while the other four are {{operated}} by computer-controlled competitors. Small colored blocks entering the queue at each station represent thousands of cars. The queue length at each station is an indicator of the gasoline demand at the current selling price and the time it takes for each station to service cars.|$|E
50|$|CD+G (also {{known as}} CD-G, CD+Graphics and TV-Graphics) is an {{extension}} of the compact disc standard that can present <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> alongside the audio data on the disc when played on a compatible device. CD+G discs are often used for karaoke machines, which use this functionality to present on-screen lyrics for the song contained on the disc. The CD+G specifications were published by Philips and Sony in an updated revision of the Red Book specifications.|$|E
50|$|In addition, its <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> {{commands}} {{have different}} names from their Integer BASIC/Applesoft II counterparts. All command names {{are of the}} form PLTx such that GR, COLOR=, PLOT, HLIN and VLIN are called PLTG, PLTC, PLTP, PLTH, and PLTV, respectively. The command for returning to text mode, known as TEXT in other versions, is simply TEX, and carries the proviso {{that it has to}} be the last statement in a program line.|$|E
50|$|Tracks {{contain the}} {{information}} to be stored on the disc. A track is a consecutive set of sectors on the disc containing a block of data. One session may contain one or more tracks of the same or different types. Tracks can be audio information or data, which use the same format, or video information. Data can include album information and <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> such as karaoke lyrics; however, these tracks are not compliant with the Red Book of CD audio standards.|$|E
5000|$|Quickly {{changing}} the color attributes on the ZX Spectrum each line, {{to overcome the}} 2-color limit every 8x8 pixel cell is often called [...] "Multicolor", probably from the C-64-specific term describing the 160x200 mode with 4 colors at least. Technically it's closer related with the C-64 FLI technique. [...] "Multicolor" [...] is also used for software-driven <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> modes like 64x96/64x48 in almost 15 colors for very colorful but less blocky effects in contrast to 8x8 pixel blocks. However, these modes are so critical with timing, that they often don't work different Spectrum models and are usually only work on one specific model. (Spectrum 48/128, 128+2, Pentagon...) ...|$|E
5000|$|Video Terminal Interface (VTI) which {{produced}} a 16-line display of 64 characters per line. The VTI {{was intended to}} drive a television using an RF modulator, or to be connected directly to a TV monitor's composite video input (not commonly available in the 1970s). The VTI also displayed <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> (today called text semigraphics). Each character position was divided into a grid 2 dots wide and 3 high, giving a graphics resolution of 128 horizontal and 48 vertical pixels, {{the same as the}} original TRS-80. A TTL-level, parallel keyboard interface was also included on the VTI. Several keyboards were available, including the Keyboard III which included a numeric keypad.|$|E
50|$|The Apple II display {{provided}} two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When {{the color}} burst reference signal was turned {{on and the}} computer attached to a color display, it could display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Later, blue and orange became available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width {{in relation to the}} colorburst signal. The high-resolution display offered more colors simply by compressing more, narrower pixels into each subcarrier cycle. The coarse, <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> display mode worked differently, as it could output a short burst of high-frequency signal per pixel to offer more color options.|$|E
50|$|Each cog {{has access}} to some {{dedicated}} counter-timer hardware, and a special timing signal generator intended to simplify the design of video output stages, such as composite PAL or NTSC displays (including modulation for broadcast) and Video Graphics Array (VGA) monitors. Parallax thus makes sample code available which can generate video signals (text and somewhat <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics)</b> using a minimum parts count consisting of the Propeller, a crystal oscillator, and a few resistors to form a crude digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The frequency of the oscillator is important, as the correction ability of the video timing hardware {{is limited to the}} clock rate. It is possible to use multiple cogs in parallel to generate a single video signal. More generally, the timing hardware can be used to implement various pulse-width modulation (PWM) timing signals.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike in Integer BASIC, Applesoft BASIC {{variable}} {{names are}} significant only to two letters; {{they can be}} made longer, but only the first two letters are used. For instance, [...] "LOW" [...] and [...] "LOSS" [...] are treated as the same variable, and attempting to assign a value to [...] "LOSS" [...] overwrites any value assigned to [...] "LOW". Furthermore, because the language used tokenization, a programmer has to avoid using any consecutive letters that are also Applesoft commands or operations (one cannot use the name [...] "SCORE" [...] for a variable because it interprets the OR as a Boolean operator, thus rendering it SC OR E, nor can one use [...] "BACKGROUND" [...] because the command [...] "GR" [...] invokes the <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> mode, in this case creating a syntax error).|$|E
5000|$|Within {{the topic}} of the art game, further subdivisions have been proposed. In her 2003 paper, Holmes {{identified}} two common art game types as the [...] "feminist art game" [...] (an art game that generates thinking about gender and typecasting), and the [...] "retro-styled art game" [...] (an art game that juxtaposes <b>low-resolution</b> <b>graphics</b> with academic or theoretical content, and that creatively subverts the format of an arcade classic to support a conceptual creative agenda). In 2005, art theorist Pippa Tshabalala née Stalker broadly defined the art game as [...] "a video game, normally PC as opposed to console based, that generally but not exclusively explores social or political issues through the medium of video games." [...] She proposed two different categorical schemes to further subdivide the genre by theme and by type. Subdividing by theme, Stalker defined [...] "aesthetic art games" [...] to include [...] "games that deal with using the game medium to express an artistic purpose," [...] and she defined [...] "political" [...] or [...] "agenda-based art games" [...] as art games that [...] "have some sort of ulterior motive other than aesthetics" [...] and whose basis is in [...] "using the medium of the computer games to bring an issue to the public's, or at least the art world's, attention in order to attract support and understanding for a cause." [...] Subdividing by type, Stalker identified the [...] "art mod", the [...] "physical manifestation art game" [...] (the player is involved physically in the game, often experiencing physical consequences, such as pain, for their actions), [...] "machinima", and [...] "3D real-time art game" [...] (an art game that displays all the characteristics of a complete level-based commercial game, both on the programming and commercial side). The identification of art mods and machinima as forms of the art game conflicts with Cannon's definition of the art mod that highlights the non-interactive and non-competitive nature of these forms of media.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 288 - 290) There are {{few resources}} available to teachers who have limited training and understanding of computers but who are required, by recent changes in their school districts' curriculum, to teach units of computer study. This project is intended as a primer for grade six teachers {{to assist in the}} planning and presentation of three units of computer study. This project includes the following units: (1) Word Processing; (2) BASIC Programming; and (3) <b>Low-Resolution</b> <b>Graphics.</b> Each of these units is divided into weekly lessons that require as little as thirty minutes of teacher presentation time each week. The students' weekly activities are designed to be completed in the classroom computer learning center. The weekly lessons include: (1) an overview, new vocabulary and lesson objectives; (2) teacher preparation suggestions; (3) lesson presentation ideas; (4) evaluation guide, grading, displaying and rewarding students' work; and (5) daily student activities, work sheets and journal pages. Special attention is given to provide directions in language teachers and students can easily understand. As teachers proceed through the three units, they will find examples and demonstrations of basic programming techniques. The goal of each unit is to enable teachers as well as students to become more confident computer users. The scope of this project includes: (1) review of literature relevant {{to the use of the}} computer as an educational tool; (2) description of the process used to develop the three units; (3) expanded lesson plans; (4) description of the use and content of the units; and (5) references and resources for teachers and students who would like to enlarge their knowledge of this interesting field...|$|E
