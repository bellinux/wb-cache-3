500|$|The {{basic concept}} behind [...] "Rush" [...] {{had been coming}} {{together}} since the sixth season. According to series creator Chris Carter, {{the way in which}} to portray the teenagers on screen was [...] "tricky". He noted, [...] "it had been a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> had dealt with teenage angst. [...] it was being done everywhere else and we wanted to take a run at it." [...] David Amman, who wrote the episode, later explained that the original idea for the episode was simply [...] " [...] effect having the power of super speed would have on troubled teens." [...] However, the story quickly developed [...] "deeper" [...] meanings: drug abuse, boredom, and the teenage experience.|$|E
500|$|The band took a {{break from}} {{performing}} live between the NetAid charity concert in October 1999 and 2001. They returned to {{the stage for a}} further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison's campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that [...] "It's a cause I think's really important and it just seemed to be the right time for us to come back – it's a long, <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> played live. It should be really great. We're really looking forward to what they (the new songs) are going to sound like live. It'll be good {{to get back on the}} old live circuit again." [...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to NME that [...] "I think it's stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It's a bit less stupid. [...] was all over the shop stylistically, I think it's a bit more focused. And I think it's a bit more impassioned".|$|E
2500|$|He had {{previously}} received support from The Vanuatu Independent in 2008, upon first announcing his entrance {{into a political}} career. The newspaper, describing him as a [...] "young visionary and idealist", had written of him: [...] "It is a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> have had a charismatic leader emerge from the crowd.

60|$|While I {{was looking}} over the things in my trunk, I came across the box of dominoes that Corny had given us to {{remember}} her by. It seemed like a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago <b>since</b> <b>we</b> had been sitting together on the water-battery at St. Augustine! In a few minutes I took the box of dominoes {{in my hand and}} went over to Colbert. As I put them on the table he looked up.|$|R
6000|$|But not {{at present}} salaries! No; {{if we are}} to {{maintain}} present salaries, let us make no more ambassadors; and let us unmake those we have already made. The great position, without the means of respectably maintaining it--there could be no wisdom in that. A foreign representative, to be valuable to his country, must be on good terms with the officials of the capital and {{with the rest of the}} influential folk. He must mingle with this society; he cannot sit at home--it is not business, it butters no commercial parsnips. He must attend the dinners, banquets, suppers, balls, receptions, and must return these hospitalities. He should return as good as he gets, too, for the sake of the dignity of his country, and for the sake of Business. Have we ever had a minister or an ambassador who could do this on his salary? No--not once, from Franklin's time to ours. Other countries understand the commercial value of properly lining the pockets of their representatives; but apparently our Government has not learned it. England is the most successful trader of the several trading nations; and she takes good care of the watchmen who keep guard in her commercial towers. It has been a <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> now, <b>since</b> <b>we</b> needed to blush for our representatives abroad. It has become custom to send our fittest. We send men of distinction, cultivation, character--our ablest, our choicest, our best. Then we cripple their efficiency through the meagreness of their pay. Here is a list of salaries for English and American ministers and ambassadors: ...|$|R
2500|$|Due {{to label}} conflicts, The Veronicas {{embarked}} on a process of making many changes to the album. The release date was postponed, and the content and theme of the album was changed. [...] The girls also explained that [...] "Lolita" [...] was not an official single promoting the new album [...] "It was just a single release for our Australian fans, as it's been such a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> have had anything new over there".|$|E

40|$|The Kite Aerial Photography - Hué project {{started with}} the {{intention}} from Mattias Ericsson and me Micael Norberg to work artistically on a jointly project with students from di erent art schools and from di erent cultures. We had an idea of building bridges both artistically and culturally. We traveled to Hué in Vietnam in order to explore new ways to collaborate and  nd new artistic meth- ods. We wanted to use kites and send our cameras {{up in the air}} to make aerial pictures. We tried to  nd a way to control events and by that also control our artistic outcome and understanding. But in the The Kite Aerial Photography project we had no control. The weather controlled our kites. The place and the language controlled what we knew and understood. What was left was to look into ourself and negate a compromise. The leftovers became documentations of an experience. And now I am looking back at those events, wondering what really happened. I am using words, trying to create an image of my memories and of my experience - hot air, smells and noise. Experi- ences I can’t communicate fully in words. You as a viewer will never feel them and I will only remember them. We will also remember di erently. Every participant have their own image ofwhat happened during those days in Hué. The feeling of being di erent, not understanding and being an outsider made us all meet ourselves in di erent ways. We believed that language would build bridges of understanding, and maybe it did. But here we are now. A <b>long</b> <b>time</b> has passed <b>since</b> <b>we</b> returned from Hué. What we have left are images and memories. I remember smells and emotions and in this state between memory and fact a tension is created. A juxtaposition of con ict- ing feelings. I look at the photographs now with a new understanding. We tried to move out of our comfort-zone looking for the unseen, the enigma, where memory and re ection becomes a liminal state. I now realize that knowledge is not fact or truth, but a state that we can call ”not knowing”. A state which for me is the very basic for understanding, and by that becoming the very essence of art...|$|R
