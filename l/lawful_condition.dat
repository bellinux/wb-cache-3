2500|$|Myrtle {{was thought}} a {{particularly}} potent aphrodisiac. The female pudendum, particularly the clitoris, {{was known as}} murtos (myrtle). As goddess of love and sex, Venus played an essential role at Roman prenuptial rites and wedding nights, so myrtle and roses were used in bridal bouquets. Marriage itself was not a seduction but a <b>lawful</b> <b>condition,</b> under Juno's authority; so myrtle was excluded from the bridal crown. Venus was also a patron of the ordinary, everyday wine drunk by most Roman men and women; the seductive powers of wine were well known. In the rites to Bona Dea, a goddess of female chastity, Venus, myrtle and anything male were not only excluded, but unmentionable. The rites allowed women to drink the strongest, sacrificial wine, otherwise reserved for the Roman gods and Roman men; the women euphemistically {{referred to it as}} [...] "honey". Under these special circumstances, they could get virtuously, religiously drunk on strong wine, safe from Venus' temptations. Outside of this context, ordinary wine (that is, Venus' wine) tinctured with myrtle oil was thought particularly suitable for women.|$|E

Contrary to opinions in popular culture, {{and perhaps even}} among Customs officials, powers to search, seize, and interrogate at United States border crossings are not unlimited.

40|$|Accreditation is {{a central}} element of the {{framework}} for research access to micro-data that currently is understood to be a barrier for transnational access. To better understand the nature and causes of the problem, and to devise potential solutions, we have mapped current arrangements across European countries. We identify similarities and differences as well as areas for improvement. Our key results are encouraging: almost all European countries do provide research access to their micro-data, {{and most of them}} allow non-national European researchers to access their data, though under varying conditions. However, some obstacles remain, and some of them require negotiation and coordination at policy-making levels. To overcome existing barriers, we propose some potential options for the future and concrete steps towards improvement, which if explored from now on, could substantially improve access while still ensuring safe and <b>lawful</b> <b>conditions,</b> and reducing the administrative financial burden of data providers...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} years, the mining sector {{has seen a}} greater {{involvement}} of the producing States {{to develop their own}} resources as well as an opening to domestic and foreign investors as part of a privatization policy. At the same time, the States sought to clarify the legislative and <b>lawful</b> <b>conditions</b> mainly regarding the questions of safety and environment. These major evolutions were particularly sensitive in the mineral producing countries and strongly increased the requests of training. Based on the idea that cooperation and training have a special position in its relations with mineral producing countries, France created in 1975 the Center for Advanced Studies of Mineral Resources (CESMAT) to coordinate the actions of training of foreign upper management personnel and to constitute a relation network. Created initially to encourage exchanges among the various sectors of technical mining expertise, CESMAT has constantly kept abreast of international developments and of new problems encountered by the mining industry such as market economies, environment and role of the State. With seven training programs of one year duration and thirty years of experience in providing innovative training based on exchange of experiences between professionals, a network of almost thousand eight hundred former trainees from hundred odd countries was created. Regarding Saudi Arabia, more than thirty geologists and mining engineers, coming from DMMR, SGS and MAADEN, have attained one of the CESMAT trainings. MINES ParisTech (Paris School of Mines), being very active in the CESMAT program, continues to lead its three specialized trainings covering the areas of Technical and Economic Analysis of Mining Operations (CESECO), Geostatistics (CFSG) and Public Administration of Mines (CESAM). It proposes also a catalog of short trainings. At the end of the long session trainings, successful participants are awarded a " Mastère spécialisé® " diploma and/or a national French postgraduate diploma of specialized training of MINES ParisTech...|$|R
50|$|Safe {{speed is}} {{the maximum speed}} {{permitted}} by the basic speed law and negligence doctrine. Safe speed {{is not the same}} as the 85 percentile operating speed used by traffic engineers in establishing speed zones. Fog, snow, or ice can create conditions where most people drive too fast, and chain reaction accidents in such conditions are examples of where large groups of drivers collided because they failed to reduce speed for the conditions. The speeds at which most people drive can only be a very rough guide to safe speed, and an illegal or negligent custom or practice is not in itself excusable. Safe speed approximates the inferred design speed adjusted for environmental alterations and vehicle and person specific factors when VACDAs is the limiting factor. The Solomon curve concept can create an approach-avoidance conflict within the driver who wishes neither to drive faster than is <b>lawful</b> and the <b>conditions</b> allow nor have an unsafe speed discrepancy between other vehicles on the road; it is never legal to go faster than the speed limit, and unilaterally reducing the risk of the latter can lead to a mass crash caused by the former.|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the problems of functioning of hidden economy in Poland. It presents and systematizes the causes of development of hidden economy and evaluates its role and significance. The causes of its development originate from the essence of management and planning in socialist economy {{as well as from the}} current economic policy. The evaluation of hidden economy is difficult because one has to take into account the fact that often the instruments applied by the State towards economic units encourage or even force them to undertake activity within the sphere of hidden economy. One should also distinguish between the activity which is evidently illegal and undertaken on a mass scale and the side-line activity having the character of help rendered to neighbours or sale of one's own produce. The grey- -sector economic activity undoubtedly lowers the income of the State (tax evasions) and leads to severing official economic ties between the market subjects. It also lowers the productivity of economic subjects in the official sector and encourages their negative innovativeness consisting mostly in looking for ways to get around the law. Despite these negative consequences, hidden economy brings also economic advantages. It fills up gaps in supply provided by official sectors, it diminishes the inflation gap, it gives rise to the foundation of new, well equipped market segments and complements the administrative distribution of goods and raw materials. The consequence of its existence is also the growth in income and level of consumption of people participating in the grey sector. The processes of differentiation of levels of consumption increase. One may conclude that the income from official economy serve to satisfy basic needs, whereas the improvement in level of consumption and the growth in real income of the population is connected with the activity in the grey economy sector. Neutralizing the negative consequences of grey economy with respect to private sector should consist among others in introducing order to the economic law, in limiting the authorities' competences to enforce new laws and in guaranting the stability of principles of private sector operation. As to socialized sectors, the scope of administrative regulation of economic processes should be limited and the financial system of enterprises should be adjusted to the requirements of self- -financing and economic self-dependence. The above steps may, in the long run, result in the integration of many forms of hidden economy with its <b>lawful</b> counterpart. In <b>conditions</b> of radical changes in the economic system, i. e. in view of socialization and privatization of the economy, the significance of hidden economy should also be subject to changes. Some of its forms should disappear or decrease, while others (i. e. tax frauds) may develop rapidly. However, in conditions of the liberalization of economic legislation and the legalization of most of the forms of hidden economy, the continued activity in the grey sector should be subject to financial restrictions...|$|R
