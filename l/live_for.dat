5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} short life expectancy; some species <b>live</b> <b>for</b> as little as six months. The giant Pacific octopus, {{one of the two}} largest species of octopus, may <b>live</b> <b>for</b> as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can <b>live</b> <b>for</b> only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its {{primary goal is}} to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can <b>live</b> <b>for</b> {{up to a year}} and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can <b>live</b> <b>for</b> several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E
