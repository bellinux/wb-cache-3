Few traditional educators promote social networking unless they are communicating with their own colleagues.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the use of}} the Internet {{resulted}} in stylistics that are not deemed appropriate in academic and formal language use, it is to be noted that Internet use may not hinder language education but instead aid it. The Internet has proven in different ways that it can provide potential benefits in enhancing <b>language</b> <b>learning,</b> especially in second or foreign <b>language</b> <b>learning.</b> Language education through the Internet in relation to Internet linguisitics is, most significantly, applied through the communication aspect (use of e-mails, discussion forums, chat messengers, blogs, etc.).|$|E

25|$|The {{direct method}} {{operates}} {{on the idea}} that second <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> must be an imitation of first <b>language</b> <b>learning,</b> as this is the natural way humans learn any language: a child never relies on another language to learn its first language, and thus the mother tongue is not necessary to learn a foreign language. This method places great stress on correct pronunciation and the target language from outset. It advocates teaching of oral skills at the expense of every traditional aim of language teaching. Such methods rely on directly representing an experience into a linguistic construct rather than relying on abstractions like mimicry, translation and memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary.|$|E
