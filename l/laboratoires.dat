25|$|The saline breast implantfilled with saline {{solution}} (biological-concentration {{salt water}} 0.90% w/v of NaCl, ca. 300 mOsm/L.)was first manufactured by the <b>Laboratoires</b> Arion company, in France, and was introduced {{for use as}} a prosthetic medical device in 1964. The contemporary models of saline breast implant are manufactured with thicker, room-temperature vulcanized (RTV) shells made of a silicone elastomer. The study In vitro Deflation of Pre-filled Saline Breast Implants (2006) reported that the rates of deflation (filler leakage) of the pre-filled saline breast implant made it a second-choice prosthesis for corrective breast surgery. Nonetheless, in the 1990s, the saline breast implant was the prosthesis usual for breast augmentation surgery, because of the U.S. FDA's restriction against the importation of silicone-filled breast implants.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-twentieth century, Morton I. Berson, in 1945, and Jacques Maliniac, in 1950, each {{performed}} flap-based breast augmentations {{by rotating}} the patient’s chest wall tissue into the breast {{to increase its}} volume. Furthermore, throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, plastic surgeons used synthetic fillers—including silicone injections received by some 50,000 women, from which developed silicone granulomas and breast hardening that required treatment by mastectomy. In 1961, the American plastic surgeons Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, and the Dow Corning Corporation, developed the first silicone breast prosthesis, filled with silicone gel; in due course, the first augmentation mammoplasty was performed in 1962 using the Cronin–Gerow Implant, prosthesis model 1963. In 1964, the French company <b>Laboratoires</b> Arion developed and manufactured the saline breast implant, filled with saline solution, and then introduced {{for use as a}} medical device in 1964.|$|E

2500|$|In 1933, the French {{pharmaceutical}} company <b>Laboratoires</b> Rhône-Poulenc began {{to search for}} new anti-histamines. [...] In 1947, it synthesized promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative, which {{was found to have}} more pronounced sedative and antihistaminic effects than earlier drugs. A year later, the French surgeon Pierre Huguenard used promethazine together with pethidine as part of a cocktail to induce relaxation and indifference in surgical patients. Another surgeon, Henri Laborit, believed the compound stabilized the central nervous system by causing [...] "artificial hibernation", and described this state as [...] "sedation without narcosis". He suggested to Rhône-Poulenc that they develop a compound with better stabilizing properties. In December 1950, the chemist Paul Charpentier produced a series of compounds that included RP4560 or chlorpromazine. Simone Courvoisier conducted behavioural tests and found chlorpromazine produced indifference to aversive stimuli in rats. Chlorpromazine was distributed for testing to physicians between April and August 1951. Laborit trialled the medicine on at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris, using it as an anaesthetic booster in intravenous doses of 50 to 100mg on surgery patients and confirming it as the best drug to date in calming and reducing shock, with patients reporting improved well being afterwards. He also noted its hypothermic effect and suggested it may induce artificial hibernation. Laborit thought this would allow the body to better tolerate major surgery by reducing shock, a novel idea at the time. Known colloquially as [...] "Laborit's drug", chlorpromazine was released onto the market in 1953 by Rhône-Poulenc and given the trade name Largactil, derived from large [...] "broad" [...] and acti* [...] "activity.|$|E
