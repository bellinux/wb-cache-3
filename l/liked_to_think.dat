5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{took great}} pride in being a Mitchell, his late father had a local {{reputation}} as a boxer. He always strived {{to live up to}} the family name and enjoyed the reputation he inherited and maintained. While Grant <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of himself as indestructible, he at many times showed emotional vulnerability and a need to be mothered. Indeed, at times he was just as likely to burst into tears as he was to throw a punch. Because of this, he attracted many women, despite the fact that he often treated them as possessions, disregarding their feelings and eliciting exaggerated revenge should they cross him (resulting in spousal abuse and the destruction of all three of his marriages). His quick temper was off-set by a period of genuine remorse and promises that he would change. However, more often than not, Grant reverted to form and when placed under pressure he seemed incapable of controlling his aggression, disregarding all consequences.|$|E

Nonetheless, later in his career, [...] "he was a writer who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that his genius had been stifled by Hollywood and by its dreadful habit of giving him so much money".|$|E

When he was ten, his older sister Olga found him lying on his back looking at the clouds and asked him what he was doing. [...] "I like to think and wonder," [...] Alexei replied. Olga asked him what he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about. [...] "Oh, so many things," [...] the boy responded. [...] "I enjoy the sun and the beauty of summer as long as I can.

2500|$|As {{a former}} kingdom, Sussex {{had a strong}} {{identity}} from this period, which was enhanced by its framework of a long coastline, the South Downs and the wooded Weald to its north. [...] Until at least the 18th century, the poor roads of the Weald tended to isolate Sussex, making the county largely self-supporting. [...] Even into Victorian period, devotees of the county <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{they were living in}} a land older than England. [...] Culturally, Sussex historically looked in a southerly direction to the sea, rather than northwards to London. [...] This can be deduced from a variety of sources, but perhaps the most striking are the earlier estate maps from the 17th and 18th centuries. [...] Almost all of them place south {{at the top of the}} map, opposite to the standard [...] convention of north-up. [...] The presence of the sea and a long coastline has affected Sussex's relationship with London, making London of considerably less significance to Sussex than it is to Kent or Surrey.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1897 and 1898, Skagway was a lawless town, {{described}} by {{one member of}} the North-West Mounted Police as [...] "little better than a hell on earth." [...] Fights, prostitutes and liquor were ever-present on Skagway's streets, and con man [...] "Soapy" [...] Smith, who had risen to considerable power, did little to stop it. Smith was a sophisticated swindler who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of himself as a kind and generous benefactor to the needy. He was gracious to some, giving money to widows and halting lynchings, while simultaneously operating a ring of thieves who swindled prospectors with cards, dice, and the shell game. His telegraph office charged five dollars to send a message anywhere in the world. Consequently, unknowing prospectors sent news to their families back home without realizing there was no telegraph service to or from Skagway until 1901. Smith also controlled a comprehensive spy network, a private militia called the Skaguay Military Company, the town newspaper, the Deputy U.S. Marshal's office and an array of thieves and con-men who roamed about the town. Smith was shot and killed by Frank Reid and Jesse Murphy on July 8, 1898, in the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf. Smith managed to return fire— some accounts claim the two men fired their weapons simultaneously— and Frank Reid died from his wounds twelve days later. Jesse Murphy is accredited as the man responsible for killing Smith. Smith and Reid are now interred at the Klondike Gold Rush Cemetery, also known as [...] "Skagway's Boot Hill." ...|$|E
