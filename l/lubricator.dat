25|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with many LMS standard {{features such as}} a self-cleaning smokebox, rocking firegrate, self-emptying ashpan, side window cab and a simplified footplate together with others which followed NCC practice, such as a water top-feed on a parallel boiler (as opposed to the taper boilers {{being used by the}} LMS at the time), Dreadnought type vacuum brake gear, Detroit sight feed cylinder <b>lubricator</b> and a cast number plate.|$|E
25|$|As {{speeds and}} {{distances}} increased, mechanisms were developed that injected thick mineral {{oil into the}} steam supply. The first, a displacement <b>lubricator,</b> mounted in the cab, uses a controlled stream of steam condensing into a sealed container of oil. Water from the condensed steam displaces the oil into pipes. The apparatus is usually fitted with sight-glasses to confirm the rate of supply. A later method uses a mechanical pump worked {{from one of the}} crossheads. In both cases, the supply of oil is proportional to the speed of the locomotive.|$|E
50|$|When more {{sophisticated}} <b>lubricators,</b> {{such as the}} Wakefield and Detroit types, were developed, displacement <b>lubricators</b> fell out of use {{but they are still}} used on model steam engines.|$|R

25|$|Some rectifiable {{shortcomings}} were cylinders with old-fashioned short-travel valves with Z-ported cylinders, plain bearings on {{the inner}} carrying wheels that were inclined to run hot and a cab that was too small and unbearably hot in summer. The heat was made worse by the steam turret, vacuum-brake ejector and sight-feed <b>lubricator</b> that were placed inside the cab. Since the seats of the driver and stoker were mounted on poles which allowed them to be swung around to outside the cab, crews could often be seen riding outside to escape the heat.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, it was {{discovered}} that rare locomotive parts that were [...] "as good as irreplaceable" [...] had been stolen, and the locomotive was moved to Perambur Locomotive Workshops at Chennai, in Tamil Nadu, for repair. [...] On arrival, it was found that an estimated 50 to 60 parts had been looted, including [...] "the boiler, condensor, <b>lubricator</b> and flow tubes". [...] The Deputy Chief Mechanical Engineer at the workshops stated [...] "What we received is a dead body, a piece of metal whose every removable part has been removed, leaving only the metal shell. The list of parts to be procured is huge." [...] Officials estimated that it could take at least a year to restore the engine, even if suppliers of replacement parts could be found. [...] Following a substantial rebuild, in which the workshops had to construct the missing parts themselves, the locomotive returned to service on 22 December 2012.|$|E
2500|$|On {{top of each}} {{gunpowder}} cartridge was a [...] "lubricator" [...] {{consisting of}} tallow and linseed oil between two tin plates, backed by a felt wad coated with beeswax and finally by millboard. The <b>lubricator</b> followed the shell down the bore, the lubricant was squeezed out between the tin plates and the wad behind it cleaned out any lead deposits left from the shell coating leaving the bore clean for the next round.|$|E

[...] A mechanical <b>lubricator,</b> driven from the crosshead on the engineer's side, fed oil to the cylinders, valves, guides {{and other parts of}} the running gear. Many of the locomotives were fitted with a speedometer, which was attached to the engineerâ€™s side frontmost leading axle.|$|E

6000|$|... 'My dear sir,' said Mr. Otis, 'I {{really must}} insist on your oiling those chains, and have brought {{you for that}} purpose a small bottle of the Tammany Rising Sun <b>Lubricator.</b> It {{is said to be}} {{completely}} efficacious upon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect on the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall leave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to supply you with more should you require it.'

'Upon the other hand,' he continued, 'if he really declines to use the Rising Sun <b>Lubricator,</b> we shall have to take his chains from him. It would be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside the bedrooms.' ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{next day}} the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible {{excitement}} {{of the last four}} weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were completely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five days he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point of the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want it, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a low, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating the symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic apparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a different matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn duty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large oriel window on the first and third Wednesday in every month, and he did not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is quite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand, he was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural. For the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as usual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible precaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots, trod as lightly as possible on the old worm- eaten boards, wore a large black velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun <b>Lubricator</b> for oiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of protection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he slipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a little humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see that {{there was a great deal}} to be said for the invention, and, to a certain degree, it served his purpose. Still, in spite of everything, he was not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across the corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion, while dressed for the part of 'Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley Woods,' he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide, which the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry Chamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged him, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and social position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the next night in his celebrated character of 'Reckless Rupert, or the Headless Earl.' ...|$|E

6000|$|On {{reaching}} a small secret chamber {{in the left}} wing, he leaned up against a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize his position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three hundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the Dowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before the glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone into hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains {{on one of the}} spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he had blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who had been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr to nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having wakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair by the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six weeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become reconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that notorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible night when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his dressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and confessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox out of Â£50,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that the ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back to him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because he had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful Lady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round her throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin, and who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond {{at the end of the}} King's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went over his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as he recalled to mind his last appearance as [...] "Red Reuben, or the Strangled Babe," [...] his dÃ©but as [...] "Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor," [...] and the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely playing ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And after all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him the Rising Sun <b>Lubricator,</b> and throw pillows at his head! It was quite unbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this manner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till daylight in an attitude of deep thought.|$|E
60|$|Nor is it only in {{the touch}} that smooth bodies cause {{positive}} pleasure by relaxation. In the smell and taste, we find all things agreeable to them, and which are commonly called sweet, to be of a smooth nature, and that they all evidently tend to relax their respective sensories. Let us first consider the taste. Since it is most easy to inquire into the property of liquids, and since all things seem to want a fluid vehicle to make them tasted at all, I intend rather to consider the liquid than the solid parts of our food. The vehicles of all tastes are water and oil. And what determines the taste is some salt, which affects variously according to its nature, or its manner of being combined with other things. Water and oil, simply considered, are capable of giving some pleasure to the taste. Water, when simple, is insipid, inodorous, colorless, and smooth; it is found, when not cold, {{to be a great}} resolver of spasms, and <b>lubricator</b> of the fibres; this power it probably owes to its smoothness. For as fluidity depends, according to the most general opinion, on the roundness, smoothness, and weak cohesion of the component parts of any body, and as water acts merely as a simple fluid, it follows that the cause of its fluidity is likewise the cause of its relaxing quality, namely, the smoothness and slippery texture of its parts. The other fluid vehicle of tastes is oil. This too, when simple, is insipid, inodorous, colorless, and smooth to the touch and taste. It is smoother than water, and in many cases yet more relaxing. Oil is in some degree pleasant to the eye, the touch, and the taste, insipid as it is. Water is not so grateful; which I do not know on what principle to account for, other than that water is not so soft and smooth. Suppose that to this oil or water were added a certain quantity of a specific salt, which had a power of putting the nervous papillÃ¦ of the tongue into a gentle vibratory motion; as suppose sugar dissolved in it. The smoothness of the oil and the vibratory power of the salt cause the sense we call sweetness. In all sweet bodies, sugar, or a substance very little different from sugar, is constantly found. Every species of salt, examined by the microscope, has its own distinct, regular, invariable form. That of nitre is a pointed oblong; that of sea-salt an exact cube; that of sugar a perfect globe. If you have tried how smooth globular bodies, as the marbles with which boys amuse themselves, have affected the touch when they are rolled backward and forward and over one another, you will easily conceive how sweetness, which consists in a salt of such nature, affects the taste; for a single globe (though somewhat pleasant to the feeling), yet by the regularity of its form, and the somewhat too sudden deviation of its parts from a right line, is nothing near so pleasant to the touch as several globes, where the hand gently rises to one and falls to another; and this pleasure is greatly increased if the globes are in motion, and sliding over one another; for this soft variety prevents that weariness, which the uniform disposition of the several globes would otherwise produce. Thus in sweet liquors, the parts of the fluid vehicle, though most probably round, are yet so minute, as to conceal the figure of their component parts from the nicest inquisition of the microscope; and consequently, being so excessively minute, they have a sort of flat simplicity to the taste, resembling the effects of plain smooth bodies to the touch; for if a body be composed of round parts excessively small, and packed pretty closely together, the surface will be both to the sight and touch as if it were nearly plain and smooth. It is clear from their unveiling their figure to the microscope, that the particles of sugar are considerably larger than those of water or oil, and consequently that their effects from their roundness will be more distinct and palpable to the nervous papillÃ¦ of that nice organ the tongue; they will induce that sense called sweetness, which in a weak manner we discover in oil, and in a yet weaker in water; for, insipid as they are, water and oil are in some degree sweet; and it may be observed, that insipid things of all kinds approach more nearly to the nature of sweetness than to that of any other taste.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{hydrostatic}} displacement <b>lubricator</b> {{was made}} by the Detroit <b>Lubricator</b> Company of the USA. A British patent was granted in 1911 and this <b>lubricator</b> was then manufactured by the Vacuum Oil Company (later Mobil Oil) as the British Detroit <b>Lubricator.</b> This <b>lubricator</b> was commonly made with either 3,4 or 5 feeds, the center feed on the odd numbered lubricators was often used for supplying oil to the steam end of Westinghouse Air compressors.|$|E
50|$|The engine had two {{double-acting}} cylinders, side-by-side {{and equipped}} with slide-valves, {{and it was}} a simple-expansion type. Drive was transmitted directly by the crankshaft to a rear-mounted differential through using a chain.

50|$|Most Mamod engines lack <b>lubricators</b> {{to store}} oil and feed {{it to the}} moving parts such as the piston and bearings.

50|$|The {{locomotive}} had valves {{to allow}} the steam supply to either engine unit to be shut off, if necessary. Exhaust steam from the cylinders of each engine unit was led to the smokebox by separate pipes. The ball joints which gave flexibility to the steam and exhaust pipes were located immediately under and concentric with the pivot centres and were served by forced lubrication from Wakefield mechanical <b>lubricators.</b> Two 8 ft <b>lubricators,</b> one on each engine unit, supplied one feed to each cylinder and each steam chest, two to the ball joints and two to the tail-end extensions of the piston rods. The oil pipes which fed the steam chests and cylinders were fitted with anti-carbonisers. The locomotive was fitted with two Gresham and Craven no. 12 self-acting feedwater injectors and had steam sanding gear, applied {{to the front and}} rear of both engine units.|$|R
50|$|Lack of lubrication: chain {{bearings}} require lubrication {{in order}} to reduce friction. The chain pull that the drive experiences can double if the bearings are not lubricated. This can cause the system to overload by either its mechanical or electrical overload protection. On conveyors that go through hot ovens, <b>lubricators</b> can be left on constantly or set to turn on every few cycles.|$|R
