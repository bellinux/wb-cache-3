40|$|Successful risk {{management}} in an offshore {{oil and gas}} production platform requires accurate and up-to-date probability of occurrence of process safety events. Traditional hazard identification and risk assessment techniques such as HAZOP and Bow-tie analysis are the well-accepted methods in the oil and gas industry. However, these methods cannot effectively cope with dynamic operating environments, which continuously affect the estimated probabilities and risks. Factors such as variations in operating conditions, equipment deterioration, and personnel competency affect the safety barriers? performances and consequently alter the probability of occurrence of the process safety events. In the past decade, Bayesian network has gained significant attention in the process safety area because of its ability to include new information. It has been integrated with various traditional risk assessment techniques, including HAZOP and Bow-tie studies, extending their capabilities to consider operational variations and revise the probability of occurrence of the process safety events. This research applies Bayesian network to HAZOP and Bow-tie studies for a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> high pressure hydrocarbon gas from an export gas compressor system. Eleven process safety indicators such as <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>containment</b> and maintenance backlog are integrated into the models to reflect changes in safety barriers? performances. The integration process is realized by aggregating multiple specific indicators into three element indicators, which are mechanical integrity, operational integrity, and personnel integrity. The updated probabilities from the developed HAZOP-BN and Bow-tie-BN models are considerably different due to dissimilarity in hazard identification approaches and the BN development process. However, both models provide consistent results with respect to the degree of effect from indicators? input. Therefore, it is prudent for a company to implement the HAZOP-BN or Bow-tie-BN and use process safety indicator data to improve its risk assessment capability. Overtime, probability estimation can be perfected through integration of additional information with the systematic risk assessment method...|$|R

40|$|Defense-in-depth is a {{fundamental}} safety principle for the design and operation of nuclear power plants. Despite its general appeal, defense-in-depth {{is not without its}} drawbacks, which include its potential for concealing the occurrence of hazardous states in a system, and more generally rendering the latter more opaque for its operators and managers, thus resulting in safety blind spots. This in turn translates into a shrinking of the time window available for operators to identify an unfolding hazardous condition or situation and intervene to abate it. To prevent this drawback from materializing, we propose in this work a novel safety principle termed “observability-in-depth”. We characterize it as the set of provisions technical, operational, and organizational designed to enable the monitoring and identification of emerging hazardous conditions and accident pathogens in real-time and over different time-scales. Observability-in-depth also requires the monitoring of conditions of all safety barriers that implement defense-in-depth; and in so doing it supports sensemaking of identified hazardous conditions, and the understanding of potential accident sequences that might follow (how they can propagate). Observability-in-depth is thus an information-centric principle, and its importance in accident prevention is {{in the value of the}} information it provides and actions or safety interventions it spurs. We examine several “event reports” from the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission database, which illustrate specific instances of violation of the observability-in-depth safety principle and the consequences that followed (e. g., unmonitored releases and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>containments).</b> We also revisit the Three Mile Island accident in light of the proposed principle, and identify causes and consequences of the lack of observability-in-depth related to this accident sequence.

This work constitutes a first step in the development of the observability-in-depth safety principle, and we hope this effort invites other researchers and safety professionals to further explore and develop this principle and its implementation...|$|R

The particular case of tsunamis is detailed in the present paper: simplified models for the inundations depths and run-ups {{as well as their}} mechanical effects on industrial tanks. The initial accident may be caused by severe service conditions in any of the tanks either under or at atmospheric pressure, or triggered by a natural hazard such as earthquake, tsunami or extreme floods for instance. This initial event generates, in general, a set of structural fragments, a fire ball, a blast wave as well as critical <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> (liquid and gas release and loss). The surrounding facilities may suffer serious damages and may also be a new source of accident and explosion generating afterwards a new sequence of structural fragments, fire ball, blast wave and confinement loss. The structural fragments, the blast wave form and the features of the fire ball can be described following database and feedback collected from past accidents. The surrounding tanks might be under or at atmospheric pressure, and might be buried or not, or protected by physical barriers such as walls. The vulnerability of the potential targets should therefore be investigated in order to assess the risk of propagation of the accidents since cascading sequences of accidents, explosions and fires may take place within the industrial plant, giving rise to the domino effect that threatens any industrial plant.
