5|$|The crab-plover {{is related}} to the waders, but is the only member of its family. It resembles a plover but has very long grey legs and a strong black bill similar to that of a tern.

5|$|The ostrich is a flightless bird {{native to}} Africa. It {{is the largest}} living species of bird. It is {{distinctive}} in its appearance, with a <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> and legs {{and the ability to}} run at high speeds.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> has {{traditionally}} been interpreted as a feeding adaptation, it was also suggested that the oversized neck of Diplodocus and its relatives may have been primarily a sexual display, with any other feeding benefits coming second. A 2011 study refuted this idea in detail.|$|E
50|$|Others, {{like the}} brachiosaurids, were {{extremely}} tall, with high shoulders and extremely <b>long</b> <b>necks.</b> Sauroposeidon {{was probably the}} tallest, reaching about 18 metres (60 ft) high, with the previous record for <b>longest</b> <b>neck</b> being held by Mamenchisaurus. By comparison, the giraffe, the tallest of all living land animals, is only 4.8 to 5.5 metres (16 to 18 ft) tall.|$|R

5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most easily {{identifiable}} dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> and tail, and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which suggests that they coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus {{has several}} {{features}} of the head in common with basal theropods such as other ceratosaurs and coelophysoids, but it also convergently shares a number of traits, including the beak and the fused sternum, with the later coelurosaurs. The overall aspect of the animal, including the <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> and legs, {{is very similar to}} that of the Cretaceous ornithomimid theropods, as well as the Triassic non-dinosaurian archosaur Effigia, representing a significant case of convergent evolution among these three distinct groups of archosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> of Dinocephalosaurus {{probably}} {{served a}} functional role. In particular, {{the length of}} the neck places a long distance between the head and the remainder of the body. This would have allowed Dinocephalosaurus to approach potential prey without the majority of its bulk being detected, which would have been effective in the murky waters of its habitat.|$|E
5000|$|Lamarck is {{best known}} for his Theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics in 1801. His theory states that the {{characteristics}} an organism acquires throughout its life in order to adapt to its environment are passed down to its offspring. For example, Lamarck believed that the <b>long</b> <b>necks</b> of giraffes evolved as generations of giraffes reached for ever higher leaves of a tree. Their offspring and later generations inherited the resulting <b>long</b> <b>necks.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{wings are}} {{modified}} when gliding {{so that they}} rise from the body at an angle, but are closer to horizontal further along the wingspan.

For active flight, the white-bellied sea eagle alternates strong deep wing-beats with short periods of gliding.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were {{becoming}} inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were {{more susceptible to}} disease. Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers. Poultry show judges also admired the <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks {{did not have the}} delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.|$|E

5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{represents}} {{the climax of}} aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> and paddle-like limbs, it was probably incapable of functioning comfortably in a terrestrial environment. One consequence of these adaptations is that Dinocephalosaurus would have been incapable of building nests on land. This would also have prevented it from possessing hard-shelled reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate the exchange of gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water {{than it is in}} air. Thus, Dinocephalosaurus could not have been oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} show the {{differences}} between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal {{as a symbol of}} aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals {{in order to make the}} differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E
5|$|The adult female {{is mainly}} {{scalloped}} and mottled in light brown {{with a more}} uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, <b>long</b> <b>neck,</b> and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower trailing edge.|$|E

5|$|The adult sarus crane is {{very large}} with grey wings and body; a bare red head {{and part of}} the upper neck; a greyish crown; and a long greenish-grey pointed bill. In flight, the <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> is held straight, unlike that of an heron, which folds it back, and the black wing tips can be seen; the crane's long pink legs trail behind them. This bird has a grey ear covert patch, an orange-red iris and a greenish-grey bill. Juveniles have a {{yellowish}} base to the bill and the brown-grey head is fully feathered.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} characteristics {{seen in the}} breed are currently in flux, so {{there is not a}} single breed phenotype, though many members of the breed closely resemble the Mérens. Enthusiasts are breeding for a rustic mountain horse, of medium size, with good gaits and good temperament. Some members of the breed closely resemble Iberian horses such as the Andalusian horse. The official breed standard calls for a moderately <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> and long, sloped shoulder, broad back, rounded croup and muscular legs. Some members of the breed are branded on the left hindquarter. Because of its relative rarity and physical similarities, the Castillonnais is commonly confused with the Mérens.|$|E
5|$|Coelurus {{is known}} {{from most of}} the {{skeleton}} of a single individual, including numerous vertebrae, partial pelvic and shoulder girdles, and much of the arms and legs, stored at the Peabody Museum of Natural History; however, the relative completeness of the skeleton was not known until 1980. The fossils were recovered from Reed's Quarry 13 at Como Bluff, Wyoming. Additionally, two arm bones possibly belonging to this genus are known from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. It was not a large dinosaur. Its weight has been estimated at around , with a length of about 2.4meters (7.9ft) and a hip height of 0.7meters (2.3ft). From reconstructions of the skeleton, Coelurus had a relatively <b>long</b> <b>neck</b> and torso due to its long vertebrae, a long slender hindlimb due to its long metatarsus, and potentially a small slender skull.|$|E
