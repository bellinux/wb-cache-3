5|$|Cheryl Cole later {{stated that}} despite her {{initially}} hating the song, {{that the success}} of the single taught the group that they were not always right regarding single decisions and that they needed to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> label from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} {{interest}} in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from, amongst others, Victoria Beckham's father, Anthony Adams. In March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management's unwillingness to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. In order to ensure they kept {{control of their own}} work, the group retrieved the master recordings of their discography from the management offices. The next week they were supposed to meet with Sheffield-based producer Eliot Kennedy. The Herberts arranged the session weeks before the group's departure.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become {{a prime example of}} successful crew resource management. For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began to change in the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew Resource Management, while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to speak up when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew Resource Management class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made Crew Resource Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect that <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> recordings of <b>their</b> own performances has on piano performers. Music students, majoring in piano performance, each played while their performances were recorded. They then marked their scores with a pencil, while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> recordings, indicating the differences between what they focused on while playing versus what they listened for in their recordings. They were requested <b>to</b> express <b>their</b> feelings about <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> recordings after they performed twice. The results showed that performers considered their performances were improved by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> recordings. On the other hand, some aspects of their performances did not improve because they were too aware of imperfections. As performers recognized <b>their</b> performances by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> recordings, they found solutions <b>to</b> problems about <b>their</b> performances through trial and error...|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own music in-game.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but {{a small fraction of}} our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

25|$|The Xbox, iOS, and Windows {{versions}} of the game include an additional radio station that supports custom soundtracks by playing user imported MP3s, allowing players to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own music while playing the game. This feature is not available on the PlayStation 2 version of the game or when played on the Xbox 360.|$|E
25|$|The Pageant {{provides}} {{young women}} opportunities to gain confidence and poise {{and to develop}} friendships through competition. The pageant has evolved over the years into a two-evening, primarily student-produced event. Classes and student organizations select representatives and judges interview the contestants, <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> platforms, and evaluate them on the group dance, individual talent and evening gown stroll. Miss MHB and three runners-up are named, and each one receives a scholarship for the semester following their selection.|$|E
25|$|Cockpit {{procedures}} were also changed. Hierarchical relations among crew members were played down. More emphasis {{was placed on}} team decision-making by mutual agreement. Less experienced flight crew members were encouraged to challenge their captains when they believed something was not correct, and captains were instructed to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> crew and evaluate all decisions in light of crew concerns. This concept was later expanded into what is known today as crew resource management (CRM), training in which is now mandatory for all airline pilots.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Kelly {{moved to}} Alice Springs {{and started to}} {{establish}} further contacts with community members, organisations and institutions across the APY Lands. The objective of this early stage was to meet locals, to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> stories and their first-hand accounts of issues facing their communities and to learn about local {{ideas on how to}} tackle those problems. At the heart of the issues people repeatedly identified in the consultations lay two causes: alienation between the generations and an imminent loss of the Pitjantjatjara language and culture.|$|E
25|$|At the bar, the player's {{interaction}} with the game is focused on preparing drinks based on the given instructions and then serving them to characters. However, the game's experience is primarily storytelling and dialogue-driven, since as the player serves the characters they also <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> stories and experiences. The game also includes scenes outside the bar, such as at Jill's home where players are able to have text conversations and use apps on her phone. Players can also visit shops and buy items using money they earn while working at the bar to decorate Jill's home, {{as well as to}} pay the rent. Keeping Jill happy at home helps her stay more focused at work as well as making her more attuned to cocktail suggestions. Players find out about VA-11 HALL-As world through the patrons of the bar and a selection of news reports on their in-game tablet computer at the outset of each day. At the start of each work day, the player creates their own music playlist for the game in the bar's jukebox.|$|E

He spent time in Bhopal with the people, to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> stories. In a later radio interview in February 2010 Rollins summed up his approach to activism, [...] "This is where my anger takes me, to places like this, not into abuse but into proactive, clean movement." ...|$|E
500|$|Bodanzky and Bolognesi {{spent four}} months in Trieste, Italy editing the film along with Italian editors Jacopo Quadri and Letizia Caudullo. However, the film was [...] "dreamed, written and filmed" [...] for Brazilian people, so they then {{returned}} to Brazil to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> opinions. After some screenings in Brazil, they felt the film was not working as they wanted. On the airplane back to Italy, they rewrote the screenplay; they focused more on Neto and removed minor characters and subplots, while emphasizing the son-father relationship. When they arrived they had a long discussion with the Italian producers before finally agreeing and finishing the film. The film was finalized in October at the Cinecittà studio in Rome, using the THX mixing technology and the standard Dolby Digital.|$|E

500|$|The in-game {{features}} {{added in}} the port were well received. The addition of the Video Editor was met with positive reactions; GameSpot's Calvert called it [...] "a {{great way to get}} creative", while Kieron Gillen of Eurogamer criticised the unpredictability in its timing. Critics also praised the addition of the customisable radio station, which allows players to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own choice of music; Tom Chick of 1UP.com named it the best feature of the port, and Steven Hopper of GameZone called it a [...] "great touch". The port's upgrade to 32 concurrent players in the online multiplayer mode, as opposed to the console version's 16 players, was also met with positive feedback; Eurogamer's Gillen said that the [...] "possibility for mayhem... increases", while Will Tuttle of GameSpy felt that the player increase [...] "changes the action significantly".|$|E

[...] In addition to paying attention to their comments on stories, he included departments in the magazine that encouraged interaction with the fans, such as a letter column, a section that listed fanzines with names and addresses, and a review column. [...] The reviews, primarily by Wollheim, but also including contributions from Richard Wilson, Forrest Ackerman, and John Michel, were of a higher standard than elsewhere in the field, and historian Paul Carter regards Astonishing and Super Science Stories as the place where [...] "book reviewing {{for the first time}} began to merit the term 'literary criticism, and adds that [...] "it was in those magazines that the custom began of paying attention to science fiction on the stage and screen also." ...|$|E
500|$|Schuster {{was born}} on 22 August 1869 to Frederick Schuster, a manager of the Manchester firm of merchants Schuster, Fulder and Company, and his wife Sophia Wood, the {{daughter}} of a Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian Army. The family described themselves as [...] "Unitarian" [...] but were descended from Jews who had converted to Christianity in the mid-1850s and included other notable people such as Sir Arthur Schuster, Sir Felix Schuster, and later Sir George Schuster. From the age of seven he was educated at St. George's School, Ascot, {{one of the most expensive}} preparatory schools in the country but one known for harsh treatment; it was standard for the headmaster to flog pupils until they bled and force other students and staff to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> screams. During the school holidays he accompanied his father to Switzerland, where he developed a lifelong love of mountaineering and skiing. He was president of the Alpine Club from 1938 to 1940.|$|E
