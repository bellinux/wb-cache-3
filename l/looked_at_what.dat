Game Informer said that Rockstar [...] " [...] the Grand Theft Auto gameplay template onto a Wild West setting". Good Game reviewer Stephanie [...] "Hex" [...] Bendixsen said that [...] " [...] really <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> people liked and didn't like in their game design from , and included it here". Eurogamer's Simon Parkin felt Red Dead Redemption successfully [...] "re-clothes" [...] the Grand Theft Auto framework in an [...] "exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario".|$|E
500|$|McQueen and MacGraw {{began an}} affair during production. She would {{eventually}} leave her husband Evans and become McQueen's second wife. Foster {{was worried that}} their relationship could have a potentially {{negative impact on the}} film by causing a [...] scandal. MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role. According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: [...] "After we had completed The Getaway and I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> I had done in it, I hated my own performance. I liked the picture, but I despised my own work." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Spice Up Your Life" [...] was {{directed}} on 6 September 1997, by Marcus Nispel in a two-day shoot located in New York City. The video features {{the group in}} a futuristic setting, inspired by the 1982 film Blade Runner, and the music video for Janet Jackson's 1989 single Rhythm Nation controlling every aspect of society in a dark futuristic post apocalyptic cityscape. Nispel {{came up with the}} concept based on a sketch that was faxed to him signed [...] "Ginger Spice". He recalls: [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> Disney did to Times Square in NYC and tried to imagine how the Spice Girls would transform it, as their career seemed to have no limits—at the time." [...] The group was not consulted about the concept. According to Brown's autobiography, they wanted a carnival party theme, but were too tired to fight about it with the label, and ended up with a concept linked to the theme of world domination. Brown commented: [...] "It wasn't right. I don't think any of us liked it much, even though we enjoyed making it. I still can't understand what's going on in it half the time." [...] The video exclusively premiered on MTV in September 1997.|$|E

500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ellison {{graduated}} in 1981 from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy, {{where he was}} active in sports and a senator in the student government. At the age of 19, while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, Ellison converted from Catholicism to Islam, later giving the following explanation: [...] "I can't claim that I was the most observant Catholic at the time [...] I had begun to really look around and ask myself about the social circumstances of the country, issues of justice, issues of change. When I looked at my spiritual life, and I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> might inform social change, justice in society... I found Islam." ...|$|E

And then the girl heard yet louder tramps and clankings, and she beheld rising from where the others had risen a whole column of cavalry in marching order.

60|$|The dog {{had pushed}} past Colonel Lee, who stood {{a little while}} at the hall-door to listen {{if there were any}} thing {{stirring}} without, while Bevis advanced into the room where the company were assembled, bearing something in his mouth, and exhibiting, in an unusual degree, that sense of duty and interest which a dog seems to show when he thinks he has the charge of something important. He entered therefore, drooping his long tail, slouching his head and ears, and walking with the stately yet melancholy dignity of a war-horse at his master's funeral. In this manner he paced through the room, went straight up to Joceline, who had been regarding him with astonishment, and uttering a short and melancholy howl, laid at his feet the object which he bore in his mouth. Joceline stooped, and took from the floor a man's glove, of the fashion worn by the troopers, having something like the old-fashioned gauntleted projections of thick leather arising from the wrist, which go half way up to the elbow, and secure the arm against a cut with a sword. But Joceline had no sooner <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> in itself was so common an object, than he dropped it from his hand, staggered backward, uttered a groan, and nearly fell to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... § 11. And this, {{which by}} {{reason we have}} thus anticipated, is in reality universally so. There is no exception. The great men never know how or why they do things. They have no rules; cannot {{comprehend}} the nature of rules;--do not, usually, even know, in what they do, what is best or what is worst: to them {{it is all the}} same; something they cannot help saying or doing,--one piece of it as good as another, and none of it (it seems to them) worth much. The moment any man begins to talk about rules, in whatsoever art, you may know him for a second-rate man; and, if he talks about them much, he is a third-rate, or not an artist at all. To this rule there is no exception in any art; but it is perhaps better to be illustrated in the art of music than in that of painting. I fell by chance the other day upon a work of De Stendhal's, [...] "Vies de Haydn, de Mozart, et de Metastase," [...] fuller of common sense than any book I ever read on the arts; though I see, by the slight references made occasionally to painting, that the author's knowledge therein is warped and limited by the elements of general teaching in the schools around him; and I have not yet, therefore, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he has separately written on painting. But one or two passages out of this book on music are closely to our present purpose.|$|E
6000|$|It chanced that I walked {{that way}} across the fields the {{following}} night, about the same hour, and hearing a low moaning at this spot, I drew near in the dark, and discovered the only survivor of the family that I know, the heir of both its virtues and its vices, who alone was interested in this burning, lying on his stomach and looking over the cellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath, muttering to himself, as is his wont. He had been working far off in the river meadows all day, and had improved the first moments that he could call his own to visit {{the home of his}} fathers and his youth. He gazed into the cellar from all sides and points of view by turns, always lying down to it, as if there was some treasure, which he remembered, concealed between the stones, where there was absolutely nothing but a heap of bricks and ashes. The house being gone, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> there was left. He was soothed by the sympathy which my mere presence implied, and showed me, as well as the darkness permitted, where the well was covered up; which, thank Heaven, could never be burned; and he groped long about the wall to find the well-sweep which his father had cut and mounted, feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burden had been fastened to the heavy end--all that he could now cling to--to convince me that it was no common [...] "rider." [...] I felt it, and still remark it almost daily in my walks, for by it hangs the history of a family.|$|E
