5000|$|From September 1857, [...] "it {{connects the}} two largest cities (<b>Rochefort</b> and <b>La</b> <b>Rochelle)</b> to the capital, thanks to the two lines that meet at Aigrefeuille and then join into the trunk line which {{continues}} towards Niort and Paris". Three rail lines traversed Aunis through Aigrefeuille: [...] "Under the metal canopy Aigrefeuille station reigned {{a great deal of}} activity because it is the junction of the <b>La</b> <b>Rochelle</b> and <b>Rochefort</b> lines to Paris and the <b>La</b> <b>Rochelle</b> - <b>Rochefort</b> line; Nearby, a small locomotive depot meets the motive power needs".|$|R

50|$|Further south lie the Charentes, which {{correspond}} to the former provinces of Aunis, Angoumois and Saintonge.

The interior of the territory is marked {{by the presence of}} a rich plain cereal evoking the Beauce by its open relief on the horizon. At the center of this space, the city of Surgères remained a pastureland where dairy farming has retained its importance: the small city is thus a production centers butter, Beurre de Charentes-Poitou.|$|R
