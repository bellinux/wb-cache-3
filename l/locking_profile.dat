40|$|Queuing network {{models are}} used to study {{the problem for the}} preclaim and the claim-as-needed <b>locking</b> <b>profiles.</b> A wide variety of {{realistic}} conditions, such as different database-size/transaction-size ratios, and different granule placement assumptions, are considered. Using simple combinatorial arguments and elementary probability theory, the authors show that expressions for quantities such as the probability of a lock being granted, the probability of deadlock, and the mean wait time for a blocked request can all be derived analytically. The analysis is straightforward and the models are easy to understand. Validation of the models is done by comparing the models' predictions with simulation results, which shows very good agreement. Finally, the problem for a claim-with-ordering locking policy is studied. Because analytic modeling of this policy is difficult, a simulation model is used instead. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|These {{tools are}} {{primarily}} used to 'set' plugs into <b>locking</b> <b>profiles</b> (nipples) {{located in the}} tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline toolstring {{that is used to}} 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection {{to the top of a}} variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the <b>lock</b> into the <b>profile</b> using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the <b>lock</b> into the <b>profile,</b> whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop downhole tool which is pinned in place.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{comprehensive}} comparative study of the inviscid spatial stability of a parallel compressible mixing layer using various models for the mean flow are reported.

The purpose {{was to determine the}} sensitivity of the stability characteristics of the compressible mixing layer to the assumed thermodynamic properties of the fluid. It is shown that the quantative features of the stability characteristics are quite similiar for all models but that there are quantitative differences resulting from the difference in the thermodynamic models. In particular, it is shown that the stability characteristics are sensitive to the value of the Prandtl number...|$|R

60|$|I sat out {{the sermon}} and departed, I hope, with the gentle preacher's blessing. I {{went into the}} smaller refectory, near by, to refresh my memory of the {{beautiful}} Last Supper of Domenico Ghirlandaio. It would be putting things coarsely to say that I adjourned thus from a sernlon to a comedy, though Ghirlandaio's theme, as contrasted with the blessed Angelico's, was the dramatic spectacular side of human life. How keenly he observed it and how richly he rendered it, the world about him of colour and costume, of handsome heads and pictorial groupings! In his admirable school there is no painter one enjoys--pace Ruskin--more sociably and irresponsibly. Lippo Lippi is simpler, quainter, more frankly expressive; but we retain before him a remnant of the sympathetic discomfort provoked by the masters whose conceptions were still a trifle too large for their means. The pictorial vision in their minds seems to stretch and strain their undeveloped skill almost {{to a sense of}} pain. In Ghirlandaio the skill and the imagination are equal, and he gives us a delightful impression of enjoying his own resources. Of all the painters of his time he affects us least as positively not of ours. He enjoyed a crimson mantle spreading and tumbling in curious folds and embroidered with needlework of gold, just as he enjoyed a handsome well-rounded head, with vigorous dusky <b>locks,</b> <b>profiled</b> in courteous adoration. He enjoyed in short the various reality of things, and {{had the good fortune to}} live in an age when reality flowered into a thousand amusing graces--to speak only of those. He was not especially addicted to giving spiritual hints; and yet how hard and meagre they seem, the professed and finished realists of our own day, with the spiritual bonhomie or candour that makes half Ghirlandaio's richness left out! The Last Supper at San Marco is an excellent example of the natural reverence of an artist of that time with whom reverence was not, as one may say, a specialty. The main idea with him has been the variety, the material bravery and positively social charm of the scene, which finds expression, with irrepressible generosity, in the accessories of the background. Instinctively he imagines an opulent garden--imagines it with a good faith which quite tides him over the reflection that Christ and his disciples were poor men and unused to sit at meat in palaces. Great full-fruited orange-trees peep over the wall before which the table is spread, strange birds fly through the air, while a peacock perches on the edge of the partition and looks down on the sacred repast. It is striking that, without any at all intense religious purpose, the figures, in their varied naturalness, have a dignity and sweetness of attitude that admits of numberless reverential constructions. I should call all this the happy tact of a robust faith.|$|R
40|$|Bilateral {{clavicle}} fractures {{are rare}} and are seldom reported on. Based on the literature review {{the incidence of}} bilateral clavicle fractures is 0. 43 % of clavicle fractures with an overall incidence of between 0. 011 and 0. 017 %. The common mechanism of injury {{is one of a}} compressive force across both shoulder girdles and is different from that causing unilateral clavicle fractures. Bilateral clavicle fractures are usually associated with high-energy impact injuries and are commonly associated with other severe injuries. These injuries are not always evident and should be actively sought for and excluded. Bilateral clavicle fractures are not commonly mentioned as an indication for operative intervention. It is suggested that bilateral clavicle fractures should be surgically managed to limit the duration of functional disability. Furthermore the use of low <b>profile</b> <b>locking</b> plates provides the ideal fixation method allowing for an earlier functional outcome. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|To {{find the}} cause of a {{functional}} or non-functional defect (bug) in software running on a multi-processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC), developers need insight into the chip. Tracing systems provide this insight non-intrusively, at the cost of high off-chip bandwidth requirements. This I/O bottleneck limits the observability, a problem becoming more severe as more functionality is integrated on-chip. In this paper, we present DiaSys, an MPSoC diagnosis system with the potential to replace today's tracing systems. Its main idea is to partially execute the analysis of observation data on the chip; in consequence, more information and less data is sent to the attached host PC. With DiaSys, the data analysis is performed by the diagnosis application. Its input are events, which are generated by observation hardware at interesting points in the program execution (like a function call). Its outputs are events with higher information density. The event transformation is modeled as dataflow application. For execution, it is mapped in part to dedicated and distributed on-chip components, and in part to the host PC; the off-chip boundary is transparent to the developer of the diagnosis application. We implement DiaSys as extension to an existing SoC with four tiles and a mesh network running on an FPGA platform. Two usage examples confirm that DiaSys is flexible enough to replace a tracing system, while significantly lowering the off-chip bandwidth requirements. In our examples, the debugging of a race-condition bug, {{and the creation of a}} <b>lock</b> contention <b>profile,</b> we see a reduction of trace bandwidth of more than three orders of magnitude, compared to a full trace created by a common tracing system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, diamond {{grinding}} {{has gained}} increasing attention as pavement preservation treatment to restore desired surface characteristics, particularly friction. Compared to other pavement preservation treatments such as surface overlays and high friction surface treatments, diamond grinding may cost less, save construction time, or require minimum maintenance. Diamond grinding produces longitudinal, continuous, and line-type texture that contains corrugations with evenly spaced ridges. The improved surface texture will immediately enhance pavement surface friction and reduce the possibility of hydroplaning in rainy weather. However, little information has been documented on the texture characteristics and long-term friction performance of diamond-ground pavements. A field evaluation was conducted to examine the surface texture and friction characteristics in diamond-ground concrete and asphalt pavements by the authors. Five pavement test sections, including two diamond-ground concrete pavements, one diamond-ground concrete bridge deck, one diamond-ground asphalt pavement, and one transversely tined concrete pavement, were selected for evaluation. Laser scanner testing was performed to capture both macro and microtexture <b>profiles.</b> <b>Locked</b> wheel testing was performed to measure the friction numbers. The test results were examined and compared so as to evaluate two performances, after construction and long-term friction performance of diamond-ground pavements. It was found that longitudinal diamond grinding can provide durable, satisfactory surface friction performance for both concrete and asphalt pavements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an optical frequency stabilization technique using a three-mode Helium Neon laser at 632. 8 nm. Using this configuration, a maximum frequency stability relative to an iodine stabilized laser of 6 Ã— 10 - 12 (71 s integration time) was achieved. Two long term measurements of 62 h and 40 h showed fractional frequency fluctuations of 6. 2 Ã— 10 - 10 (2 ?) and 1. 6 Ã— 10 - 10 (2 ?) when correcting for known frequency fluctuations outside the controller bandwidth, respectively. This stabilization scheme maximizes the available optical power (1. 7 mW in this instance) because the output mode {{is in the}} center of the HeNe gain curve. This stabilization technique was also verified for a larger HeNe laser with a lower free spectral range. While not optimized for this configuration and laser, we demonstrated fractional frequency fluctuations below 1 Ã— 10 - 8 with 3. 5 mW of usable output power. This is useful for multi-axis systems or systems employing fiber coupling. In this paper, the overall system is described and data containing the frequency <b>locking</b> signal sensitivity, <b>profile</b> during laser warm up, sensitivity to environmental fluctuations, and optical power of the locking signal is shown.

40|$|Regolith carbonate, {{especially}} when indurated (calcrete), {{has been widely}} adopted as a sampling medium by many Australian Au exploration companies. Rapid uptake of the medium in geochemical exploration programs, following its reported success in the South Australia Challenger Au deposit discovery, has resulted in poorly constrained sampling methodology with many inconsistencies. Results have therefore been equivocal. This study of regolith carbonates and their association with Au will improve this situation. Three aspects of regolith carbonate development and association with Au are investigated. These are based on variable spatial scales, ranging from the southern Australian continent, to local area, to individual profile. On a continental scale, regolith carbonates cover extensive areas of southern Australia. The primary component, Ca, is sourced from mineral weathering or atmospheric sources. Through the use of Sr isotopes to provide a surrogate expression for Ca sources, the source was identified as > 90 % atmospheric or marine derived. A uniform inland signature is identified, {{which is due to}} the continual recycling and mixing of marine derived Ca with minimal bedrock input. An external Ca source means that Ca does not have a direct relationship with Au, which is locally sourced from mineralised areas. On a local scale, a Au-in-calcrete anomaly extending over 20 kmÂ² and lying over both mineralised (Tunkillia Au prospect) and barren bedrock was investigated. Regolith-landform mapping and geochemistry was used to further identify the zone of elevated Au-in-calcrete. The zone was found to correspond spatially with palaeo- and contemporary drainage systems that currently flow into ephemeral lakes. Geochemistry of the area shows that the majority of elements have been transported and enriched along these systems. This dispersion pattern and its contemporary landscape expression is complicated by dune fields over mineralisation that partially cover the palaeo-drainage. Millions of dollars have been spent drilling this anomaly with no significant mineralisation found beyond the discrete Tunkillia mineralized zones, yet with the aid of regolith-landform mapping an explanation of the anomaly spatial pattern and dispersion pattern has been provided at very low cost. On the profile scale, two regolith carbonate profiles from the White Dam Au-Cu prospect were analysed in detail. Mass balance calculations revealed chemical gains and losses for the soil horizon and total profile. The investigation quantified the extensive external Ca input and revealed the position and size of the Au particles. Gold in the profile prior to regolith carbonate development is concentrated at the top of what is presently the regolith carbonate horizon as calcite precipitation in void spaces reduces permeability. Ongoing calcite precipitation up the <b>profile</b> <b>locks</b> in the Au, resulting in a Au-in-calcrete anomaly. Exposure of Au-enriched calcrete horizons to chemical and physical weathering results in decomposition of the material. This material can then be transported in the form of surface lag, which may settle on top of existing and still developing regolith carbonates to form new Au-in-calcrete anomalies that are unrelated to underlying bedrock. The formation of Au-in-calcrete anomalies in relation to landscape processes is demonstrated. Additional information on landscape setting, gathered while sampling, can therefore improve interpretation of regolith carbonate geochemistry. Exploration companies that take time to understand the landscape setting in this way and react accordingly, can therefore expect improved results. Thesis (Ph.
