Both unidimensional and multidimensional IRT models {{have been developed to}} control <b>local</b> <b>item</b> dependence caused by testlets. The purposes of the current study were to (1) investigate how different levels of LID can affect IRT true and observed score equating of testlet-based tests when the traditional three parameter logistic (3 PL) IRT model was used for calibration, and (2) compare the performance of four different IRT models, including the 3 PL IRT model, graded response model (GRM), testlet response theory model (TRT), and bifactor model, in IRT true and observed score equating of testlet-based tests with various levels of <b>local</b> <b>item</b> dependence. Both real and simulated data analyses were conducted in this study. Two testlet-based tests (i. e., Test A and Test B) that differed in subjects, test length, and testlet length were used in the real data analysis. For simulated data analysis, two main factors were investigated in this study: (1) testlet length (5 or 10), and (2) LID level within testlets that was defined by testlet effect variance (0, 0. 25, 0. 5625, 0. 75, 1, and 1. 5). For the unidimensional IRT models (i. e., 3 PL IRT model and GRM), unidimensional IRT true score and observed score equating procedures, explained in Kolen and Brennan (2004), were used. For the two investigated multidimensional IRT models (i. e., 3 PL TRT model and bifactor model), the unidimensional approximation of multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) true score equating procedure and the unidimensional approximation of MIRT observed score equating procedure (Brossman 2 ̆ 6 Lee, 2013) were applied. The traditional equipercentile equating method was used as the baseline for comparison in both real data and simulated data analyses. It was found in the study that both testlet length and the LID level affected the performance of the investigated models on IRT true and observed score equating of testlet-based tests. When the traditional 3 PL IRT model was used for tests with long testlets, higher levels of <b>local</b> <b>item</b> dependence led to IRT equating results that deviated further away from those obtained from the baseline method. However, the effect of <b>local</b> <b>item</b> dependence on IRT equating results was not prominent for tests with short testlets. Moreover, for tests consisting of long testlets (e. g., a testlet length of 10 or more) and having a very low level of <b>local</b> <b>item</b> dependence (e. g., a LID level of 0. 25 or lower), and for tests consisting of short testlets (e. g., a testlet length around 5), all four investigated IRT models worked well in IRT true and observed score equating. For tests with long testlets and a relatively high level of <b>local</b> <b>item</b> dependence (e. g., a LID level of 0. 5625 or higher), the GRM, bifactor, and TRT models outperformed the traditional 3 PL IRT model in IRT true and observed equating of testlet-based tests. The study suggested that the selection of models for IRT true and observed score equating of testlet-based tests should be considered with respect to the features of the testlet-based tests and the groups of examinees from which the data is collected. It is hoped that this study encourages researchers to identify differences among existing models for IRT true and observed score equating of testlet-based tests with various features, and to develop new models that are appropriate for modeling testlet-based tests to obtain accurate IRT number correct score equating results...|$|R

40|$|December 2013. A Dissertation {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Steven Osterlind. Vita. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Mixture Rasch models, which are often used to investigate response strategy difference, differential item functioning, and test speediness, have gained much attention in educational and psychological research recently. Although these models show promise in more in-depth understanding of the latent variables being measured, {{the determination of the}} number of latent classes remains a challenging issue. This problem becomes more serious when one of the key underlying assumptions, <b>local</b> <b>item</b> independency is violated. The current simulation study examined the performance of mixture Rasch models in deciding the correct number of latent classes when passage-related <b>local</b> <b>item</b> dependence is present. Three information-based indices, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Integrated Completed Likelihood (ICL) are used in this study for selecting number of latent classes under a variety of conditions. Results indicate that the ICL selects the correct number of latent classes at all conditions {{despite the fact that the}} assumption of <b>local</b> <b>item</b> independence is violated. The BIC is moderately effective under certain conditions. The AIC tends to select the more complex model under most conditions and is considered to be least effective for this use. Among four manipulating factors, the level of testlet effects appeared to be the most influential cause for overextracting latent classes based on the AIC and BIC. The impacts of other factors vary according to which information-based index is used. Includes bibliographical references (pages 89 - 96) ...|$|R
