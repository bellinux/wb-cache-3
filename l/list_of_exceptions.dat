500|$|In its {{original}} form, the qualification requirements for an FHA insured loan {{called for the}} borrower to be his/her own source of funds for the down payment. [...] In 1996, the U.S. Congress amended the statute to permit the down-payment funds {{to come from a}} family member of the borrower. [...] However, HUD subsequently issued guidelines that considerably expanded the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>exceptions</b> beyond that which appeared in the statute. [...] The expanded list included, for example, the borrower's employer or labor union. [...] The expanded list also included [...] "charitable organizations". [...] That guideline also noted that [...] "As a rule, our concern is not with how the donor obtains the gift funds provided they are not derived in any manner from a party to the sales transaction". [...] In 1996, HUD issued Mortgagee Letter 96–18, stating [...] "a nonprofit or other organization that provides bona fide gifts to eligible participants should not compel the beneficiary to purchase only properties owned by the donor of the funds.

The entry was retained in Ernest Gowers's 1965 revision. Robert Burchfield rewrote it for the 1996 edition, stating 'the rule can helpfully be extended [...] "except when the word is pronounced with [...] "', and giving a longer <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>exceptions,</b> including words excluded from Fowler's interpretation.

2500|$|If no {{suitable}} {{line break}} {{can be found}} for a line, the system will try to hyphenate a word. The original version of TeX used a hyphenation algorithm based {{on a set of}} rules for the removal of prefixes and suffixes of words, and for deciding if it should insert a break between the two consonants in a pattern of the form vowel–consonant–consonant–vowel (which is possible most of the time). TeX82 introduced a new hyphenation algorithm, designed by Frank Liang in 1983, to assign priorities to breakpoints in letter groups. A list of hyphenation patterns is first generated automatically from a corpus of hyphenated words (a list of 50,000 words). If TeX must find the acceptable hyphenation positions in the word encyclopedia, for example, it will consider all the subwords of the extended word [...]encyclopedia., where [...] is a special marker to indicate the beginning or end of the word. The list of subwords includes all the subwords of length 1 (., e, n, c, y, etc.), of length 2 (.e, en, nc, etc.), etc., up to the subword of length 14, which is the word itself, including the markers. TeX will then look into its list of hyphenation patterns, and find subwords for which it has calculated the desirability of hyphenation at each position. In the case of our word, 11 such patterns can be matched, namely 1c4l4, 1cy, 1d4i3a, 4edi, e3dia, 2i1a, ope5d, 2p2ed, 3pedi, pedia4, y1c. For each position in the word, TeX will calculate the maximum value obtained among all matching patterns, yielding en1cy1c4l4o3p4e5d4i3a4. Finally, the acceptable positions are those indicated by an odd number, yielding the acceptable hyphenations en-cy-clo-pe-di-a. This system based on subwords allows the definition of very general patterns (such as 2i1a), with low indicative numbers (either odd or even), which can then be superseded by more specific patterns (such as 1d4i3a) if necessary. These patterns find about 90% of the hyphens in the original dictionary; more importantly, they do not insert any spurious hyphen. In addition, a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>exceptions</b> (words for which the patterns do not predict the correct hyphenation) are included with the Plain TeX format; additional ones can be specified by the user.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{programming}} languages, such as Java and C#, typically provide {{features that}} handle exceptions. These features separate error-handling code from regular source code and are proven {{to enhance the}} practice of software reliability, comprehension, and maintenance. Having acknowledged the advantages <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> handling features, the misuse of them can still cause catastrophic software failures, such as application crash. Prior studies suggested anti-patterns <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> handling; while little knowledge was shared about the prevalence of these anti-patterns. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence of exception-handling anti-patterns. We collected a thorough <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> anti-patterns from 16 open-source Java and C# libraries and applications using an automated exception flow analysis tool. We found that although exception handling anti- patterns widely exist {{in all of our}} subjects, only a few anti- patterns (e. g. Unhandled Exceptions, Catch Generic, Unreachable Handler, Over-catch, and Destructive Wrapping) can be commonly identified. On the other hand, we find that the prevalence of anti- patterns illustrates differences between C# and Java. Our results call for further in-depth analyses on the exception handling practices across different languages...|$|R

With this objective, they develop a methodology that allows them to study the welfare effects of a bilateral agreement by identifying the sectors that would encounter the most problems and those that would be most favored by a trade agreement. A general typology of the changes under different protection regimes in an eventual free trade area between the United States and MERCOSUR is developed (enhanced protection versus reduced protection and trade diversion versus trade creation). This methodology utilizes data on trade and production, and it allows the typology of goods in each of these categories to be determined empirically. The work is carried out at a high level of disaggregation so as to be able to identify the reciprocal sensitive sectors. The results constitute an objective base for analyzing the <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>exceptions</b> that the trade agreement would entail. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{elliptic}} 3 -manifolds are {{the closed}} 3 -manifolds that admit a Riemannian metric of constant positive curvature, that is, {{those that have}} finite fundamental group. The (Generalized) Smale Conjecture asserts that for any elliptic 3 -manifold M, the inclusion from the isometry group of M to the diffeomorphism group of M is a homotopy equivalence. The original Smale Conjecture, for the 3 -sphere, was proven by J. Cerf and A. Hatcher, and N. Ivanov proved the generalized conjecture {{for many of the}} elliptic 3 -manifolds that contain a geometrically incompressible Klein bottle. Our main results are 1. The Smale Conjecture holds for all elliptic 3 -manifolds containing geometrically incompressible Klein bottles. These include all quaternionic and prism manifolds. 2. The Smale Conjecture holds for all lens spaces L(m,q) with m at least 3. These results complete the Smale Conjecture for all cases except the 3 -dimensional real projective space and those admitting a Seifert fibering over the 2 -sphere with three exceptional fibers of types (2, 3, 3), (2, 3, 4), or (2, 3, 5). The technical work needed for these results includes the result that if V is a Haken Seifert-fibered 3 -manifold, then apart from a small <b>list</b> <b>of</b> known <b>exceptions,</b> the inclusion from the space of fiber-preserving diffeomorphisms of V to the full diffeomorphism group is a homotopy equivalence.
