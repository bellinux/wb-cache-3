40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) systems {{enable users}} to {{interact}} with computer-generated objects in a natural manner. However, inevitable time <b>lags</b> occur when a Virtual Reality system responds to dynamic head or hand movements of a user. Many studies have reported the time <b>lag</b> problems with Virtual Reality systems but studies on the combined effects of head and hand movement-related <b>lags</b> are few. The purposes of this research are {{to determine the effects}} of (i) head movement-related <b>lags,</b> (ii) hand movement-related <b>lags,</b> and (iii) combined head and hand movement-related <b>lags</b> on manual task performance. Both discrete and continuous manual tasks have been investigated and the mechanisms responsible for the degraded performance with <b>lags</b> have also been studied and identified. In addition, quantitative models to predict the task performance in the presence of hand movement-related <b>lags</b> and combined hand and head movement-related <b>lags</b> are presented. Four experiments were conducted. With discrete manual tasks, both additional head movement-related <b>lags</b> (≥ 110 ms) and hand movement-related <b>lags</b> ([is more than or equal to 55 ms) significantly increased the task completion times. Effects of hand movement-related <b>lags</b> were found to be significantly greater than the effects of head movement-related <b>lags</b> of the same magnitudes. With continuous manual tracking tasks, tracking errors increased with increasing hand movement-related <b>lags</b> but not with increasing head movement-related <b>lags</b> (up to 440 ms). It was found that the effects of hand movement-related <b>lags</b> had significant interactions with the effects of target width but not with target distance. This contradicts some previous findings. A model explaining this interaction phenomenon has been developed. With the presence of head movement-related <b>lags,</b> the opposite was found. That is, the effects of head movement-related <b>lags</b> had significant interactions with the effects of target distance but not with target width. The interaction results indicate that, in the presence of <b>lags,</b> the effect of target width (W) and distance (D) should not be analyzed as a single effect of 'Index-of-Difficulty, ID' (ID = log 2 2 D/W). This is a new finding. With a constant <b>lag,</b> discrete target-directed hand movement times were found to be consistent with Fitts' laws (R 2 [is more than] 0. 8).
