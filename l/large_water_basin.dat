40|$|The {{abrasion}} {{processing of}} shores is a pressing problem of <b>large</b> <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> of the Lower Volga region and other Russian regions. About 3 km 2 of shoreland is annually {{lost in the}} zone of the Volgograd <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> {{as a result of}} this process. The existing methods of shores protection are connected with the creation of concrete structures having a high level of erosion resistance. They are extremely expensive and in most cases they are not affordable for rural municipalities suffering from abrasion. The authors offer cheap and environmentally friendly way of protecting the shores of <b>large</b> <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> from abrasion. The method is based on the plantation of a common reed strip on a water basin’s shallow. The biological characteristics of common reed as the main component of shore protection structures are described. The terms and milestones of the work in the conditions of the Volgograd <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> are developed. The main result of applying our methodology is the complete cessation of abrasion processing of the shore at the corresponding piece of land. The authors overview the positive qualities of reed plantations, their biocenotic, barrier and waterproof role in on-shore ecosystems. The application of the described method will allow saving for the national economy dozens of hectares of valuable shore lands annually, in particular, irrigated cropland, settlement lands, infrastructure. In addition to the direct benefits associated with the conservation of land resources, the intensity of adverse processes associated with erosion of shores (<b>water</b> <b>basin</b> muddying, deterioration of sanitary qualities of water) will decrease. Due to the wide geographic spread of common reed described in the present work, the technology of shores stabilization can be applied at almost all lowland <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> of Russia...|$|R

5000|$|The {{pavilion}} {{was to be}} bare, with no exhibits, {{leaving only}} the structure accompanying a single sculpture and specially-designed furniture (the Barcelona Chair).

40|$|A partir de références bibliographiques encore réduites, les auteurs ont mis au point un {{protocole}} expérimental d'évaluation de la toxicité des sédiments de rivière, après extraction au dichlorométhane et mesure de la toxicité par le lest de Bioluminescence Bactérienne. Ce protocole simple appliqué à quarante-trois prélèvements correspondant à des situations de pollution diversifiées, a permis d'établir et de proposer une typologie des sédiments {{en fonction}} de leur niveau de toxicité. Correspondant à une approche nouvelle (tests biologiques de toxicité sur sédiments), la méthodologie apparaît particulièrement intéressante pour la gestion patrimoniale des cours d'eau (réseaux de surveillance, mise en évidence de situations de pollutions), et devrait être intégrée dans les opérations de mesure de l'impact des pollutions toxiques sur les écosystèmes aquatiques. As toxic substances in river water {{are not easy}} to detect and to measure, sediments able to precipitate them have been userd, successfully, to quaintly metals and a limited number of organics. Actually, analytical determinations, very expansive, time consuming and never exhaustive, are not an adequate means for a general estimation of the presence of toxic organic substances. Another developing approach consists in determining effects not the substances themselves (contained in the sediments) but their toxic effects on biotests applied directly on all the sediments or on the extracts. This approach has been used by relatively few teams, principally in North-America and in The Netherlands, in limited areas, to evaluate the local impacts of industrial effluents on sea and-or river waters. On the contrary, the object of this work is to measure the interest of this kind of approach, at a <b>large</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Basin,</b> first to establish the toxic profiles of rivers with areas of pollution, and second to constitute a memorization, susceptible of being compared at regular intervals for an estimation of general depollution policies. Based on data taken from the literature, an organic extraction of sediments with dichloromethane as solvent (without pretreatment) and photobacterium phosphoreum luminescence inhibition test were chosen. Actually, according to the literature, dichloromethane is the must convenient solvant and toxic activities of extracts are well correlated with organic toxic contents in the few cases where, exceptionally, the two approaches have been carried out simultaneously. Similarly, the bacterial luminescence test, Microtox (commercial name), quick and inexpensive, is well correlated with results from other biotests when, occasionally, both were utilised. Moreover, Microtox was well tested in the Agence laboratory. Different conditions of extraction were carefully tested, before the adoption of the definite protocol : whole sediments (10 -g) are mixed (slow agitation in rolling flasks) for 6 hours with dichloromethane (100 -mL) and sodium sulphate (50 g). Dichloromethane is then eliminated and the remaining solid materials are washed twice with fresh dichloromethane (2 x 20 mi). Dichloromethane extract and washings are collected, dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated (below 40 °C) to 1 mL, further adjusted to 3 mL. A portion measured accurately of this concentrate is added to ethanol and concentrated to remove dichloromethane. Bacterial bioluminescence tests, in duplicate, are performed on ethanol extracts, diluted (1 %) in salified (sodium chloride 2 %) distilled water. Estimates of the EC 50 (concentration causing a 50 % reduction in bioluminescence) obtained using linear regression analysis are converted into Toxic Units and referred to the net organic weight, measured separately, at 550 °C. This expression of results is particularly relevant when sediments with different organic net weights are compared. The protocol has been applied to sediments collected at 43 sites in the principal rivers of Rhône Méditerranée Corse Basin and in special distant from significant domestic and industrial activities. The toxic amplitude observed (ratio of l/ 200 between lowest and highest toxic units obtained with the panel) and the good reproductibility of the whole process (10 % to 25 %) were consistent with a trial subdivision in 5 classes as follow :Class 1  : Out of pollution - Class 2  : Moderate toxicity - Class 3  : Important toxicity - Class 4  : Very important toxicity - Class 5  : Exceptional toxicity. The relevancy of this classification was estimated when sediments were classed according to their toxic content. The classification proves to be correct in must cases. Exceptionally toxic sediments were collected in sites affected by large industries and agglomerations as (CHASSE and SAINT-VALLIER) on River Rhone near Lyon and important chemical plants, or GIVORS, on the small River GIER, markedly affected by many various industries. On the contrary sediments of moderate toxicity corresponded to sites relatively far from sources of important pollutions, e. g., ARLES on the River RHONE near the sea and a number of sites on the River SAONE. Moreover, when repeated sampling was performed on the same sites, the results were consistent, belonging to the same class of toxicity. The general object of this work was not to determine a definite classification of sediment toxicities, but to assess the relevancy of this approach. In our opinion, it was proved that bioassays on sediment extracts, and specially the bacterial bioluminescence assay, are a valuable tool, before the material impossibility to determine the toxic substances content. Moreover this approach could be used at the Basin. More investigations are necessary to define more accurately the number and level of toxic classes and e. g. to establish correlations with perturbations of benthic communities living in the sediments. It is also a contribution to the general knowledge and action based on biotests performed on effluents and different compartments of rivers...|$|E
40|$|Ljetnikovac Bunić-Kaboga sagrađen je u prvoj polovici 16. stoljeća, u vrijeme Miha Junijeva Bone, a preuređen je nakon potresa 1667. kad je došao u posjed obitelji Kaboga. Iz prve su faze sačuvani građevinski dijelovi po kojima se ovaj ljetnikovac ubraja u vrhunska ostvarenja dubrovačke gotičko-renesansne arhitekture. U drugoj fazi promijenjeno je mjesto orsana, staro je stubište zamijenjeno novim, dijelom prigrađenim začelju; zatečena žbuka je otučena pa baroknoj fazi pripadaju i svi oslikani slojevi predvorja, stubišta, dvorane na katu i bočnih soba. U ovom se članku detaljnije obrađuju rezultati konzervatorsko-restauratorskih istraživanja s posebnim osvrtom na nalaze iz druge faze, na osnovi kojih su bile predložene smjernice za njihovu prezentaciju. The villa was {{constructed}} in two phases that match the periods prior to and after the 1667 earthquake. During the first phase, which defined the architectural typology, the exterior and the principal layout of the building, the villa belonged to the Bunić family, while {{in the second phase}} it was owned by the Kaboga family. The villa, as it was executed in the first phase, {{is considered to be a}} prime example of the Dubrovnik villa architecture and an exceptional monument of the Gothic-Renaissance style. Its construction is dated to the first decades of the 16 th century, based on style characteristics of the portico and its column capitals, the loggia and the chapel that was commissioned in 1538 from Petar Andrijić. All recent insights into the first phase of the villa resulted from the 2008 and 2009 research and are published in the Journal of the Institute of Art History 38 (2014), while this article focuses on the findings from the second phase of construction, which were the basis for the proposed conservation guidelines. Portions of the villa that originated in the 18 th and 19 th century, in the time of the Kaboga family, are far inferior to the architectural concept achieved in the time of the Bunić family. Moreover, certain interventions have undermined its former excellence. For example, the construction of a staircase projection to the rear of the building altered the relation between the great hall and the back garden, and a change in the overall layout of the villa ensemble emerged from adding a new boathouse in front of the westernmost arch of the portico. In the rooms of the 1 st floor, new flooring was laid and wooden beams were replaced with coved plaster ceilings. The renovation of the interior that introduced characteristics of the Baroque style was radical in terms of the walls. All the previous plaster was hacked off, so that all the layers of paint and the wall painting investigated in the conservation research were determined to have originated during or after the 18 th century. The research was therefore focused on investigating the interior in order to determine the relation between the two phases and the possibilities for their presentation. The major intervention in the second phase was the construction of a new staircase; the vertical communication became more complex and visually connected to the ground-floor entrance hall. The dynamic concept of the staircase is revealed particularly in its first section, which consists of three separately-vaulted sequences, suggesting spatial depth. Parallel flights of stairs are located in a tall room topped by the plastered ceiling. Both the stairs and the landings are paved with light- and dark-grey marble slabs that give it a representative character. The connection of the atrium and the staircase is accentuated with the almost identical painting of the walls: elements of architecture (decorations, capital portions of the pilasters and the arches, panel mouldings) that are elsewhere executed sculpturally are here painted. The division of the wall surface, the vaults and the ceiling is executed in painted architectural decoration. The oldest three painted layers are done in this way. In both the entrance hall and the staircase, the second layer – pink with brown decorations – is proposed for conservation, as it was revealed to be the finest and best preserved. The fourth landing that ends the staircase had particular importance in the layout of the 1 st floor: therefrom one entered into the great hall, exited to the garden or climbed to the attic. The wall painting of the western, the only painted wall of the landing, stretched from the gray-colour parapet to the frame of the panel mouldings that continue over to the wooden door frame, which suggests they once stretched across the doors that were, however, removed in the renovation. The staircase of Villa Bunić-Kaboga contributed nothing to the prior architectural concept, and without the wall painting, the space would be even further devalued. The great hall – with its 16 th-century scale, Gothic windows on the façade wall, Renaissance door-frames and the late 18 th-century wall painting – reflects the changing styles of the villa. It is suggested that the penultimate painted layer should be presented, i. e. that the plaster on all the walls up to the parapet zone should be preserved and conserved (the imitation of marble plates in wine-red, framed with grey bands), and that the wall painting on top of the parapet should be reconstructed according to the findings. Over the light-blue paint on the walls, decorations were executed in darker blue; thicker and thinner vertical and horizontal lines compose frames, whose upper corners are filled with tendril motifs. The wall painting imitates panels that would in a more sumptuous variety be executed in relief or even gilded ornaments. However, the transparency suggested by the sky-blue colour is unmistakably reminiscent of the times when the great hall of the Villa Bunić, opened with numerous windows, generated the same impression. Lines drawn in darker blue are reminiscent of supporting structures with tendrils, which are frequent in garden pavilions. Although the guidelines were accepted by the Conservation Department in Dubrovnik in October of the same year, opposition to the proposal lasted until the spring of 2012. The painting in the lateral rooms of the 1 st floor also has the horizontal division of wall surfaces and ceiling coves that optically lowers the rooms: marbleization is found in the parapet zones. In the front lateral rooms of the 1 st floor, the findings were revealed to be deserving of at least a partial presentation. The guidelines were therefore formulated in such a way: regardless of whether they originated at the same time and the fact that they were more a reflection of the commissioner’s taste than the high style criteria, it was necessary, given the architecture of the villa itself and its designated users – conservators – to display the authentic space and its furnishings. For example, in the northeastern side room, the oldest layer was proposed for presentation, but was unfortunately not executed: it depicted a marbleized parapet against a light-grey and pale-pink background with dark-grey sinews, while the wall on top of it was painted light-grey and pale-pink. On the eastern wall, in one of the paint layers, a fine pencil and monochrome wash drawing was discovered: on top of two fluted pilasters and barely visible traces of a moulded architrave, a lion is depicted holding with its paw an open book with an inscription: INIVSTI PVNIENTVR ET SEMEN IMPIORVM PERIBIT. According to documented measures it can be induced that in the 18 th-century interior renovation, the drawing in fact traced the painted fireplace hood from the 16 th century. As proposed in the conservation guidelines, the drawing was strapped, but was not returned during the final conservation efforts. In addition, the northeastern room of the 1 st floor had in its western wall a fireplace, whose relatively small dimensions and the spolia cornice indicated that its format was subsequently altered. Due to the lack of information, it was not proposed for reconstruction. It was, however, renovated, i. e. its opening was framed with moulded jambs whose plasticity mismatches the cornice. Furthermore, the guidelines underlined that in all the back lateral rooms, regardless of the quality of the painting, the zones of the parapet, the wall and the coves should be distinguished. This would be a way to optically lower the small-sized rooms, which were in the Baroque period given high ceilings with no beams. Not considering and not applying this type of wall division would result in a distorted impression of the Baroque space, which is unfortunately what had taken place. The loggia, opened with two arches on the north and the south side, was found with some 19 th-century woodwork, which was removed according to the proposed guidelines. The floor slabs needed to be replicated in the most similar material, the same colour and size of the slabs and the way they were laid, in order for the loggia to be distinguished from open surfaces of the terrace and the garden. However, this suggestion was disregarded. The <b>large</b> <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> that was discovered in the eastern wall with no beams was presented in a highly stylized and wrongly interpreted manner. The terrace in front of the façade and the chapel, as well as the one on top of the boathouse, was in the second phase paved with stone slabs. Investigations initially determined the height of an earlier paving, which was 4. 5 cm lower, later to reveal the original paving in bricks (25 x 12. 5 cm), laid in a fishbone pattern and matching the time of origin of the façade. The subsequent finding was, unfortunately, overlooked in the conservation. Indeed, this is not the only example of how in this villa renovation the taste of the sponsor was given priority over the authenticity of the findings. Other than the two historical phases, some 19 th- and 20 th-century construction efforts affected the condition the conservators encountered in the 2008 research. According to the cadastral plan from 1832 / 1877 and its written portion from 1841, aside from the cultivated downs, there was also a facility building and a small garden at the presumed original location of the 16 th-century boathouse. At the turn of the century, the last owners caused injuries to the arches and the capitals as they embedded some woodwork into the loggia. In addition, damage was done to the stone frames of the Gothic windows in the 1 st floor: metal wedges were driven into window jambs, columns, capitals and arches. Single-arched windows lost their three-foil outline and the three-arched window was given two side openings in place of the central one. The conservation report suggested that a special renovation project be established for the three-arched window, in order to investigate the possibility of returning the opening to its original form. However, this was disregarded, whether there was a reason or not for doing so...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the resource curse links the abundance of natural resources {{to higher levels of}} conflict occurrence. Until now, most literature merely focuses on non-renewable resources such as diamonds or gold. This paper sheds the light on water as a renewable resource and takes a new perspective arguing that water abundance can also be linked to conflict occurrence. The main argument for water to be a curse is based on the expectation that the commercialization of water resources can lead through the effects of greed or grievances to interstate clashes. The quantitative time-series cross-section analysis focuses on shared <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> and examines their link to low-level militarized interstate disputes (MID). Multivariate logistic regressions, interaction terms and marginal effects show that <b>larger</b> <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> are associated with a lower conflict risk which means that the expectation of a water curse cannot be confirmed. The results for greed and grievance as determinants of conflict show that greed does in fact increase the conflict risk, but the effect is independent from water abundance. In contrast, grievances {{turn out to be a}} conflict-decreasing factor, also when set in relation with water abundance. The results strengthen previous findings suggesting that scarcer water resources are a conflict-contributing factor. However, even though a curse cannot be confirmed at this point, strong improvements in the development of indicators are needed before ruling out the possibility of a water curse...|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} divided into two main parts. The first part is focused on the {{properties}} of phosphorous and nitrogen that are most important in the eutrophication process, while {{the second part of the}} thesis presents the specifics of the <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> Jezero in Smarjeske Toplice. The first part of the thesis describes the problem of pollution with nutrients in the aquatic environment - eutrophication. Eutrophication is caused by excessive nutrient concentrations in the aquatic environment, which is limited by the lack of one of the two presented nutrients in this thesis. The thesis is focused on two nutrients, namely phosphorus and nitrogen. The thesis presents the basic properties for phosphorus and nitrogen and the circulation of these two nutrients in the environment. It also lists and describes the main anthropogenic activities, which contribute the largest share of these nutrients into the environment. In its next chapters the thesis presents the chemical and biological processes, removal of phosphorus and nitrogen, and some common technologies developed for the purpose of disposing these two nutrients from water. Then it presents some assumptions and actions for reducing the impact of these two nutrients on the environment in the future. The first part of the thesis is concluded with the use of nutrients in Slovenian agriculture in order to improve the productivity of its agricultural land.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a unified computing technology for {{all stages of}} landslide-type tsunami. The computing technology {{is based on the}} numerical solution of the Navier – Stokes equations for multiphase flows. The method of numerical solution of the Navier – Stokes equations uses a fully implicit algorithm. This algorithm removes stiff restrictions on the time steps and allows simulating a tsunami propagation in arbitrarily <b>large</b> <b>water</b> <b>basins.</b> The basic sampling equation formulas, coefficient types as well as the basic steps of the computational procedure are presented. The landslide is modeled by a single phase with its density and viscosity, which is separated by the interface from water and air phases. A parallel algorithm of the method implementation based on an algebraic multigrid method is proposed for the effective usage of the method to calculate the tsunami in <b>large</b> <b>water</b> areas. The multigrid method of implementation is based on algorithms of global level and cascading collection. These algorithms do not impose restrictions on the scale parallelization and allow the use of the proposed technology in petaflop class systems. It shows the possibility ofsimulating all the stages of the landslide-type tsunamis: generation, propagation and runup. The verification of the method is carried out by using the tests provided by the experimental data. The mechanism of bathymetric data accounting and the technology of constructing three-dimensional grid models are described. The results of the comparison with the non-linear dispersion theory are presented for the historical tsunami that resulted from a volcanic eruption on the island of Montserrat, the Caribbean. The results of this comparison are in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Subject of {{the paper}} is the {{presentation}} of the potential of use of multispectral remote sensing data for the investigation of <b>water</b> quality of <b>large</b> <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> on the example of the monitoring of the Baltic Sea with MERIS data. An interpretation and inversion scheme for optical satellite data over water has been developed to be used in several national and international projects to monitor different aspects of water quality. The resulting "Principal Component Interpretation" algorithm allows an optimized estimation of water constituents: chlorophyll pigment concentrations, suspended matter concentration and yellow substance concentration as well as optical properties of the water body. From these are derived secondary parameters like water transparency. In the frame of the international ESA MARCOAST project this interpretation scheme was developed for a regular (daily) monitoring of the Baltic Sea. Results are uniformly mapped images and concentration maps of the Baltic Sea area from which are additionally derived weekly, monthly and seasonal means. The Principal Component Interpretation belongs to the class of model based multivariate interpretation schemes and is closely related to Neural Networks techniques, but bases on a completely different training procedure. It makes use of an optimal information redistribution between the spectral bands and relates them to the water constituents. This kind of estimation allows an simultaneous estimation of expected global estimation accuracy. The regular monitoring is accompanied by the survey of in-situ ground measurements, which can be used for validation. The paper will present the bio-optical model which is used for the interpretation of Baltic Sea water. The basics of the interpretation scheme basing on principal component analysis will be explained and results of the monitoring of different products will be discussed on examples of a time series in 2008, showing the development and movement of algae blooms, together with other constituents. The obtained results are critically compared with available ground measurement...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of biomarkers for reconstructing past environmental conditions {{depends on their}} source specificity {{as well as on}} their preservation during transport and in the sediment. Bottom water oxygen contents are thought {{to be one of the}} major controlling factors of organic matter preservation. We investigate the selective degradation/preservation of several lipid biomarkers by comparing their abundance and radiocarbon concentration in surface sediments from oxygen-replete and oxygen-depleted sites in the Black Sea. The world’s <b>largest</b> surface <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> with both well-oxygenated and permanently oxygen-deficient conditions below the pycnocline (100 - 200 m) provides ideal conditions for this study. A radiocarbon (14 C) -based study of several organic compounds by Wakeham (unpublished data) revealed a wide range in 14 C concentration of marine phytoplankton-derived biomarkers in surface sediments from one site in the SW Black Sea reflecting post-depositional processes. In previous studies it was found that sea surface temperatures (SST) determined from the ratio of di- and tri-unsaturated alkenones (UK’ 37) are unrealistically low and show strong spatial (own data) and down-core variations (Xu et al. 2001) questioning the applicability of UK’ 37 in the Black Sea.

In these circumstances, to discuss the sustainable development may seem inappropriate; therefore, be taken in steps such as halting {{the decline of the}} economy and industry; the industry revitalization and growth; the development that takes place according to the criteria of sustainable development. To this must be stopped declining industrial output and output stabilization. It must be found and made the necessary conditions leading to full use of the potential of the country, to stimulate those structural changes that allow the country to fall market economy conditions. To address the main criteria for sustainable industrial development since this time of economic downturn may be several reasons such as the need to respect the provisions of international treaties to which Romania is a party. Some of them may be mentioned as: putting control of Earth's greenhouse effect, preventing damage to the ozone layer (waiving of manufacture and use of chlorofluorocarbons), transboundary pollution and protection of <b>large</b> <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> of the border. Each of these treaties contain provisions that are converging concept of sustainable development. The entry into the European Union implies aligning Romanian legislation in the EU The EU Council adopted a common position, relative to a plan of action intended to give a new political impetus of the fifth environmental action program. The main objective of this program is the promotion of sustainable development throughout the economy. The Action Plan identifies priority areas for action, namely: • better integration of environmental issues into policies as those of agriculture, transport, energy, industry and tourism; • further development of basic tools acting on the market and, in particular, horizontal instruments; • improving enforcement and implementation of environmental legislation; • raising awareness to protect the environment. The following are considered priority themes: control climate change; protecting the ozone layer; acid rain control, improving air quality; water resource management; waste management; protection against noise; nature protection and biodiversity. The privatization of industrial enterprises is also an opportunity to assess damage to these facilities, the environment and solutions to remedy such damage. Existing law requires, these actions pave the ground for a sustainable approach to development industry. The works market organic products or opportunities for are: agricultural and food products labeled organic; technologies and processes used to "clean" manufacturing; Products with low pollutant potential (low sulfur fuels, unleaded petrol cars with catalytic emission control, etc.); use of renewable energy and raw materials to form the corresponding markets. ...|$|R
40|$|Four {{previously}} unknown hypogean species of cyclopoid copepods {{were collected in}} cenotes and wells of the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. Diacyclops chakan sp. n. and D. puuc sp. n. differ from their congeners in combining 3 -segmented swimming legs, 11 -segmented antennules, and legs 1 - 4 endopodite segment 2 all with 2 setae. Species of Diacyclops rarely occur in tropical regions, and the Diacyclops described here are only {{the second and third}} species recorded from Mexico. The benthic D. puuc was found in the large underground reservoir of a cenote. Diacyclops chakan was encountered in such <b>large</b> open subterranean <b>water</b> <b>basins,</b> but more frequently and abundantly in wells. The two Mesocyclops species, M. chaci sp. n. and M. yutsil sp. n., most closely resemble their epigean benthic congener M. reidae Petkovski, but are modified by loss of some body ornament and attenuation of swimming legs and mouthparts. Mesocyclops chaci sp. n. occupies crevicular spaces (wells and small caverns). The second species, M. yutsil sp. n., with more pronounced attenuation of legs, has a planktonic life in <b>large</b> subterranean <b>water</b> volumes. The extremely attenuated appendages of both species distinguish them from all other Mesocyclops, and resemble those of the hypogean Kieferiella delamarei Lescher-Moutoué. These three species are considered as a species-flock which have radiated as specialists within a highly dynamic geomorphological environment...|$|R
