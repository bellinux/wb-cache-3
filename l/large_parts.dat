Zahir had turned the port city of Acre into a major regional power, partly fueled by his monopolization of the cotton and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre's regional dominance was further elevated under Zahir's successor Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar at the expense of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Large</b> <b>parts</b> of Zimbabwe {{were once}} covered by forests with {{abundant}} wildlife. Deforestation and poaching {{has reduced the}} amount of wildlife. Woodland degradation and deforestation, due to population growth, urban expansion and lack of fuel, are major concerns and have led to erosion and land degradation which diminish the amount of fertile soil. Local farmers have also been criticised by environmentalists for burning off vegetation to heat their tobacco barns.|$|E

5|$|The pre-Islamic Middle East was {{dominated}} by the Byzantine and Sassanian empires. The Roman-Persian Wars between the two had devastated the region, making the empires unpopular amongst local tribes. Furthermore, in the lands that would be conquered by Muslims many Christians (Nestorians, Monophysites, Jacobites and Copts) were disaffected from the Eastern Orthodox Church which deemed them heretics. Within a decade Muslims conquered Mesopotamia, Byzantine Syria, Byzantine Egypt, <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> of Persia, and established the Rashidun Caliphate.|$|E

40|$|We study {{two types}} of {{probability}} measures {{on the set of}} integer partitions of $n$ with at most $m$ parts. The first one chooses the random partition with a chance related to its <b>largest</b> <b>part</b> only. We then obtain the limiting distributions of all of the parts together and that of the <b>largest</b> <b>part</b> as $n$ tends to infinity while $m$ is fixed or tends to infinity. In particular, if $m$ goes to infinity not fast enough, the <b>largest</b> <b>part</b> satisfies the central limit theorem. The second measure is very general. It includes the Dirichlet distribution and the uniform distribution as special cases. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the parts jointly and that of the <b>largest</b> <b>part</b> by taking limit of $n$ and $m$ {{in the same manner as}} that in the first probability measure.
