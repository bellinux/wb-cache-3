40|$|In many {{advanced}} industrial fields, such as aeronautics and transportation, {{the study}} of impact resistance of the composite materials is very important. In particular, {{it could be useful}} to appreciate the damage induced in the material by an accidental impact, during the manufacturing process, the in service or the maintenance. In literature, many papers are available on this topic, in particular different reinforcements (such as glass fibre, carbon fibre and aramid fibre) and resin typology (such as epoxy and polyester) were studied. In this paper, the impact behavior of laminates made of glass fibre and phenolic resin was studied. The laminates were produced by means of autoclave forming process. Two different samples typologies were studied: orthotropic and quasi-isotropic. For both the above mentioned samples, different thickness (3, 4, 5, and 6 mm) were analyzed. Impact test were carried out using a semi-spherical indenter and a “weight drop” CEAST testing machine with full penetration and variable energy. The aim of the variable energy test is to correlate the dimension of the indentation <b>left</b> by the <b>indenter</b> on the surface with the impact energy. The indentation measurement is very important and in this work the measurements were carried out using a LEICA DCM 3 confocal microscope. A dedicated software allows to measure all the dimensions of interest. The tests with variable energy confirmed that the samples with different stratification show similar behaviors respect to the energy adsorption. On the other hand, about the external damage, the quasi-isotropic specimens showed an higher resistance than the orthotropic ones in all the different thicknesses tested. Furthermore, the results obtained allow to say that the indentation depth varies {{as a function of the}} impact energy following a logarithmic law, contrarily to what happen for laminates made by epoxy resin where an exponential law was observed...|$|R
40|$|Metallic {{coated steel}} sheet {{can be very}} {{aggressive}} towards copper alloy, resistance spot welding electrodes. These steels accelerate the electrode degradation process far in excess of that experienced when spot welding uncoated steels through an accumulation of the coating around the electrode tips, changing the geometry of the electrode and through an erosion process on the tip face {{in contact with the}} workpiece. The rate of electrode degradation is closely linked to the chemistry of the metallic coating and can be very severe, particularly when welding steels with coatings high in aluminium or when inappropriate welding conditions are used. High volume welding industries employing these steels are n o w faced with the need to more frequently monitor weld quality and electrode condition in order to sustain structural integrity of their product. Being very time consuming, the traditional shop floor, destructive techniques for assessing weld quality, are no longer considered appropriate. This has provided the impetus for researchers to develop new, non-destructive techniques which are easily implemented and which remove operator judgement as to the condition of electrodes. This work examines the feasibility of such a technique. The Adept (Advanced Grey Scale) Vision System has been assessed as to its ability to view and accurately measure the impression left by spot welding electrodes on the surface of a zinc-iron rich metallic coated steel during a simulated production run and to equate these measurements to weld nugget size and tensile shear strength. The results of this work appear promising in that the vision system has identified electrode wear patterns and has successfully related these to both nugget size and tensile shear strength, these being paramount to engineers charged with design. The accuracy of the vision system has been thoroughly checked through the use of other techniques including carbon paper impression measurements of the degrading tips, profilometry on the impression <b>left</b> by the <b>indenting</b> electrode and ultrasonic and X-ray measurement of the weld prior to final destructive peel testing to measure actual weld nugget size. All techniques indicate trends that support the vision systems future capability as a new, non-destructive weld quality monitoring system...|$|R
40|$|Background: In the dog, {{neoplasms}} of the {{lacrimal gland}} are rare. Lacrimal cysts were also reported. Computed tomography (CT) scan findings of these lacrimal gland abnormalities {{have not been}} described in dogs. Purpose: The present report describes clinical and CT features of a lacrimal gland tumor in a dog. Methods: A 3, 5 year old female intact Leonberger with a good general health status was presented with a progressive swelling {{at the level of}} the supero-temporal area of the left upper eyelid and of the bulbar conjunctiva since 3 weeks. Ocular examination revealed a slight enophthalmia and a ventronasal strabismus, the presence of a firm mass in the upper eyelid which was anteriorly well circumscribed and extending posteriorly between the globe and the orbital ligament. Findings: A CT scan pre- and post- contrast studies of the head were performed. A 3 cm hypoattenuating (+/- 10 HU) ovoid mass was observed dorsolateral to the <b>indented</b> <b>left</b> globe. This mass was well circumscribed by an unevenly thick irregular soft tissue- attenuating wall (50 HU), which was strongly contrast-enhanced (150 HU) and measured about 2 to 10 mm in thickness. The left globe was displaced caudoventromedially. No adjacent bone lesion, or foreign body was observed. No normal left lacrimal gland was observed. These findings were suggestive of an abscess or an orbital tumor with a necrotic/cystic center; a lacrimal cyst was considered less likely because of the unevenness and the thickness of the wall. Complete surgical ablation was done by a modified lateral orbitotomy. Histopathology revealed a mixed benign tumor of the lacrimal gland and a lymphocytic necrotic adenitis. Six months postoperatively no recurrence is noted and the tear production is 15 mm/min. Conclusion: The lacrimal gland is located dorsolateral to the globe and produces tears. In human medicine, a wide range of lacrimal gland pathologies were described and assessed by computed imaging techniques. Pleomorphic adenomas (mixed benign tumor) could reveal irregular bone erosion and could undergo malignant transformation. In dogs, lacrimal cysts were described as thin walled structures. 4 Only few articles reported lacrimal gland tumor. To the authors knowledge, CT findings of a lacrimal gland tumor have not been described previously. In conclusion, lacrimal gland tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of a firm ovoid cystic/necrotic mass dorsolateral to the orbit. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the development of an inverse analysis of the depth-sensing indentation test based on a multi-objective function (MOF) optimisation model. The input data of this model are the load-displacement (P-h) curve extracted from the indentation instrument and the surface topography of the residual imprint <b>left</b> by the <b>indenter</b> after the removal of the load measured via atomic force microscopy (AFM). A Swift’s power law material model was considered to represent the indented material and thus, the output of the optimisation are the Young’s modulus (E), yield stress (σy) and strain-hardening exponent (n). The optimisation problem was designed to minimise the error between both the experimental and predicted P-h curves, i. e. the first objective, and pile-up profiles, i. e. the second objective, with the aim of addressing the non-uniqueness of the inverse analysis of indentation. A 3 D FE model of the depth-sensing indentation test has been developed in ABAQUS in order to generate the predicted data from a set of trial material properties, i. e. E, σy and n. The generation of FE input files (pre-processor) and extraction of FE output files (post-processor) have been automated through MATLAB and Python subroutines. The optimisation problem was solved by the trust-region reflective algorithm available in the MATLAB Optimization ToolboxTM and thus, concisely, the model minimised the experimental and predicted data by modifying iteratively the material properties, starting from the initial guess properties specified by the user, until convergence was reached. Upon convergence, the material properties were said to describe the elastic-plastic behaviour of the indented material. A comprehensive experimental programme was carried out in order to investigate the load dependency of the indentation response of three different materials, including a steel (CrMoV), a titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) and a high-purity copper (C 110). The study of the topography of the residual imprints provided {{a better understanding of the}} effects of the microstructural arrangement on the plastic displacement of material beneath the indenter. The extent of piling-up was observed to be very sensitive to the difference in material properties from grain to grain and the crystallographic plane of the indented grain. Furthermore, it was concluded that the structural arrangement of the indented material may also contribute to the asymmetry observed in the pile-up profiles, in particular in materials with large grains relative to the projected area of the indenter, e. g. C 110. This piece of work therefore, is suggested as a guideline for the use of height measurements of the residual imprint in the characterisation of the plastic behaviour of materials. The multi-objective function optimisation model is proved to be a step forward to the characterisation of the near-surface properties as, in contrast to the P-h curve, the residual imprint is strongly linked to the plastic behaviour of the indented material. Therefore, the physics governing the indentation problem were better represented. Therefore, the optimised P-h curve provided a very good fit to the corresponding experimental curve, to within an error of less than 2. 4...|$|R
