40|$|We {{study the}} level lines of GFF {{starting}} from interior points. We {{show that the}} level line of GFF starting from an interior point {{turns out to be}} a sequence of <b>level</b> <b>loops.</b> The sequence of <b>level</b> <b>loops</b> satisfies "target-independent" property. All sequences of <b>level</b> <b>loops</b> starting from interior points give a tree-structure of the plane. We also introduce the continuum exploration process of GFF starting from interior. The continuum exploration process of whole-plane GFF satisfies "reversibility". Comment: 41 pages, 14 figures.

40|$|An {{analytical}} design {{method for}} a conventional proportional-integral (PI) control-ler is {{developed for the}} optimal control of the liquid <b>level</b> <b>loop</b> in order to explicitly handle important control specifications. The constrained optimal control problem for the liquid <b>level</b> <b>loop</b> is formulated and converted into an unconstrained optimization problem to find an optimal PI controller tuning rule. The proposed PI controller minimizes {{the rate of change}} of the outlet flow and the deviation of the level subject to two important constraints in the level loop: the maximum allowable rate of change in the outlet flow rate and the maximum allowable deviation of the level. The simulation results show that the constrained optimal control of the liquid <b>level</b> <b>loop</b> can be successfully implemented using a simple PI controller with the proposed design method...|$|R

40|$|It is very {{important}} to find some nontrivial relations for color-ordered amplitudes at <b>loop</b> <b>levels.</b> In the last several years, a pure group-theoretic method has been proposed to study <b>loop</b> <b>level</b> relations for color-ordered amplitudes in gauge theories. In this paper, we apply the same method to study the linear relations for <b>loop</b> <b>level</b> four point color-ordered gluon amplitudes in gauge theory with group and find that there are 1, 6, 10, 13, 16 constraint relations at L= 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 <b>loop</b> <b>level.</b> It is expected that there are more group-theoretic constraints for high <b>loop</b> <b>levels.</b> The constraint relations should be derived order by order in gauge theories. This is unlike the case, where there are only four constraints for higher (L≥ 2) loop amplitudes. Comment: mistakes corrected, conclusion change...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{renormalization}} group equations for the Standard Model {{at the one}} and two <b>loops</b> <b>levels.</b> At one <b>loop</b> <b>level</b> we find an exact constant of evolution built from {{the product of the}} quark masses and the gauge couplings g 1 and g 3 of the U(1) and SU(3) groups. For leptons at one <b>loop</b> <b>level</b> we find that the ratio of the charged lepton mass and the power of g 1 varies ≃ 4 × 10 − 5 in the whole energy range. At the two <b>loop</b> <b>level</b> we have found two relations between the quark masses and the gauge couplings that vary ≃ 4 % and ≃ 1 %, respectively. For leptons at the two <b>loop</b> <b>level</b> we have derived a relation between the charged lepton mass and the gauge couplings g 1 and g 2 that varies ≃ 0. 1 %. This analysis significantly simplifies the picture of the renormalization group evolution of the Standard Model and establishes new important relations between its parameters. There is also included a discussion of the gauge invariance of our relations and its possible relation to the reduction of couplings method...|$|R
30|$|We {{believe that}} our {{framework}} better explains and guides {{the development of a}} fully adaptive ITSs. Indeed, having only two loops, the outer loop and the inner loop, is too coarse and obscures important instructional layers that need be addressed explicitly by adopting appropriate instructional strategies as illustrated above for the solution-step and hint <b>level</b> <b>loops.</b> In fact, Rus et al. (2013) suggested there should be even more loops (than the three in our framework) accounted for in a fully independent, comphrehensive, longitudinal education technology that monitors and tutors students {{over a long period of}} time spanning many topics and grade levels. According to Rus and colleagues, there should be a loop for each of the following instructional levels: curriculum/standards level, the course level, the lesson level, the activity level, the solution level, and the hint <b>level.</b> Each such <b>loop</b> will have to be guided by different instructional strategies that are appropriate for the corresponding instructional level. For instance, strategies for sequencing instructional tasks across many instructional sessions in a course, which should be informed by principles of interleaving and spacing (Pavlik and Anderson 2008) that have been shown to promote long-term learning, should be implemented as part of the course <b>level</b> <b>loop</b> in the Rus and colleague’s taxonomy of instructional levels. For simplicity and to fairly describe the current state of the DeepTutor system, we only limit our discussion to the three-loop framework mentioned above which addresses the activity (or task) instructional level, solution-step instructional level, and hint instructional <b>level.</b> These three <b>loops</b> are essential in order to understand micro- and macro-adaptivity in DeepTutor which in turn are important to understand the context of our presented here.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{two-dimensional}} statistical physics models leads naturally {{to the analysis}} of various conformally invariant mathematical objects, such as the Gaussian free field, the Schramm-Loewner evolution, and the conformal loop ensemble. Just as Brownian motion is a scaling limit of discrete random walks, these objects serve as universal scaling limits of functions or paths associated with the underlying discrete models. We establish a new convergence result for percolation, a well-studied discrete model. We also study random sets of points surrounded by exceptional numbers of conformal loop ensemble loops and establish the existence of a random generalized function describing the nesting of the conformal loop ensemble. Using this framework, we study the relationship between Gaussian free field extrema and nesting extrema of the ensemble of Gaussian free field <b>level</b> <b>loops.</b> Finally, we describe a coupling between the set of all Gaussian free field <b>level</b> <b>loops</b> and a conformal loop ensemble growth process introduced by Werner and Wu. We prove that the dynamics are determined by the conformal loop ensemble in this coupling, and we use this result to construct a conformally invariant metric space. by Samuel Stewart Watson.
