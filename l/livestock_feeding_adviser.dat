40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{explains}} {{the status of}} <b>livestock</b> <b>feed</b> resources and market situations in Welmera and Dendi weredas of West Shoa Zone, Ethiopia. The objective of the survey {{was to assess the}} potentials and constraints of feed resources and related marketing practices and suggest appropriate intervention options to overcome the constraints. Majority (76 %) of the interviewed farmers have faced shortage of <b>livestock</b> <b>feeds.</b> The diminishing trend of grazing land from time to time, roughage, concentrate feeds are the factors contributing to feed shortage. Moreover, the increasing trend in selling price of hay and concentrate feeds aggravates more to the problem. This situation is limiting livestock productiv in the highlands of Ethiopia. Under this condition, farmers purchase feeds to both local and crossbred animals. The purchased feeds include: hay, straw, grazing area, oilseed cakes, wheat bran and wet grass. Among these, the grazing area purchased takes the highest (52 %) proportion. Farmers and traders participate in purchasing of <b>livestock</b> <b>feeds.</b> The proportion of farmers that purchase feeds is higher (30 %) than that of the traders (1 %). To alleviate the problems related to shortage of <b>livestock</b> <b>feeds</b> and decline of animal production an...|$|R

The sample was taken through purposive sampling towards experts and stakeholders of corn agribusiness. The data obtained were analyzed by the analyzing instrument of spend criteria technique and analytical hierarchy process. The results of this research show that 1) in general, the condition of corn agribusiness in Indonesia is poor, 2) Factors that influence the efficacy of corn agribusiness development are technology, infrastructure, human resources and capital. 3) Strategy shall be developed by the entrepreneurs (particularly PT.
