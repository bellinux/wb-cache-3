By 1989, he developed a prototype system that would later allow [...] "plug-and-play" [...] integration of automation systems and clinical analyzers for managing and testing of patient specimens. His approach was to build an automated transport system which would allow various testing processes using commercial, off-the-shelf testing and collection systems. He didn't design the instruments, but sought an automated system to manage the testing processes, leading to increased efficiency, improved reporting and lower <b>laboratory</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

This results in unexpected and unwanted postoperative respiratory muscle paralysis {{requiring mechanical ventilation}} in such patients. The duration of such paralysis may last from hours to days. To identify susceptible individuals, the dibucaine number can be determined so as to alert the care team to the risks of use of butyrylcholinesterase substrates. Pestel et al. measured 24,830 Dibucaine numbers {{over a period of}} 4 years in a European trial. Numbers below 30 (atypical homozygous) were found in 0.07% (n=18) giving an incidence of 1:1,400. Dibucaine numbers from 30 to 70 (atypical heterozygous) were found in 1.23% ( [...] n=306). On the basis of identification of the Dibucaine numbers we could avoid the administration of succinylcholine resulting in a cost reduction of 12,280 Euro offset against the total <b>laboratory</b> <b>costs</b> amounting to 10,470 Euro.|$|E

40|$|During certain {{months of}} the year, viral {{respiratory}} infections lead to {{a dramatic increase in}} pediatric emergency room visits and hospital admissions. Rapid identification of the infectious organism results in timely treatment and reductions in hospital cost and length of stay. Before the introduction of molecular testing to the virology laboratory, diagnosis relied on the standard methods of immunofluorescence and culture. These tests can be labor-intensive and costly. Recent studies have demonstrated the higher sensitivity, faster turnaround, and broader diagnostic spectrum provided by multiplexed RT-PCR assays. Data comparing the <b>laboratory</b> <b>cost</b> and labor efficiency of the tests are lacking. To address this issue, we chose to implement the principles of operational workflow analysis using lean methodology to critically evaluate the potential advantages of a multiplexed RT-PCR assay both in terms of workflow and cost effectiveness. Our results indicated that the implementation of the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) resulted in a standardized workflow with decreased requirements in <b>laboratory</b> <b>cost</b> as well as improvement in efficiency. In summary, we demonstrate that, in our laboratory, the Luminex xTAG RVP is more operationally streamlined and cost-effective than standard viral direct fluorescent antibody and culture.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{clinical}} significance of discontinuing routine antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) isolates from blood cultures was investigated. Prospectively, AST was requested primarily {{for patients with}} serious underlying illnesses. Antibiotic use did not change significantly when AST was not performed routinely. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>cost</b> savings were 75 % if AST was not performed, but more specimens were submitted from these patients. Oxacillin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci from blood cultures has remained > 70 % since implementation of this protocol, while annual vancomycin utilisation has shown only small, incremental increases.

40|$|Cape Town, South Africa. To {{model the}} effects of {{increased}} case finding and triage strategies on <b>laboratory</b> <b>costs</b> per tuberculosis (TB) case diagnosed. We used a validated operational model and published laboratory cost data. We modelled the effect of varying the proportion with TB among presumptive cases and Xpert cartridge price reductions on cost per TB case and per additional TB case diagnosed in the Xpert-based vs. smear/culture-based algorithms. In our current scenario (18. 3 % with TB among presumptive cases), the proportion of cases diagnosed increased by 8. 7 % (16. 7 % vs. 15. 0 %), and the cost per case diagnosed increased by 142 % (US$ 121 vs. US$ 50). The cost per additional case diagnosed was US$ 986. This would increase to US$ 1619 if the proportion with TB among presumptive cases was 10. 6 %. At 25. 9 - 30. 8 % of TB prevalence among presumptive cases and a 50 % reduction in Xpert cartridge price, the cost per TB case diagnosed would range from US$ 50 to US$ 59 (comparable to the US$ 48. 77 found in routine practice with smear/culture). The operational model illustrates the effect of increased case finding on <b>laboratory</b> <b>costs</b> per TB case diagnosed. Unless triage strategies are identified, the approach will not be sustainable, even if Xpert cartridge prices are reduced...|$|E
40|$|Background: As {{more and}} more {{patients}} meeting the criteria for osteoporosis are referred to a fracture and osteoporosis outpatient clinic (FO clinic), the <b>laboratory</b> <b>costs</b> to screen for secondary osteoporosis also increases. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the value of screening on underlying diseases at an FO clinic by obtaining a standard set of laboratory tests. Methods: We included all 541 patients ≥ 50 years with a fracture referred to our FO clinic, during the period January 2005 to January 2007. The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and expressed as a T score. A standard set of laboratory tests was obtained to screen on underlying diseases. Results: Laboratory results were as often abnormal in patients with a normal BMD compared to patients with a low BMD. Underlying diseases were infrequently diagnosed. However, the prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in men was quite high, up to 18. 2 %. The costs to diagnose 1 patient with an underlying disease did vary between € 92 and € 972 depending on the group of patients described. Conclusion: Screening all patients, referred to an FO clinic, for underlying diseases by obtaining a standard set of laboratory tests is probably not useful since laboratory tests are as often abnormal in patients with a normal BMD compared to patients with a low BMD. Moreover, the prevalence of secondary osteoporosis is low, while <b>laboratory</b> <b>costs</b> are substantial...|$|E

METHODS: This was a non-randomised intervention study in the Internal Medicine wards at Steve Biko Academic Hospital, Pretoria, in which the intervention was <b>laboratory</b> test <b>costs</b> provided to clinicians as a pocket-sized brochure. The intervention period was the winter months of May - August 2008 and the pre-intervention period was the same months of the preceding year. In the two 4 -month periods (2007 and 2008), {{the number of days}} in hospital and the laboratory tests ordered were computed for each patient admitted. For the intervention and control groups, pre- and postintervention cost and days in hospital were estimated. RESULTS: The mean cost per patient admitted in the intervention group decreased from R 2 864. 09 to R 2 097. 47 – a 27 % reduction. The mean cost per day in the intervention group as a whole also decreased, from R 442. 90 to R 284. 14 – a 36 % reduction. CONCLUSION: Displaying the charges for diagnostic tests on the laboratory request form may significantly reduce both the number and cost of tests ordered, and by doing so bring about considerable in-hospital cost savings.
