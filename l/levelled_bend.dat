30|$|If we adopt {{deep level}} HTL {{material}} of MoOx, anode Schottky junction {{will be changed}} to ohmic contact, and the extraction probability will be enhanced [10]. However, existing energy <b>level</b> <b>bending</b> in transport channel will deteriorate charge extraction. To avoid such extraction efficiency drop caused by improper junction and charge capturing and scattering in potential dip region, {{we can make the}} whole device as thin as the width of cathode depletion layer. In such a case, depletion layer electric field will superimpose potential gradient on the trapped holes and thus, inducing vacuum <b>level</b> <b>bending</b> will be reduced, which is “Schottky barrier lowering” that makes easy escape of captured charge carriers and makes smooth transport of free charges [21]. Taking into account that thin (~[*] 70  nm) OPV show near 100 % internal quantum efficiency, Schottky barrier lowering is an effective way to circumvent the drawbacks [6]. However, for thick OPV cells to extract charge carriers efficiently, it is firstly required that trapped holes in HOMO level of OPV cells should be equal to minimize the potential dip in transport channel.|$|R

40|$|The semiconductor-electrode {{interface}} impacts {{the function}} {{and the performance}} of (opto) electronic devices. For printed organic electronics the electrode surface is not atomically clean leading to weakly interacting interfaces. As a result, solution-processed organic ultrathin films on electrodes typically form islands due to dewetting. It has therefore been utterly difficult to achieve homogenous ultrathin conjugated polymer films. This has made the investigation of the correct energetics of the conjugated polymer-electrode interface impossible. Also, this has hampered the development of devices including ultrathin conjugated polymer layers. Here, LangmuirShafer-manufactured homogenous mono-and multilayers of semiconducting polymers on metal electrodes are reported and the energy <b>level</b> <b>bending</b> using photoelectron spectroscopy is tracked. The amorphous films display an abrupt energy <b>level</b> <b>bending</b> that does not extend beyond the first monolayer. These findings provide new insights of the energetics of the polymer-electrode interface and opens up for new high-performing devices based on ultrathin semiconducting polymers.

40|$|Landau <b>level</b> <b>bending</b> {{near the}} edge of graphene, {{described}} using 2 d Dirac equation, provides a microscopic framework for understanding the quantum Hall Effect (QHE) in this material. We review properties of the QHE edge states in graphene, with emphasis on the novel phenomena that arise due to Dirac character of electronic states. A method of mapping out the dispersion of the edge states using scanning tunneling probes is proposed. The Zeeman splitting of Landau levels is shown to create a particularly interesting situation around the Dirac point, where it gives rise to counter-circulating modes with opposite spin. These chiral spin modes lead to a rich variety of spin transport phenomena, including spin Hall effect, spin filtering and injection, and electric detection of spin current. The estimated Zeeman spin gap, enhanced by exchange, of a few hundred Kelvin, makes graphene an attractive system for spintronics. Comparison to recent transport measurements near nu= 0 is presented.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of {{printed circuit boards}} under dynamic loads is a key issue in the handheld electronic products industry.

40|$|Applying a first-principles {{computational}} approach, we have systematically {{analyzed the}} effects of [2 + 2] cycloaddition oligomerization of fullerene C 60 chains on their junction electronic and charge transport properties. For hypothetical infinite C 60 chains, we first establish that the polymerization can in principle increase conductance by several orders of magnitude due to the strong orbital hybridizations and band formation. On the other hand, our simulations of the constant-height scanning tunneling microscope (STM) configuration shows that, {{in agreement with the}} recent experimental conclusion, the junction electronic structure and device characteristics are virtually unaffected by the C 60 chain oligomerization. We further predict that the switching characteristics including even the ON/OFF-state assignment will sensitively depend on the substrate metal species due to the Fermi-level pinning at the substrate-side contact and the subsequent energy <b>level</b> <b>bending</b> toward the STM tip-side contact. We finally demonstrate that a force-feedbacked nanoelectromechanical approach in which both of the C 60 -electrode distances are kept at short distances before and after switching operations can achieve a metal-independent and significantly improved switching performance due to the Fermi-level pinning in both contacts and the large intrinsic conductance switching capacity of the C 60 chain oligomerization.

40|$|Organic {{electronics}} {{based on}} organic semiconductors offer tremendous advantages compared to traditional inorganic counterparts such as low temperature processing, light weight, low manufacturing cost, high throughput and mechanical flexibility. Many key electronic processes in organic electronic devices, e. g. charge injection/extraction, charge recombination and exciton dissociation, occur at interfaces, significantly controlling performance and function. Understanding/modeling the interface energetics at organic-electrode/organic-organic heterojunctions {{is one of}} the crucial issues for organic electronic technologies to provide a route for improving device efficiency, which is the aim of the research presented in this thesis. Integer charge transfer (ICT) states pre-existed in the dark and created as a consequence of Fermi level equilibrium at donor-acceptor interface {{have a profound effect on}} open circuit voltage in organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaics. ICT state formation causes vacuum level misalignment that yields a roughly constant effective donor ionization potential to acceptor electron affinity energy difference at the donor-acceptor interface, even though there is a large variation in electron affinity for the fullerene series. The large variation in open circuit voltage for the corresponding device series instead is found to be a consequence of trap-assisted recombination via integer charge transfer states. Based on the results, novel design rules for optimizing open circuit voltage and performance of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells are proposed. Doping and insertion of interlayer are two established methods for enhancing charge injection/extraction properties at organic-electrode interface. By studying the energy level alignment behavior at low to intermediate doping levels for molecule-doped conjugated polymer/electrode interfaces, we deduce that two combined processes govern the interface energetics: (i) equilibration of the Fermi level due to oxidation (or reduction) of polymer sites at the interface as per the ICT model and (ii) a double dipole step induced by image charge from the dopant-polymer charge transfer complex that causes a shift of the work function. Such behavior is expected to hold in general for low to intermediate level doped organic semiconductor systems. The unified model is further extended to be suitable for conjugated electrolyte/electrode  interfaces, revealing the design rules for achieving the smallest charge injection/extraction barrier for both thin tunneling and thick charge transporting conjugated electrolyte interlayers. To probe into the energy level spatial extension at interfaces, we employ the original approach of building and characterizing multilayers composed of a well-defined number of polymer monolayers with the Langmuir-Shäfer method to control polymer film uniformity and thicknesses, avoiding the problems associated with spin-coating ultrathin films. The disordered/amorphous films feature smaller, and in fact negligible, energy <b>level</b> <b>bending</b> compared to the more well-ordered films, in contradiction with existing models. It is found that that energy <b>level</b> <b>bending</b> depends on the ICT state distribution rather than the density of states of the neutral polymer chains in relation to the Fermi energy, thus taking into account the Coulomb energy associated with charging the polymer chain and transferring a charge across the interface. Based on this work, a general model for energy <b>level</b> <b>bending</b> in absence of significant doping of conjugated polymer films is proposed. Organic semiconductors are sensitive to ambient atmosphere that can influence the energetics. The degradation effects of common PCBM film induced by oxygen and water are found to be completely different. Upon exposure to oxygen, the work function is down-shifted by ~ 0. 15 eV compared to the ICT curve of the pristine PCBM film, originating from the weak interaction between the fullerene part of PCBM and oxygen, and this can be reversed by thermal treatment in vacuum. The down-shift in energetics will cause a loss in open circuit voltage at electrode interface, but aids free charge generation at donor-acceptor interface. Upon exposure to water, there is irreversible extensive broadening and bleaching of the valence electronic structure features as well as a substantial decrease of work function and ionization potential, severely degrading the transport properties. Overall, the research results in this thesis thus give a deeper understanding of interface phenomena in organic electronics, especially regard to organic solar cells, aimed to further improve the device operation efficiency and lifetime...|$|R

The effect of time varying mesh stiffness, time varying frictional torque on the gear teeth, lateral and torsional flexibility of the shafts and flexibility of the bearings {{were included in the}} model. The model was developed by using the Lagrangian method, and it was applied to study the effect of three design variables on the vibration and stress levels on the gears. The first design variable, module, had little effect on the vibration levels but a higher module resulted to higher <b>bending</b> stress <b>levels.</b> The second design variable, pressure angle, had little effect on the vibration levels, but had a strong effect on the stress levels on the pinion of a high reduction ratio gear pair. A pressure angle of 25 o resulted to lower stress levels for a pinion with 14 teeth than a pressure angle of 20 o. The third design variable, contact ratio, had a very strong effect on both the vibration <b>levels</b> and <b>bending</b> stress <b>levels.</b> Increasing the contact ratio to 2. 0 reduced both the vibration <b>levels</b> and <b>bending</b> stress <b>levels</b> significantly. For the gear train design used in this study, a module of 2. 5 and contact ratio of 2. 0 for the various meshes was found to yield the best combination of low vibration <b>levels</b> and low <b>bending</b> stresses.
