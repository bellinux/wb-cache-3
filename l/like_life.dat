After his win in the 1960 elections he was flooded with calls and letters urging that Zeus be continued. This was a concentrated {{effort on the part of}} the Army, who fought back against similar Air Force tactics. They also deliberately spread the Zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as much political and industrial support as possible, while taking out advertisements in major mass-market magazines <b>like</b> <b>Life</b> and The Saturday Evening Post promoting the system.|$|E
5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor <b>like</b> <b>LIFE,</b> using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E
25|$|Karel Čapek {{was born}} in 1890 in the Bohemian {{mountain}} village of Malé Svatoňovice. However, six months after his birth, the Čapek family moved to their own house in Úpice. His father, Antonín Čapek, worked as a doctor at the local textile factory. Antonín was a very energetic person; apart from {{his work as a}} doctor, he also co-funded the local museum and {{was a member of the}} town council. Despite opposing his father's materialist and positivist views, Karel Čapek loved and admired his father, later calling him “a good example... of the generation of national awakeners.” Karel's mother, Božena Čapková, was a homemaker. Unlike her husband she did not <b>like</b> <b>life</b> in the country and she suffered from long-term depressions. Despite that, she assiduously collected and recorded local folklore, such as legends, songs or stories. Karel was the youngest of three siblings. He would maintain an especially close relationship with his brother Josef, a highly successful painter, living and working with him throughout his adult life. His sister, Helena, was a talented pianist, but later become a writer and published several memoirs about Karel and Josef.|$|E

500|$|Hepburn's {{relentless}} {{energy and}} enthusiasm for life {{is often cited}} in biographies, while a headstrong independence became key to her celebrity status. This self-assuredness meant she could be controlling and difficult; her friend Garson Kanin likened her to a schoolmistress, and she was famously blunt and outspoken. Katharine Houghton commented that her aunt could be [...] "maddeningly self-righteous and bossy". Hepburn confessed to being, especially early in life, [...] "a me me me person". She saw herself as having a happy nature, reasoning [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>life</b> and I've been so lucky, why shouldn't I be happy?" [...] A.

500|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{a high level of}} realism, Letts and Dicks hired a {{technical}} advisor, James Burke, a science correspondent who was well known to television viewers thanks to his work as anchorman on the television coverage of the Apollo moon landings and for presenting science series such as Tomorrow's World and The Burke Special. Burke decided that 2003 would be a realistic date for bases to have been established on the Moon, telling the Radio Times that [...] "Men won't go back to the Moon until the 1990s. Neither the Russians nor the Americans have any plans at present and no-one else can afford it. [...] As for the base itself – it should look exactly as it would if they built one tomorrow.

2500|$|Outside of the Garip and [...] "Second New" [...] {{movements}} also, {{a number}} of significant poets have flourished, such as Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca (1914–2008), who wrote poems dealing with fundamental concepts <b>like</b> <b>life,</b> death, God, time, and the cosmos; Behçet Necatigil (1916–1979), whose somewhat allegorical poems explore the significance of middle-class daily life; Can Yücel (1926–1999), who—in addition to his own highly colloquial and varied poetry—was also a translator into Turkish of a variety of world literature; and İsmet Özel (1944– [...] ), whose early poetry was highly leftist but whose poetry since the 1970s has shown a strong mystical and even Islamist influence.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the country}} grew wealthier in the 1950s, {{a form of}} neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and other film genres, such as sword-and-sandal {{followed}} as spaghetti westerns, were popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Actresses such as Sophia Loren, Giulietta Masina and Gina Lollobrigida achieved international stardom during this period. Erotic Italian thrillers, or giallos, produced by directors such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento in the 1970s, also influenced the horror genre worldwide. In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies <b>like</b> <b>Life</b> Is Beautiful directed by Roberto Benigni, [...] with Massimo Troisi and The Great Beauty directed by Paolo Sorrentino.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{types of}} subject were recognised: banketje were [...] "banquet pieces", ontbijtjes simpler [...] "breakfast pieces".

[...] Flowers wilt and food decays, and silver is of no use to the soul.

2500|$|... "Will I?", a song {{which takes}} place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was {{inspired}} by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much <b>like</b> <b>Life</b> Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or have died from AIDS.|$|E
2500|$|In Du [...] "Cubisme" [...] Gleizes and Metzinger wrote: [...] "If we {{wished to}} relate {{the space of the}} [...] {{painters}} to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems." [...] Cubism itself, then, was not based on any geometrical theory, but corresponded better to non-Euclidean geometry than classical or Euclidean geometry. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective; an understanding that would include and integrate the fourth dimension. Cubism, with its new geometry, its dynamism and multiple view-point perspective, not only represented a departure from Euclid's model, but it achieved, according to Gleizes and Metzinger, a better representation of the real world: one that was mobile and changing in time. For Gleizes, Cubism represented a [...] "normal evolution of an art that was mobile <b>like</b> <b>life</b> itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rebecca Blaine Harding {{was born}} at the David Bradford House in Washington, Pennsylvania, on June 24, 1831, to Richard and Rachel Leet Wilson Harding. Rebecca was the eldest of five children. After an {{unsuccessful}} entrepreneurial spell in Big Spring, Alabama, the family finally settled in Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1836. At the time, Wheeling was developing into a productive factory town, the concentration of which was iron and steel mills. The environment of Rebecca's home town would later affect the themes and vision of her fiction, <b>like</b> <b>Life</b> in the Iron Mills. [...] Despite Wheeling's productivity and its accessible location along the Ohio River, Davis described her childhood as having belonged to a slower, simpler time, writing in her 1904 autobiography Bits of Gossip that, [...] "there were no railways in it, no automobiles or trolleys, no telegraphs, no sky-scraping houses. Not a single man in the country was the possessor of huge accumulations of money".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the fifth}} anniversary of Columbine, the FBI's lead Columbine {{investigator}} and several psychiatrists published their conclusions in a news article. These conclusions stated Harris was a clinical psychopath, whereas Klebold was depressive. Harris had been the mastermind, having a messianic-level superiority complex, and had hoped to demonstrate his superiority to the world, whereas Klebold, having repeatedly documented his desires to commit suicide in his diaries—particularly due to his lack of success with women—had primarily participated in the massacre as a means to simply end his life. Dr. Dwayne Fuselier, the supervisor in charge of the Columbine investigation, would later remark: [...] "I believe Eric went to the school to kill and didn't care if he died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn't care if others died as well." [...] Klebold's final remark in the videotape he and Harris made shortly before their attack upon Columbine High School is a resigned statement made as he glances away from the camera: [...] "Just know I'm going to a better place. I didn't <b>like</b> <b>life</b> too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since then many {{world famous}} authors have praised War and Peace as a {{masterpiece}} of the world literature. Gustave Flaubert expressed his delight in a January 1880 letter to Turgenev, writing: [...] "This is the first class work! What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed." [...] Later John Galsworthy called War and Peace [...] "the best novel that had ever been written". Romain Rolland, remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote: [...] "this work, <b>like</b> <b>life</b> itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement." [...] Thomas Mann thought War and Peace to be [...] "the greatest ever war novel {{in the history of}} literature." [...] Ernest Hemingway confessed that it was from Tolstoy that he'd been taking lessons on how to [...] "write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way." [...] "I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did", Hemingway asserted in his 1955 Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Time anthology.|$|E
