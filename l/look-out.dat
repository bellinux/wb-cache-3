5|$|Structure 57 {{is a large}} mound at the {{southern}} limit of the Central Group with an excellent view across the coastal plain. The structure {{was built in the}} Late Preclassic and underwent a second phase of construction in the Late Classic. It may have served as a <b>look-out</b> point.|$|E
5|$|As a fleet flagship, her {{complement}} was 115 {{officers and}} 1,860 men in 1947. Air conditioning was provided {{for many of}} the ship's control spaces, and asbestos insulation was provided on exposed areas of the ship's sides, decks and bulkheads. Steam heating was provided for her armament, instruments, <b>look-out</b> positions and other equipment to make Vanguard suitable for operations in the Arctic. An Action Information Centre was fitted below the main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around Vanguard.|$|E
5|$|When the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, {{looks for}} relief from his weary watch, {{he turns his}} eyes toward the Southern Cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight {{approaches}} the Southern Cross begins to bend, and the whirling worlds change their places, and with starry finger-points the Almighty marks the passage of Time upon the dial of the universe; and though no bell may beat the glad tidings, the <b>look-out</b> knows that the midnight is passingthat relief and rest are close at hand.|$|E

5|$|On 9 March 1908, a point cleaner working {{near the}} station was injured. A Board of Trade enquiry criticised the lack of <b>look-outs</b> for railway workers.|$|R
5|$|During the Second World War {{the castle}} {{was used by}} the Allied military. The Great Tower was used as a <b>look-out</b> post and United States' forces used the castle gardens for {{baseball}} games. Castle House fell empty after the death of its final lessee, James Geenway; the house was then briefly requisitioned in 1942 by the Royal Air Force and turned into flats for key war workers, causing extensive damage later estimated at £2,000. In 1956, Castle House was de-requisitioned and sold by the Earl of Powis the following year to Ludlow Borough Council for £4,000, which rented out the flats.|$|E
5|$|Inside, {{the main}} room is a conference room {{on the main floor}} that {{includes}} a large projection system {{that can be used for}} remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. A painting by John Fery is displayed over the fireplace, which the fireplace was part of the original structure in the conference room. The remainder of the interior of the building has a modern look with glass-enclosed offices surrounding an open common area. Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum of Art is displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the <b>look-out</b> basement. A small meeting room is located above a small portion of the main floor.|$|E
5|$|Prem (Salman Khan) {{lost his}} parents {{at an early}} age. He lives with his elder brother Rajesh (Mohnish Bahl) and uncle Kailashnath (Alok Nath). Rajesh manages the family {{business}} and his family is on the <b>look-out</b> for a suitable bride for him. Professor Siddharth Chaudhary (Anupam Kher) and Mrs. Chaudhary (Reema Lagoo) have two daughters, Pooja (Renuka Shahane) and Nisha (Madhuri Dixit). The Chaudhary couple and Kailashnath are old friends who meet again after several years. They arrange a marriage between Rajesh and Pooja. From their first meeting, Nisha and Prem start bickering lightheartedly with each other, and the fun and mischief continues throughout Pooja and Rajesh's wedding.|$|E

50|$|Hobgoblins: Several small, excitable spirits who {{are only}} {{seen in the}} {{courtyard}} where the ghosts convene. They serve as <b>look-outs</b> when the ghost community have invited Caroline, Otto, and Iakob for the final celebration.|$|R
60|$|The {{morning of}} the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was {{relieved}} by crowds of the daylight <b>look-outs,</b> who dotted every mast and almost every spar.|$|R
5|$|The {{military}} camp held 160 men and {{was later}} used to hold prisoners of war. Italian, but not German, prisoners were allowed to attend dances at the anti-aircraft camp at nearby Stiffkey. Near {{the end of the}} war, the camp was used to house East European refugees, and it was finally pulled down in 1948. Many of the wartime buildings were destroyed by the Royal Engineers in 1955, but the generator house was taken over by the coastguard service as an observation post. It was acquired by the NWT in 1983, and the upper part was used as a <b>look-out,</b> while the larger lower section became a beach café. The building was overwhelmed by shingle in a storm in 2008 and subsequently demolished.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk Coast Path, {{an ancient}} long {{distance}} footpath, cuts {{across the south}} eastern corner of the reserve along the sea wall between the farmland and the salt marshes, and further west at Holme-next-the-Sea the trail joins Peddars Way. The tip of Blakeney Point {{can be reached by}} walking up the shingle spit from the car park at Cley Beach, or by boats from the quay at Morston. The boat gives good views of the seal colonies and avoids the long walk over a difficult surface. The National Trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay, and a visitor centre on the Point. The centre was formerly a lifeboat station and is open in the summer months. Halfway House, or the Watch House, is a building 2.4km (1.5mi) from Cley Beach car park. Originally built in the 19th century as a <b>look-out</b> for smugglers, it was used in succession as a coast guard station, by the Girl Guides, and as a holiday let.|$|E
5|$|Royal Artillery {{military}} fortifications {{were established}} at Cley beach, including two 6-inch (15.24cm) guns, five buildings, two pillboxes, a minefield, and concrete anti-tank blocks. A spigot mortar emplacement and an Allan Williams Turret machine gun emplacement were sited {{closer to the}} village. One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012. The military camp accommodated 160 men and was later used to hold prisoners of war. Near {{the end of the}} war, the camp was used to house East European refugees, and was finally pulled down in 1948.

60|$|Now it {{was that}} all hands of us were ordered forward to act as <b>look-outs,</b> and the pungy danced along in the darkness, as if rejoicing at her escape from a peril that had well-nigh proved her ending.|$|R
60|$|Fired by the cry {{which seemed}} {{simultaneously}} {{taken up by}} the three <b>look-outs,</b> the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch, some feet above the other <b>look-outs,</b> Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.|$|R

60|$|The gentlemen, who merely volunteered an {{occasional}} drag, cheerfully took the <b>look-outs,</b> and {{as there were}} plenty of fire-arms, though not much powder, little apprehension was entertained of the Arabs. As was expected, the night passed away tranquilly, and every one arose with the dawn refreshed and strengthened.|$|R
50|$|The park is {{open from}} 8:00 to 17:00 Tuesday to Sunday.There {{is a small}} {{entrance}} fee.There are two official trails with waterfalls, one trail through the cerrado vegetation, and three <b>look-outs</b> with {{a panoramic view of}} the city of Caldas Novas. All the trails are easy, but may be hot.|$|R
25|$|War with France resumed in May 1803. Captain Leigh {{received}} a letter of marque on 3 August 1803. He sailed from Portsmouth on 28 August, bound for St Helena and the Cape. Georgiana would then spend some three years at St Helena, serving primarily as a <b>look-out</b> vessel and guard-ship.|$|E
25|$|News of Troy's fall quickly {{reached the}} Achaean kingdoms through {{a system of}} fire relays. A fire signal lit at Troy was seen at Lemnos, relayed to Athos, then to the <b>look-out</b> towers of Macistus on Euboea, across the Euripus {{straight}} to Messapion, then to Mount Cithaeron, Mount Aegiplanctus and finally to Mount Arachneus where it was seen {{by the people of}} Mycenae, including Clytaemnestra.|$|E
25|$|Evidence exists {{of earlier}} {{occupation}} {{in the area}} at Castle Hill (not {{to be confused with}} Castle Hill, Huddersfield), a small hilltop above Birdsedge that contains defensive works which might have been either a Roman or tribal <b>look-out</b> station. Some local historians claim that the ancient ridge above the Sovereign, known as 'Burnt Cumberworth' contained ancient furrows before they were destroyed by quarrying in the late 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Nanny Town was an {{excellent}} location for a stronghold, as it overlooked Stony River via a 900-foot ridge, making a surprise attack by the British virtually impossible. The Maroon organized <b>look-outs</b> for such an attack, as well as designated warriors, who could be summoned {{by the sound of}} a horn called an abeng.|$|R
60|$|Although {{the utmost}} {{vigilance}} was observed among {{the officers and}} <b>look-outs,</b> {{during the rest of}} the night, there occurred nothing to arouse the crew from their usual recumbent attitudes between the guns. The wind continued light but steady, the sea smooth, and the heavens clouded, as during the first hours of darkness.|$|R

25|$|On April 8, A major gunbattle broke out, {{damaging}} {{the facade of}} the church and causing a fire. Both sides claimed the shooting had begun from the other side. The IDF claimed that the Palestinians had opened fire from a bell tower, wounding two Israel Border Police gendarmes in a nearby rooftop <b>look-out.</b> An IDF officer said the Israeli troops returned fire, and threw a smoke grenade, which started a blaze in a second-floor meeting hall overlooking the Basilica of St Catherine, adjacent to the Church of the Nativity. One Palestinian militant was killed.|$|E
25|$|After her {{delivery}} {{from the}} Free City of Danzig Sanct Svithun was employed on the passenger/freight line between Bergen in Western Norway and various ports in Northern Norway. In 1931 she was rebuilt with a {{refrigerated cargo hold}} to enable her to transport fresh fish from the fisheries in Northern Norway. During the rebuild she was also fitted with wireless telegraphy. She was a popular ship amongst her passengers, with a large superstructure and a spacious promenade deck with a <b>look-out</b> salon in the bow area. Sanct Svithun was {{also known as a}} superbly seaworthy vessel.|$|E
25|$|As in the army, the ship's centuria {{was headed}} by a centurion with an optio as his deputy, while a beneficiarius {{supervised}} a small administrative staff. Among the crew were also a number of principales (junior officers) and immunes (specialists exempt from certain duties). Some of these positions, mostly administrative, were identical {{to those of the}} army auxiliaries, while some (mostly of Greek provenance) were peculiar to the fleet. An inscription from the island of Cos, dated to the First Mithridatic War, provides us with a list of a ship's officers, the nautae: the gubernator (kybernētēs in Greek) was the helmsman or pilot, the celeusta (keleustēs in Greek) supervised the rowers, a proreta (prōreus in Greek) was the <b>look-out</b> stationed at the bow, a pentacontarchos was apparently a junior officer, and an iatros (Lat. medicus), the ship's doctor.|$|E
60|$|The rate {{at which}} the little craft was flying before a fresh gale, in {{perfectly}} smooth water, soon put our sealers in a better condition to form closer estimates of their chances. The <b>look-outs</b> aloft, one of whom was Hazard, the first officer, sent down on deck constant reports of what they could see.|$|R
60|$|The two {{singularly}} consorted listeners in {{the tower}} stood gazing, at their respective <b>look-outs,</b> {{so long as the}} smallest glimpse of the flowing robe of her light form was to be seen and then they turned to each other, and stood confronted, the eyes of each endeavouring to read the expression of his neighbour's countenance.|$|R
60|$|There {{were great}} rejoicings among the Saxons, on whose side but twenty-three had been killed. A solemn mass was held, at which all {{save a few}} <b>look-outs</b> on the walls attended, and thanks {{returned}} to God for the repulse of the pagans; then the garrison full of confidence awaited the next attack of the enemy.|$|R
