25|$|Sociolinguistics is {{the study}} of how {{language}} is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of <b>language</b> <b>variation</b> and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and ideolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research on both style and discourse in language, and also study the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.|$|E

Differences between any two given dialects can be quantified {{in terms of the}} presence or absence of specific units at each level of the language. To cite a single example of <b>language</b> <b>variation</b> along the geographical parameter, it may be noted that there are as many as seventy seven different expressions employed by the Ezhavas and spread over various geographical points just to refer to a single item, namely, the flower bunch of coconut. 'Kola' is the expression attested in most of the panchayats in the Palakkad, Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram districts of Kerala, whereas 'kolachil' occurs most predominantly in Kannur and Kochi and 'klannil' in Alappuzha and Kollam. 'Kozhinnul' and 'kulannilu' are the forms most common in Trissur Idukki and Kottayam respectively. In addition to these forms most widely spread among the areas specified above, there are dozens of other forms such as 'kotumpu' (Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram), 'katirpu' (Kottayam), krali (Pathanamthitta), pattachi, gnannil (Kollam), 'pochata' (Palakkad) etc. referring to the same item.|$|E

2500|$|Semiotics is {{the study}} of sign {{processes}} (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of [...] "sign" [...] to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are literary studies, discourse analysis, text linguistics, and philosophy of language. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, {{is the study}} of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, Edward Sapir and Ferdinand De Saussure's structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including Jacques Derrida, Mikhail Bakhtin, Michel Foucault, and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century. These theories emphasize the role of <b>language</b> <b>variation,</b> and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.|$|E

(2) what non-standard English patterns does Huckleberry Finn use in talking with other characters? And (3) In what context does he uses each variations in talking with other characters?

The data analysis brought forward the following findings: (a) the <b>language</b> <b>variations</b> that are used by Huckleberry Finn are standard English and non standard English, (b) the non standard English forms that are used by Huckleberry Finn are (1) the absence of agreement between adjective quantifier and nouns, (2) the absence of the third person marker in verbs showing present tense, (3) the absence of agreement between nouns and verbs (plural or singular), (4) the absence of copula be, (5) the use of double negation, (6) the use of ‘aint’ or ‘haint’, and (7) consonant cluster simplication (c) Huckleberry Finn uses the standard English when he is talking with (1) close or intimate friends, (2) Jim, an uneducated nigger who comes from a lower social class, and (3) strangers, (4) in informal settings, and (5) about casual or daily topics. While he uses non-standard English when he is talking with (1) close or intimate friends, (2) Jim, an uneducated nigger who comes from a lower social class, (3) Judge Thatcher, an educated person who comes from a higher social class, and (4) strangers, (5) in formal and informal settings, and (6) about casual or daily topics.

40|$|We explore {{probabilistic}} lexico-syntactic pattern matching, {{also known}} as soft pattern matching, in a definitional question answering system. Most current systems use regular expression based hard matching patterns to identify definition sentences. Such rigid surface matching often fares poorly when faced with <b>language</b> <b>variations.</b> We propose two soft matching models to address this problem: one based on bigrams {{and the other on}} Profile Hidden Markov Model (PHMM). Both models provide a theoretically sound method to model pattern matching as a probabilistic process that generates token sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the models on definition sentence retrieval for definitional question answering. We show that both models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art manually constructed hard matching patterns on recent TREC data. A critical difference between the two models is that the PHMM has a more complex topology. We experimentally show that the PHMM can handle <b>language</b> <b>variations</b> more effectively but requires more training data to converge. While we evaluate soft pattern models only on definitional question answering, we believe that both models are generic and can be extended to other areas where lexico-syntactic pattern matching can be applied...|$|R
