30|$|As Dougherty (2016) details, cycling {{through the}} abductive <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> <b>for</b> {{institutional}} problem setting and solving begins with imagining a configuration of interdependencies among relational elements and rules {{that can produce}} the specific kind of collaboration needed to address a certain problem. For example, if the problem is developing improved models for the early evaluation of drug possibilities, participants would include large firms, research hospitals, regulators, and small firms. Leaders need to be appointed, perhaps a coalition with clear rules for IP, participation, and task forces to oversee particular processes. Evaluating digs into the hypothesized interdependencies to examine assumptions {{and figure out what}} works and not, and why and how. Over time, experiments generate insights into how to develop and deploy metrics about how well the collaboration is doing, update and revise the problem, arrive at joint decisions and agreements, and foster ongoing participation. Some collaborative commons will be relatively short-lived, while others may continue for years.|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{capability}} theory {{asserts that}} the learning capabilities of construction organisations influence {{the degree to which}} value-for-money (VfM) is achieved on collaborative projects. However, there has been little study conducted to verify this relationship. The evidence is particularly limited within the empirical context of infrastructure delivery in Australia. Primarily drawing on the theoretical perspectives of the resource-based view of the firm (e. g. Barney 1991), dynamic capabilities (e. g. Helfat et al. 2007), absorptive capacity (e. g. Lane et al. 2006) and knowledge management (e. g. Nonaka 1994), this paper conceptualises learning capability as a knowledge-based dynamic capability. Learning capability builds on the micro-foundations of high-order <b>learning</b> <b>routines,</b> which are deliberately developed by construction organisations for managing collaborative projects. Based on this conceptualisation of learning capability, an exploratory case study was conducted. The study investigated the operational and higher-order <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> adopted by a project alliance team to successfully achieve VfM. The case study demonstrated that the <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> of the alliance project were developed and modified by the continual joint learning activities of participant organisations. Project-level <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> were found to significantly influence the development of organisational-level <b>learning</b> <b>routines.</b> In turn, the learning outcomes generated from the alliance project appeared to significantly influence the development of project management routines and contractual arrangements applied by the participant organisations in subsequent collaborative projects. The case study findings imply that the higher-order <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> that underpin the learning capability of construction organisations have the potential to influence the VfM achieved on both current and future collaborative projects...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to results of {{doctoral}} research work at University of Bochum as applied to the radar transmission experiment CONSERT of the ESA cometary mission Rosetta. This research aims at achieving the limits of optimum spatial (and temporal) resolution for radar remote sensing by implementation of covariance informations concerned with error-balanced control as well as coherence of wave propagation effects through random composite media involved (based on Joel Franklin's approach of extended stochastic inversion). As a consequence the well- known inherent numerical instabilities of remote sensing are significantly reduced in a robust way by increasing the weight of main diagonal elements of the resulting composite matrix to be inverted with respect to off-diagonal elements following synergy relations as {{to the principle of}} correlation receiver in wireless telecommunications. It is shown that the enhancement of resolution for remote sensing holds for an integral and differential equation approach of inversion as well. In addition to that the paper presents a discussion on how the efficiency of inversion for radar data gets achieved by an overall optimization of inversion due to a novel neuro-genetic approach. Such kind of approach is in synergy with the priority research program "Organic Computing" of DFG / German Research Organization. vThis Neuro-Genetic Optimization (NGO) turns out, firstly, to take into account more detailed physical informations supporting further improved resolution such as the process of accretion for cometary nucleus, wave propagation effects from rough surfaces, ground clutter, nonlinear focusing, etc. as well as, secondly, to accelerate the computing process of inversion in a really significantly enhanced and fast way, e. g., enabling online-control of autonomous processes such as detection of unknown objects, navigation, etc. The paper describes in some detail how this neuro-genetic approach of optimization is incorporated into the procedure of data inversion by combining inverted artificial neural networks of adequately chosen topology and <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> <b>for</b> short access times with the concept of genetic algorithms enabling to achieve a multi-dimensional global optimum subject to a properly constructed and problem-oriented target function, ensemble selection rules, etc. Finally the paper discusses how the power of realistic simulation of the structures of the interior of a cometary nucleus can be improved by applying Benoit Mandelbrot's concept of fractal structures. It is shown how the fractal volumetric modelling of the nucleus of a comet can be accomplished by finite 3 D elements of flexibility (serving topography and morphology as well) such as of tetrahedron shape with specific scaling factors of self similarity and a Maxwellian type of distribution function. By applying the widely accepted fBm-concept of fractal Brownian motion basically each of the corresponding Hurst exponents 0 (rough) < H < 1 (smooth) can be derived for the multi-fractal depth (and terrain) profiles of the equivalent dielectric constant per tomographic angular orbital segment of intersection by transmissive radar ray paths with the nucleus of the comet.

40|$|Definitions of apraxia {{of speech}} (AOS) {{describe}} this motor speech disorder as an impairment {{in planning and}} programming of speech movements (Duffy, 2005). The exact underlying mechanism of the impairment, however, is not well understood. The purpose of this investigation is to specify the speech planning impairment in AOS by testing two specific hypotheses framed in the DIVA model (Guenther, 2006). Previous accounts of AOS Several studies have investigated the underlying nature of AOS. Whiteside and Varley (1998) claim that the problem involves accessing learned motor programs while Aichert and Ziegler (2004) argue that the programs themselves are damaged. However, both accounts {{were based on a}} model that does not address speech motor control in detail (Levelt et al., 1999). Moreover, both accounts were based on data from off-line tasks and did not examine speech motor planning in real time. Speech motor planning in the DIVA model The present research was based on the DIVA model (Guenther, 2006), which is a model of speech motor control. In this model, speech motor planning takes place primarily in the acoustic domain. It begins by activating a speech sound map (SSM) cell, which can be activated by production or perception of a speech sound. The SSM cell, in turn, activates its auditory target region (i. e., expected feedback for the motor program to be executed) and the feedforward commands constituting the <b>learned</b> motor <b>routines</b> <b>for</b> speech sounds. Because hearing words can activate the SSM and interfere with the speech planning process we designed an experiment based on the auditory interference paradigm to examine two hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 (Damaged Program Hypothesis; DPH) states that the problem in AOS is damaged speech motor programs, i. e. damage to the feedforward commands from the SSM. Hypothesis 2 (Retrieval Hypothesis; RH) states that the problem is in activating or retrieving otherwise intact motor programs. In this case, there is difficulty activating or selecting the intended SSM cell...|$|R

This paper develops a holistic model of the overall process, by integrating knowledge-oriented, routine-oriented, and social/contextual perspectives, each of which plays a necessary role in explaining essential aspects. One feature of the transfer of organizational learning systems entailed arranging local access to, and opportunity to replicate, various types of knowledge repository that contained corporate values as well as technical expertise. A second feature involved the development of collective <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> through dynamic interplay with evolving, locally based, knowledge repositories.

On performance night, Lauren decides to quit, but to do the performance first, but refusing to the lift, which Danny understands, and doesn't mind. However, after Claudine's constant digs, Lauren changes her mind, and does the lift, but passes out shortly after. Lauren soon catches the eye of Britannia High's school heartthrob, Danny Miller, who eventually gets up the courage to ask Lauren out after the pair kiss, which only fuels Claudine's hatred of Lauren more, as she also has a thing for Danny. When Lola gets into the papers, and has a dramatic change of attitude, Claudine and Lauren become closer, with the pair doing each other's make up, showing text, and sharing magazines. This, however, is short lived. When Claudine successfully breaks up Danny's and Lauren's three-month relationship by taking the card and rose Danny had left on Lauren's bed, causing her to think he forgot, Danny starts going out with Claudine.

Yet, there is {{debate about the}} pay-off of the IT revolution, and empirical evidence suggests that investments in IT do not guarantee enhanced performance. Drawing from accounting, marketing, management and information technology literature, this study uses structural equation modeling to assess {{the extent to which}} managerial use of IT is intertwined with control issues including <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> (internal and external), product quality, cost improvement, customer satisfaction and firm profitability. The conceptual framework builds on knowledge- and resource-based views and return on quality perspectives. The results indicate support for the theoretical framework. Extent of managerial IT use influences internal and external <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> that influence quality and cost improvement. Quality improvement significantly impacts customer satisfaction and cost improvement that significantly impact firm profitability. The non-hypothesized paths are not significant, indicating that <b>learning</b> <b>routines,</b> quality improvement, cost improvement and customer satisfaction are intervening variables between extent of managerial IT use and firm profitability.

Although previous studies indicated that governance directly influences performance, and that learning directly influences performance, {{there is little}} deductive evidence exploring the relationship between all three variables, especially {{at a high level}} of disaggregation. A conceptual model is developed based on the literature, which defines collaborative learning capability (CLC) as an absorptive capacity that construction organizations develop to explore, transform, and exploit knowledge through 18 specific <b>learning</b> <b>routines.</b> These routines influence formal and informal governance types and, ultimately, three different performance metrics for projects. This study is based on a survey of 320 experienced practitioners on Australian collaborative infrastructure projects in the construction sector.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} why structures of learning underpin the creation of competencies that allow firms to compete more successfully in dynamic markets. The paper seeks to challenge the idea that, in the absence of learning, capabilities are the main source of competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach – First, the paper discusses the relationships between competencies, learning, and dynamic markets. Second, a preliminary analysis is conducted of the <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> of 118 top sales managers. The results are compared with three different structures of learning, allowing conclusions to be drawn about learning in dynamic markets. Findings – The study illustrates that a number of dynamic <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> are not evident in the sales environments of dynamic markets. The findings suggest that firms are not well placed to renew routines from inside-out and to respond to market dynamics. The patterns of integration among individuals and groups, however, seem to be well represented, reflecting higher-level <b>learning</b> <b>routines.</b> Research limitations/implications – The empirical findings offered here are of a preliminary nature. Future researchers might usefully apply the typology of learning structures to examine in more detail the empirical links established. Studies might also examine organisational learning in a variety of industrial and consumer-based contexts.

The first abductive <b>learning</b> <b>routine</b> is using clues to imagine a configuration of interdependencies among strategic or institutional elements that might constitute a viable strategic value creating opportunity or governance structure. There are no architectures for radical products, strategies, or institutional arrangements, so researchers begin by imagining possible architectures. Not any hypothesis will do for complex challenges, because hypotheses about one cause leading to one effect will not work.

Persisting does not mean sticking to {{a course of action}} mindlessly. Rather, persisting means continually probing the forward development of a new product, new way to enable innovation, or value creating opportunity and learning about how to improve or redirect their emergence, including choosing to stop developing this opportunity. Cycling through abductive <b>learning</b> <b>routines</b> takes advantage of emergence when innovators imagine where they can go with what the system is learning, and they shape and redirect that learning with ongoing ideas of value creation. They implement imagined configurations of learning events to see how they might work, to consider what else seems to be going on, and to surface new possibilities.|$|R
