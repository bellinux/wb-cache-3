25|$|Two {{weeks later}} Sydney {{were up in}} Brisbane to face off in the second leg of the {{preliminary}} final. They had suffered a knock-back the day before they flew up with Marquee player Juninho ruled out {{with a knee injury}} that he picked up in training. Ruben Zadkovich was announced as his replacement. Sydney started the match well but with lots of poor decisions by referee Mark Shield including the sending off of Midfielder Robbie Middleby for a tackle, which did not even deserve a yellow. Queensland scored in the 14th minute through their Brazilian import Reinaldo and Sydney never looked <b>like</b> <b>coming</b> back after that. Referee Shield made another poor call when Sydney captain Tony Popović allegedly shoved Roar striker Tahj Minniecon in the penalty box, and Sasa Ognenovski converted the penalty past keeper Clint Bolton. Many Sydney fans were disgusted at the poor display shown by referee Mark Shield, as most games refereed under him {{have turned out to be}} fair challenges, and as a result the small Sydney group that had travelled across the border booed him off.|$|E

Her overall assessment was that [...] "although the programme makers undeniably made some compromises to draw in viewers, millions will have enjoyed the company of these seven, shared in their lives and learned a lesson in diversity.… They will now have an entry point to broadening their understanding of the rich and joyful diversity of gender experience, something which has always existed but of which they were previously unaware." ...|$|E
500|$|Longworth {{notes that}} the {{dramatic}} success of Out of Africa led to a backlash of critical opinion against Streep {{in the years that}} followed, especially as she was now demanding $4million a picture. Unlike other stars at the time such as Sylvester Stallone and Tom Cruise, Streep [...] "never seemed to play herself", and certain critics felt her technical finesse led people to literally see her acting. Her next films did not appeal to a wide audience; she co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the dramas Heartburn (1986) and Ironweed (1987), in which she sang onscreen {{for the first time since}} the television movie Secret Service (1977). In Evil Angels (1988), she played Lindy Chamberlain, an Australian woman who had been convicted of the murder of her infant daughter despite claiming that the baby had been taken by a dingo. Filmed in Australia, Streep won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, a Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Streep has said of perfecting the Australian accent in the film: [...] "I had to study a little bit for Australian because it's not dissimilar , so it's <b>like</b> <b>coming</b> from Italian to Spanish. You get a little mixed up". Vincent Canby of The New York Times referred to her performance as [...] "another stunning performance", played with [...] "the kind of virtuosity that seems to redefine the possibilities of screen acting".|$|E

500|$|The fourth-season premiere saw Leigh's first {{appearance}} {{as a main}} cast member. Leigh first appeared on the show {{during the last two}} episodes of the third season as Meredith's half-sister, Lexie. Following Washington's departure, it was reported that show's executives were planning on adding new cast members, such as Lexie. She was officially upgraded to a series' regular on July 11, 2007, for the fourth season. On casting Leigh as Lexie, Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes stated, [...] "We met with a lot of young actresses, but Chyler stood out. She had a quality that felt right and real to me. It felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting." [...] Leigh offered her insight on her first days working with the main cast of the series, [...] "It was <b>like</b> <b>coming</b> into somebody else's group or circle. It was a little daunting in the beginning. But I have had such a great time." [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come" [...] was the first episode in two years not to feature the character of Montgomery, due to her portrayer, Walsh, leaving the series in order to launch the Grey's Anatomy spin-off, medical drama Private Practice. However, the character continued to be prominent throughout the run of the series, appearing sporadically as a guest star in the following seasons. Also introduced in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come" [...] is the new generation of interns, all of whom were portrayed in co-star capacity, with the exception of Lexie.|$|E
500|$|The {{new owners}} of RKO made an initial effort {{to revive the}} studio, hiring veteran {{producer}} William Dozier to head production. A needed cash infusion was realized in 1954 when the 89 acre RKO Encino movie ranch was sold off {{to make way for}} a new tract home development. [...] During the first half of 1956, the production facilities were as busy as they had been in a half-decade. RKO Teleradio Pictures released Fritz Lang's final two American films, While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (both 1956), but years of mismanagement had driven away many directors, producers, and stars. Other films included Bundle of Joy, a remake of the Ginger Rogers-starring Bachelor Mother which was re-tooled as a vehicle for star couple Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. Rogers herself would make a film for the new RKO (The First Traveling Saleslady) and would later comment that [...] "coming back to RKO was <b>like</b> <b>coming</b> back to a picnic you've been on last week, and pick up the bones all around and see what the ants have taken from the lunch that you left." [...] The studio was also saddled with the last of the inflated B movies such as Pearl of the South Pacific (1955) and The Conqueror (1956) that enchanted Hughes. The latter, starring John Wayne, was the biggest hit produced at the studio during the decade, but its $4.5 million in North American rentals did not come close to covering its $6 million cost.|$|E

Recorded and mixed by Gad at Kite Music Studios in Los Angeles, Lewis provided all of the vocals for [...] "Thunder" [...] and Gad performed all of the instrumentation and programming. The track's audio was mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound studios in New York City, with assistance from Randy Merrill. For the acoustic version of [...] "Thunder", Lewis' additional vocals were recorded by Adam Lunn at Wendy House Studios in London. On [...] 30 June 2015, Lewis released a three-minute teaser video with snippets of the title track, [...] "Ladders, and [...] "Power".

[...] In an interview for Next Magazine, Lewis further elucidated upon the songs meaning: [...] "It was <b>like</b> <b>coming</b> from a place where you’ve been through a hard situation that has really made you reflect or look deep inside {{to figure out what it}} is that you want to do next," [...] said Lewis.

500|$|The {{production}} {{moved to}} the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London. There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built. A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea {{was inspired by a}} technique used in Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968). Nolan said, [...] "I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario". The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40ft (12m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length grew to 100ft (30m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like [...] "a giant hamster wheel". Nolan said of the device, [...] "It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know how it was done, it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling in a wonderful way". Gordon-Levitt remembered, [...] "it was six-day weeks of just, <b>like,</b> <b>coming</b> home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to choose the right time to cross through them, and if you don't, you're going to fall." [...] On July15,2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story, including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.|$|E

The Return sold 71,000 copies in its first week to open at number eight on the Billboard 200 album chart, but sales declined rapidly after that, not approaching those of his earlier albums. [...] However, Studdard did have good success on the Urban Contemporary chart with [...] "Change Me" [...] (which reached number one) and its successor [...] "Make Ya Feel Beautiful". Studdard continued to tour, saying he would play a variety of music: [...] "Coming out to my show is <b>like</b> <b>coming</b> to my house. I'll play the songs I love. It's like a party.
