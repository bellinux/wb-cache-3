40|$|Natural {{processes}} tend to vary {{over time}} and space, {{as well as between}} species. The ecosystem services these natural processes provide are therefore also highly variable. It is often assumed that ecosystem services are provided linearly (unvaryingly, at a steady rate), but natural processes are characterized by thresholds and limiting functions. In this paper, we describe the variability observed in wave attenuation provided by marshes, mangroves, seagrasses, and coral reefs and therefore also in coastal protection. We calculate the economic consequences of assuming coastal protection to be linear. We suggest that, in order to refine ecosystem-based management practices, it is essential that natural variability and cumulative effects be considered in the valuation of ecosystem services.

40|$|The <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface</b> {{is a very}} {{attractive}} location for humans to settle. In the case of low lying, sedimentary coastlines {{this can be a}} risky location, as these shorelines are inherently dynamic in nature. Accelerating rates of relative sea level rise will increase coastal erosion, creating world-wide growing demands for coastal protection along urbanized shores. Central notion to this project is that the key to sustainably adapt to this situation {{is to be found in}} smart, pro-active sediment management using ‘building-with-nature’ (BwN) approaches, rather than in traditional reactive approaches involving expansion of static, hard coastal defense structures. However, an element that has been overlooked so far in current BwN approaches, is the interaction with the built environment at the <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface,</b> creating new conditions for both sediment dynamics and settlement. Leaving this interaction unnoticed, these elements may be affecting each other adversely.

In the southern portion of the study area different processes were verified. Upwelling processes caused by ocean dynamics typical of shelf break areas, eddies related to surface dynamics and regeneration processes confirmed by the increase of nutrients and the decrease of dissolved and saturation oxygen data were verified. High silicate concentrations in the surface waters were identified related to low salinities (minimum of 21. 22 in winter and 21. 96 in summer), confirming the importance of freshwater inputs in this region, especially in winter. Silicate concentration range showed values between 0. 00 and 83. 52 mu M during winter and from 0. 00 to 41. 16 mu M during summer. Phosphate concentrations worked as a secondary trace of terrestrial input and their values varied from 0. 00 to 3. 30 mu M in winter and from 0. 03 to 2. 26 mu M in summer; however, in shallow waters, phosphate indicated more clearly the fresh water influence. The most important information given by nitrate concentrations was the presence of water from SACW upwelling that represents a new source of nutrients for marine primary production. Nitrate maximum values reached 41. 96 M in winter and 33. 10 mu M in summer. At a depth similar to 800 m, high nitrate, phosphate and silicate concentrations were related to Malvinas Current Waters, Subantarctic Shallow Waters and Antarctic Atlantic Intermediate Waters (AAIW). Dissolved oxygen varied from 3. 41 to 7. 06 mL L- 1 in winter and from 2. 65 to 6. 85 mL L- 1 in summer. The percentage of dissolved oxygen saturation in the waters showed values between 48 % and 113 % in winter and from 46 % to 135 % in summer. The most important primary production was verified in the summer, and situations of undersaturation were mainly observed below 50 m depth and at some points near the coast. The anti-correlation between nutrients and dissolved oxygen which showed evident undersaturation also revealed important potential sites of remineralization processes.

Twenty-one sites in and around Monterey Bay were surveyed for evidence of microcystin toxin (2010 – 2011) at the <b>land–sea</b> <b>interface.</b> Following this initial survey four major watersheds in the Monterey Bay area were surveyed (2011 – 2013) for microcystin concentration, nutrients, alkalinity and water temperature to identify potential environmental factors correlated with the abundance of microcystin at the <b>land–sea</b> <b>interface.</b> During the first year microcystin was detected in 15 of 21 sites. Data from years two and three were analyzed by principal components analysis and mixed effects model. Results indicated that coastal nutrient loading (nitrate, phosphate silicate, ammonium, urea), were statistically significant predictors of the microcystin concentrations in the watersheds with clear evidence for seasonality at some sites. Microcystin was frequently at highest concentration in the autumn; however, at some locations high levels of toxin were measured during spring. Because this toxin {{has the ability to}} biomagnify and persist within food webs, elevated levels within the watershed may decrease potential for health and survival of wildlife and humans exposed to freshwater and marine waters.

40|$|Effective {{governance}} is {{urgently needed}} {{to reduce the}} existing pressures on coastal-marine resources due to human activities on both the land and sea. Yet effective governance across the <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface</b> remains elusive in theory and practice. The purpose of my doctoral work is to illuminate the elements of effective governance necessary to address sustainability challenges and ensure the wellbeing of communities situated {{at the margins of}} the land and sea. Specifically, I examined (1) the current state of knowledge regarding effective land-sea governance, (2) the contributions of network governance to improving capacities to address social and ecological processes across the <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface,</b> and (3) the conditions that foster transformations towards network governance in land-sea systems. My research was guided by an overall transdisciplinary framing, which allowed for the application of multiple strategies of inquiry – including systematic review and case studies – and a concurrent mixed methods approach to both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Data were collected through a systematic literature search and semi-structured interviews. The case studies were drawn from the Lesser Antilles – a region currently facing multiple sustainability challenges across the <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface</b> due to rapid land-use change, uncontrolled coastal development, and the cross-cutting threats associated with climate change. Systematic review of land-sea governance scholarship found that the main governance challenges associated with addressing land-sea interactions include determining boundaries, addressing cross-scale effects, and accessing appropriate scientific and local knowledge. Science-policy integration and functional fit are the two most referenced ingredients of governance effectiveness across the <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface.</b> However, supportive networks and both social and temporal fit were also cited relatively frequently as factors contributing to governance effectiveness. Despite the presence of a firm knowledge base, the review highlighted the need for improved conceptual richness and theory-building regarding governance across the <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface.</b> In comparative case studies from the southeast coast of Saint Lucia and the southwest coast of Dominica, I examined how network governance contributes to social-ecological fit, or the ability to address social-ecological processes in land-sea systems. I found that network governance has contributed to coordinating management of shared resources and interconnected ecological entities. However, its potential role in promoting co-governance and land-sea integration is yet to be fully realized due to the inertia of existing arrangements. The analysis demonstrates that a more thorough understanding of how network governance emerges in largely hierarchical governance systems is needed in order to improve governance capacities for addressing land-sea interactions in the region. I then examined the processes contributing to the emergence of network governance in four embedded case studies: Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (focus on Saint Vincent), Antigua and Barbuda (focus on Antigua), Grenada, and Saint Kitts and Nevis (focus on Saint Kitts). Drawing on network governance theory and the concept of governance transformations, I investigated the conditions that foster transformations towards network governance in land-sea systems. I found that participation on collaborative projects has been an essential ingredient in initiating transitions towards network governance. The case studies revealed that project participation was both necessary and sufficient for initiating a transition towards land-sea integration. However, project participation was necessary but insufficient to promote transitions towards co-governance, or state and non-state collaboration in network governance. Other important conditions for initiating transitions include the ratification of multilateral agreements, the presence of boundary-spanning organizations, and experience with extreme events (e. g., tropical storms). The leadership of central actors and core teams can help ensure that ongoing transitions proceed towards network governance. Also, it will be important to find innovative governance strategies or arrangements that can leverage and build the latent capacities found within communities to improve the emergence of co-governance. These strategies will likely challenge current conceptions of network governance in the region. A synthesis across these analyses yields three broader contributions. First, my research supports the proposition that network governance can be beneficial to address land-sea interactions. Network governance as a concept helps bridge the theory and knowledge garnered over the years in attempting to apply integrated and ecosystem-based management. It allows for an examination of how different patterns of collaboration and coordination can help match functional interactions in ecosystems and promote inclusive participation in governance. In practice, such an approach can help match governance simultaneously to both the social and ecological properties of land-sea systems – a challenge that has been pervasive. Second, my research identifies the limitations of network governance specifically in relation to preparing for, and responding to extreme events. The governance networks useful to address land-sea interactions may simply be too cumbersome or inefficient in the face of hurricanes and other storms. Improved integration between land-sea governance networks and the institutional arrangements in place to manage disasters could compensate for these limitations of network governance. Third, my research shows the need to consider multiple modes of governance – specifically, both hierarchical and networked modes – as coexisting, rather than in isolation. Governance networks and the hierarchical mode can be synergistic or antagonistic – either serving to support or undermine one another. My research challenges a view that network governance necessarily implies a hollowing of the state. Rather, I demonstrate how effective network governance is contingent upon appropriate guidance from the state. The state, in such instances, requires a clear mandate to participate in governance networks and ensure sustainable regulation. These contributions – although grounded in the Lesser Antilles context – are relevant for coastal areas and island nations throughout the globe...|$|E

40|$|The {{alteration}} {{of the global}} environment by human activities is so widespread that scientists argue we've entered a new geologic epoch known as the Anthropocene. This dissertation examines the impact of human activities on biogeochemical cycling at the <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface.</b> I focus primarily {{on the role of}} land use/land cover (LULC) and coastal nutrient enrichment on silicon (Si) cycling in New England rivers and salt marshes. On land, Si is taken up by vegetation, improving plant fitness and protecting plants from a variety of environmental stressors. In aquatic systems, diatoms, the dominant type of phytoplankton in coastal temperate waters, require Si to survive. My research demonstrates that LULC is an important driver of Si export to coastal systems, accounting for 40 - 70 % of the variability of riverine fluxes. Developed watersheds export significantly (p= 0. 03) more Si than their forested counterparts, which I hypothesize is due to less vegetated cover, a known Si sink, in developed watersheds. Building on this, I calculated the amount of Si fixed by land plants globally (84 Tmol yr- 1) and the percent (55 %) of global terrestrial net primary production that can be attributed to active Si-accumulating organisms. Next, I created the first complete salt marsh Si budget by quantifying tidal creek fluxes and net Si accumulation in a relatively undisturbed low-nutrient salt marsh. Further, comparing this Si accumulation to that of a high-nutrient marsh revealed that the high-nutrient marsh contained significantly (p< 0. 05) more Si within the sediments, roots, and porewater. Combining my original data from six New England salt marshes with published values, I quantify the mode of Si accumulation (rejective, passive, or active) by Spartina grasses and the environmental controls on such accumulation. Finally, using radionuclide tracers 137 Cs and 210 Pb, I calculated vertical accretion rates of five salt marshes and compared these values to historical measurements. I found that accretion rates have slowed and this deceleration is driven, in part, by a decrease in organic matter accumulation. Together, this dissertation improves our knowledge of Si cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and identifies previously unrecognized ways in which humans are perturbing biogeochemical cycles at the <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface...</b>|$|E

The natural resource implications of these livelihood decisions are potentially profound as they provide novel linkages and spatially-explicit feedbacks between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Our findings support the need for more scientific inquiry in understanding trans-ecosystem tradeoffs due to linked-livelihood transitions as well as the need for a trans-ecosystem approach to natural resource management and development policy in rapidly changing coastal regions...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{bathymetric}} and topographic measurements {{have been}} collected independently to serve different purposes. As well, depth and height data were referred to different vertical datums, which created inconsistency across the <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface.</b> With {{the growing number of}} coastal applications, such as coastal zone management and marine boundary delimitation, it is necessary that a seamless vertical reference surface be established. Unfortunately establishing the relationships between the various vertical datums, and consequently the seamless vertical reference surface, is not an easy task. To tackle this subject, the FIG Working Group 4. 2 (WG 4. 2), Vertical Reference Frame, was established. This paper summarizes the activities and findings of the Working Group and discusses routes by which a vertical datum separation model could be developed. It also provides some examples of countries that have already developed one. This {{is by no means a}} complete survey of all modelling techniques used world wide and readers are invited to contribute with additional examples/input to enable WG 4. 2 to develop this subject further.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of institutional arrangements and policies for governance {{has become a}} key question within the sustainability paradigm, not least in coastal areas which have unique issues and jurisdictions across the <b>land–sea</b> <b>interface.</b> In the UK, approximately 60 non-statutory coastal management initiatives have been established at the local/regional level since the 1990 s, based {{on a variety of}} programmes and projects. Proposals for a UK Marine Bill have raised questions about the role of non-statutory initiatives in the system of governance. The traditional sectoral approach to management and planning is being modified due to the pressure of increased human activities, but doubts exist about what effective contribution local and regional partnerships can make. The paper reports extensive examples of Integrated Coastal Management initiatives engaging institutions and society to produce outputs which have transformed management, promoting long-term, collaborative, participatory and ecologically sustainable approaches. The paper concludes that there are demonstrable benefits in taking a partnership approach to coastal management at a local level, yet these forms of planning and management are not widely accepted or embedded within the current system of governance...|$|E

Vaez, Abbas Rajabifard & Ian WilliamsonWith climate change, rising sea levels pressing harder year on year {{and the need to}} manage our resources more carefully in this dynamic environment, the inability to integrate land and marine base information is an increasing problem in many countries. The absence of a seamless spatial data framework prevents the execution of standard practice of locating and referencing spatial data across the land-marine interface where so much pressure and development is taking place. There is a growing and urgent need to create a seamless SDI model that bridges the gap between the terrestrial and marine environments, creating a spatially enabled <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface</b> to more effectively meet sustainable development objectives. This article discusses drivers for integrating land and marine environments and proposes a seamless SDI model as an abstract level SDI and its associated components. This is followed by issues and challenges that must be overcome in developing an overarching architecture for a seamless SDI that allows access to and interoperability of data from marine, coastal and terrestrial environments.

In order to maximize {{the benefits of the}} increasing world trade globalization, and to position themselves as key stopping points, Euro-Mediterranean ports have to adapt while following sustainable development goals. But the marine interfaces transformation can not be done only through ports. It also needs new transverse and integrated policy planning strategies, which would allow establishing clear synergies among different types of activities (food supply chain, aqua-farming, energies, transport, leisure…). The aim is to optimally reposition the <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface</b> by setting the European ports at the center of economic, social and cultural development and by giving back to coastal areas its environmental virtues. How to reposition ports as natural extensions of cities? How to reconnect various transport modes including roads, rail networks, sea transportations systems, while creating new freight zones in order to facilitate logistics at the interface between land and sea?Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The <b>land-sea</b> <b>interface</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex areas of {{management}} in the world. The population along the coastline is continuously increasing and has done so dramatically in the past decade. This has brought with it an increased need to more effectively and efficiently manage this area to meet the economic, environmental and social outcomes of sustainable development. In response to this situation, on land, Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) have been developed to create an environment that will enable users to access and retrieve complete and consistent spatial datasets in an easy and secure way. Within the marine environment tools such as marine cadastre can provide a means for delineating, managing and administering legally definable offshore boundaries, however there is still the need for an overarching spatial information platform to facilitate the use and administration of these tools in a holistic fashion. Currently, most of the SDI initiatives restrict their attention to the landward or seaward regions with little or no consideration of coastal zones. There is the growing and urgent need to create a seamless SDI model that bridges the gap between the terrestrial an...|$|E
