For instance low-emissivity (low-e) windows will transmit light and short-wave infra-red energy into a building but reflect the <b>long-wave</b> <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> generated by interior furnishings. Similarly, special heat-reflective paints are able to reflect more heat than visible light, or vice versa.|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of air traffic in the Asia Pacific region {{in the last decade}} has brought about the need for more {{sustainable}} modes of flight. A key initiative is the development of a Next Generation Air Traffic Management (NG-ATM) system which allows aircraft to fly optimal trajectories. Besides fuel- and time-related costs, other considerations for optimal routing include emissions, noise and contrails. Multi-Objective Trajectory Optimisation (MOTO) allows the generation of optimal trajectories with regards to these objectives, with dynamic weights depending on the phase of flight. Contrails are a major contributor to aviation&# 039;s total Radiative Forcing (RF), being more significant than that of CO 2. In particular, when formed in areas of low temperature and high relative humidity, contrails are known to persist for hours, spreading and eventually transitioning into cirrus clouds. Contrails trap heat by reflecting the <b>long-wave</b> <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> emitted by the earth back to its surface, producing positive RF. However, the albedo of contrails also reflects the incoming shortwave radiation from the sun, resulting in a negative component of RF. The impact of contrails, quantified by its associated RF, is thus not merely a function of environmental parameters but also a function of time. In this paper, a MOTO algorithm is used to generate optimal trajectories that minimize the radiative impact of contrails and CO 2, while minimizing flight time and fuel burn. A case study of a transcontinental flight from Paris to Beijing is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of such an algorithm in providing strategic and tactical trajectory optimization capabilities...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{show that}} the mean global {{temperature}} – and, therefore, climate – is determined mainly by the reflected portion of the total heat received from the Sun. The heat reflected directly by <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> is insufficient for maintenance of the temperature necessary for the Earth life, since it is limited by absorption windows created by green-house gases (mainly water molecules).

40|$|The Inkjet {{printing}} {{technology is a}} direct patterning technique to deposit functional materials with high precision and accuracy. This deposition technology {{is often used to}} manufacture conductive electrodes for different active and passive electronic devices on flexible foils. It is an up-scalable process in terms of printing devices from low (via. Sheet-to-Sheet, S 2 S platform) to high (via. Roll-to-Roll platform) quantities. For manufacturing of these conductive electrodes and hence electronic devices through the R 2 R platform, a suitable post-treatment/curing methodology is very much desired. In this work, the focus is concentrated on the curing methodology using the <b>Infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> for both the inkjet-printed conductive electrodes and insulator layer, for completing a “proof of concept” Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) electronic device structure over the R 2 R platform. A conductive silver nano-particle and a polymeric dielectric ink are used to print the top and bottom conductive electrodes, with a middle insulator layer for the MIM structure respectively. It is observed that not only the printed silver electrode layers (both top and bottom) can be cured {{with the help of the}} <b>Infra-red</b> <b>radiation,</b> but also the insulator layer. Additionally, the layers constituting the MIM device structure is cured with the conventional curing methodology which in this case is thermal curing using a convection oven. This curing procedure for the printed functional layers is generally performed for the S 2 S manufacturing process. The conductive electrodes are then electrically characterized by measuring the sheet resistance (on the foil and dielectric layer) as a function of the un-conventional <b>Infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> and conventional oven curing methodologies. The cured layers for both the conductive electrodes and insulator layers are morphologically analyzed for the layer thickness and homogeneity.
