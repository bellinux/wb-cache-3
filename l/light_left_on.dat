60|$|Helped {{from below}} by Ricardo, and from above {{by the man}} more {{unexpected}} than an angel, Mr. Jones scrambled up {{and stood on the}} wharf by the side of Heyst. He swayed like a reed. The night descending on Samburan turned into dense shadow the point of land and the wharf itself, and gave a dark solidity to the unshimmering water extending to the last faint trace of light away to the west. Heyst stared at the guests whom the renounced world had sent him thus {{at the end of the}} day. The only other vestige of <b>light</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> earth lurked in the hollows of the thin man's eyes. They gleamed, mobile and languidly evasive. The eyelids fluttered.|$|E

5000|$|In 1913 Fegan vacated the Southwark Street {{property}} and opened another building at 62-64 Horseferry Road, {{which he called}} [...] "The Red Lamp" [...] because of the <b>light</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> at night to signal assistance given to anyone who needed shelter whatever the hour. [...] To prepare boys for emigration to Canada, Fegan also established at Goudhurst in Kent a farm using Canadian farming methods and implements. By the 1920s the farm included a home for Fegan and his wife, which they called Blantyre Lodge after one of their earliest supporters Lord Blantyre.|$|E

40|$|The {{vision of}} Palaemonetes is of {{particular}} interest in view of extensive studies of the responses of its chromatophore systems and eye pigments to light. The spectral sensitivity is here examined under conditions of dark adaptation and adaptation to bright colored lights. In each case the relative number of photons per one-fiftieth sec flash needed to evoke a constant peak amplitude (usually 25 or 50 µv) in the electroretinogram (ERG) was measured at various wavelengths throughout the spectrum. The sensitivity is the reciprocal of this number. In dark-adapted animals the spectral sensitivity curve consists of a broad, almost symmetrical band, maximal at about 540 mµ, with a shoulder near 390 mµ. Adaptation to bright red or blue <b>light,</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> continuously throughout the measurements, depresses the 540 mµ peak without notably changing its shape or position, implying that only one visual pigment operates in this region. Adaptation to red light, however, spares a violet-sensitive system, so that a high, narrow peak at 390 mµ now dominates the spectral sensitivity function. The 540 and 390 mµ peaks are apparently associated with different visual pigments; and these seem to be segregated in different receptor systems, since the associated ERG's have markedly different time constants. It is suggested that these two sensitivity bands may represent the red- and violet-sensitive components of an apparatus for color differentiation...|$|E

50|$|The Montego offered many {{improvements}} {{over the}} Maestro, {{many of which}} were later incorporated into the latter, such as a new SOHC engine (the S-Series), and a more robust dashboard. As with the Maestro, there was a high-performance MG version which again used the solid-state instrument cluster, trip computer, and synthesised voice for the information and warning systems. The dashboard fitted to the Montego was superior to that originally designed for the Maestro and featured a rally-style tachometer, a service indicator and a representation of the car showing open doors, <b>lights</b> <b>left</b> <b>on,</b> etc.|$|R
5000|$|For 2000, {{the final}} edition of this Laguna, the Laguna Concorde, was introduced. It {{included}} semi-leather seats, and vocal warnings like [...] "Welcome.

The on-board computer would notify {{the driver of}} any doors not being closed, <b>lights</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> etc., weather ("Please brake carefully the road is watery") or other faults in the electrical or mechanical circuits. The onboard voice synthesizer warnings system was also available on the earlier 1998 RXE and V6 models. This is the same basic unit as used in the Renault Safrane.|$|R

50|$|A {{last call}} is not {{announced}} per se, {{but as a}} custom the lights are flashed a few times (or {{in case of a}} dimly lit establishment such as a night club, all <b>lights</b> are <b>left</b> <b>on)</b> to notify the customers that serving drinks is over.|$|R

50|$|Although {{several of}} the rooms were built during the 18th century, {{alterations}} to {{most of them have}} led to the loss of their original character. Only the entrance hall remains virtually intact with its eight 'Roman Doric' columns supporting a shallow vaulted ceiling. The 1979 fire peeled off the whitewash paint cover of the ceiling revealing the intricate painted pattern (as designed by Sloane). Although the finances did not allow this pattern to be restored at the time, it has since been returned to its former glory by Mess members. A second small fire was started while restoration was under way in 1980 cause of the fire was work <b>lights</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> over night.|$|R

50|$|At {{any point}} during the rounds, the women can press the button {{in front of them}} to turn off their light if they do not believe a date with this man would be {{constructive}} to their well-being and if this occurs, their area of the stage will turn red. If, at the end of three rounds, there are still <b>lights</b> <b>left</b> <b>on,</b> the bachelor will turn off all but two of the remaining lights himself. He will then have a chance to ask one question to the last two women, before choosing which woman he wants to go on the date with by turning off one more light. If the man is <b>left</b> with two <b>lights</b> at the end of round 3, he will just ask his question to the two remaining women and if there is only one <b>light</b> <b>left</b> at the end of round 3, he will go on the date with that girl without asking her his question. There are usually four men brought on {{in the course of a}} single episode, though on some occasions segments have been cut and only three men have been shown.|$|R
25|$|Mawari-butai (revolving stage) {{developed}} in the Kyōhō era (1716–1735). The trick was originally accomplished by the on-stage pushing of a round, wheeled platform. Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement. The kuraten (“darkened revolve”) technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition. More commonly the <b>lights</b> are <b>left</b> <b>on</b> for akaten (“lighted revolve”), sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect. This stage was first built in Japan in the early eighteenth century.|$|R
50|$|If {{a battery}} has been {{completely}} discharged (e.g. the car <b>lights</b> were <b>left</b> <b>on</b> overnight) and next is given a fast charge {{for only a few}} minutes, then during the short charging time it develops only a charge near the interface. The battery voltage may rise to be close to the charger voltage so that the charging current decreases significantly. After a few hours this interface charge will spread to the volume of the electrode and electrolyte, leading to an interface charge so low that it may be insufficient to start a car.|$|R
5000|$|Cut lights - Green lamps used {{to signal}} {{different}} things based {{on where the}} approaching aircraft is in its approach. Early in a no-radio or [...] "zip-lip" [...] approach (which is routine in modern carrier operations), Cut Lights are flashed for approximately 2-3 seconds {{to indicate that the}} aircraft is cleared to continue the approach. Subsequent flashes of the Cut Lights are used to prompt the pilot to add power. The longer the <b>lights</b> are <b>left</b> <b>on,</b> the more power should be added. Cut Lights are operated manually by the LSO.|$|R
5000|$|An {{intruder}} detection {{or access}} control system {{could be used in}} conjunction with light level sensors to turn lights on and off. So when you walk into a dark room the lights turn on (if you are allowed to be there) and when you leave they turn off behind you, thus making energy savings by preventing <b>lights</b> from being <b>left</b> <b>on.</b>|$|R
50|$|Monique - Gerald's mother. Abused {{drugs and}} Gerald anytime she was high. She often {{enforced}} and imparted horrible messages and punishments on Gerald {{when he was}} a child (e.g, putting a lighter up dangerously close to his hand after Gerald was playing with it.) When the house burned down after the <b>lighter</b> was <b>left</b> <b>on</b> and unattended, Monique is arrested and charged for child neglect. However, after she is released, her personality changes, even more so once she is hit by a taxi. Her character experiences many mental changes through the story, even refusing to accept Jordan's behavior post-taxi accident.|$|R
50|$|Like the Calico Mills design, the Kaden Tower, when {{occupied}} at night, {{is reminiscent}} of a Japanese lantern with inside lighting illuminating the grillwork with a soft, yellow glow. During the month of December in the 1970s and early 1980s, transparent color gels {{were placed on the}} inside of the windows to form large seasonal symbols when the office <b>lights</b> were <b>left</b> <b>on.</b> Other notable features of the building are several Wright-inspired stained glass windows and a glass elevator system on the building's exterior, surrounded by a low dome that houses the building's air conditioning systems and accented with a reflecting pool and fountain.|$|R
50|$|The single guy {{needs to}} impress thirty single ladies {{through a series}} of videos or {{interviews}} about him. Each woman has a light which she can turn off if she is unimpressed by the single man. The man's aim is to convince as many women as possible to keep their lights on so that he can then pick, from the women remaining, the one that he wishes to take on a date. If no <b>lights</b> are <b>left</b> <b>on,</b> then the man must leave the show without a date. At the end of the game, the guy may choose a date from the women who leave their lights on.|$|R

At around 4:45 a.m. the next morning, Patsy awoke to go to the toilet and noted that the light was off. It is almost certain Eloise had already been taken by this time.|$|R
5000|$|Karen Chisholm in The Newtown Review of Books {{cited the}} novel's {{suspense}} {{as a major}} attraction: [...] "There are a few authors out there who write books that just about guarantee that sleep will be lost, and <b>lights</b> will be <b>left</b> <b>on</b> {{for quite some time}} after finishing them, and as with Brown’s previous work, Dark Horse has this effect. The reader knows that not everything will be as it appears. The worry sets in early and doesn’t let up." ...|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} of the superstitions that are held by theatre participants, specifically in the Southern Wisconsin area, why the superstitions are held, and the feelings that participants have about those superstitions. General superstitions included are why you never say MacBeth in a theatre, why you never say Good Luck to anyone in theatre, and why ghost <b>lights</b> are <b>left</b> <b>on</b> in the theatre. The respondents also then talk about places that they have learned these superstitions {{and whether or not}} they believe they have any value. The video also includes the respondents discussing any personal superstitions that they may have that are specific to themselves. These superstitions are an interesting aspect of communication because they dictate the ways in which participants in the theatre world interact with other members and also nonmembers...|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, the U.S. Coast Guard {{sought to}} forever darken the light, {{and in fact}} shut it off for a short time.

[...] Numerous public comments were submitted {{as part of the}} regulatory process. In due course, an arrangement was made whereby the <b>light</b> was <b>left</b> <b>on</b> (albeit with its operating expenses to be paid by the Alcona County Historical Society) and it was designated as an official [...] "seasonal private aid to navigation."

60|$|My elder brother, {{for whom}} {{there was no}} place in the office where I worked, had found one in a store, and he beguiled the leisure that <b>light</b> trade <b>left</b> <b>on</b> his hands by reading the novels of Captain Marryat.

I believe I had no critical reserves in regard to them, but simply they did not take my fancy. Still, we had great fun with Japhet in 'Search of a Father', and with 'Midshipman Easy', and we felt a fine physical shiver in the darkling moods of 'Snarle-yow the Dog-Fiend.' I do not remember even the names of the other novels, except 'Jacob Faithful,' which I chanced upon a few years ago and found very, hard reading.|$|R
50|$|He was {{generally}} portrayed in a macho manner, {{although he could}} also appear as a Renaissance man, or as military, family, or even common. This reflected his presentation as a universal man, capable of all subjects; a <b>light</b> was <b>left</b> <b>on</b> in his office long after he was asleep as part of propaganda to present him as an insomniac owing to his driven to work nature. Mussolini as a practitioner of various sports such as fencing, auto racing, skiing, horse riding, lion taming and swimming was promoted to create {{an image of a}} valiant and fearless hero. Mussolini's prestige as a hero aviator in the manner of Charles Lindbergh was especially important, as for fascism the aeroplane embodied qualities such as dynamism, energy and courage. Mussolini himself oversaw which photographs could appear, rejecting some, for instance, because he was not sufficiently prominent in a group.|$|R
