40|$|Background and Purpose. Manual lifting is a {{frequent}} cause of back injury, {{and there is no}} evidence as to which training mode can provide the best training effect for lifting performance and muscle force. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of a squat lift training and a free weight muscle training program on the maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic peak torque in subjects without known neuromuscular or musculoskeletal impairments. Subjects. Thirty-six adults (20 male, 16 female) without known neuromuscular or musculoskeletal impairments participated. The subjects' mean age was 21. 25 years (SD= 1. 16, range= 20 - 24). Methods. Subjects were divided into 3 groups. Subjects in group 1 (n= 12) performed squat lift training. Subjects in group 2 (n= 12) participated in free weight resistance training of their shoulder abductors, elbow flexors, knee extensors and trunk extensors. Subjects in group 3 (n= 12) served as controls. The maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic peak torques of the trunk extensors, knee extensors, elbow flexors, and shoulder abductors of each subject were measured before and after the study. Training was conducted on alternate days for 4 weeks, with an initial load of 80 % of each subject's maximum capacity and with the load increased by 5 % weekly. Results. All groups were comparable for all measured variables before the study. After 4 weeks, subjects in groups 1 and 2 demonstrated more improvement in maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic peak torque of the back extensors compared with the subjects in group 3, but the 2 training groups were not different. Conclusion and Discussion. The findings demonstrate that both squat lift and free weight resistance training are equally effective in improving the <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic back extension performance of individuals without impairments.

40|$|Abstract—The {{present study}} follows a {{physiological}} approach to evaluate physical work capacity (PWC) during manual material handling (MMH) tasks on Indian male workers. This study involves six independent lifting {{variables such as}} lifting frequency (2, 5, and 8 lifts/min), <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> (7, 14, and 21 kg), vertical height (waist, shoulder, and maximum reach), horizontal distance (25, 40, and 55 cm), laboratory condition (21 °C, 27 °C, and 33 °C) and three different rectangular box size{X (35 × 24 × 28 cm),Y (44 × 34 × 17 cm), and Z (58 × 38 × 24 cm) }. The selected two response variables were oxygen intake and heart rate. Taguchi L 27 Orthogonal array (OA) was applied to evaluate {{the effect of these}} lifting variables and plots of raw and signal- to- noise ratio data was used for computing the significance and their effect on the response variables. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) used to evaluate an optimal result of the variables. After analysis; it was found that all six variables (i. e. lifting frequency, <b>lifting</b> <b>load,</b> vertical height, horizontal distance, laboratory environment and box size) had significant effect on oxygen intake; whereas five variables (i. e. lifting frequency, <b>lifting</b> <b>load,</b> vertical height, horizontal distance and laboratory environment) showed a significant effect except one factor of box size was found insignificant in case of heart rate...|$|E

40|$|Manual lifting {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{practices}} used in the industries to transport or move objects to a desired place. Nowadays, even though mechanized equipment is widely available, manual lifting is still considered as an essential way to perform material handling task. Improper lifting strategies may contribute to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), where overexertion contributes as the highest factor. To overcome this problem, electromyography (EMG) signal is used to monitor the workers’ muscle condition and to find maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>load,</b> lifting height and number of repetitions that the workers are able to handle before experiencing fatigue to avoid overexertion. Past researchers have introduced several EMG processing techniques and different EMG features that represent fatigue indices in time, frequency, and time-frequency domain. The impact of EMG processing based measures in fatigue assessment during manual lifting are reviewed in this paper. It is believed that this paper will greatly benefit researchers who need a bird’s eye view of the biosignal processing which are currently available, thus determining the best possible techniques for lifting applications...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{industrial}} tote dumpers and lifters {{are equipped}} with long-stroke single-rod hydraulic cylinders. For years, valve-controlled cylinders {{have been used in}} tote dumpers. Valve-controlled actuators are highly inefficient due to huge power losses in throttling valves. They also need a cooling system to remove the wasted heat energy from the hydraulic oil. This article introduces a low-cost throttle-less hydraulic circuit to control the single-rod cylinder of a tote dumper. The system consists of a motor-driven gear pump, an On/Off solenoid valve, to redirect the differential flow of the single-rod hydraulic cylinder and a counterbalance valve, which makes the circuit controllable for assisting loads and keeps the load in position with no effort from the hydraulic pump. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the circuit. A test rig has been designed to simulate a <b>lifting</b> <b>load.</b> The energy efficiency of the circuit is determined by comparing a valve-controlled circuit with the proposed circuit. The proposed circuit composition is not only efficient and simple but is also accurate in terms of position response using a proportional controller. The circuit is easy to control since the only needed measurement is the displacement of the actuator. The circuit, however, does not recycle energy...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 29 - 31) Back pain is {{the most}} common and costly musculoskeletal problem in the workplace around the world. No previous study has compared the effects of asymmetrical lifting (lifting with a twist) on both upper body and lower body skeletal muscles with multiple lifting loads. It was hypothesized that the asymmetrical lifts of 20, 35, and 50 pounds could require a significantly higher muscle activation on the nine measured muscles when compared to symmetrical lifts of the same load. The dependent variables were the mean EMG activation of twelve selected muscles during the concentric upward lifting phase. The independent variables were the lifting method with two levels: symmetrical versus asymmetrical, and the <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> with three levels of 20, 35, and 50 pounds. The results were analyzed with twelve two by three ANOVAs. The results from the twenty-two participants showed no statistical significant differences among the different conditions on mean EMG muscle activation between symmetrical and asymmetrical lifts. These results suggest that untrained individuals that lift heavy objects during their profession may exert the same muscular effort among multiple lifting loads and twisting while lifting may not alter the activation of certain muscles...|$|E

Moreover, the values of stresses obtained at different locations of the guide thimbles are also comparable with the stress values of the experiment determined at the same locations through strain gauges. Therefore, validation of the FE methodology is confirmed. The values of stresses are less than the design limit of the materials used for the grid and the guide thimble.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a {{complete}} simulation model and study the tip-over responses of mobile cranes. The developed model takes into account all factors that could affect the overturning of truck cranes including: (I) detailed dynamics of Ibe manipulator links and the base that can potentially rock back and forth, (iI) combined vehicle suspension and ground-tire compliance, (iiI) condition of the ground under the wheels or Ibe outrigger pontoons, (iv) friction between Ibe outriggers/tires and the ground, (v) spatial motion of load carried, via a rope, by the telescopic boom of the truck crane, and (VI) hydraulic drive system. The model also includes the effect of the presence of the wheels that can support the machine in case of ground failure at any of the outrigger pontoons, aud therefore is capable of predicting subsequent responses in case of soil failure under the cmne supports. Simulation results are presented to understand tip-over responses ofa typical mobile crane in the presence of load <b>lifting,</b> <b>load</b> swivel, ground failure and various ground conditions.

This study explains the impact of limiting the effective thickness of the cheek plate with respect to the main plate of the padeye and the advantages of increasing the effective thickness of the cheek plates. It also touched on the fabrication requirements to achieve the required effective thickness of the cheek plates. In addition, a sensitivity study about the impact of the out of plane force on the padeye design is addressed and the maximum out of plane angle that shall be considered is recommended. A finite element analysis using London University Structure Analysis System (LUSAS), is conducted and compared with the hand calculation. The benefits and advantage of using FE analysis is addressed in this study. At the end of this research a guideline on the design of the padeye is developed. It has been found that the dynamic amplification factor can be reduced to a lower value of 1. 15 instead of 1. 35. The effective thickness of the cheek plate can be increased to 100 % with proper fabrication and welding sequence.

50|$|Racing engines {{often fail}} at high {{rotational}} speeds because mechanical springs {{are unable to}} retract the valves quickly enough to provide clearance for the piston. Renault's pneumatic valve technology replaced steel springs with light weight compressed air bellows. These could retract valves more quickly and reduce the possibility of piston-valve interference, as long as pressure could be maintained. Additionally, the amount of seat tension required to keep a coil sprung valve under control results in greater peak <b>lift</b> <b>loading,</b> with added stress to the entire valvetrain as a result. Pneumatic systems, sharing a common reservoir of pressure retain a more static level of force, controlling the valve effectively, without any attendant peak <b>lift</b> <b>load</b> increase.|$|R
