5|$|The head <b>linesman</b> is {{positioned}} {{on one end}} of the line of scrimmage. He watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head <b>linesman</b> also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on his side of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.|$|E
5|$|For the 1981–82 season, Nea Salamina {{acquired}} foreign footballers for {{the first}} time, Bulgarians Nazca Michailiof and Stefan Pavlov. An unprecedented incident occurred during the 1982–83 season when, {{in a game against}} Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in GSZ Stadium, three Nea Salamina's players were expelled and the remaining players surrounded the <b>linesman</b> to protest. The <b>linesman,</b> claiming to have received blows, was transported to the hospital where radiographs failed to show injuries caused by the players. After the <b>linesman</b> made a formal complaint, a court imposed a sentence of 45 days. This was unprecedented for Cypriot football. The players remained in jail for five days and were released after public outcry, but then CFA authorities imposed crippling sanctions on them, ordering them to stay off the court for several months.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Goebel {{served in}} the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Commander on an {{aircraft}} carrier. His final game as an official was the 1952 Rose Bowl between Illinois and Stanford, {{in which he was}} the head <b>linesman.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} is {{the list of}} officials to serve as referees and <b>linesmen.</b> Officials in italics were only employed as <b>linesmen</b> during the tournament.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Linesmen</b> (also {{known as}} the [...] "Liney") are {{primarily}} responsible for watching for violations involving the centre line and the blue line. Such infractions include icing and offside infractions, after which the <b>linesmen</b> conduct faceoffs. They are also expected to break up scuffles, fistfights and other altercations that occur during the game. Ice hockey rules allow <b>linesmen</b> to call some penalties (such as too many players on the ice), while others only allow them to report the infraction to the referee.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, the Australian Wheelchair Tennis Association {{selected}} Simmonds {{together with}} nine other wheelchair athletes as <b>linesmen</b> for the 1983 Custom Credit Indoor Tennis Championships. This followed {{the suggestion of}} John Newcombe, famous Australian tennis champion. Simmonds, secretary of New South Wales Wheelchair Tennis Association, assured the public that the <b>linesmen</b> {{would be able to}} handle John McEnroe and other competitors. [...] Well-known Australian radio announcer John Laws informed the public that [...] "Jeff is one of the tough, no nonsense <b>linesmen</b> Superbrat will encounter at this year's Custom Credit Indoor Championship." [...] According to Newcombe, most <b>linesmen</b> selected were able bodied before their injury, “They have great reflexes and good eyesight and they are involved in the game already so they should make good linesmen”.|$|R
5|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{playing of}} the national anthem was performed by trumpeter Dan Oxley. The game's referee was Ed Ardito, its umpire was Greg Adams, and its <b>linesman</b> was Jim Laborde, all of Conference USA. A military veteran from each school was invited to the ceremonial pregame coin toss to determine first possession.|$|E
5|$|The Laycoe {{incident}} was Richard's second altercation with an official that season, after having slapped a <b>linesman</b> {{in the face}} in Toronto the previous December, {{for which he was}} fined $250. Upon hearing the referee's report, league president Clarence Campbell ordered all parties to appear at a March 16 hearing at his office in Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Leicester City {{started their}} cup run against Barnsley, but {{required}} a replay {{to overcome their}} Third Division opponents 2–1. The first Leicester goal was controversial, as the referee overruled his <b>linesman,</b> who had flagged for a foul. Barnsley equalised with a penalty, but Leicester quickly retook the lead. Later {{in the second half}} Leicester claimed a third goal, but the referee adjudged that the ball had not crossed the line. A 1–0 win at Millwall followed.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{minutes after}} the restart, Whelan was penalised for an offence {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool area. Winterburn took the {{resulting}} indirect free kick, from which Alan Smith scored with a header. Liverpool's players protested, claiming Smith had not made contact (and thus the goal should have been disallowed, coming directly from an indirect free kick) or that there had been a push by O'Leary. After consulting his <b>linesman,</b> the referee David Hutchinson awarded the goal. After the match, he recalled none of the Liverpool players knew why they had protested, and TV replays confirm that Smith made contact.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl {{kicked off}} at 2:30p.m. Mountain Time on Tuesday, December 30, 2008 {{in front of}} a crowd of 26,781spectators at Bronco Stadium in Boise, Idaho. The weather {{conditions}} were cloudy with a temperature of 38°F (3°C) and wind at eightmph (12.9km/h) from the southeast. The officiating staff consisted of referee Clair Gausman, umpire Rico Orsot, <b>linesman</b> Cal McNeill, line judge Gary McNanna, back judge Tom Bessant, field judge Shane Standley, side judge Kim Nelson, and scorer Mike Cannon. The game was televised on ESPN and drew a television rating of 2.1 for an estimated 3,039,000 viewers. It was a 218%increase in television viewers from the previous season's game.|$|E
5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} {{on the end}} of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head <b>linesman.</b> He or she supervises player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} few {{accidents}} at Waterloo compared to other London terminal stations. On 21 August 1896, an engine leaving the locomotive yard overran its clearance point, colliding with a departing passenger train. Five passengers were injured. On 5 May 1904, a <b>linesman</b> accidentally stepped on a signal wire. This gave a false clear signal to a goods van, which collided with a passenger train, killing one, while on 25 October 1913, a collision between two passenger trains at Waterloo Junction killed three people.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from the war, Davey worked for the South Australian Railways as a labourer and <b>linesman</b> over three periods between 1926 and 1946. He married Eugene Agnes Tomlinson on 25 August 1928, there being no children of the union. After suffering for many years with bronchitis and emphysema, he died on 21 December 1953 of a coronary occlusion. He was buried at the West Terrace AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, with full military honours. In addition to the Victoria Cross, Military Medal, 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Davey was also later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, {{was presented to the}} Australian War Memorial in Canberra in 1967, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{was delighted}} with his team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. He felt the brawl in stoppage time was {{born out of}} Arsenal's frustration after going behind in the match; he did not want either team to be punished. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had no regrets over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability to control their players. Emmanuel Eboué was retrospectively banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of improper conduct and charged £2,500 for his comments about the <b>linesman.</b>|$|E

5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head <b>linesman,</b> drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 Sugar Bowl {{kicked off}} at 7:30p.m. EST on December 31, 1995, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The game's {{officials}} {{were from the}} Atlantic Coast Conference. Michael Dover was the referee, William Wampler was the umpire, and Sam Stephenson was the <b>linesman.</b> A capacity crowd of 70,283 people attended the game, which was televised by the American Broadcasting Company. The crowd was the smallest to attend a Sugar Bowl in the Superdome to that point. Mark Jones was the play-by-play announcer for the broadcast, Todd Blackledge was the analyst, and Dean Blevins was the sideline reporter. Approximately 6,041,700 American households watched the broadcast, giving it a television rating of 6.3.|$|E
5|$|The Richard Riot was a riot on March 17, 1955 (Saint Patrick's Day), in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The riot {{was named}} after Maurice Richard, the star ice hockey player for the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). Following a violent altercation on March 13 in which Richard hit a <b>linesman,</b> NHL {{president}} Clarence Campbell suspended him {{for the remainder of}} the 1954–55 NHL season, including the playoffs. Montreal fans protested that the suspension was too severe; the team's largely Francophone fan base claimed the length of the suspension was motivated by Richard's French Canadian ethnicity. Outside of Montreal, however, the suspension was seen as justified and, if anything, too short.|$|E
50|$|The NHL {{selected}} {{seven of}} their referees and seven <b>linesmen</b> to officiate the tournament.|$|R

50|$|Ali Sabbagh {{has been}} sentenced to {{six months in jail}} by a Singapore court on 10 June 2013, after {{pleading}} guilty to influencing two <b>linesmen</b> to help fix an AFC Cup match which took place on 3 April 2013. He and the two <b>linesmen</b> “corruptly receiving gratification in the form of free sexual service,” arranged by Singaporean businessman Eric Ding Si Yang.|$|R
5|$|The {{day after}} the final Arsenal and Chelsea {{submitted}} claims for wrongful dismissal of Adebayor and Mikel, respectively, to The Football Association (FA). The FA denied both appeals and clarified their penalties. Eboué was charged with violent conduct for striking Bridge, whereas Adebayor was charged for his behaviour after being sent off. Both players were suspended for three matches – one less than Mikel. Arsenal and Chelsea were charged with misconduct concerning their inability to control their players and were fined £100,000 each. Wenger criticised the FA's treatment of his players and accused the <b>linesman</b> of lying in his account of Adebayor's actions. This led to an investigation where Wenger was found guilty; he was later fined £2,500 and censured by the FA.|$|E
5|$|Wolves enjoyed an {{excellent}} {{start to the}} 1969–70 season, winning seven of their opening eight games, but fell away to a mid-table finish after the shock retirement of 24-year old forward Peter Knowles, who left the game to become a full-time Jehovah's Witness volunteer. Dougan had a poor season, limited to just ten goals in 33 games due to injuries and an eight-week suspension for verbally abusing a <b>linesman</b> in a home defeat to Everton. In the return fixture at Goodison Park, he suffered a clash of heads with full-back Keith Newton and had to undergo major re-constructive surgery and was out of action for two months. McGarry did not speak to Dougan during his two-month absence, but Dougan decided against issuing a transfer request as {{he did not want}} to further his reputation as a journeyman player.|$|E
5|$|In March 1955, Richard was {{suspended}} {{for the remainder of}} the season, including the playoffs, after he received a match penalty for slashing Boston's Hal Laycoe then punching a <b>linesman</b> who attempted to intervene. The suspension touched off a wave of anger towards league president Clarence Campbell, who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats, mainly from French-Canadians accusing him of anti-French bias. Campbell dismissed the warnings, and attended the March 17 game as planned. His presence at the game was perceived by many fans as a provocation and he was booed and pelted with eggs and fruit. An hour into the game, a fan lobbed a tear-gas bomb in Campbell's direction, and firefighters decided to clear the building. Fans leaving the game and a growing mob of angry demonstrators rioted outside of the Montreal Forum, which became known as l'affaire Richard, or the Richard Riot. Richard became the first player to score 500 career goals on October 19, 1957. He retired in 1960 as an eight-time Stanley Cup champion, as well as the NHL's all-time leading scorer with 544 goals.|$|E
