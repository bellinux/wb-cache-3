In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks.

After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where labor was transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low labor costs that were forty to seventy percent lower than in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then <b>leveraging</b> it to produce value-added goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{dynamics}} of corporate <b>leverage</b> when funding decisions {{are made in the}} interests of shareholders. In the absence of prior commitments or regulations, shareholder-creditor conflicts give rise to a <b>leverage</b> ratchet effect, which induces shareholders to resist reductions while favoring increases in <b>leverage</b> even when total-value maximization calls for the opposite. Unlike inefficiencies based on asymmetric information, the <b>leverage</b> ratchet effect applies to all forms of <b>leverage</b> reduction, including earnings retentions and rights offerings. The <b>leverage</b> ratchet effect is present {{even in the absence of}} frictions other than the inability to write complete contracts. The effect creates an agency cost of debt that lowers the value of the <b>leveraged</b> firm. Standard frictions magnify the impact of the effect.

The resulting <b>leverage</b> dynamics can produce outcomes that cannot be explained by simple tradeoff considerations. <b>Leverage</b> can be adjusted in many ways.
