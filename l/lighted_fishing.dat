40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the influence of food involvement as a means of understanding differences in fish consumption levels. This study presents the findings of an online survey of 899 Australian consumers which investigated drivers and barriers to fish consumption among regular, light and very <b>light</b> <b>fish</b> consumers. The findings reveal that higher food involvement leading to increased fish consumption is associated with reduced perceived risk, higher perceived hedonic and symbolic value, and increased product importance. Regular fish consumers are less likely to perceive risk with selecting fish and recognising if fish is fresh than <b>lighter</b> <b>fish</b> consumers. Moreover, regular fish consumers are more likely to perceive higher levels of hedonic value (liking fish and feeling satisfied after eating fish), higher symbolic value (the extent to which people consider eating fish says something about them as a person) and greater product importance (greater interest in food traceability and looking for authentic foods to cook) than <b>lighter</b> <b>fish</b> consumers. Based on these findings, recommendations for increasing food involvement as a means of stimulating seafood consumption through marketing interventions such as consumer information and education, promotional strategies and product development are provided...|$|R

50|$|The {{effects of}} sky glow in {{relation}} to the ecosystem have observed to be detrimental to a variety of different organisms. The lives of plants and animals alike (especially those which are nocturnal) are affected as their natural environment becomes subjected to unnatural change. It can be assumed that the rate of human development technology exceeds the rate of non-human natural adaptability to their environment, therefore, organisms such as plants and animals are unable to keep up and can suffer as the consequences. Although sky glow can be the result of a natural occurrence, the presence of artificial sky glow has become a detrimental problem as urbanization continues to flourish. The effects of urbanization, commercialization, and consumerism are the result of human development; these developments in turn have ecological consequences. For example, <b>lighted</b> <b>fishing</b> fleets, offshore oil platforms, and cruise ships all bring the disruption of artificial night lighting to the world's oceans. Similar problems of disrupting the environment and its biosphere are also very prevalent in regards to energy resources such as the installation of wind turbines and the interference they cause with not only bird flight paths, but also with human neurology.|$|E

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>fishing</b> has rapidly {{developed}} and widely {{spread all over}} Indonesia. In the past, lamps (kerosene-pressured lamp) was used in shallow coastal fishing using scoop net and hand line. Nowadays, fishing with lamp (electric lamp), is widely practices from the coastal fishery to offshore fisheries in combination for boat seine, lift net, purse seine etc. In the new millennium, there are two aspects development of <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> technology, are how to increase the catch, {{but at the same}} time how to conserve the fish resources which is an implementation of sustainable fisheries. In Indonesia, research on the impact of <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> has been limited especially for purse seine and lift net (bagan). Bagan is a lift net formed of box-shaped net with fine mesh size of 0. 5 cm, operated with lamp for attracting pelagic species. The purpose of this paper is to review of some research on <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> in Wallacea Area in Indonesia in relation to the impact on sustainable fisheries with special reference to purse seine and lift net. These two fishing gears have different characteristic in relation to the fish species. In the respect of first of maturity of fish, purse seine is friendly for big eye scad but did not friendly for sardine and Indian mackerel. On the other hand, purse seine produces low by catch and discarded catch. The other fishing gear, lift net of bagan rambo (large typed lift-net), generate negative impact which catch higher number of immature fish such as Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) and Russel scad (Decapterus ruselly) and this gear needs high energy consumption for fish lamp. According to the biological aspect bagan rambo was, however environmentally friendly for ancovy (Stolephorus insularis) big eye scad and big size pelagic fish with less amount of discarded catch. It is very important that fishing regulation which is declared in the Code of Conduct for Sustainable Fisheries (CCRF) is to reduce catching the juvenile fish. Therefore, an environmentally friendly <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> technology should be considered in the near future. To establish the environmentally friendly technology of lift net (bagan), better management of fishing unit, fishing ground and the fishing season should be taken in the first priority. Meanwhile, necessary other factors are strongly considered such as improving mesh selectivity of fishing gear and increase of awareness of fishermen to be more responsibl...|$|R

40|$|The use of lamp for {{attracting}} {{and catching}} {{fish and other}} aquatic animals has rapidly developed and widely spread all over in Indonesia In {{the beginning of the}} history of <b>light</b> <b>fishing,</b> the lamp was used in the shallow coastal fishing ground, with the limited number of lamp for the beach seine, scoop net and hand line, by using the torch or kerosene lamp. According to the introduction of the electric lamps, the <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> has been expanded to the oflshore fisheries to the large-scale commercial level for the boat seine, purse seine, Bagan (platform lift-net), by using electric lamps such as incandescent lamp, fluorescent lamp, and mercury lamp. As the typical characteristics of the tropical fisheries in Indonesia, there are many types of fishing gear for a certain target species, and variety of catch species for a certain type of gear, for identifying the multi-species and multi-gear fisheries. South Sulawesi is one of the regions in Indonesia with the intensive <b>fishing</b> activities with <b>light,</b> with the specialized development of Bagan Rambo (Large scale lift-net operated from the platform raft) in Barru regency, and the purse seine in Jeneponto regency.

40|$|Coastal {{fisheries}} resources {{play a crucial}} role in promoting food security and incomes throughout the world. In recent years there has been important concerns all over the world about the overexploitation of wild fish stocks. In many developing coastal countries this overexploitation has been attributed to the increasing demand of fish products and exacerbated by modernization and development of new fishing techniques to increase catch. One of the major problems in the fishing industry is the dwindling levels of fishing output. Ghana’s fishing levels are increasingly becoming unsustainable due to the use of highly destructive <b>fishing</b> equipment like <b>light</b> attraction equipment. Apart from the periodic shortages of pre-mix fuel, <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> activities is identified by peasant fishers as a major challenge to their livelihood. The use of <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> method for fishing also has the potential to negatively impact the profitability of poor fishers who are mainly small-scale artisanal fishers. The damaging effect of <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> operation in the country and the factors affecting the effective enforcement of the ban on such operation leaves us with lots of uncertainties which this research seeks to unravel. To help develop an effective management response to this challenge the study highlights the factors that make artisanal fishermen flout fishing regulations, identify the possible reasons why the prohibition of <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> is not effectively enforced, and make necessary recommendations on the measures needed to bring the fisheries regulations closer to the realities on the ground. Different data collection strategies were employed in the study and the data was analyzed qualitatively. It finds that low penalties and poor enforcement for law-breakers are two of the major problems. The study also finds that, the lack of alternative livelihood opportunities for rural fishers contributes greatly to the increasing pressure on coastal {{fisheries resources}} which subsequently leads overexploitation. It therefore recommends that, enforcement is tightened, artisanal fishers should be given more education and be involved in the decision making process...|$|R

40|$|A {{technical}} simulation {{and economic}} model {{was developed for}} a floating photovoltaic (PV) -battery system powering a submerged light emitting diode (LED) lighting system. The system was designed to provide around the equivalent of 1000 lumens (lm) of light of the existing <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> technology (a floating pressurised kerosene light) for artisanal light fishers to use for 8 h per night on Lake Victoria and other lakes in the region (Tanganyika, Rukwa, Mweru, Kivu, etc.). The net present cost (NPC) of a technically appropriate PV-battery-LED system was calculated as US$ 280 over 5 years, five-times less than the existing solar-based technology, a PV-battery-compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) system, and around ten times less than the baseline pressurised kerosene-based technology over the five years. Fishers owning the new PV-battery-LED system outright will likely recoup their initial investment within a year relative {{to the cost of}} alternatives, although the upfront capital cost of the new system was higher than the pressurised kerosene and PV-battery-CFL, and found to be practically unaffordable to the subsistence fishers without microcredit. Nonetheless, the technical simulations found that the new system was also able to provide additional lighting services during the day and evening, with little (if any) electrical impact on the system when in use for <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> during the small hours of moonless nights. This research also demonstrates that the high cost of operating pressurised kerosene lamps precludes them for use in other applications within the community, including in homes. This research suggests that facilitated local development of appropriate new <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> technology configurations will require training of local individuals to sensitise fishing communities to the new technology, and sustain wider adoption of the more efficient, cost-effective, and safer alternative...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} use of modern lighting technology in use for artisanal <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> for omena/dagaa/mukene (Rastrineobola argentea) on Lake Victoria in Kenya. Technical system simulations, analysis of field data, economic modelling, and peer-review literature indicates {{that there is a}} clear economic rationale for small-scale stand-alone photovoltaic-based battery charging for new light emitting diode (LED) lighting technology to displace existing pressurised kerosene lamp technology, and that implementation of even an unsubsidised custom <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> system design can deliver a substantial reduction in fishing costs. In addition, our research suggests that new lighting technology designs can more efficiently attract targeted fish species and potentially reduce bycatch of endangered cichlid species. Furthermore, our initial research findings elucidate numerous external benefits of the new system: new LED lighting systems can be locally designed and assembled, creating a new local service industry; cost-effective photovoltaic-battery- LED designs can be used in the household during the day/evening (in contrast to existing <b>fishing</b> <b>lighting</b> technology); the proposed technology reduces other major costs of fishing, such as travel to obtain existing fuels/energy; the technology is zero emissions at point of use; is healthier and safer to operate; can eliminate environmental (kerosene) pollution; increases local energy security, and; enable fishers to own a fishing asset with lasting value, potentially of use as collateral to utilise credit services over time...|$|R
