50|$|A slug {{is used to}} {{increase}} adhesive weight, allowing full power to be applied at a lower speed, thus allowing a higher maximum tractive effort. They are often used in <b>low-speed</b> <b>operations</b> such as switching operations in yards. At low speeds, a diesel-electric locomotive prime mover is capable of producing more electricity than its traction motors can use effectively. Extra power would simply cause the wheels to slip and possibly overheat the traction motors. A slug increases the number of traction motors available to the locomotive, increasing both the pulling and braking power. In addition the load on each traction motor is reduced, which helps prevent overheating from excess current. Slugs typically carry ballast {{to increase}} their weight and improve traction. Large blocks of concrete are frequently used for this purpose, substituting for {{the weight of the}} now-absent prime mover.|$|E

40|$|Integrated flight/propulsion {{control systems}} have been {{designed}} for operation of STOVL aircraft over the low speed powered-lift flight envelope. The control system employs command modes for attitude, flightpath angle and flightpath acceleration during transition, and translational velocity command for hover and vertical landing. The command modes and feedback control are implemented {{in the form of}} a state-rate feedback implicit model follower to achieve the desired flying qualities and to suppress the effects of external disturbances and variations in the aircraft characteristics over the low speed envelope. A nonlinear inverse system was used to translate the output from these commands and feedback control into commands for the various aerodynamic and propulsion control effectors that are employed in powered-lift flight. Piloted evaluations of these STOVL integrated control designs have been conducted on Ames Research Center's Vertical Motion Simulator to assess flying qualities over the low-speed flight envelope.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a generic design methodology for variable camber flap systems for transport aircraft, intended to be used for cruise and <b>low-speed</b> <b>operations.</b> The methodology was structured after several revisions were performed on conventional high-lift device design methodologies for existing transport aircraft. The definition and detail explanations are given at every phase of the methodology. A case study was performed in order to give an example of the implementation of the methodology where a transport aircraft called A TRA, a design study from previous PhD report, was taken as a model. Experimental work could not be performed, due to budget constraints, so the case study was only carried out using computer-based analyses. Software packages such as MSES-code (a Computational Fluid Dynamic software), CATIA and PATRANINASTRAN were used for this case study to analyse aerodynamic characteristics, layout as well as simulation and structure analyses respectively. The results obtained showed that it was practically feasible to deploy such a high-lift device to transport aircraft when the effect from aerodynamic loads gave minimum effect on structural deformation. The deflections of the flap as well as spoilers under critical loads were below the allowable limits, which had a minimal effect due to the additional lift force generated from the movable surfaces...|$|E

A uniflow diesel engine takes in air via scavenge ports, and exhaust gases exit through an overhead poppet valve. Two-stroke diesels are all scavenged by forced induction. Some designs use a mechanically driven Roots blower, whilst marine diesel engines normally use exhaust-driven turbochargers, with electrically driven auxiliary blowers for <b>low-speed</b> <b>operation</b> when exhaust turbochargers are unable to deliver enough air.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to provide {{information}} about the in-cylinder flow field optimisation in a high speed, direct injection (HSDI) four valve per cylinder diesel engine for off-highway applications. Fully transient CFD analyses of different valve profile strategies for the intake and compression strokes are at first performed, in order to evaluate the effects on both engine permeability and in-cylinder flow field evolution. Modifications are applied to each intake valve separately: gradually stretched cam profiles are imposed so that strategies range from the standard operation, i. e. the adoption of a unique cam profile for the two intake valves, up to the limit case characterized by a 40 % difference between the intake valves maximum valve lifts for three different engine conditions. Organized flow structures (i. e., swirl) and turbulent flow patterns are investigated, in order to address rules for ad-hoc strategies aiming at finding the best trade off between engine performance and pollutant emission. The effectiveness of the valve strategies is validated by means of full injection and combustion simulations using state of the art models. At first, results for the base case are validated against experiments; subsequently, both full-load / peak-torque and mid-load / <b>low-speed</b> <b>operations</b> for the most promising cases are performed. Relative valve profile strategies prove to strongly influence the flow field within the combustion chamber, and therefore the subsequent spray evolution and fuel combustion, confirming the importance of an ad-hoc optimization {{in order to meet the}} best trade-off between performance and pollutant emissions...|$|E
40|$|This summary {{presents}} the main conclusions and {{results of the}} design studies conducted {{by a group of}} 13 students at the University of Maryland. The students, all participants in the spring 1989 course ENEE 418 in the Electrical Engineering Department, met weekly in a two-hour class to discuss and evaluate design alternatives. The main problem considered was the design and control of a planar testbed simulating a free-flying space robot for applications in satellite servicing. This project grew out of the 1988 class where a dual-armed free flyer (DAFF) was designed and partially built. This year, a group of six students continued the development of the DAFF, achieving computer-controlled motion of the DAFF's arms. All fabrication and testing of the DAFF is being conducted in the Intelligent Servosystems Laboratory at the University of Maryland. While the work related to the design and development of the DAFF is the main subject of the report, {{it should be noted that}} other students in the ENEE 418 class have investigated additional issues related to manipulation in space. For example, one group studied a new parallel linkage based manipulator for fine motion applications such as in assembly operations in space. They investigated the mechanism's kinematics, its reachable workspace, and precision of applying forces and torques. In yet another project, a student set out to measure and map the friction characteristics of the actuators used in the Modular Dextrous Hand, which has been recently developed in the Intelligent Servosystems Laboratory. The results are expected to help compensate for this friction, which is a highly nonlinear disturbance and presents significant problems in high-precision, <b>low-speed</b> <b>operations.</b> This summary continues with the discussion of the results obtained by the group of students who have been working on developing the DAFF testbed...|$|E
