40|$|Abstract: A {{finite element}} model of an ultra-precision {{grinding}} machine that can have high precision and high stiffness is constructed and structural analysis is done with equivalent stiffnesses of linear motion guides by after structural design and the deformation of the grinding machine is obtained. In {{order to reduce the}} deformation of the grinding machine that causes bad influence on precision, structural complement is conducted by adding ribs at {{the lower part of the}} column. Also, the straightness of the grinding machine is improved by lifting the base side of the column. Modal analysis is done to find the natural frequencies. And thermal analysis is done to obtain temperature distributions and thermal deformation due to heat sources. Experiments were also done to measure the straightness of the machine and the temperature on <b>LM</b> <b>guide.</b> The deformation of the grinding machine is reduced by adding ribs and the grinding machine is stable for vibration because the machine has high natural frequency. It is confirmed that the ultra-precision grinding machine with linear motion guide applied is very stable for thermal deformation...|$|E
40|$|Linear motion (<b>LM)</b> ball <b>guides</b> {{have good}} {{accuracy}} and high efficiency. They are widely applied for precision machinery such as machine tools, semiconductor fabrication machines and robots. However, friction force incurs heat between the balls and grooves. Thermal expansion {{due to the}} heat deteriorates stiffness and accuracy of the <b>LM</b> ball <b>guides.</b> For accurate estimation of stiffness and accuracy during the linear motion, friction models of <b>LM</b> ball <b>guides</b> are required. To formulate accurate frictional models of <b>LM</b> ball <b>guides</b> according to load and preload conditions, rolling and viscous frictional analyses have been performed in this paper. Contact loads between balls and grooves are derived from Hertzian contact analysis. Contact angle variation is incorporated for the precision modeling. Viscous friction model is formulated from the shear stress of lubricant and the contact area between balls and grooves. Experiments confirm validity of the developed friction model for various external load and feedrate conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Design {{resources}} reuse is {{very important}} to the rapid response design. In this paper, a design resources reusable model based on product family is established to meet the rapid response design. Firstly, parameters transmission structure of product family is constructed based on Generic Bill of Materials (GBOM) and product master model, and then the reused design resource library is established by the instantiation to master model. Finally product configuration management and variant design is realized {{on the basis of the}} reused design resource library. In the developing process of the rapid response design system of machine tool component, the Linear Motion (<b>LM)</b> rolling <b>guide</b> variant design subsystem is developed by the application of the above methods to realize the variant design and configuration management of <b>LM</b> rolling <b>guide.</b> The result shows that the method can provide a reliable guarantee for establishment and effective management of corporate design resource base...|$|R
40|$|For liver metastases (<b>LM),</b> image <b>guided</b> {{percutaneous}} ablative procedures such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), laser induced thermal therapy (LITT) and trans-arterial chemo-embolisation (TACE) {{are increasingly}} being used because they are relatively safer, less invasive and equally effective. CT scan guided interstitial brachytherapy (IBT) with a single large dose of radiation by high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy is a novel technique of treating LM and has shown good results. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan may provide better information for assessing the response toIBT procedures. We hereby report a case of LM that was treated by HDR IBT and PET scan was done in addition to CT scan for assessing the response...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundRefinements in {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention (PCI), {{including the}} use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and fractional flow reserve (FFR), have allowed the treatment of complex lesions with good results. As a result, the percutaneous approach for left main coronary artery (LM) lesions has spread, including centers with a lower volume of PCI procedures. Our objective was to report the early and late outcomes of PCI in unprotected LM lesions. MethodsConsecutive patients treated at two different hospitals from August 2009 to July 2013 were included. The indication for the percutaneous approach was based on the clinical assessment and the calculation of Syntax score, EuroScore and on the patient’s wishes. ResultsTwenty-eight patients with mean age of 69. 2 ± 10. 1 years were treated, 39 % were diabetic and 39 % had acute coronary syndromes. Half of the patients had EuroScore≥ 6; the Syntax score was 26. 0 ± 8. 4 and 82 % had LM bifurcation lesions. Interventions were guided by IVUS and/or FFR in 71. 4 % of the patients, 93 % were treated with drug-eluting stents, and the 1 -stent technique was used in most occasions. Angiographic success was achieved in 100 % of the cases. At the 19. 2 ± 13. 7 month follow-up, the rate of major adverse cardiac events was 21. 4 % in the follow-up longer than 4 years, cardiac death 14. 2 %, non-fatal myocardial infarction 3. 5 % and target-lesion revascularization 3. 5 %. ConclusionsPCI in unprotected <b>LM</b> lesions, <b>guided</b> by IVUS and/or FFR whenever possible, is safe and effective in the short and long-term, in the experience of a hospital with a moderate number of PCI procedures...|$|R
