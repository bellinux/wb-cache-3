40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 53). Banking {{is known as the}} backbone of the national economy and it {{play an important role in}} the business sector & promoting industrialization & economic development of the country. City Bank Ltd is one of the ancient private commercial bank operated in Bangladesh which deals with four different and significant banking divisions which are the driving force of the bank such as Retail Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, SME Banking and Treasury Banking. Here the report has been prepared on “Retail activities and Customer services of CBL” and it covers detail about retail banking activities and customer service accomplishes by the bank. Besides it also consist of general information of CBL, financial information, learning points, findings, and recommendation. Retail banking discusses about the banking in which banking institutions accomplish transactions directly with consumers, rather than corporations or other banks. CBL started its retail function in 2009. Through retail banking City bank collects deposits, provides loan to customers, and offers various card services both local and abroad and some services to non-resident business. The bank wants to provide their customers the best-in-class services, innovative products and financial solutions from smart outlets. During the internship period I worked under the customer service department. The Customer Service area is divided into few sections such as, Cheque, pin, cards, loan, remittance, pay order and so on. The customer service includes activities, such as- opening different accounts, cheque requisition and delivery, pin receive and delivery, <b>loan</b> <b>paper</b> fill up and processing, call center registration and so on.

40|$|Lending {{money to}} one another {{is one of the}} common {{transactions}} among people. The borrowed property is sometimes {{in the form of the}} very property itself, such as gold and rice, and sometimes in the form of currency, i. e., paper money. Given the inflation issue and the decrease in the economical value of money, the lenders undoubtedly do not take back their money with the same economical value that they have lent it to the borrower the year before. To compensate the damage and to prevent the loss incurred, some believe that from the beginning the exchange of money for gold or for other goods can be postulated as a condition for lending money. Others have suggested the "purchase power" as a basis for paying off one's debt. Yet, others due to the symbolic nature of paper money believe that the same amount of money that has been borrowed is to be paid back; and, finally, another group have set forth the inflation rate as the basis for calculation. In this article the above theories are dealt with and critically reviewed. The first and the second theories can be taken as suitable approaches. However, with respect to the nature of the loan contract which is based on risk (gharar), its philosophy which is rendering voluntary help and benevolence to the needy without expecting any benefits, and the lender's intention to acquire Divine pleasure and otherworldly reward, the third theory, i. e., the calculation of the inflation rate in lending paper money, would be in contradiction with the philosophy of <b>loan.</b> <b>Paper</b> money as being symbolic is also subject to more deliberation due to its credit value and has no application in paper money loan in view to the definition given for money; although, according to the advocates of this theory in order to compensate the decrease of the value of money a condition as to paying for the damage due to delay in payment can be stipulated in the loan contract, which is irrelevant to our discussion. Keywords: <b>loan,</b> <b>paper</b> money, inflation, purchase power, payment, damage for delay, usuryاز جمله معاملات رایج میان مردم ، قرض دادن به یکدیگر است. مال مقروضه گاه به صورت عین مال است مانند طلا و برنج و گاه پول رایج یعنی اسکناس می باشد. با توجه به این که در پول امروزی موضوع تورّم و کاهش ارزش اقتصادی آن مطرح است ، بدون شک در قرض دادن با اسکناس ، وام دهنده از لحاظ ارزش اقتصادی همان پولی را که سال قبل به وام گیرنده داده بود، نمی گیرد. برای جبران خسارت و جلوگیری از ضرر، بعضی معتقدند که می توان از ابتدا برابری ارزش اسکناس با طلا یا کالای دیگر را شرط نمود. عده ای « توان خرید » را مبنای اداء دین در نظر گرفته اند. برخی دیگر به دلیل مثلی بودن اسکناس ، معتقدند همان مقدار پولی که قرض داده شده ، باید برگردانده شود ، و بالاخره گروهی « نرخ تورّم » را به عنوان معیار محاسبه مطرح کرده اند. آنچه در این مقاله مورد مطالعه قرار می گیرد ، طرح نظریات مزبور و نقد و بررسی آنهاست. نظریه اول و دوم می تواند راهکار مناسبی باشد، اما با توجه به ماهیت عقد قرض که مبتنی بر غرر است و فلسفه آن که کمک داوطلبانه به نیازمندان بدون کسب منفعت همراه با احسان و نیکی است و نیز نیّت قرض دهنده که کسب رضای خدا و ثواب اخروی است، نظریه سوم یعنی محاسبه نرخ تورّم در قرض اسکناس با ماهیّت و فلسفه قرض منافات پیدا می کند. مثلی بودن اسکناس نیز به دلیل ارزش اعتباری آن ، محل تأمّل است و در قرض اسکناس با توجه به تعریفی که از پول شده ، کاربردی ندارد ؛ هرچند که به نظر طرفداران این نظریه برای جبران کاهش ارزش پول می توان شرط خسارت تأخیر تأدیه در ضمن عقد نمود که این ربطی به بحث ما ندارد. کلید واژه ها: قرض، اسکناس، تورّم، توان خرید، تأدیه، خسارت تأخیر، ربا...|$|E

40|$|Contact author. 1 Although {{extensive}} {{studies have}} been done to examine the prepayment of primary mortgages, not much has been done to analyze the prepayment of home equity <b>loans.</b> This <b>paper</b> studies the prepayment of fixed-rate home equity loans using a large loan-level sample for the period 1995 to 1998. We find that prepayment of home equity loans is sensitive to changes in market interest rates, indicating that borrowers refinance their loans when market interest rates are lower than coupon interest rates. We also find that trends in interest rate changes {{play an important role in}} borrower prepayment decisions. When borrowers expect market interest rates to decrease further, they will wait for better opportunities to prepay their home equity loans even when the loans are already “in the money. ” Loan size and borrower creditworthiness also affect the prepayment of home equity loans. However, the loan-to-value ratio, an important factor in primary mortgage prepayment, has little effect on the prepayment of home equity <b>loans.</b> This <b>paper</b> also documents the effect of payment delinquencies on prepayment behavior. Borrowers with either minor or major delinquencies in making monthly payments are less likely to prepay their home equity loans. ...|$|R

Results indicate that gifts and informal loans are partly motivated by consumption smoothing motives but do not serve to efficiently share risk. Certain shocks are better insured through gifts and loans than others. Mutual insurance does not {{take place at the}} village level; rather, households receive help primarily through networks of friends and relatives. Network quality matters. Risk is shared through flexible, zero interest informal loans rather than gifts. The evidence is consistent with models of quasi-credit where enforcement constraints limit gift giving. ...|$|R

This was followed in the evening by attacks in police posts in Aathbiskot-Rari in Rukum, Holeri in Rolpa and Sindhuligadhi in Sindhuli. The 'People's War' was formally launched.After the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) came into government in 1997, violence between both sides stopped but the issue could not be resolved. The government formed a taskforce to look into the 'Maoist Activities and a Search for Solutions' in April 1997 under CPN (UML) MP Prem Singh Dhami but the commission report was ultimately shelved in August of the same year. A local election was called in May 1997, but polls could not be held in 87 village development committees due to intimidation by the Maoists. The government in response attempted to introduce the Terrorist and Destructive Activities (Control and Punishment) Act in July 1997 at the initiative of deputy prime minister and home minister Bam Dev Gautam. The act would give the police wide-ranging powers against perceived 'terrorists'. But the government was forced to backtrack on the law before it was placed in front of the parliament owing to mass protests from the civil society, the media, and international organizations.|$|R
