50|$|Mindset had dual {{front-mounted}} ROM cartridge ports with a <b>locking</b> <b>knob</b> on {{the left}} side of the main computer module to lock the ROM modules into place. The Mindset had the option (through its System Configuration Utility) to be able to select whether the system booted from left or right ROM carts, or disk drive. Cartridges could also contain CMOS RAM, which would be retained when unplugged by a battery in the cartridge case. Cartridges were envisioned to be a primary medium for software distribution on the Mindset, but sales of the system were too low for cartridges to be economical, and software was distributed on disk instead.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Jazzmaster, the floating tremolo was used on the then top-of-the-line Fender Jaguar guitars, released in 1962, and also on the Fender Bass VI, released in 1961. Jaguar and Jazzmasters share the same bridge plate and string saddles, though Jaguar bridges (and the earliest Jazzmaster bridges) have taller [...] "legs". The two are functionally interchangeable and replacement parts for each {{are one and the}} same. The Bass VI bridge has a wider plate and longer intonation screws to allow the bass strings to be correctly intonated, and the saddles have threads cut for larger diameter strings. There have also been a small number of not very notable imitations by other makers, generally without the <b>locking</b> <b>knob.</b> Fender discontinued all floating tremolo models by 1980, but reintroduced both the Jazzmaster and Jaguar first as Japanese models in the mid 1980s, then as American-made reissues in the 1990s. The tremolo-equipped Bass VI was reintroduced as a US Custom Shop model in 2006.|$|E

40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring loaded socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an adjustable spring force on the socket. A <b>locking</b> <b>knob</b> is attached to the lead screw to allow for hand manipulation of the lead screw...|$|E

50|$|Analog diving watches {{must have}} a water {{resistant}} crown. Some models have the crown mounted in unconventional positions like 4, 8 or 9 o'clock to avert or reduce discomfort from the crown touching the wearers (left) wrist or back of the hand. Often the crown has to be unscrewed to set or adjust the time and date and afterwards retightened to restore the water resistance of the watch and minimize the chance of unintentional operation under water. There are also watch models where a <b>locking</b> handle, separate <b>knob</b> or an extra crown cover has to be manipulated before the crown can be operated. There are however models that have crowns that are operated like the crowns of non diver's analog watches. Screw down or otherwise locking crowns and traditionally operated water resistant crowns can not be operated under water.|$|R
50|$|Alzheimer disease {{presents}} specific {{challenges for}} caregivers, {{who need to}} make the home as accessible as possible to the elderly resident, while keeping safety features in mind. Removable stove switch <b>knobs,</b> <b>locks</b> on kitchen cabinets, electric kettles with automatic shut-off, and adding lighting to eliminate shadows in the house can all help caregivers to reduce dangers to the person with Alzheimer disease. Other features that can improve the well-being of the elderly person can include marking doors with conspicuous and distinct signs or objects such as ribbons or wreaths, can assist memory. Adding a cot or bed to the main floor of the house to allow the elderly person to rest without climbing stairs to a bedroom can be helpful to the Alzheimer patient. Furniture and clutter can also be removed to make the house more safe for an elderly person inclined to pace or wander.|$|R

5000|$|The Schlage Manufacturing Company {{was founded}} by {{inventor}} Walter Schlage in 1920 {{with the help of}} three businessmen who each contributed $10 to become equal partners. Walter Schlage had already secured several patents dating back to 1909, when he patented a doorknob that would also complete an electrical circuit so that, for instance, the lights would turn on when the door was opened. However, Schlage's key invention was the bored cylindrical lock, which evolved through several iterations, including a 1917 filing for a mortise mechanism which <b>locked</b> when the <b>knob</b> was tilted; two filings in 1920 (in April for a lock requiring one hole and a surface rabbet rather than a complex mortise pocket and October for a mortise with the lock mechanism activated by a button coaxial to the knob). This series would ultimately culminate in , filed in 1923, which was sold commercially as the Schlage [...] "A" [...] series lock. Schlage would later make a 1925 filing for a push button cylindrical lock fusing the two 1920 patents with the 1923 patent.|$|R
40|$|A simple, effective, easy-to-use device <b>locks</b> {{a control}} <b>knob</b> {{in a set}} position. In the initial {{application}} for which this device was conceived, the control <b>knob</b> to be <b>locked</b> {{is that of a}} needle valve. Previously, in that application, it was necessary for one technician to hold the knob to keep the valve at the desired flow setting while another technician secured the valve with safety wire [...] a time-consuming procedure. After attachment of the wire, it was still possible to turn the knob somewhat. In contrast, a single technician using the present device can secure the knob in the desired position. in about 30 seconds, and the knob cannot thereafter be turned, even in the presence of harsh vibrations, which occur during space shuttle launch. The device includes a special-purpose clamp that fits around the control knob and its shaft and that can be tightened onto the knob, without turning the knob, by means of two thumbscrews. The end of the device opposite the clamp is a tang that contains a slot that, in turn, engages a bolt that protrudes from the panel on which the control knob and its shaft are mounted...|$|R
50|$|Prominently {{placed at}} the top are the large wind-on and rewind knobs, the {{right-hand}} one is the film advance knob, both to be operated in the clockwise direction. Next to it is a manually reset automatic frame counter dial and the chromed wind-on release button, the latter not to be mistaken for the shutter release. The front element focusing Kodak lens has a rigid lensmount set in a Kodak inter-lens shutter. The shutter is cocked by a gear coupling to the sprocket-wheel drum, which is trailing along with the passing film during the wind-on operation. Hence, there is no shutter cocking without a film in the camera. An automatic mechanism locates the next frame on the film by <b>locking</b> the advance <b>knob.</b> It is released for the next frame by depressing the wind-on release button before turning the wind-on knob. This prevents double exposure, but not blank frames since nothing prevents pressing the button again and advance the film. However, a red indicator is shown to the left in a slot {{on the top of}} the shutter cover that indicates the camera has been wound. The shutter release, in the shape of a rearward-pointing pin attached to the shutter release lever, is situated at about 10-o'clock at the shutter housing. It is protected from being accidentally triggered by a small cover extending over it.|$|R
50|$|Quattro car {{production}} was 11,452 vehicles {{over the period}} 1980-1991, and through this 11 year production span, despite some touch-ups, there were no {{major changes in the}} visual design of the vehicle. For the 1983 model year, the dash was switched from an analogue instrument cluster, to a green digital liquid crystal display (LCD) electronic instrument cluster. This was later changed in 1988 to an orange LCD electronic instrument cluster. The interior was redesigned in 1984, and featured a whole new dash layout, new steering wheel design, and new centre console design, the switches around the instrument panel were also redesigned at this time. In 1985 the dash changed slightly with harder foam and lost a diagonal stripe, the dash switches were varied slightly and the diff <b>lock</b> pull <b>knob</b> gave way to a two-position turning knob with volt and oil temp digital readouts.External styling received very little modification during its production run. Originally, the car had a flat fronted grille featuring four separate headlamplenses, one for each of the low and high beam units. This was altered for the 1983 model year, and replaced with combined units featuring a single lens, but housing twin reflectors. This was changed again, for the 1985 model year, in what has become known as the 'facelift model' and included such alterations as a new sloping front grille, headlights, and trim and badging changes. Max speed was 124 mph. The RR 20v Quattro also featured a new three spoke steering wheel design, leather covering for door arm rests, gloveboxes, centre console and door pockets. There was also a full length leather-wrapped centre console running {{all the way to the}} rear seats. The 20v was also the first Ur-Q to have 'quattro' script interior with partial leather seats. The floor on the driver's side had a bulge due to dual catalytic exhaust setup. The different models may be distinguished by the emblems on their boot lids: the WR had a vinyl 'quattro' decal or a brushed aluminium effect plastic emblem, the MB had chrome plated 'Audi', 'Audi rings' and 'quattro' emblems, whilst the RR had only chrome plated 'Audi rings'.|$|R
60|$|There the Prince saw {{enough to}} fill him with wonder {{for the rest of}} his life. His old friend, Trumkard, took him day by day into the bazaars, and the palaces, and the mosques, and {{hundreds}} of places just as nice. One beautiful evening the Prince set out for a walk by himself through the city. The gentle twilight still tinged the sky with gold, and the soft breeze from the river, that passed through fruit-gardens and vineyards on its way to the city, smelt of peaches, and grapes, and plums, and oranges, and pomegranates, and pineapples, and was truly very delicious. Everything was lovely, and the Prince felt good and happy. The very beggars, when he had passed them, blessed the happy stars that had caused them to be born during his life-time, so noble and generous was the Prince this evening. Strolling along, he came to the palace of the mighty King. The Prince knew the palace; for Trumkard had taken him into it, and had shown him the six judges sitting in their velvet chairs, and the magical music hanging up against the marble tablet between them. He knew all about the music, and the conditions attached to it, but, not being much of a musician, he had never felt inclined to try it. So he walked through the royal courts and vestibules, and into the great hall where stood the six chairs,--empty, and covered with silken covers to keep the dust off during the night. And the music was concealed by a great plate of gold which was locked over it every night. He met but few persons; for every one who was not detained by some particular duty, had gone out-of-doors that lovely night. Here and there, a porter, or a black eunuch, or a soldier or two, he met; but as every one who saw him, knew him instantly for a prince of good blood, he could, of course, wander where he pleased. He passed on among the golden columns and sculptured doorways, and under vaulted and arabesque ceilings, until he came to a door of mother-of-pearl, which had a golden <b>lock,</b> an alabaster <b>knob,</b> and a diamond key-hole. It turned easily on silver hinges, and the Prince passed by it into a beautiful garden. He had never been in such a place of loveliness. The trees were hung with many soft-colored lamps, and the fruit glittered and shone in gorgeous colors on the branches. Every night-bird sang, and every night-flower was giving forth its fragrance. In the middle of the garden was a fountain, the waters of which rose in a single jet from the centre, and then, as they fell back into the basin, each of their thousand drops struck upon a silver harp-string, causing the most delightful sounds to fill the air, and mingle with the songs of the birds and the perfume of the flowers. Around the great basin were silken cushions on which the Prince reclined, and the goldfish that were swimming in the basin came up to him to be fed. There also came the ruby fish, that shines as red as blood, and the zimphare, or transparent fish, which is as colorless as the water, and can only be discovered by a green knot on its head and another on its tail.|$|R

In the history of thousand of years human beings, {{one of the most}} important objectives of is constructing the naturalhabitation based on their needs. Just like all the living things in nature, mankind also effort a lot to protect themselves from thenatural envoirement conditions. In the history of residence which originated with the humanitarian history, starting from thedwellings carved into the rocks, the residence culture brought from Central Asia survived at the residence of Ottoman era and thevery best samples of Turkish Residence Architecture builted during this age. Residental Architecture in late period of OttamanEmpire has gained a new dimension with the foreign decoration style. The traditional identity shaped by the cultural values brought from Central Asia that are melted togetwer with the severalcultures in Anatolia as well as the the influence of Islam. The urban architecture and ornamentation effected by the provincialcapital style has never been studied so far. The folk architecture has survived as a matter of distictive subject. Our study of OldTurkish Houses covers Ilvat and neighborhood villages also consist of the village houses in Buyuk Ilvat, Belen Ilvat, Bucak Ilvatand Sarihacilar. The regional houses,feature more traditional characteristic, are explored and evaluated for the first time with this studyemerged as the best samples of folk architectured displayed. The houses in our study evaluated by taking into considerataion the material, construction technique, project and ornamentstyles. The main raw material in the construction of these regional housed are stone and timber. Metals as raw metarial is notcommon. Metals can be seen on window fences, door <b>knobs,</b> <b>lock</b> and hinges. Brick almost never used at any houses explored. The top cover of the houses are Turkish Style roof tiles. The plaster used in coating the oven and the fixture of illuminant. The soil only used in grout which is no longer available. The building structures constructed by the matarials widely available in theregion. While all the walls in the house builted with the groutless dry wall technique that is wooden beams mounted between therubble stones and compressed peşdunavs, in the resort part of the houses wooden curtain walls can be seen. The upper cover ofthe house is pitched roof and coated with Turkish Style roof tiles. Carriers such as console units, hands in hips and wooden pillarsused in the ascent, eaves, restrooms and summerhouses. Soil and Stone furnishings can be seen in the courtyard and ground floorof the house whereas the upper floors completely made of timber. Almost all the doors of the houses in the region made ofwooden. The courtyard and main entences doors are double-winged, room doors are single and multilayer. The sighseeingwindows of the regional houses are latticed inside and shuttered outside. The room Windows ar evice versa (latticed outside andshuttered inside). The connection between the floors done by the wooden stairways. The houses in Akseki Ilvat and Sarihacilar village can be classified into three groups according to project types. As well as the climate and natural conditions the influential folk architecture has a great effect on formation of the projecttypes. The basic spaces form the project are hall and the rooms. The first type houses are the most comman ones with outer hall. Those houses are also divided into 2 groups as ouetr hall with eyvan and outer hall without eyvan. Ouetr hall with eyvan projecttype houses are generally constructed by highly welfared individuals and regulated for crowded families. Compared to the otherhouses the number of rooms and the ornamentary increased. Second type houses are the ones with iner halls. Third types are theones with middle hall. The last two types are not comman in practice in the region. The execution of those two project types areseen only in one sample. Generally the basic element forms the front-line in the region is the overhangs. These overhangs areembodied according the direction of the halls. Can be grouped as overhangs on the right, overhangs on the left and overhangs inthe middle acording to the location of the averhangs based on the enterence door. The overhangs are carried by wooden pillarsand hand in hips. The cover of the overhangs are laid with tiles regardless of the roof. The windows of the overhangs aregenerally latticed with outer shutter. The windows of the overhangs decareted with lattices are distinguished with different typesof lattices. Some lattices divided into four trays and an observation window is built. Some lattices are built complete and there areskylight windows above. Room windows are rectangular lattice form and shuttered inside. The double-wing and multilayerenterence door of the houses placed under the overhangs. Eaves of the houses is made of timber and the outside ornaments areplain. One of the important element in the front-line is the chimneys. The chimneys are squared stone masonry and conical hat. The summerhouses is another element that activates the front-line. The summerhouses are open air places that are carried bywooden pillars. In the explored houses the interior decoration has wider application area, the outside ornament is more modest. The outerornament is concentrated on overhangs and windows, the interior ornament can be seen on pavilion, room doors, ceilings,cupboards and wardrobes as an accurate samples. Almost every room of the regional houses has a cupboard closet. Generally the top of the cupboard and closets are divided bytimber trays and the inside of the trays left blank. The bigger houses constructed by higher income individuals the timber trays ofcupborad and closet are filled with herbal charesteristic decorative motives. In interior decoration specifically the room doors has accurate ornament features. These single-wing doors are divided bytimber trays on top. The insdie of the timber trays are decorated by geometric and herbal forms ornament motives. Just like in the cupboards there is timber tray ornament in the open cabinets in the top of the rooms. The inside of the traysare sometimes kept blank and sometimes decorated with rose motifs and four leaf clover. One of the most important areas in theornament of the room is ceilings. The room ceilings in the regional houses are generally flat timber with lower hammerset. A hubin the shape of eight or rarely six armed star form placed in the middle of the ceiling which is perpendicularly divided to squaresby timber laths. In the middle of the hub there are motives of eight armed star narrowing throught the center, branch and rarelystylized tulip. In the center heaven fruit pomegranate, the symbol of abundance and blessing, appliquied as embossed. It can beseen ellips and round ceilings in some houses, howevere the comman ones are the flat ceilings hubbed with eight armed star. Round ceilings generally filled with timber strips in a shape of sun disc motive. When compared to plain and sloppy constructed urban houses, the regional houses built highly ornate and elaborate. Althought the regional houses are a product of folk architecture, refletcs the capital fashion in project type, front line allignment,glamorious and ornaments. The main reason is because of the finacial power and the status of the owners. The local craftsmen,lived in the region and experinced the capital fashion, had a great role in evolving this synthesis architecture. Houses mostlyconstructed in early 20. Centuryare being restored along with the Akseki-Ibradi Disctrict Development Plan. The restored housedare really in good conditions. Only the repairs done by the owners do not resulted succesfully. Those repiars cause the loss oforiginality. Nowadays, those houses, especially the non resident ones, which have great importance in Traditional ResidentArchitecture are abandoned to the wild circumtances of nature...|$|R
