5|$|Efforts {{to keep a}} person's {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} below somewhere between 140 and 160 mmHg is generally recommended. Medications to achieve this may include <b>labetalol</b> or nicardipine.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is by prompt {{neurosurgery}} or radiologically guided interventions. Medications such as <b>labetalol</b> may {{be required}} to lower the blood pressure until repair can occur. Efforts to treat fevers are also recommended. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is frequently used to prevent vasospasm. Routine use medications to prevent further seizures is of unclear benefit. Nearly half of people with a SAH due to an underlying aneurysm die within 30 days and about a third who survive have ongoing problems. 10–15 percent die before reaching a hospital.|$|E
25|$|Beta2-adrenergic agonist acts on beta-2 {{receptor}} {{to drive}} potassium into the cells. Therefore, beta blockers {{can cause the}} rise in potassium levels due to blockage of beta-2 receptors. However, the rise potassium levels is not marked unless there are other co-morbidities present. Examples of drugs that can raise the serum potassium are non-selective beta-blockers such as propanolol and <b>labetalol.</b> Beta-1 selective blockers such as atenolol do not increase serum potassium levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} in β-blocker development {{led to the}} introduction of drugs with variety of properties. β-blockers were developed having a relative selectivity for cardiac β1-receptors (for example metoprolol and atenolol), partial adrenergic agonist activity (pindolol), concomitant α-adrenergic blocking activity (for example <b>labetalol</b> and carvedilol) and additional direct vasodilator activity (nebivolol). In addition, long-acting and ultra-short formulations of β-blockers were developed. In 1988, Sir James Black was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on drug development.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} pharmacokinetics, {{cimetidine}} in particular interferes {{with some of}} the body's mechanisms of drug metabolism and elimination through the liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway. To be specific, cimetidine is an inhibitor of the P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4. By reducing the metabolism of drugs through these enzymes, cimetidine may increase their serum concentrations to toxic levels. Many drugs are affected, including warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, lidocaine, quinidine, propranolol, <b>labetalol,</b> metoprolol, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, some benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, sulfonylureas, metronidazole, and some recreational drugs such as ethanol and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).|$|E
2500|$|The {{autonomic}} {{effects of}} tetanus {{can be difficult}} to manage (alternating hyper- and hypotension hyperpyrexia/hypothermia) and may require IV <b>labetalol,</b> magnesium, clonidine, or nifedipine ...|$|E
2500|$|Beta {{blockers}} are the first-line {{treatment for}} patients with acute and chronic aortic dissection. [...] In acute dissection, rapidly acting, titratable parenteral agents (such as esmolol, propranolol, or <b>labetalol)</b> are preferred. [...] Vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside can be considered {{for patients with}} ongoing hypertension, but they should never be used alone, as they generally cause reflex tachycardia.|$|E
50|$|Long term <b>labetalol</b> use {{also has}} {{different}} effects from other beta-blocking drugs. Other beta-blockers, such as propranolol, persistently reduce cardiac output during exercise. The peripheral vascular resistance decreases when <b>labetalol</b> is first administered. Continuous <b>labetalol</b> use further decreases peripheral vascular resistance. However, during exercise, cardiac output {{remains the same}} due to a compensatory mechanism that increases stroke volume. Thus, <b>labetalol</b> is able to reduce heart rate during exercise while maintaining cardiac output by the increase in stroke volume.|$|E
50|$|Geriatric: The {{elderly are}} more likely to {{experience}} dizziness when taking <b>labetalol.</b> <b>Labetalol</b> should be dosed with caution in the elderly and counseled on this side effect.|$|E
50|$|Nursing: Breast milk {{has been}} shown to contain small amounts of <b>labetalol</b> (0.004% {{original}} dose). Prescribers should be cautious in the use of <b>labetalol</b> for nursing mothers.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to local}} anesthetics and sodium channel {{blocking}} antiarrhythmics, <b>labetalol</b> also has membrane stabilizing activity. By decreasing sodium entry, <b>labetalol</b> decreases action potential firing and thus has local anesthetic activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} alpha to beta {{blockade}} {{depends on whether}} <b>labetalol</b> is administered orally or intravenously (IV). Orally, the ratio of alpha to β blockade is 1:3. Intravenously, alpha to β blockade ratio is 1:7. Thus, the <b>labetalol</b> can be {{thought to be a}} beta-blocker with some alpha-blocking effects. By comparison, <b>labetalol</b> is a weaker β-blocker than propranolol, and has a weaker affinity for alpha-receptors compared to Phentolamine.|$|E
50|$|The {{physiological}} {{effects of}} <b>labetalol</b> when administered acutely (intravenously) are not predictable solely by their receptor blocking effect, i.e. blocking beta1- receptors should decrease heart rate, but <b>labetalol</b> does not. When <b>labetalol</b> {{is given in}} acute situations, it decreases the peripheral vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure while having {{little effect on the}} heart rate, cardiac output and stroke volume, despite its alpha1-, beta1- and beta2- blocking mechanism. These effects are mainly seen when the person is in the upright position.|$|E
50|$|<b>Labetalol</b> {{possesses}} intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In particular, it is {{a partial}} agonist at beta2- receptors {{located in the}} vascular smooth muscle. <b>Labetalol</b> relaxes vascular smooth muscle {{by a combination of}} this partial beta2- agonism and through alpha1- blockade. Overall, this vasodilatory effect can decrease blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|The mixed beta/alpha blocker <b>labetalol</b> {{has been}} shown to be safe and {{effective}} for treating concomitant cocaine-induced hypertension and tachycardia, without any “unopposed alpha-stimulation” adverse events recorded. The use of <b>labetalol</b> is approved by a recent AHA/ACC guideline for cocaine and methamphetamine patients with unstable angina/non-STEMI.|$|E
50|$|The β:α {{antagonism}} of <b>labetalol</b> {{is approximately}} 3:1.|$|E
50|$|The agents {{carvedilol}} and <b>labetalol</b> {{are both}} α- and &beta;-blockers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Labetalol</b> is a dual alpha (α1) and beta (β1/β2) {{adrenergic}} receptor blocker and competes with other Catecholamines for binding to these sites. Its action on these receptors are potent and reversible. <b>Labetalol</b> is highly selective for postsynaptic alpha1- adrenergic, and non-selective for beta-{{adrenergic receptor}}s. It is about equipotent in blocking both beta1- and beta2- receptors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Labetalol,</b> first {{generation}} of beta blockers propranolol, second generation of beta blockers atenolol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Labetalol,</b> {{in animal}} models, {{was found to}} cross the blood-brain-barrier in only {{negligible}} amounts.|$|E
50|$|Labetalol's dual alpha and beta {{adrenergic}} antagonism {{has different}} physiological effects in short- and long-term situations. In short-term, acute situations, <b>labetalol</b> decreases blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance with {{little effect on}} stroke volume, heart rate and cardiac output. During long-term use, <b>labetalol</b> can reduce heart rate during exercise while maintaining cardiac output {{by an increase in}} stroke volume.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Labetalol</b> - an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker, {{given as}} an {{intravenous}} bolus or infusion. Bolus followed by infusion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Labetalol</b> has two chiral carbons and {{consequently}} exists as four stereoisomers. Two of these isomers, the (S,S)- and (R,S)- forms are inactive. The third, the (S,R)-isomer, {{is a powerful}} α1 blocker. The fourth isomer, the (R,R)-isomer which {{is also known as}} dilevalol, is a mixed nonselective β blocker and selective α1 blocker. <b>Labetalol</b> is typically given as a racemic mixture to achieve both alpha and beta receptor blocking activity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Labetalol</b> is {{effective}} {{in the management of}} hypertensive emergencies, postoperative hypertension, pheochromocytoma-associated hypertension, and rebound hypertension from beta blocker withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|Some beta {{blockers}} (e.g., <b>labetalol</b> and carvedilol) exhibit mixed antagonism of both β- and α1-adrenergic receptors, which provides additional arteriolar vasodilating action.|$|E
5000|$|Antipsychotics such as {{haloperidol}} {{are useful}} in treating agitation and psychosis from methamphetamine overdose. Beta blockers with lipophilic properties and CNS penetration such as metoprolol and <b>labetalol</b> may be useful for treating CNS and cardiovascular toxicity. The mixed alpha- and beta-blocker <b>labetalol</b> is especially useful for treatment of concomitant tachycardia and hypertension induced by methamphetamine. The phenomenon of [...] "unopposed alpha stimulation" [...] has not been reported {{with the use of}} beta-blockers for treatment of methamphetamine toxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Labetalol</b> acts by {{blocking}} alpha and beta adrenergic receptors, resulting in decreased peripheral vascular resistance without significant alteration of heart rate or cardiac output.|$|E
5000|$|The {{autonomic}} {{effects of}} tetanus {{can be difficult}} to manage (alternating hyper- and hypotension hyperpyrexia/hypothermia) and may require IV <b>labetalol,</b> magnesium, clonidine, or nifedipine ...|$|E
50|$|Drug {{treatment}} options are limited, as many antihypertensives may negatively affect the fetus. Methyldopa, hydralazine, and <b>labetalol</b> are {{most commonly used}} for severe pregnancy hypertension.|$|E
50|$|Efforts {{to keep a}} person's {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} below somewhere between 140 and 160 mmHg is generally recommended. Medications to achieve this may include <b>labetalol</b> or nicardipine.|$|E
50|$|The {{agents of}} choice for blood {{pressure}} control during eclampsia are hydralazine and/or <b>labetalol.</b> This is because of their effectiveness, lack of negative effects on the fetus, and mechanism of action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Labetalol</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with overt cardiac failure, greater-than-first-degree heart block, severe bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, severe hypotension, anyone {{with a history of}} obstructive airway disease including asthma, and those with hypersensitivity to the drug.|$|E
50|$|The minimum {{requirement}} for adrenergic agents {{is a primary}} or secondary amine separated from a substituted benzene ring by one or two carbons. This configuration results in strong agonist activity. As {{the size of the}} substituent attached to the amine becomes greater, particularly with respect to a t-butyl group, then the molecule typically is found to have receptor affinity without intrinsic activity, and is, therefore, an antagonist. <b>Labetalol,</b> with its 1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl substituted amine, is greater in size relative to a t-butyl group and therefore acts predominantly as an antagonist. The overall structure of <b>labetalol</b> is very polar. This was created by substituting the isopropyl group in the standard beta-blocker structure with an aralkyl group, including a carboxamide group on the meta position, and by adding a hydroxyl group on the para position.|$|E
50|$|<b>Labetalol</b> is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} high blood pressure. It can be given intravenously in severe hypertensive situations, or by mouth for long term hypertension management. Its dose and use is limited by its main side effect—postural hypotension, {{where there is a}} substantial drop in blood pressure when standing up.|$|E
50|$|Some beta {{blockers}} (e.g. oxprenolol, pindolol, penbutolol, <b>labetalol</b> and acebutolol) exhibit intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). These agents {{are capable of}} exerting low-level agonist activity at the β-adrenergic receptor while simultaneously acting as a receptor site antagonist. These agents, therefore, {{may be useful in}} individuals exhibiting excessive bradycardia with sustained beta blocker therapy.|$|E
50|$|Beta {{blockers}} are the first-line {{treatment for}} patients with acute and chronic aortic dissection. In acute dissection, rapidly acting, titratable parenteral agents (such as esmolol, propranolol, or <b>labetalol)</b> are preferred. Vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside can be considered {{for patients with}} ongoing hypertension, but they should never be used alone, as they generally cause reflex tachycardia.|$|E
