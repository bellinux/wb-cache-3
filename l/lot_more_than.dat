But {{the next day they}} had regained confidence and ordered Guderian's XIX Panzer Corps to press north and push on to the Channel ports of Boulogne and Calais, {{in the back of the}} British and Allied forces to the north.|$|E
25|$|High school {{students}} in every riding in Ontario were allowed to cast ballots in their classrooms {{as part of a}} student vote. While their numbers did not count in the official election, they did tell a story all on their own. The student vote reflected change a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the actual result, as well as widespread anti-conservatism. 93 ridings favoured the Liberals in the student vote, nine favoured the New Democrats, and one favoured the Greens, while the Conservatives were shut out. There was also a vote for elementary students.|$|E
25|$|Although Packer's {{reputation}} as an astute businessman was legendary and he made some good investments, he {{was by no means}} a self-made man – his grandfather Robert Clyde Packer and his father Sir Frank Packer had built up the media empire and its related holdings over many decades.

25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> that.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{splicing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important components that show functional complexity of genome. Modified splicing has significant effect on the phenotype that is relevance to disease or drug metabolism. A change in splicing can be caused by modifying any of the components of the splicing machinery such as splice sites or splice enhancers or silencers. Modification in the alternative splicing site can lead to a different protein form which will show a different function. Humans use an estimated 100,000 different proteins or more, so some genes must be capable of coding for a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just one protein. Alternative splicing occurs more frequently than was previously thought and can be hard to control; genes may produce tens of thousands of different transcripts, necessitating a new gene model for each alternative splice.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} is best understood and {{is almost always}} broken up into four groups and then looking at how architecture changed or didn’t change within those groups. The four groups are: May, Satunsat, and Ah Canul/Canul and Dzib. These groups make up the urban center, and are almost exclusively monumental architecture. They were defined by the excavation team and they’re essentially just a cluster of buildings, or a building (Madrid, 1991). There’s a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just these four groups; the rest just hasn’t been excavated really, since {{there was such a}} heavy focus on excavating monumental architecture. Most of what’s been excavated at Oxkintok is temples, palaces, and multiroom structures. To trace the changes in architecture of the site, the above chart (Fig. 7) was compiled. It’s a compilation of data from the three sources listed below figure 7. It is evident that there are lots of major changes between the three periods, and in general it's a transition from irregular design to a more elaborate, very planned out geometric design with decoration and complex stucco art and stone wrought decorations. One thing that remains consistent the use of domes and arches for entryways and open spaces. Concerning the individual groups, there's a concentration of Proto Puuc in the Ah-Canul group and Early Oxkintok in the May group that was later modified in the Proto Puuc phase, but no group is confined to one phase.|$|E

Production of Mighty Heroes ended when Bakshi left Terrytoons.|$|E

500|$|In March 1970, the {{two houses}} reached a {{compromise}} whereby 150 million dollars would be {{struck in the}} 40% silver alloy for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities. The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors' pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, {{with the aid of}} Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as [...] "a lot less than the country deserves, but a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> it appeared we would get". The reason for having a collector's edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.|$|E
