On the other hand, other high-index surfaces, especially GaAs(n 11), have received significant attention and hosted wide range of InGaAs nanostructures with distinguished functions. For example, InGaAs quantum wires are observed on GaAs(311)A and a unique growth mode is revealed, starting from 2 D, through 1 D, and finally leading to 3 D [9].

40|$|When {{assembling}} micro-optical instruments, a goal is {{the positioning}} of the elements with permissible deviations in the sub-micrometer-range and angle deviations smaller than a few seconds. In manufacturing a well-known fact is, that the attitude of an object can be exactly changed by applying momentum to its end. This idea was developed further by Fraunhofer Institute, Jena into an effective and universal principle of adjustment for miniaturized components in precision engineering and in microoptics. In contrast to conventional adjustment methods, the component to be adjusted is immobilized with the final prestressing force before the adjustment process starts. Then, specific momentums generated by an electromagnetic striking mechanism are transmitted to the immobilized component. The result of the impact against the object are stepped movements in form of lateral or fine angular motions caused by the momentum transfer and by the stick-slip-effect. Depending on the mechanical arrangem ent minimum incremental motions better than 150 nm or 0. 3 arcsec are achieved. Different prototypes of intelligent striking mechanisms have been investigated and optimized. The attitude of the object to be adjusted is determined by a measuring system and fed back into a computer (numerical control system). The combination of eight strike magnets and a PC-based algorithm allow fast and exact {{positioning of the}} components fibre/fibre or fibre/opto-electronic sensor. The described prototypes enable angular adjustments of components (for example mirror mount) with accuracy better than 1, 0 arc sec, <b>lateral</b> <b>alignments</b> with accuracy better than 300 nm and inexpensive solutions to adjustment problems.

50|$|St. Marien is a three-aisled hall church {{without a}} transept. The main aisle is three bays long. The bays {{in the central}} nave are {{slightly}} rectangular. Both side aisles are four bays deep, these having a slight oblong shape. The central nave is separated from the side aisles by archways consisting of large compound piers. The extension of the side aisles by one bay each enables {{the inclusion of the}} western tower in the interior architecture. On the eastern side, the nearly-quadratic hall is appended by the polygon-shaped basilican chancel. Attached to the chancel on the north side is the quadratic sacristy, covering four bays. This has four arches, all buttressed by one central compound pier. The Gothic hall is overlaid by ribbed vaults. The nave is 20.56 metres long in total, which represents only a slight difference from the length and width measurements (roughly 25.5 and 24.5 metres respectively). This gives the nave an almost-cubical shape. The central nave is only slightly wider than the side aisles. This results in merely a weak accentuation of the longitudinal axis of the church. The bays of the side aisles counteract this slight longitudinal alignment by opening up their broadsides to the central nave, thus emphasising the <b>lateral</b> <b>alignment.</b> This gives the impression of undirected space. St. Marien is thus characterised by the overall appearance of its nave.|$|E

40|$|Type I {{and type}} II keratins form {{obligatory}} heterodimers, which self- assemble into 10 -nm intermediate filaments (IFs). Like all IF proteins, {{they have a}} central alpha-helical rod domain, flanked by nonhelical head and tail domains. The IF rod is more highly conserved than head and tail, and within the rod, the carboxy R/K L L E G E sequence is more highly conserved than most other regions. Mutagenesis studies have {{shed some light on}} the roles of the head, tail, and R/K L L E G E sequence in 10 -nm filament structure. However, interpretations have often been complicated in part because many of these studies have focused on transfected cells, where filament structure cannot be evaluated. Of the few in vitro assembly studies thus far conducted, comparison of keratin mutants with other IF mutants have often been difficult, due to the obligatory heteropolymeric nature of keratin IFs. In this report, we describe in vitro filament assembly studies on headless, tailless, headless/tailless, and R/K L L E G E truncated mutants of keratin 5 and its partner keratin 14. Using varying conditions of ionic strength and pH, we examine effects of analogous K 5 and K 14 mutations on the stability of 10 -nm filament structure. Using EM, we examine effects of mutations on the ability of subunits/protofibrils to (a) elongate and (b) laterally associate. Our results demonstrate that (a) tails of K 5 and K 14 are required for filament stabilization; (b) the head of K 5, but not of K 14, is required for filament elongation and lateral alignments; and (c) the R/K L L E G E domains are required for <b>lateral</b> <b>alignments,</b> but not for filament elongation...|$|R

50|$|Callbach‚Äôs {{church was}} first built in 1334, {{but over the}} course of history it has several times been {{destroyed}} and then built over again. In 1782, after a third reconstruction by the Ducal Zweibr√ºcken Building Director Friedrich Gerhard Wahl, the aisleless church assumed its current shape. Held at the church are services of the Evangelical faith, whose members make up a majority of some 80% in the village. The rectangular building rises on a slope overlooking Kirchstra√üe (‚ÄúChurch Street‚Äù), and access thereto is gained by way of a stairway up to a portal. Because of the sloped site, the church is underpinned in part by a simple vaulted cellar. The cellar‚Äôs fa√ßade towards the street is faced with sandstone blocks. The building as a whole follows the east-west orientation that is traditionally typical of church buildings. The monochromatically white plastered fa√ßade with its shaped elements in the Classicist style is framed by corner lesenes made of natural stone. The portal and the windows along the middle axis and a gable with a round window accentuate this straight-lined entrance fa√ßade. Beginning in 1993, the church - which is a parish church - was renovated in two phases. The exterior was done in 1993-1995, while the interior was done in 1998-1999. The overhaul and conversion brought into existence a newly structured multifunctional space inside the church. The inside, with its new colour scheme, now also offers rooms that may be used for various functions and purposes. The new spatial concept made it necessary to rearrange the seating and the original <b>lateral</b> <b>alignment</b> to the altar and the pulpit along the aisleless church‚Äôs side wall. The stone slabs on the church floor with their signs of wear, the pews and the simple wooden table altar were overhauled and restored. A sandstone stele with a gilt baptismal font made according to current designs completes the church‚Äôs furnishings. The building-in of a kitchenette, chair storage, a lavatory facility and rooms with movable walls allow the parishioners to arrange the space for the most varied of occasions. Besides the church services and liturgical exercises, the church is also used for meetings and cultural events.|$|E

40|$|All ES evolve as {{the result}} of {{stakeholder}} decisions and decision processes that affect their design and operation. These decision making problems often involve many stakeholders, each of whom have a say in the outcome. This has been termed a <b>lateral</b> <b>alignment</b> problem, as opposed to a unitary decision making problem. <b>Lateral</b> <b>alignment</b> focuses on group decision making where stakeholders are nominally organizationally independent, interact to maximize their own goals and simultaneously a common goal, and who are able to influence decision outcomes to varying degrees through power and influence. Previous work in the relevant literatures has focused on two variants used to assess and model group decision making. Type 0 Group Decision problems involve anonymous voting, where stakeholders do not interact. Type 1 Group Decision problems involve non-cooperative interaction where stakeholders try to maximize their self-interest through negotiation. We define the <b>lateral</b> <b>alignment</b> problem as a Type 2 Group Decision problem, which involve elements of both non-cooperative and cooperative behavior. Type 2 Group Decisions have not been fully treated in the existing literatures. In this thesis, we evaluate a prototype Type 2 Group Decisions: the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) from 1970 - 1994 as a test case. One major advantage of studying the FOMC is the availability of data and relevant analytical published work. Our original empirical findings include: 1. Information ambiguity is the major factor that impacts coalition dynamics, via the number of starting bids, in FOMC decision making. 2. Deliberation time is directly determined by information ambiguity and the relationship is the same across chairmen eras. 3. Decision efficacy falls off gradually as information ambiguity increases. (cont.) 4. Members whose past views are best reflected as correct in hindsight appear to build up reputation and have greater influence on decision outcomes. We also develop an agent based model (ABM) to study the FOMC. As we show, the ABM is very effective at predicting observables of the FOMC decision making process. These observables are: 1. Membership in the Winning Coalition. 2. Number of Bargaining Rounds. 3. Decision Outcomes. 4. The Number of Starting Bids.

40|$|Spontaneous {{release of}} {{neurotransmitter}} {{has been demonstrated}} in various types of synapses. Its physiological significance, however, is still unknown. In nerve-muscle cultures of embryonic Xenopus laevis, we observed that acetylcholine, which is released spontaneously at the synaptic terminal, caused frequent twitches of muscle cells. These muscle cells developed cross-striations earlier than neighboring non-twitching cells. This effect of innervation was unaffected by tetrodotoxin but was blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin. Repeated iontophoretic application of acetylcholine or KCl to muscle cells caused twitches and also accelerated the formation of cross-striations. Thus twitching apparently promotes <b>lateral</b> <b>alignment</b> of myofibrils. It is also known that myosin synthesis is higher in twitching muscle cells.

40|$|For many optical systems the {{properties}} and {{alignment of the}} internal apertures and pupils are not critical or controlled with high precision during optical system design, fabrication or assembly. In wide angle imaging systems, for instance, the entrance pupil position and orientation is typically unconstrained and varies over the system s field of view in order to optimize image quality. Aperture tolerances usually do not receive {{the same amount of}} scrutiny as optical surface aberrations or throughput characteristics because performance degradation is typically graceful with misalignment, generally only causing a slight reduction in system sensitivity due to vignetting. But for a large deployable space-based observatory like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we have found that pupil alignment is a key parameter. For in addition to vignetting, JWST pupil errors cause uncertainty in the wavefront sensing process that is used to construct the observatory on-orbit. Furthermore they also open stray light paths that degrade the science return from some of the telescope s instrument channels. In response to these consequences, we have developed several pupil measurement techniques for the cryogenic vacuum test where JWST science instrument pupil alignment is verified. These approaches use pupil alignment references within the JWST science instruments; pupil imaging lenses in three science instrument channels; and unique pupil characterization features in the optical test equipment.

InGaAs QDs conventionally grown on on-axis (100)-GaAs substrates are optically active and typically emit in the 1.0 to 1.3 eV range [2]. Those grown unconventionally - on high-index substrates [3], pre-patterned layers [4], or cross-hatch patterns [5 ‚Äì 9] - exhibit similar optical characteristics with a possibility to obtain <b>lateral</b> QD <b>alignment,</b> further expanding the range of optoelectronic applications which includes lasers [10] and detectors [11]. These QDs are usually embedded in a junction/mirror structure and have to be overgrown by GaAs or AlGaAs. The active (QD) and overgrown layers, however, have different growth temperature requirements: QDs growth temperature is low (approximately 470 ¬∞C to 520 ¬∞C) to prevent In desorption, but subsequent overlayer growth temperature is high (580 ¬∞C and above), especially if the layer contains slow-diffusing species such as Al. The fundamental difference in growth temperature requirements and its inevitability lead to extensive investigation of the properties of InGaAs QDs annealed in situ [12 ‚Äì 15] and ex situ [15 ‚Äì 21]. In terms of luminescence, it is well established that conventional InGaAs QDs that underwent annealing would: (1) exhibit a blueshift in their ground-state emission, (2) have narrower linewidth, and, in some cases, (3) emit at an increased intensity due to interdiffusion and intermixing of cations and the reduction in non-radiative recombination centers in the surrounding matrix [13 ‚Äì 20]. Annealing studies of unconventional InGaAs QDs such as those grown on InGaAs metamorphic or cross-hatch patterns (CHPs), however, have received much less attention, partly because of the perceived inferiority due to the presence of misfit dislocations (MDs) at the InGaAs/GaAs heterointerface [22] and partly because the full explanation of the rich optical features of these types of QDs is still lacking.|$|R
