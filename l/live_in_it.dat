5|$|Shirley {{resolves}} {{to complete}} a ritual to fully become the Merines and fulfill her destiny, meeting with Walter and the Ferines leader Maurits Welnes. However, soldiers from the country of Gadoria attack during the ceremony attempting to kill her thinking she willfully sided with Vaclav, with Fenimore jumping {{in the way of}} one of their blades and dying instead. The traumatic event causes Shirley to be fully engulfed by Nerifes, the malevolent spirit of the ocean itself, before leaving with Maurits. Senel and his friends go after her, passing through the deeper areas of the ship where they discover from fractured recordings that the Legacy was a colony ship from another world, and the Ferines came to the planet and made war with the Orerines 4000 years ago. Arriving at Maurits' stronghold, the party faces Walter, who reveals his jealousy over Shirley choosing Senel over him, and fights until his life gives out. They learn from Maurits that it was in fact the Orerines, not the Ferines, who are the outsiders. He explains that the Orerines' terraforming technology upset the will of the sea so much that his people can no longer <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> and wishes to use Shirley to flood the world and appease the ocean so that the Ferines can thrive once more. After he is beaten and Shirley brought back to her senses, Maurits summons a physical manifestation of Nerifes itself, which is driven back by Senel and his friends. In the end, Maurits resolves to put aside old hatreds and work towards an era of peace between Orerines and Ferines as the characters return to their old lives.|$|E

25|$|Hobart Ison {{was born}} in 1897. His family had moved to Kentucky in the late 19th century, and their wealth was tied to land. During the coal boom of the 1920s, Ison owned several local {{businesses}} including a car dealership. However, he lost everything during the Great Depression except the land he had inherited. Ison was often described as eccentric. A lifelong bachelor, {{he had once been}} engaged, but his fiancee called off the wedding. Ison had already built a home for them, and chose to leave it unoccupied for 30 years rather than <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> or rent it.|$|E
25|$|In 1873 {{he was one}} of {{the founders}} of Mea Shearim, whose name he coined.

In each neighborhood he supervised the purchase and construction of homes and assisted home buyers in acquiring loans. He also helped establish community institutions and spoke in the local synagogue. One of his sermons inspired a wealthy philanthropist named David Reiss to underwrite the founding of another neighborhood, Beit David, in 1873.|$|E

He protected himself from attackers by constructing a high wall around his home and paying a Turkish soldier and, later, an Arab guard, {{to keep an eye on}} him. He insisted that his wife remain in the Old City, while another Jew boarded with him. Until more homeowners moved in two and a half years later, he returned to his wife only on Shabbat. In 1872 the neighborhood was sufficiently populated that Rivlin brought his wife to live with him.|$|E
25|$|Max Weber {{and some}} schools of {{modernization}} theory suggest that cultural values could affect economic success. However, researchers have gathered evidence {{that suggest that}} values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement {{into and out of}} poverty, as opposed to shifts in values. Studies have shown that poverty changes the personalities of children who <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> The Great Smoky Mountains Study was a ten-year study that was unexpectedly able to demonstrate this. During the study, about one-quarter of the families saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in income. The study showed that among these children, instances of behavioral and emotional disorders decreased, and conscientiousness and agreeableness increased.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, {{industrialisation}} in Germany must {{be considered}} to have been positive in its effects. Not only did it change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern world we <b>live</b> <b>in.</b> <b>It</b> solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, {{in terms of social}} inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, 'alienation', new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare.|$|E

500|$|If {{the carbon}} in {{freshwater}} is partly acquired from aged carbon, such as rocks, then {{the result will}} be a reduction in the / ratio in the water. For example, rivers that pass over limestone, which is mostly composed of calcium carbonate, will acquire carbonate ions. Similarly, groundwater can contain carbon derived from the rocks through which it has passed. These rocks are usually so old that they no longer contain any measurable , so this carbon lowers the / ratio of the water it enters, which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> This is known as the hard water effect because it is often associated with calcium ions, which are characteristic of hard water; other sources of carbon such as humus can produce similar results. [...] The effect varies greatly and there is no general offset that can be applied; additional research is usually needed to determine the size of the offset, for example by comparing the radiocarbon age of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material.|$|E
500|$|Ericsson {{originally}} made no {{submission to}} the board, but became involved when Cornelius Bushnell, the {{sponsor of the}} proposal that became the armored sloop , needed to have his design reviewed by a naval constructor. The board required a guarantee from Bushnell that his ship would float despite the weight of its armor and Cornelius H. DeLamater of New York City recommended that Bushnell consult with his friend Ericsson. The two first met on 9 September and again on the following day, after Ericsson had time to evaluate Galenas design. During this second meeting Ericsson showed Bushnell a model of his own design, the future Monitor, derived from his 1854 design. Bushnell got Ericsson's permission to show the model to Welles, who told Bushnell {{to show it to}} the board. Upon review of Ericsson's unusual design, the board was skeptical, concerned that such a vessel would not float, especially in rough seas, and rejected the proposal of a completely iron laden ship. President Lincoln, who had also examined the design, overruled them. Ericsson assured the board his ship would float exclaiming, [...] "The sea shall ride over her and she shall <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> like a duck". On 15 September, after further deliberations, the board accepted Ericsson's proposal. The Ironclad Board evaluated 17 different designs, but recommended only three for procurement on 16 September, including Ericsson's Monitor design.|$|E
500|$|Comedian Ed Byrne {{performed}} a skit {{in which he}} jokingly attacked the song for its lack of ironies: [...] "The only ironic thing about that song is it's called 'Ironic' and it's written {{by a woman who}} doesn't know what irony is. That's quite ironic." [...] Also, satirists Berger and Wyse parodied the song in one segment of their cartoon strip The Pitchers. In that episode, a superhero named [...] "Irony Man" [...] compared his superpowers to lyrics from Morissette's song, causing his cohorts to rename him [...] "The Man from Alanis". In December 2009, the comedy website CollegeHumor released a spoof video of the song called [...] "Actually Ironic", featuring actress Sarah Natochenny, in which Patrick Cassels amended the lyrics in a form that would be appropriately ironic. The CollegeHumor spoof was replicated in July 2013 by sisters Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz, from New York City, who published their version on YouTube. The sisters sing the line [...] "We fixed it for you, Alanis. You're welcome." [...] throughout their [...] "It's Finally Ironic" [...] video.
