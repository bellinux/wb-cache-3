40|$|The {{white bass}} were {{probably}} originally stocked in Spirit Lake, northwestern Iowa, {{in the last}} 50 years and were not native to these waters. The numbers have shown great fluctuations over the years. The field work {{for the present study}} covered the period 1941 to 1946. Spirit Lake is a shallow, rich, hard water, eutrophic lake not exceeding 23 feet in depth. Potamogeton richardsonii and Scirpus acutus are the dominant deep-water plants. In general, young pan and game fish amounted to a very large percentage of all of the small fish in the lake during the years 1941, 1942, 1943, 1945 and 1946. The young of yellow perch, black crappie, white crappie, bluegill and black bullhead constituted all of the small pan fish for these years. Young white bass were quite common in 1942; young <b>large-mouth</b> black <b>bass</b> were common in 1943, 1945 and 1946. The number of small pan fish was always many times greater than that of the young game fish. Adult yellow perch and black bullhead were very abundant for every year considered. The age and growth of the individual white bass were determined by the scale method. The body-scale relationship of the white bass can be described as a regression line having a Y intercept (length axis) of 23. 9 millimeters and a slope of 1. 88. Females grew faster and larger than the males, but they did not live as long. The 1941 year class dominated the population from 1942 through 1946...|$|R

Growth of black crappie {{was positively related to}} growth of largemouth bass. Black crappie catch per unit effort (CPUE) was positively associated with watershed size and alkalin-ity and negatively related to largemouth bass growth. Size structure of bluegill populations was positively influenced by chlorophyll concentrations and <b>large-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> catch rates. Total phosphorus and CPUE of stock-to-quality length largemouth bass were also positively related to bluegill growth. Bluegill CPUE was inversely related to largemouth bass growth. Quality largemouth bass popu-lations were allied with turbid (high total suspended solids and low Secchi disk depth) impoundments that had a diverse shoreline and large watersheds. <b>Large-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> growth was inversely related to mean depth, and largemouth bass CPUE was inversely related to alkalinity and total suspended solids. Information from this study will be used to classify and rank impoundments in terms of their management priorities.

40|$|Abstract. —We {{describe}} the morphological changes associated with starvation in larval <b>large-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> Micropterus salmoides and develop bivariate and multivariate morphological indices of nutritional status. We obtained hatchery-reared largemouth bass, raised them until completion of fin development, and divided them into two randomized experimental groups of fed and unfed fishes. Fed fishes {{were provided with}} newly hatched brine shrimp twice daily. We quantified morphological changes in body shape using 23 morphometric characters. After only 3 d of food deprivation, {{we were able to}} detect statistically significant differences in morphology between the fed and unfed fish using multivariate analysis. The magnitude of the mean difference increased over time. An unexpected result suggested that a simple, bivariate ratio of standard length to body depth at the anus was almost as efficient and robust at classifying fed and unfed largemouth bass from an independent data set as a multivariate index based on all 23 morphometric characters. The relative ease of use, combined with a small level of misclassification error rate and a firm foundation in whole-body changes, makes these ratio indices effective tools for detecting food deprivation in larval largemouth bass.

40|$|Abstract. —We used {{information}} from an angler rec-ognition program {{to assess the}} relationship between lake-record weights of freshwater fishes captured by Texas anglers and two predictors of fish production and growth: reservoir surface area and growing-season length. The lake-record weights of two species, <b>large-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> Micropterus salmoides and flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris, were {{directly related to the}} logarithm of surface area. The record weights of all species studied were unrelated to growing-season length. Regardless of the statistical significance of individual correlations, there was a significant excess of positive correlations across all species between lake-record weights of fish and log surface area. This indicates the presence of a general relationship between the record weights of fish and reservoir area. Our results suggest that record weights of fish may be constrained by reservoir surface area. The goal of fishery management is to provide opportunities for quality recreational fishing (Driver and Cooksey 1980). To achieve this goal, fisheries must be managed to produce a variety of experiences or ‘‘products’ ’ (Driver 1985) because anglers differ in their species preferences (Spencer 1993; Wilde and Ditton 2000), interest in har-vesting or releasing captured fish (Fedler and Dit...|$|E
40|$|Macrophyte {{harvesting}} {{often has}} been suggested {{as a way to}} improve fish growth and size struc-ture in lakes with high densities of submergent macrophytes and stunted fish populations. How-ever, previous experimental tests have provided no clear consensus on whether the technique works for management. We conducted a series of whole-lake manipulations to test the effects of macrophyte removal on growth of bluegill and largemouth bass. We selected four lakes in south-ern and central Wisconsin for experimental manipulation and nine others for controls. In August 1994, we removed macrophytes from approximately 20 % of the littoral zone by cutting a series of evenly spaced, deep channels throughout each treatment lake. In the first year after manipulation, we observed substantially increased growth rates of some age classes of both bluegill and <b>large-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> in treatment lakes relative to controls. Growth rates of other age classes were less responsive to manipulation. We observed increased bluegill and largemouth bass growth despite rapid regrowth of macrophytes in our treatment lakes. By May 1996, fewer than 25 % of the chan-nels remained. Our results suggest that harvesting macrophytes in a series of deep channels may be a valuable tool for integrated management of fish and macrophytes...|$|E
40|$|I {{compiled}} {{quantitative information}} from published and unpublished studies that evaluated <b>large-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> fishery responses to minimum-length and slot-length limits. My data set includes results from 91 evaluations conducted on 88 lakes located across the United States. Forty-nine evaluations were of minimum-length limits, and 42 were of slot-length limits. The most commonly evaluated regulations were 12 - (n = 13) and 14 -in (n = 14) minimum-length limits and 12 - to 15 -in slot-length limits (n = 23). I constructed and tested six hypotheses about largemouth bass fishery responses to minimum-length and slot-length limits. Minimum-length limits increased largemouth bass population size when all minimum-length limits were included (P = 0. 034) {{but not when}} 12 -in minimum-length limits were excluded. Minimum-length limits failed to increase the proportion of larger fish (proportional stock density, relative stock density) and the number and weight of fish harvested by anglers, but did increase angler catch rates (P = 0. 033). Slot-length limits were suc-cessful in restructuring largemouth bass populations by increasing population size (P = 0. 018) {{and the proportion of}} larger fish (proportional stock density, P = 0. 025; relative stock density, P = 0. 056) but did not increase angler catch rates or harvest.

This study {{is the first to}} demonstrate the presence of L hongkongensis in natural water environments, with the bacterium being isolated from the waters of six reservoirs, with higher recovery rates in summer and during days of higher water and ambient temperatures. 3. Molecular typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a heterogenous population of L hongkongensis in both the freshwater fish and drinking water reservoir isolates, suggesting that the bacterium is endemic in our freshwater environments. 4. Since freshwater fish are common food items for our population, the general public should be educated on the proper preparation and thorough cooking of freshwater fish before consumption to avoid L h o ngk o nge n s i s – a sso c ia t e d gastroenteritis. 5.

40|$|The steroidogenic acute {{regulatory}} (StAR) protein mediates the rate-limiting step of mitochondrial {{transport of}} cholesterol for steroid biosynthesis. To investigate {{the regulation of}} this protein in lower vertebrates, we cloned the StAR coding region from <b>large-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> for analysis. Induction of the mRNA corresponded with increasing levels of plasma sex steroids in vivo. Cultures of largemouth bass ovarian follicles were exposed to dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP), a potent signaling molecule for steroidogenesis. StAR mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated by dbcAMP signaling, suggesting that the 5 ′ regulatory region of the gene is functionally conserved. To further analyze its transcriptional regulation, a 2. 9 -kb portion of the promoter was cloned and transfected into Y- 1 cells, a steroidogenic mouse adrenocortical cell line. The promoter activity was induced in a dose-responsive manner upon stimulation with dbcAMP; however, deletion of 1 kb from the 5 ′ end of the promoter segment significantly diminished the transcriptional activation. A putative retinoic acid-related receptor-α/rev-erbα element was identified between the − 1. 86 - and − 2. 9 -kb region and mutated to assess its potential role in dbcAMP regulation of the promoter. Mutation of the rev-erbα element significantly impeded dbcAMP-induced activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA results revealed rev-erbα and retinoic acid-related receptor-α enrichment at the site under basal and dbcAMP-induced conditions, respectively. These results implicate important roles for these proteins previously uncharacterized for the StAR promoter. Altogether these data suggest novel regulatory mechanisms for dbcAMP up-regulation of StAR transcription in the distal part of the largemouth bass promoter...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Few published studies present data on rela-tionships between fish mercury and surface or pore water sulfate concentrations, particularly on an ecosystem-wide basis. Resource managers can use these relationships {{to identify the}} sulfate conditions that contain fish with health-concerning total mercury (THg) levels and to evaluate the role of sulfate in methyl-mercury (MeHg) production. In this study, we derived relationships between THg in three fish trophic levels (mosquitofish, sunfish, and age- 1 <b>large-mouth</b> <b>bass)</b> and surface water sulfate from 1998 to 2009 for multiple stations across the Everglades Protection Area (EPA). Results show the relationship between sulfate and fish THg in each fish type is nonlinear and largely skewed, similar {{to the relationship between}} MeHg production and sulfate concentration in peatland sediment pore water identified by other researchers. Peak fish THg levels occurred in * 1 to 12 mg/L sulfate conditions. There was significant variability in the fish THg data, and there were several instances of high-fish THg levels in high-sulfate conditions ([30 mg/L). Health-concerning fish THg levels were present in all surface water sulfate conditions; how-ever, most of these levels occurred in 1 – 20 mg/L sulfate. The data in this study, including recent studies, show consistent and identifiable areas of high- and low-fish THg across the spectrum of surface water sulfate concentration, therefore, applying an ecosystem-wide sulfur strategy may be an effective management approach as it would signifi-cantly reduce MeHg risk in the EPA...|$|E
40|$|Population {{characteristics}} of largemouth bass (Micropterous salmoides L.) including growth, body condition (relative weight), size structure, survival, and fecundity {{were examined in}} relation to abundance of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) coverage (primarily hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata L. f. Royle) in three major embayments of Lake Seminole, Georgia. Relative weight, fecundity, and growth of <b>large-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> in the Spring Creek embayment (76 % areal SAV coverage) was considerably less than measured in the Chattahoochee and Flint river arms that contained lower SAV coverages (26 % and 32 %). It took fish 1. 8 years longer to reach 406 mm in Spring Creek compared to the Chattahoochee-Flint arms. Consequently, fish were smaller in Spring Creek than in the Chattahoochee-Flint arms. In addition, due to slower growth rates and lower fecundity-to-body weight relation, we predicted a 47 % reduction in total potential ova production in Spring Creek {{compared to the other}} two reservoir embayments. The annual survival rate of 3 to 10 year old largemouth bass was higher in Spring Creek (84 %) than in the Chattahoochee-Flint arms (72 %) and suggested either lower harvest and/or lower accessibility of particularly larger fish to angling in dense vegetation. Contrary to our expectaions, the fit between number-at-age and age in a catch-curve regression was weaker for fish collected in Spring Creek and suggested greater recruitment variability has occurred over time in this highly vegetated embayment. In Lake Seminole, spatial differences in largemouth bass population characterstics were associated with disparate levels of SAV. Our data suggest that a reduction in hydrilla, but maintenance of an intermediate level of SAV in Spring Creek, should improve largermouth bass population in this arm of the reservoir...|$|E
40|$|Des séries de données (physicochimie, plancton, poisson) collectées pendant deux saisons consécutives sur deux groupes d'étangs de {{pisciculture}} de Dordogne (Sud-ouest de la France) ont été analysées statistiquement (analyses en composantes principales ACP, analyse des correspondances multiples ACM, tris croisés). Des liens significatifs entre les différents constituants de la chaîne trophique ont été identifiés, et les facteurs clés de la production piscicole mis en évidence. En début de saison, une régulation ascendante oriente la composition et l'abondance de la flore algale, suivant les concentrations de N et PO 4 et leurs proportions relatives. L'abondance du zooplancton filtreur est liée à la fois aux ressources trophiques disponibles (cellules algales aisément ingérables) et à la pression de prédation qu'il subit de la part des juvéniles de poissons. La production piscicole de gardon (Rutilus rutilus) et de tanche (Tinca tinca) est plus faible si ces espèces sont associées (compétition alimentaire interspécifique chez les juvéniles) ou produites en présence d'un carnivore. En contre-partie d'une production piscicole plus faible, la stabilité de la structure du réseau trophique est accrue. Les concentrations en P-PO 4, la quantité de grands Crustacés planctoniques et une densité de poissons adaptée aux capacités du milieu constituent les facteurs clés de la production piscicole finale. The main parameters (physicochemistry, plankton, fish) of {{two sets}} of fish ponds (8 and 9 ponds respectively; area between 0. 2 and 1. 2 ha; mean depth: 1. 5 m) located in south-west of France were monitored during two consecutive seasons (1995, 1996). The benthic macroinvertebrates and the microbial loop were not taken into account for these field studies. No macrophytes were growing into the studied ponds. The multivariate analyses of the two yearly data bases provided informations {{on the strength of}} the various links among and between the successive compartments of the food web (physicochemistry of water, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish) and identified the bottlenecks of the food web to the fish production. Integrated water samples were collected bimonthly (from May to September) for field measurements (T°, pH, dissolved O 2, Secchi disc transparency, conductivity) and laboratory analyses ([N. NH 4], [N. NO 2], [N. NO 3], [ortho-P], [Ca] using a HACH spectrophotometer). The groups of planktonic algae (Diatoms, Desmidieae, Dinophyceae, Chlorococcales and Volvocales, Euglenophyceae, Cyanobacteriae) were identified and classified in three categories (dominant, present, rare). Rotifers, Cladocerans and Copepods were numbered (N/litre) into two size classes (large or small, with a threshold at 400 µm). One hundred liters of pond water were filtered through a plankton net (mesh size: 80 µm) and the volume of sedimented zooplankters measured as zooplankton biovolume (mL/ 100 liters). The total numbers of fish stocked and collected are noted (weight and number of fish/species; age classes). Working on private production ponds, we were not allowed to make catches for stomach contents studies. The data from each season were analysed through PCA, MCA, crosstabs (STATBOX software from GRIMMER); for each species of fish a ratio was computed between the biomass of the collected juveniles and the biomass of the stocked breeders. In the studied fish ponds like in other eutrophic bodies of water, the densities of the planktonic organisms follow a bimodal evolution, with high numbers at the end of spring (June) and the end of summer (August), separated by a phase of more transparent water. During the first phase, Daphnia and large Cladocerans are predominant with Chlorophyceae, replaced later in the season by species of smaller size and shorter life cycle (Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, Cyclops), associated with Cyanobacteriae, at a time where predation by fish is more intense as their biomass increase. In spring, different algal communities develop with density depending on the initial concentrations of inorganic N and PO 4 and the PO 4 /N ratio. If the available dissolved N and P are infra-optimal, mixotroph algae (Chrysophyceae, Dinophyceae) and Rotifers predominate. When [N] is not limiting (N/P between 4 / 1 and 10 / 1), Chlorophyceae become predominant, but if PO 4 is in relative excess, they are replaced by Cyanobacteria. The abundance of grazing Cladocerans is linked to the capacity of the available algal cells to be ingested. Cyanobacteria can already become predominant in May because of the selective grazing by Cladocerans on more readily ingestible phytoplankton taxa. Links among groups of zooplankton are evidenced: small grazers (Rotifers, Cladocera 2 mL/ 100 L), a water transparency between 0. 30 and 0. 70 m and are related to a shift from small size species (400 µm). In spring numerous small zooplankters facilitate the survival of the fish fry, whose growth is later ensured by high densities of larger Crustaceans. From the fish production data, the ratios between the biomass of collected juveniles and the biomass of stocked breeders were compared under different rearing conditions for the various species. Roach Rutilus rutilus, tench Tinca tinca and gudgeon Gobio gobio have similar production potentials when reared separately (juveniles production in kg is 5 to 7 times the biomass of the breeders). When roach and tench are reared together under the same conditions, the ratio is divided by 2 for each species, but the total net production of fish remains at the same level (500 - 600 kg/ha). This shows that there is a strong feeding competition on zooplankton between the juveniles of roach and tench. In opposition, there is little feeding competition between roach and gudgeon. When the two benthic species are associated, tench strongly dominates the gudgeon. The addition of a carnivorous species to the association of roach + tench reduces the final total production by 250 - 300 kg/ha. Between 30 and 40 kg of carnivorous fish (Esox lucius or Stizostedion lucioperca) are produced {{at the expense of the}} equivalent of a final biomass of 200 kg/ha of young Cyprinids. The pressure of predation from these two top consumers is 2 to 3 times less intense compared to the predation exerted by the <b>large-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> Micropterus salmoides. As the basic food for juvenile fish, the zooplankton can be considered here as the key element of the food web, between the bottom-up (production) and top-down (predation) effects. The ortho-phosphate concentration is the limiting factor for the ascending regulation of the food web, and the amount of initially stocked fish regulates the top-down effects. The maximum net final fish production reached about 800 kg/ha with roach alone, or in association with tench. In such cases, Cyanobacteria were dominant in the pond with the presence of Chlorophyceae. The low density of zooplankton and the sub-optimal dissolved oxygen concentrations during the day seem to indicate that at such production level, the food chain is near to collapse...|$|E
