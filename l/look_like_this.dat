Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.|$|E

500|$|Alcibiades has {{not been}} spared by ancient comedy and stories attest to an epic {{confrontation}} between Alcibiades and Eupolis resembling that between Aristophanes and Cleon. He also appears as a character in several Socratic dialogues (Symposium, Protagoras, Alcibiades I and II, {{as well as the}} eponymous dialogues by Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes). Purportedly based on his own personal experience, Antisthenes described Alcibiades's extraordinary physical strength, courage, and beauty, saying, [...] "If Achilles did not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> he was not really handsome." [...] In his trial, Socrates must rebut the attempt to hold him guilty for the crimes of his former students, including Alcibiades. Hence, he declares in Apology: [...] "I have never been anyone's teacher".|$|E

A day later, Grande discussed the video's concept and said that it was [...] "the coolest concept ever and he killed it and it's very different. I'm very nervous about it because it's so unique and weird and I feel like brave and different, but it’s exciting".|$|E

The penectomy was not entirely {{successful}} and left the penis [...] "a greyish-brown, shrivelled mass". According to Sigurður, [...] "I should have stretched it and sewn it at the back to keep it in more or less a normal position". Instead, it [...] "went directly into the formaldehyde". Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður expressed confidence that [...] "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon." [...] Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved human penis is [...] "that it's very old, you know, a bit shrunken, and the male members [...] say 'oh, I hope mine will not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> when I get old. Sigurður has considered donating his own penis to the museum when he dies but said that it depends on his wife: [...] "If she dies first, my specimen would go in here. If I die first, well I can't say. She might say no." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his work on}} Trouble in Mind, Divine again became involved with a John Waters project, the film Hairspray (1988). Set in Baltimore during the 1960s, Hairspray revolved around self-proclaimed [...] "pleasantly plump" [...] teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local television show and rallies against racial segregation. As he had in Waters's earlier film Female Trouble, Divine took on two roles in the film, {{one of which was}} female and the other male. The first of these, Edna Turnblad, was Tracy's loving mother; Divine would later note that with this character he could not be accurately described as a drag queen, proclaiming [...] "What drag queen would allow herself to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> I look like half the women from Baltimore." [...] His second character in the film was that of the racist television station owner Arvin Hodgepile. In one interview, Divine admitted that he had hoped to play both the role of mother and daughter in Hairspray, but that the producers had been [...] "a bit leery" [...] and chose Ricki Lake for the latter role instead. Divine went on to state his opinion on Lake, jokingly telling the interviewer that [...] "She is nineteen and delightful. I hate her." [...] In reality they had become good friends while working together on set. Reviews of the film were predominantly positive, with Divine in particular being singled out for praise; several commentators expressed their opinion that the film marked Divine's breakthrough into mainstream cinema. He subsequently took his mother to the film's premier in the Miami Film Festival before she once more accompanied him to the Baltimore premier, this time also with several of his other relatives. After the screening, a party was held at the Baltimore Museum of Art, where Frances Milstead granted an impromptu interview to the English film critic Jonathan Ross, a friend and fan of Divine's.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding creationism, Chandler {{refers to}} himself as a [...] "historic creationist", taking the view {{presented}} by Old Testament professor Dr. John Sailhamer in his book Genesis Unbound. Chandler describes the view, in his words, that God created the universe [...] "in {{the early stages of}} an unknowable period of time" [...] and that the days of creation were when [...] "God groom a section of land that was uninhabitable...and prepare it for Adam and Eve and plac them in the garden and g them the cultural mandate, 'Go and make {{the rest of the world}} <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> You're going to need a lot of help. Have a lot of babies.'" [...] He affirms that the creation of the universe took place before the biblical Creation Week.|$|E

They find that many of them feel a lack of {{confidence}} and hide themselves behind clothing, and do not have any knowledge of what to wear. Then the process of Susannah being aged through prosthetics begins. To give an accurate depiction of how Susannah would look at the age of 70 years, a plastic surgeon and prosthetic expert take details of her lifestyle and examine past pictures to see how she is aging. When the face mask and body suit are fitted, Susannah is clearly distressed and states [...] "There is no way I'm going to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> when I'm 70. I will not dress like this and I will not allow my face to become like this." [...] An elderly woman, Shirly Tripe, then takes Susannah shopping to find her some clothing from her own favourite shops. Susannah comments on Shirley's choice: [...] "It's a sack. This is a testament that older women, or mature women, benefit so much from tailoring." [...] Susannah then meets a shocked Trinny with her new appearance. The two fashionistas then aim to tackle what they believe older women should avoid; wearing loose fitting clothes. They take Shirley shopping to get some tighter fitting clothes, although Shirley shows much resistance and claims she looks like 'mutton dressed as lamb'.|$|E
