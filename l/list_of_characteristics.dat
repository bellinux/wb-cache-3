During the development program, its weight increased from 14 to almost 27 tons.

25|$|Lack of self-correction: {{scientific}} research programmes make mistakes, but {{they tend to}} reduce these errors over time. By contrast, ideas may be regarded as pseudoscientific because they have remained unaltered despite contradictory evidence. The work Scientists Confront Velikovsky (1976) Cornell University, also delves into these features in some detail, as does the work of Thomas Kuhn, e.g. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) which also discusses some of the items on the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristics</b> of pseudoscience.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of the term contourite has varied throughout the decades. Originally, Heezen et al. (1966) defined the concept, without using the actual word, as a sedimentary deposit on the continental rise derived from thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents that flow parallel to bathymetric contours. They did this to emphasize the difference between these deposits and turbidites in order to explain the ubiquitous smoothness and lack of irregularities of the continental rise in the Blake-Bahama Basin. Before this, it was thought that only turbidity flows were capable of depositing and reworking sediment at depths greater than the continental slope. Hollister and Heezen (1972) adopted the name contourite for these deposits and provided a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristics</b> that described their sediments. Faugères and Stow (1993) note that as research on the subject developed, the term contourite was used to describe various forms of sedimentary deposits from bottom-currents including those at much shallower depths and even in lacustrine settings. They suggested going back to the original {{definition of}} a contourite, that is for deposits at depths greater than 500 m derived from stable thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents (i.e. deepwater bottom-currents), in order to avoid using the same name when describing sedimentary deposits formed by different processes. They also suggest the umbrella term bottom-current deposit, which includes contourites and deposits generated by other bottom-currents.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the history}} of {{religious}} studies, {{there have been many}} attempts to define the term [...] "religion". Many of these have been monothetic, seeking to determine a key, essential element which all religions share, which can be used to define [...] "religion" [...] as a category, and which must be necessary in order for something to be classified as a [...] "religion". There are two forms of monothetic definition; the first are substantive, seeking to identify a specific core as being at the heart of religion, such as a belief in a God or gods, or an emphasis on power. The second are functional, seeking to define [...] "religion" [...] in terms of what it does for humans, for instance defining it by the argument that it exists to assuage fear of death, unite a community, or reinforce the control of one group over another. Other forms of definition are polythetic, producing a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristics</b> that are common to religion. In this definition there is no one characteristic that need be common to every form of religion.|$|E
60|$|There {{is nothing}} truer than physiognomy, taken in {{connection}} with manner. The art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human creature to present {{his or her own}} page with the individual character written on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied. It may require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything does) some patience and some pains. That these are not usually given to it, - that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of the face as the whole <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and neither seek nor know the refinements that are truest, - that You, for instance, give {{a great deal of time}} and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the face of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to you, - I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable. Perhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial expression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to you to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.|$|E
