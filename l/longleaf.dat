5|$|Habitat loss. Gopher {{tortoises}} (Georgia, Florida's official tortoise) {{have been}} {{impacted by the}} loss of 97% of the Southeast's <b>longleaf</b> pine forest.|$|E
5|$|The southeastern U.S. {{subspecies}} (Falco sparverius paulus) {{has declined}} 82% since 1940 {{due to a}} decrease in nest site availability. This decline {{is a result of}} <b>longleaf</b> pines being cleared from agricultural fields. Despite this, the American kestrel is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|In Florida, nesting {{habitats}} often {{consist of}} mangrove swamps, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, pinelands, seasonally flooded flatwoods, hardwood swamps, and open prairies and pastureland with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash pines (Pinus elliottii), <b>longleaf</b> pines (P. palustris), loblolly pines (P. taeda) and cypress trees, {{but for the}} southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used. In Wyoming, groves of mature cottonwoods or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland. In Southeast Alaska, Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by hemlocks (Tsuga) at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, several {{woodpeckers}} {{are under}} threat as their habitats are destroyed. Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance {{of land for}} agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees, but some do not. A few species have even flourished when they have adapted to man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers, but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker {{has been the focus}} of much conservation effort in the southeastern United States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the <b>longleaf</b> pines they favour as nesting sites.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{suitable}} habitats for gopher tortoise is the <b>longleaf</b> pine ecosystem, which provides suitable well-drained and sandy soils for tortoises to inhabit. <b>Longleaf</b> pine forests include abundant low herbaceous plant growth and open canopy/space for tortoise’s eggs to incubate. Since European settlement, <b>longleaf</b> pine decreased in area by an estimated of 96%, which has contributed to an 80% decrease in population densities of gopher tortoise. This {{means that there is}} only 4% of <b>longleaf</b> pine remaining.|$|E
25|$|At {{the southernmost}} {{length of the}} Blue Ridge, part of the Appalachian Mountains, Anniston's {{environment}} is home to diverse species of birds, reptiles and mammals. Part of the former Fort McClellan is now operating as Mountain <b>Longleaf</b> National Wildlife Refuge to protect endangered Southern <b>Longleaf</b> Pine species.|$|E
25|$|Geneva State Forest is a managed forest. Trees are {{harvested}} {{on a regular}} basis for multiple uses. The forest largely comprises <b>longleaf</b> pine. The <b>longleaf</b> pine is the official state tree of Alabama. Large forests of the pine once were present along the southeastern Atlantic coast and Gulf Coast of North America, as part of the eastern savannas. These forests were the source of naval stores - resin, turpentine, and timber.|$|E
25|$|Kisatchie National Forest is Louisiana's only {{national}} forest. It includes 600,000 {{acres in}} central and north Louisiana with large areas of flatwoods and <b>longleaf</b> pine forest.|$|E
25|$|Alexandria is {{on a level}} plain in {{the center}} of the Louisiana <b>Longleaf</b> Pine forests, in which pine is {{interspersed}} with various hardwoods. A number of small bayous, such as Bayou Rapides, Bayou Robert, and Hynson Bayou, meander throughout the city. In the immediate vicinity of the city, cotton, sugar, alfalfa, and garden vegetables are cultivated.|$|E
25|$|Singletary Lake is {{surrounded}} by a bay forest. This forest consists primarily of bay trees such as the loblolly, red bay, pond pine and Atlantic white cedar. The understory consists of huckleberry, leucothoe, gallberry and pepperbush. turkey oak, blueberry, holly and <b>longleaf</b> pine {{can be found at the}} higher elevations away from the shoreline.|$|E
25|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps-Carolina Bay Loop Trail is a one-mile (0.6km) {{hiking trail}} {{that was built}} by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. It passes by the shore of Singletary Lake and then winds through the forest of bay trees and shrubs and a second forest of <b>longleaf</b> pine and turkey oak.|$|E
25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} have negative impacts on seed germination. The {{extent of the}} damage, however, depends on how long seeds are vulnerable for (dry and germinating) and by the abundance of the ants. One study showed that while these ants are attracted to and remove seeds which have adapted for ant dispersal, red imported fire ants damage these seeds or move them in unfavourable locations for germination. In seeds given to colonies, 80% of Sanguinaria canadensi seeds were scarified and 86% of Viola rotundifolia seeds were destroyed. Small percentages of <b>longleaf</b> pine (Pinus palustris) seeds deposited by workers successfully germinate, thus providing evidence that red imported fire ants help the movement of seeds in the <b>longleaf</b> pine ecosystem. Elaiosome-bearing seeds are collected {{at a higher rate}} in contrast to nonelaiosome-bearing seeds and do not store them in their nests, but rather in surface trash piles in the mound vicinity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>longleaf</b> pine at Geneva State Forest {{is managed}} in three stages. The Alabama Forest Commission uses the natural {{regeneration}} method in their forest management. The three stages are preparatory cutting, establishment cutting and removal cutting. All three sections undergo an annual controlled burn in which ⅓ {{of the unit}} is set ablaze by foresters. The controlled fires encourage regrowth and provide forage for wildlife. Following removal cutting the forests are allowed to regenerate naturally. It takes 75 years for the forests to regrow.|$|E
25|$|North Carolina {{consists}} of three main geographic regions: the Atlantic coastal plain, occupying the eastern portion of the state; the central Piedmont region, and the Mountain region in the west, {{which is part of}} the Appalachian Mountains. The coastal plain {{consists of}} more specifically-defined areas known as the Outer Banks, a string of sandy, narrow barrier islands separated from the mainland by sounds or inlets, including Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound, the tidewater region, the native home of the venus flytrap, and the inner coastal plain, where <b>longleaf</b> pine trees are native.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Coosa River Watershed, 281 {{occurrences of}} rare {{plant and animal}} species and natural {{communities}} have been documented, including 73 occurrences of 23 species that are federal or state protected. Ten conservation targets were chosen: the riverine system, matrix forest communities (oak hickory-pine forest), gray bat (Myotis grisescens), riparian vegetation, mountain <b>longleaf</b> pine (Pinus palustris) forest communities, red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), critically imperiled aquatic species (fish, mussels, and snails), southern hognose snake (Heterodon simus), caddisflies, and imperiled plants. Maintaining the biodiversity of the Coosa River system is particularly important because it has already lost a significant portion of its aquatic fauna to extinction.|$|E
25|$|Much of the state's lands {{were formed}} from {{sediment}} washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. These contain a rich southern biota; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets. There are also {{many species of}} tree frogs, and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. In more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape, and has produced extensive areas of <b>longleaf</b> pine forest and wet savannas. These support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants. Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four {{that have not yet}} received recognition.|$|E
500|$|The mouse inhabits some of Florida's driest locations. It {{is common}} in the sand pine (Pinus clausa) scrub and the high pinelands of turkey oak (Quercus laevis) and <b>longleaf</b> pine (Pinus palustris), and {{is found in the}} slash pine (Pinus elliottii) and turkey oak habitat of the {{southern}} ridge sandhills, and in scrubby flatlands, and in coastal scrub associations. [...] Home ranges average roughly , and are smaller in the flatlands. Populations are greater in the scrub and flatlands than in the highlands. Its largest populations may occur within Ocala National Forest and the scrubs along Lake Wales Ridge.|$|E

In addition to offering several boat and adventure tours, it contains a small theater; exhibit hall; meeting facilities; walking trails; a canoe and kayak landing.|$|E
2500|$|Since the <b>longleaf</b> pine {{ecosystem}} {{is required}} for the maintenance of the gopher tortoise, conservation efforts are needed to maintain this endangered ecosystem. The <b>longleaf</b> pine ecosystem provides extreme conditions such as “nutrient” deprived soil and “sandy sites” for gopher’s habitation. [...] The <b>longleaf</b> pine is a relatively long-lived tree for this region of the world, with individual trees often persisting for several centuries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{forests and}} shores of Eglin Air Force Base {{are at the}} center of one of the most biodiverse {{locations}} in North America. [...] Over 50 species threatened in Florida are found on the base, including sea turtles that nest on its white-sand beaches and red-cockaded woodpeckers that thrive in its <b>longleaf</b> pine forests. [...] The base has a natural resources management team that constantly monitors important species within the base with the goal of balancing their national defense mission with environmental stewardship. [...] <b>Longleaf</b> pine forest, a forest type reduced to 5% of its former range in the last few centuries, covers [...] of the base. [...] Part of this forest, , is old growth, making the base home to one of the most extensive old-growth <b>longleaf</b> pine forests in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{experiments}} on very resinous <b>longleaf</b> pine specimens indicate {{an increase in}} strength, due to the resin which increases the strength when dry. Such resin-saturated heartwood is called [...] "fat lighter". Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and termites; however they are very flammable. Stumps of old <b>longleaf</b> pines are often dug, split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires. Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut. Spruce impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cultivated}} {{productions of}} the Mountain section are sweet corn, wheat, oats, barley, hay, tobacco, fruits and vegetables. [...] Cattle are also reared quite extensively for market, and {{large numbers of}} chickens are raised for market in the northwestern mountains and foothills. A prominent new industry in the mountains is the raising and selling of Christmas Trees. In the Piedmont region of central North Carolina are found all {{the products of the}} mountains, although over the southern half cotton appears as the staple product. [...] In the deep, loamy soils of the coastal region, cotton, corn, and oats are the staple crops, and truck farming (growing fruits and vegetables for northern markets), constitutes a flourishing industry. [...] Formerly <b>longleaf</b> pine forests produced tar, pitch and turpentine, and more recently lumber. Little old growth <b>longleaf</b> area is left; much has been replanted in loblolly pine, which is used for paper pulp, plywood, and lumber. Four of the grape varieties of America are native to North Carolina; the Catawba, Isabella, Lincoln, and Scuppernong.|$|E
2500|$|Gopher {{tortoise}} {{could potentially}} lose [...] of its habitats if Florida’s population doubles. Due to land development and human activity, [...] of land, {{which is the}} size of Vermont, will be developed. [...] of agricultural lands and [...] of unused land will be developed. This will cause more competition for water resources between animals and humans. The low reproductive rate of the tortoise makes it more vulnerable to declines in <b>longleaf</b> ecosystem and extinction.|$|E
2500|$|Alabama is {{nicknamed the}} Yellowhammer State, {{after the state}} bird. Alabama {{is also known as}} the [...] "Heart of Dixie" [...] and the Cotton State. The state tree is the <b>longleaf</b> pine, and the state flower is the camellia. Alabama's capital is Montgomery.

The oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana.|$|E
2500|$|Gopher {{tortoises}}, {{like other}} tortoises {{of the genus}} Gopherus, {{are known for their}} digging ability. Gopher tortoises {{spend most of their time}} in long burrows, up to [...] in length and [...] deep. In these burrows, the tortoises are protected from summer heat, winter cold, fire, and predators. The burrows are especially common in <b>longleaf</b> pine savannas, where the tortoises are the primary grazers, playing an essential role in their ecosystem. Except during breeding season, gopher tortoises are solitary animals, inhabiting a small home range. Within their range they dig several burrows. On average, each gopher tortoise needs about [...] to live.|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the southeastern}} United States was once open <b>longleaf</b> pine forest with a rich {{understory}} of grasses, sedges, carnivorous plants and orchids. The above maps shows that these ecosystems (coded as pale blue) had the highest fire frequency of any habitat, once per decade or less. Without fire, deciduous forest trees invade, and their shade eliminates both the pines and the understory. [...] Some of the typical plants associated with fire include Yellow Pitcher Plant and Rose pogonia. The abundance and diversity of such plants {{is closely related to}} fire frequency. Rare animals such as gopher tortoises and indigo snakes also depend upon these open grasslands and flatwoods. [...] Hence, the restoration of fire is a priority to maintain species composition and biological diversity.|$|E
2500|$|Fort McClellan—former {{site of the}} U.S. Army Military Police Training Academy, a Vietnam era Infantry Training Center, Chemical Corps Regimental Headquarters, Chemical Warfare {{training}} center, and Women's Army Corps Headquarters—was de-commissioned in the 1990s. A {{portion of}} the former fort is now home to the Alabama National Guard Training Center.

2500|$|A Witt {{lecture on}} the poor {{processes}} used by the American Naval stores industry and the almost certain likelihood that those processes would completely destroy the <b>Longleaf</b> Pine (Pinus palustris) led Herty to study the naval store industry's use of those trees to produce timber and turpentine. [...] After engaging in literature and field research {{to better understand the}} industry and its processes, Herty confirmed the validity of Witt's claim that the pine species would be completely destroyed. Herty also elucidated massive inefficiencies in the destructive collection processes. [...] After conferring with forester W. W. Ashe of the North Carolina Geological Survey, Herty simplified a cup and gutter system used for many decades in France to combat both problems. The [...] "Herty system" [...] required less forestry expertise and labor, both necessities to insure the method's financial success in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|How can {{understanding}} of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems? [...] Humans often conduct activities {{that allow for}} the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or {{as a result of}} a focus on nature. [...] Traditional natural history can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically. [...] However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated ecosystems, through what is known as focused natural history. [...] Rosenzweig [...] cites four examples: shrikes (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable steel fence posts contributed to their decline. [...] Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes. [...] Additionally, the cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus) thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, natterjack toads (Bufo calamatus) declined when reductions in sheep grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and <b>longleaf</b> pine (Pinus palustris) declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of wildfires prevented its return after timbering. [...] Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.|$|E
