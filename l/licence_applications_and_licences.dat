50|$|When a not-for-profit {{community}} group {{applies to the}} regulating body (the Australian Communications and Media Authority) for a community broadcasting licence, it specifies the community interest it intends to serve. Licensees are selected by the regulator {{on the basis of}} suitability and on the merits of the <b>licence</b> <b>application</b> <b>and</b> the capacity to serve identified community interests. Upon grant of a five-year renewable licence each station is required to continue to serve the community interest for which the licence was granted. The Broadcast Services Act establishes the requirement to continue to represent the licensed community of interest and the requirement to encourage participation from the licensed community of interest in the provision and selection of programs as key conditions of the licence. Provisions for Temporary Community Radio Liceneces in the Act allow, where spectrum is available, for aspirant {{community group}}s to develop their facilities and financial and programming models before the regulator considers making a permanent licence available.|$|R
