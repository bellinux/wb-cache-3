5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops very quickly in the <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps. Scientists hypothesize that this plasticity is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant food resources are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E
5|$|These {{molecules}} are rod-shaped, some {{created in}} the <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> some appearing spontaneously in nature. Since then, two new types of LC molecules have been discovered, both man-made: disc-shaped (created by S.

5|$|According to Angela Davis, neutron {{activation}} analysis that was administered after the shootout showed no gunpowder residue on Shakur's fingers and forensic analysis performed at the Trenton, New Jersey crime <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> the FBI crime labs in Washington, D.C. did not find her fingerprints on any weapon at the scene. According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200yards (183m) away, he did not report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, {{more than an hour}} later.|$|E

To promote herself, she frequented producers' offices, befriended gossip columnist Sidney Skolsky, and entertained influential male guests at studio functions, a practice she had begun at Fox. She also became a friend and occasional sex partner of Fox executive Joseph M. Schenck, who persuaded his friend Harry Cohn, the head executive of Columbia Pictures, to sign her in March 1948.|$|E

5|$|In March 2002, Google cofounder Sergey Brin {{launched}} Google Compute as an add-on for the Google Toolbar. Although {{limited in}} function and scope, it increased participation in Folding@home from 10,000, {{up to about}} 30,000 active CPUs. The program ended in October 2005, {{in favor of the}} official Folding@home clients, and is no longer available for the Toolbar. Folding@home also gained participants from Genome@home, another distributed computing project from the Pande <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> a sister project to Folding@home. The goal of Genome@home was protein design and associated applications. Following its official conclusion in March 2004, users were asked to donate computing power to Folding@home instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being used as {{the exterior of the}} school, Studio C holds sets for the school's entrance foyer, the gymnasium, the media <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> a hallway with lockers. As the series progressed and the budget increased, a stairway and balcony was installed in the foyer in an attempt to get characters off the floor and not all appear in the same geometric plane. For the first few seasons, the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards; due to warping, it was replaced by concrete painted to look like wood.|$|E

Trepkos and O'Neil are officially unaccounted for and presumed dead; Trepkos is last seen carrying O'Neil's body as he disappears into the volcano.|$|E
