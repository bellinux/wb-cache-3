40|$|Abstract. To {{determine}} the cause of high oil temperature of the bearings in a kiln, oil samples extracted from the recovery of lubricant oil and were tested by comprehensive oil analytical techniques (including conventional physical and chemical Analysis, pollution degree detection and ferrography wear particle analysis). Results show that root cause of high oil temperature is improper selection of lubricating oil and serious solid particles pollution of using lubricating oil. Therefore, the application of oil analytical techniques to monitor the oil working condition, to prevent mechanical failure and to extend machine life is very effective. Preface The lubricating oil, which used in the riding wheel bearing box of cement rotary kiln in a medium-sized cement factory, was domestic famous brand of 220 # gear oil.
