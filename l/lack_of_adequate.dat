5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater.

5|$|For the {{constitution}} to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for {{the addition of a}} bill of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E

5|$|The RLM {{was still}} not {{interested}} in the Ju 87 and was not impressed that it relied on a British engine. In late 1935, Junkers suggested fitting a DB 600 in-line engine, with the final variant to be equipped with the Jumo 210. This was accepted by the RLM as an interim solution. The reworking of the design began on 1 January 1936. The test flight could not be carried out for over two months due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> aircraft. The 24 January crash had already destroyed one machine.|$|E
5|$|Before {{and during}} the summit US {{president}} George W. Bush, British prime minister Tony Blair, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende made a plea to European NATO members to make more troops available for deployment in Afghanistan, remove the national caveats (i.e. national restrictions on how, when and where forces can be used) and start sending its troops into the conflict-ridden south of the country. According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L. Jones {{it was not the}} lack of combat troops and the caveats were the problem, but the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> helicopters and military intelligence to support airlift and on-the-ground operations.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} pace of operations, deployment, and redeployment, {{coordination}} of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations. This was made even more problematic by the confusion generated by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> communications systems between the rapidly advancing units. The joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network. Regardless, due {{to the ability of}} U.S. logisticians to innovate and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the communications system, although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. operations.|$|E

5|$|The growing African-American {{population}} {{settling in}} the South Side bordered {{a neighborhood of}} Irish Americans existing since the mid-19th century and the two groups competed for jobs and housing. African-American migrants arrived after waves of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe; there were competition and tensions in their relationships, too. Ethnic groups were possessive of their neighborhoods, which their young men often patrolled against outsiders. Because of agricultural problems, Southern whites also migrated to the city, about 20,000 by this period. The rapid influx of migrants caused overcrowding {{as a result of}} a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> low-cost housing.|$|E
5|$|Prior to federation, {{the various}} Australian colonies could, and often did, charge tariffs on goods {{from the other}} colonies, ostensibly for the {{protection}} of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making goods purchased from Melbourne, the closest large city, more expensive and reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets. In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity. Another item of concern was the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> river crossings. Along the Riverina the Murray was—and remains—part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney.|$|E

5|$|Arrangements for naval gunfire {{support to}} the landings, had {{originally}} included bombarding the beaches and approaches but was changed to engagement of the ridges during the landings, with the beaches only to be shelled prior to the landings. No decision was ultimately made {{on the issue of}} close-support, and it was left up to the initiative of individual ships' captains. A reluctance to approach the shore later impacted on landings at 'V' and 'W' beach where some of the heaviest losses among the infantry occurred, while naval gunfire was of some assistance at 'S', 'X' and Anzac. Even then its effectiveness was limited by the initial confusion ashore, the broken terrain, thick vegetation, and the lack of observation. Kitchener had ruled that air requirements must be met by the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the Allies employed a small force of seaplanes and other aircraft from 3 Squadron, RNAS (Commander Charles Samson) which arrived at Tenedos at the end of March. The aircraft were unopposed by the small Ottoman air force at first and during the planning, the force had been used to provide aerial reconnaissance, although this ultimately proved inadequate to meet the Allies' intelligence needs and make up for the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> maps. After the landings, Allied aircraft conducted photographic reconnaissance, observed naval gunfire, reported on Ottoman troop movements and conducted a small number of bombing raids.|$|E
5|$|During {{the race}} to develop an oral polio vaccine several large scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had {{determined}} that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest. Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one {{million people in the}} Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). The results of these human trials have been controversial, and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses have, however, have been conclusively refuted. By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> information, often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility. The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Some {{challenges}} faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non-existent training programs, a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> emergency transport, {{a shortage of}} resources to fund emergency medicine development, and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend the resources they devote to emergency medicine. Additionally, the standards and methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing countries {{due to a lack}} of infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local demographics. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries; instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used. Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment, developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing availability to emergency medicine must improve health, there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health. Evidence-based medicine seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition.|$|E

The developer Regalian Properties approached the government in 1987 {{to see if they}} had any interest in the proposed building. At the same time, MI5 was seeking alternative accommodation and co-location of the two services was studied. In the end this proposal was abandoned due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> buildings <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> size (existing or proposed) and the security considerations of providing a single target for attacks. In December 1987, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government approved the purchase of the new building for SIS.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, Internet still <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> {{support for}} QoS-sensitive applications, such as VoIP, Videoconference, and Video-on-Demand.

In recent years, Service Overlay Networks (SONs) have emerged as a profitable way to leverage these issues without changing the underlying infrastructure. In this paper, we address the topology design problem of a SON from a performance point of view. Since the analytical solution of the problem is too computationally complex, we compare the performance of some well-known topologies and we also propose a new traffic demand aware overlay topology. Through extensive simulations, we investigate the performance of each overlay topology in different network scenarios, taking into account overhead and accepted traffic between the overlay nodes...|$|R
5|$|The {{far left}} {{flank of the}} German attack fell on the 104th Brigade {{near the village of}} Treux, {{although}} {{due to the fact that}} the line was south of the Ancre in this area, the defenders were less subject to surprise and had good fields of fire. A post of the 18th Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers was located in a deep sunken road in the northeast corner of Marrett Wood, which was southwest of Treux itself. On the evening of 27 March, Monash had ordered the 10th Brigade to establish if the 35th Division really held the wood, and patrols of the 37th Battalion had located the British post in the sunken road and provided some support, consisting of a few snipers and a Lewis gun crew which was low on ammunition. About 08:00, Germans were seen approaching in the distance, and the commander of the Lancashire Fusiliers post asked the 37th Battalion for greater support. Before this could arrive, however, several hundred Germans of II/13 IR attacked, but they were beaten off by the combined British/Australian force at Marrett Wood with the help of the British artillery. The rest of 13 IR attacked further east around the village of Ville, but were easily stopped by the main line of the 106th Brigade. In response to the Lancashire Fusiliers' request for reinforcements, a company of the 38th Battalion occupied Marrett Wood about 11:35, just as another unsuccessful German assault was mounted. A further unsuccessful attempt was made at 16:30. The Germans blamed <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adequate</b> artillery support for their failure to capture Treux and Marrett Wood.|$|E
