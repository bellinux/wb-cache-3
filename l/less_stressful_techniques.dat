30|$|With {{regard to}} the details of the group comparisons, the one-way ANOVA showed a {{significant}} association between professional status and perceived threatening factors. In particular, people who combined teaching with another job perceived challenges to be less frequent and <b>less</b> <b>stressful</b> than colleagues who worked only as teachers. For nearly all the variables, no {{differences were found between the}} two sub-groups of people who combined teaching with another job (i.e. those who were involved in a job closely related to the taught field and those who were engaged in a job very different from the taught field). These groups differed only with respect to the perceived role-related challenges. Teachers who combined teaching with jobs different from the taught field perceived such challenges to be less frequent and <b>less</b> <b>stressful</b> than those colleagues who only taught or whose additional job was related to the taught field.|$|R

50|$|Being {{met with}} an {{individual}} in a dark uniform can be intimidating to a person with autism, particularly when they have been a crime victim or are injured. Police and emergency responders may become frustrated, not knowing a person that they're talking to is autistic. The responders may not be communicating {{in a way that}} will create understanding and make the situation <b>less</b> <b>stressful.</b> A program has been launched in Glasgow, Scotland to enter information into a database about autistic people so that responding police and emergency personnel are notified when they will be meeting an autistic person and may then communicate in a way that increases understanding and makes the situation <b>less</b> <b>stressful.</b> Autism Alert Cards, for example, are available for autistic people in Scottish Borders and Lothian Scotland so that police and emergency personnel will recognize autistic individuals and respond appropriately. The cards, which encourage autism friendly interaction, have a couple of key points about interacting with people with autism.|$|R

50|$|A cinder {{track is}} a type of race track, {{generally}} purposed for athletics or horse racing, whose surface is composed of cinders.

The impact on performance as a result of differing track surfaces is a topic often raised when comparing athletes from different eras.|$|R
