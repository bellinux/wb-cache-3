500|$|The {{first thing}} for a private {{secretary}} {{to do is to}} study her employer. After I went to work for Mr. Roosevelt, for months I read carefully all the <b>letters</b> <b>he</b> dictated ... I learned what <b>letters</b> <b>he</b> wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly how Mr. Roosevelt would answer some of his <b>letters,</b> how <b>he</b> would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many <b>letters</b> <b>he</b> could just say yes or no and I knew what to say and how to say it.|$|R

5|$|In Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had {{recently}} been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed {{by the actions of}} the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he {{sent a letter to the}} colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular <b>Letter.</b> <b>He</b> also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House to rescind the letter. The house refused to comply.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn {{wrote the}} concert Hebrides Overture (Fingal's Cave) in 1830, {{inspired}} by visits to Scotland {{around the end}} of the 1820s. He visited Fingal's Cave, on the Hebridean isle of Staffa, as part of his Grand Tour of Europe, and was so impressed that he scribbled the opening theme of the overture on the spot, including it in a <b>letter</b> <b>he</b> wrote home the same evening.|$|E

5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by {{the corruption of the}} health system and feeling that he could not fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the <b>letter,</b> <b>he</b> refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|At {{work one}} day, Esquire meets John Garnett (Keith David), a millionaire {{who heads a}} {{successful}} business venture called the United Express. The two quickly become friends, with Garnett's admiration for Esquire's ambition and Esquire's respect for Garnett's success driving the relationship. Esquire sees an opportunity to obtain the letter of recommendation that would bring about his acceptance to his primary college choice. When Esquire goes to Garnett's house {{to pick up the}} <b>letter,</b> <b>he</b> meets his daughter Erin, who, to his surprise, turns out to be New-New, whose real name is Erin.

5|$|Benedict Arnold next wrote {{a series}} of letters to Clinton, even before he might have {{expected}} {{a response to the}} July 7 letter. In a July 11 <b>letter,</b> <b>he</b> complained that the British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made. On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to £20,000 (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a £1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular <b>Letter.</b> <b>He</b> also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E
5|$|David Livingstone, {{who visited}} Feira in 1856, {{described}} it as utterly ruined at that time, but still conspicuous by the ramshackle monastery buildings on the site. When Clark arrived about three decades later, the Portuguese still maintained a boma (fort) called Zumbo on the opposite bank of the Luangwa, but the surrounding country, then called Mashukulumbwe, was largely wild, {{and out of the}} control of any government. Harrison Clark settled at Feira, initially alone. According to a <b>letter</b> <b>he</b> wrote in 1897, he flew the British Merchant Navy's Red Ensign flag over his house.|$|E

Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) convinces Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) to move to the caves, because they made a deal that if Charlie found peanut butter, she would move; Charlie shares an imaginary jar of peanut butter with her. Sawyer attempts to burn the <b>letter</b> <b>he</b> wrote, but he finds himself unable to go through with it.|$|E

5|$|Lurie's script {{received}} a rewrite by Pamela Pettler, {{who worked with}} Burton on Corpse Bride, but the director hired Big Fish screenwriter John August in December 2003 to start from scratch. Both August and Burton were fans of the book since their childhoods. August first read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when he was eight years old, and subsequently sent Dahl a fan <b>letter.</b> <b>He</b> {{did not see the}} 1971 film prior to his hiring, which Burton believed would be fundamental in having August stay closer to the book. The writer updated the Mike Teavee character into an obsessive video game player, as compared to the novel, in which he fantasized about violent crime films. The characters Arthur Slugworth and Prodnose were reduced to brief cameo appearances, while Mr. Beauregarde was entirely omitted.|$|E

5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 <b>letter</b> <b>he</b> sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|On September 25, 2007, Mayor Gavin Newsom {{suspended}} Jew {{for alleged}} official misconduct {{and began the}} process of removing him from office. The city attorney also served Jew with civil charges of misconduct for allegedly lying about where he lived. Deputy budget director Carmen Chu was appointed as Jew's temporary replacement on the Board of Supervisors. On January 10, 2008, Jew tendered his resignation in exchange for Herrera and Newsom dropping both the civil lawsuit and misconduct proceeding before the Ethics Commission regarding his residency violation. In a <b>letter,</b> <b>he</b> noted that he resigned due to tremendous legal expenses and swore never to seek public office again {{in the best interest}} of his family. Chu became Jew's interim successor until the election in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|The initial vigour and {{excitement}} {{he brought to}} the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At {{the same time as}} Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by <b>letter,</b> <b>he</b> began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, {{at the end of the}} second volume, Wilde left The Woman's World. The magazine outlasted him by one issue.|$|E
