40|$|Paternally Expressed Gene 3 (Peg 3) is an {{imprinted}} gene that controls milk letdown and maternal-caring behaviors. In this study, a conditional knockout allele {{has been developed}} in Mus musculus to further characterize these known functions <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 3 in a tissue-specific manner. The mutant line was first crossed with a germline Cre. The progeny of this cross displayed growth retardation phenotypes. This is consistent with those seen in the previous mutant <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 3, confirming {{the usefulness of the}} new mutant allele. The mutant line was subsequently crossed individually with MMTV- and Nkx 2. 1 -Cre lines to test Peg 3 's roles in the mammary gland and hypothalamus, respectively. According to the results, the milk letdown process was impaired in the nursing females with the Peg 3 mutation in the mammary gland, but not in the hypothalamus. This suggests that Peg 3 's roles in the milk letdown process are more critical in the mammary gland than in the hypothalamus. In contrast, one of the maternal-caring behaviors, nest-building, was interrupted in the females with the mutation in both MMTV- and Nkx 2. 1 -driven lines.

The PEG resistant cell line exhibited a higher growth {{in the presence of}} Cd than the sensitive line, although Cd acccumulation was higher in the former than in the latter. Exogenous PEG induced an increase in Cd concentration in the sensitive but not in the resistant cell line while NaCl induced a decrease in Cd accumulation in both cell lines. In the presence of Cd alone, the water content (WC) was higher and the osmotic potential was lower in PEG-sensitive than in PEG resistant <b>line.</b> The presence <b>of</b> <b>PEG</b> in the Cd-containing medium increased the WC and decreased the osmotic potential in PEG-resistant line comparatively to Cd stress alone, while an inverse trend was observed for the sensitive line.

30|$|Herein, enlightened by {{the above}} facts, we {{developed}} a simple and reliable colorimetric method for the MW determination <b>of</b> <b>PEG</b> in aqueous solution using citrate-reduced AuNPs.

The SDs of the AuNPs are monitored by ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometry, which exploits the strong sensitivity of the localized surface plasmon resonance spectrum to the aggregation of AuNPs. In this study, the SDs are calculated by the absorbance ratios of the stable to the aggregated AuNPs in solution. The nanoparticles exhibit greater stability upon an increase in the MW (〈h 2 〉 1 / 2) <b>of</b> <b>PEG.</b> <b>Of</b> the systems tested, the 〈h 2 〉 1 / 2 <b>of</b> <b>PEG</b> molecules was found to exhibit a good linear correlation to the SDs of the AuNPs in a specified range.

Then cutting a thick piece of wood for a mallet, they drove one <b>of</b> the <b>pegs</b> into the tree and hung their weight upon it. It held, and this seemed to satisfy them, for they immediately began making a quantity <b>of</b> <b>pegs</b> <b>of</b> the same kind, while I looked on with great interest, wondering how they could possibly ascend such a lofty tree by merely driving pegs in it, the failure of any one of which at a good height would certainly cause their death. When about two dozen pegs were made, one of them began cutting some very long and slender bamboo from another clump, and also prepared some cord from the bark of a small tree. They now drove in a peg very firmly at about three feet from the ground, and bringing one of the long bamboos, stood it upright close to the tree, and bound it firmly to the two first <b>pegs,</b> by means <b>of</b> the bark cord and small notches near the head <b>of</b> each <b>peg.</b> One <b>of</b> the Dyaks now stood on the first peg and drove in a third, about level with his face, to which he tied the bamboo in the same way, and then mounted another step, standing on one foot, and holding by the bamboo at the peg immediately above him, while he drove in the next one. In this manner he ascended about twenty feet; when the upright bamboo was becoming thin, another was handed up by his companion, and this was joined by tying both bamboos to three or four <b>of</b> the <b>pegs.</b> When this was also nearly ended, a third was added, and shortly after, the lowest branches of the tree were reached, along which the young Dyak scrambled, and soon sent the Mias tumbling down headlong. I was exceedingly struck by the ingenuity of this mode of climbing, and the admirable manner in which the peculiar properties of the bamboo were made available. The ladder itself was perfectly safe, since if any one peg were loose or faulty, and gave way, the strain would be thrown on several others above and below it. I now understood the use <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> bamboo <b>pegs</b> sticking in trees, which I had often seen, and wondered for what purpose they could have been put there. This animal was almost identical in size and appearance with the one I had obtained at Semabang, and was the only other male specimen of the Simia morio which I obtained. It is now in the Derby Museum.|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} study, {{we tested the}} in vivo effects of Yy 1 gene dosage on the Peg 3 {{imprinted}} domain with various breeding schemes utilizing two sets of mutant alleles. The results indicated that a half dosage of Yy 1 coincides with the up-regulation <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 3 and Zim 1, suggesting a repressor role of Yy 1 in this imprinted domain. This repressor role of Yy 1 {{is consistent with the}} observations derived from previous in vitro studies. The current study also provided an unexpected observation that the maternal allele <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 3 is also normally expressed, and thus the expression <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 3 is bi-allelic in the specific areas of the brain, including the choroid plexus, the PVN (Paraventricular Nucleus) and the SON (Supraoptic Nucleus) of the hypothalamus. The exact roles of the maternal allele <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 3 in these cell types are currently unknown, but this new finding confirms the previous prediction that the maternal allele may be functional in specific cell types based on the lethality associated with the homozygotes for several mutant alleles <b>of</b> the <b>Peg</b> 3 locus. Overall, these results confirm the repressor role of Yy 1 in the Peg 3 domain and also provide a new insight regarding the bi-allelic expression <b>of</b> <b>Peg</b> 3 in mouse brain...|$|R

Hybrid surface micro-patterns composed of topographic structures <b>of</b> polyethylene glycol (<b>PEG)</b> -hydrogels and hierarchical <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were fabricated on silicon wafers. Micro-sized <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> Au NPs were first obtained {{on the surface of}} a silicon wafer via “micro-contact deprinting”, a method recently developed by our group. Topographic micro-patterns <b>of</b> <b>PEG,</b> <b>of</b> both low and high aspect ratio (AR up to 6), were then aligned on the pre-patterned surface via a procedure adapted from the soft lithographic method MIMIC (Micro-Molding in Capillaries), which is denoted as “adhesive embossing”. The result is a complex surface pattern consisting of alternating flat Au NP lines and thick PEG bars. Such patterns provide novel model surfaces for elucidating the interplay between (bio) chemical and physical cues on cell behavior. DFG, EXC 314, Unifying Concepts in Catalysi...|$|R
