40|$|In recent times, the {{research}} on distributed control for multi-agent systems is a trend of system control engineering. In the centralized control, {{there is a high}} <b>level</b> <b>agent</b> which manages the whole system. The high <b>level</b> <b>agent</b> gathers all data of the low <b>level</b> <b>agents</b> and controls all low <b>level</b> <b>agents.</b> Therefore, the high <b>level</b> <b>agent</b> has tremendous responsibilities, and the trouble in the high <b>level</b> <b>agent</b> causes serious problems in the whole system. In con-trast to the centralized control, each agent has dependent controller and operates separately in the distributed control. Further, each agent does not need to know the all of the informa-tions about system. They need the minimum informations to control own agent. Therefore, the distributed control is more efficient than the centralized control, and the trouble in one of the agents does not affect the whole system. Because of these advantages, the distributed control is applied to the multi-agent systems such as satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, mobile robots, and so on. In this thesis, one of the distributed control problem, the distance-based formation control for multi-agent systems, is considered. In contrast to the previous research, the system which has constantly moving leader is handled. The purpose of pro-posed controller in this thesis is to make agents converge and maintain the desired formation by measuring only relative position. Because the controller uses only relative position, the velocity of other agents should be estimated. The graph theory, adaptive control theory and nonlinear control theory are used to solve the problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a {{development of a}} design of experiment technique for quality improvement in automotive manufacturing industrial. The quality of interest is the colour shade, {{one of the key}} feature and exterior appearance for the vehicles. With low percentage of first time quality, the manufacturer has spent a lot of cost for repairing work as well as the longer production time. To permanently dissolve such problem, the precisely spraying condition should be optimised. Therefore, this work applied the multiple regression and response surface methods or RSM to investigate significant factors and to determine the optimum factor level in order {{to improve the quality of}} paint shop. Firstly, 2 k full factorial was employed to study the effect of five factors including the paint flow rate at robot setting, the paint <b>levelling</b> <b>agent,</b> the paint pigment, the additive slow solvent, and non volatile solid at spraying of atomising spraying machine. The response value of colour shade at 15 and 45 degree are measured using spectrophotometer. Then the regression models of colour shade at both degrees were developed from the significant factors affecting each response. Consequently, both regression models were placed into the form of linear programming to maximise the colour shade subjected to 3 main factors including the pigment, the additive solvent and the paint flow rate. This led to the determination of new levels of decision variables and brought 70 % reduction on paint repairs cost and improve first time quality from 70 % to 88 % for the production of interes...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to increase the retarding effect of the acid dye Telon Blue RR (C. I. Acid Blue 62) release on polyamide fibres dyeing by encapsulation of the dye in liposomes {{as an alternative to}} synthetic auxiliaries, in order to reduce effluent pollution. The retarding effect achieved with the use of mixed cationic liposomes of dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB) /soybean lecithin (containing a 10 % molar fraction of DODAB) was better in comparison with either pure soybean lecithin liposomes or synthetic auxiliaries. The retarding effect of liposomes on the dye release was analysed through changes in the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the acid dye at different conditions. The effect of temperature (in the range of 25 ºC - 70 ºC) on the spectroscopic behaviour of the dye in the absence and in presence of polyamide was also studied, in order to simulate the dyeing conditions. Exhaustion curves obtained in dyeing experiments showed that, below 45 ºC, the retarding effect of the mixed liposomes (lecithin/DODAB (9 : 1)) was {{similar to that of the}} auxiliaries, but better than the one of pure lecithin liposomes. At higher temperatures (above 45 ºC), the system lecithin/DODAB presents a better performance, achieving a higher final exhaustion level when compared with the commercial <b>levelling</b> <b>agent</b> without losing the smoothing effect of lecithin.

A related class of fluid, the deep eutectic solvents, have recently been shown to have equally interesting electrochemical properties whilst also being more air and moisture stable and economical to produce. The electrodeposition of Zn from the deep eutectic solvents 1 : 2 ChCl: ethylene glycol and 1 : 2 ChCl: urea was investigated. A theory of relative chloride activities was developed and applied to effectively account for differences in the voltammetry, chronoamperometry and morphology of deposits obtained from the two solvents. Additionally the solute concentration was determined to {{have an effect on the}} physical properties of the solvent; moreover, this effect was seen to be solvent dependent. The first EXAFS study of metal speciation in deep eutectic solvents was used to elucidate the identity of the dissolved Zn species. A novel technique, the combined in-situ AFM-EQCM, has been designed and applied, in a time resolved manner, to the study of Zn electrodeposition from 1 : 2 ChCl: ethylene glycol. It was shown that the organic additives ethylene diamine and ammonia could be used to modify the Zn deposit morphology. It has been proposed that the additives alter the Zn nucleation and growth mechanism through interaction with the free chloride ions in the electrochemical double layer. The effect of surfactants has also been described and sodium dodecyl sulphate found to be an effective <b>levelling</b> <b>agent.</b> The feasibility of Zn alloy deposition from choline chloride based deep eutectic solvents has been investigated. Zn-Cu and Zn-Co alloys were successfully deposited from deep eutectic solvents for the first time.

40|$|In [Houk, 2005], the “Agents of the mind” idea is {{proposed}} as a suitable framework {{for studying the}} dynamics and complexities of mind. “Agents of the mind” is inspired by the society of mind idea of Marvin Minsky [Minsky, 1988]. According to the society of mind, the mind is a complex system. The mind agents are elusive to identify. The mind {{is proposed}} as a hierarchy of agents. The higher hierarchy agents compose of lower hierarchy <b>agents.</b> Higher <b>level</b> <b>agents</b> do not command lower <b>level</b> <b>agents</b> but they basically trigger or invoke lower <b>level</b> <b>agents.</b> Agents are functional entities and they interact with each other. One {{important part of the}} society of mind idea is that agents at the lowest level are the real workers. Higher level functionalities emerge {{as a result of the}} functioning of the lower <b>level</b> <b>agents</b> and the interactions between them. In agents of the mind project, computational distributed processing modules (DPM) are posited for corresponding anatomically defined assemblies and they are referred to as the agents of the mind. M 1 is an anatomical area in the cerebral cortex which produces voluntary commands via its loops through basal ganglia and cerebellum. M 1 -DPM is a computational distributed processing module which simulates M 1 area and its loops for voluntary commands production. We use Netlogo 3. 1 agent-based programming environment to illuminate the properties of mind. In this work, the attractor network in cerebellar loop and the effects of Purkinje cell on production of motor commands have been studied. The results are reported in this paper...|$|R

The basic hypothesis of IDEA is that a large control system can be structured {{as a collection of}} interacting control agents, each organized around the same fundamental structure. The control system consists of two IDEA <b>agents,</b> a System <b>level</b> <b>agent</b> and a Mission <b>level</b> <b>agent,</b> and operates the K 9 planetary rover prototype in real-time. The system is evaluated in the scenario where the rover must acquire images from a specified set of locations. The IDEA agents are responsible for enabling the rover to achieve its goals while monitoring the execution and safety of the rover and recovering from dangerous states when necessary. Experiments carried out, both in simulation and on the physical rover, produced highly promising results. The rover successfully accomplished its goal while correctly responding to successive alarms. The performance analysis indicates that the system <b>level</b> <b>agent</b> can achieve a 1 - 2 Hz control rate on a 300 MHz Pentium, adequate for slow-moving planetary rovers. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{complications}} encountered {{when attempting to}} create a secure pervasive computing environment. The model introduced in this paper is primarily conceptual. The chosen environment is built around a shared space containing a classified network. Since access to the classified network is only available to people once they are in this space, we investigate what is required to ensure only authorised people can enter, which highlights problems inherent {{in any kind of}} physical access control, and then how to carry this through to manage their access to information once inside the space. A layered agent architecture is considered, using real time devices such as biometric mechanisms, door actuators and a smart card reader acting as the lower <b>level</b> <b>agents.</b> These agents are then wrapped in software allowing them to communicate with higher <b>level</b> <b>agents</b> that through the coordination of these low <b>level</b> <b>agents</b> control the security of the pervasive environment.

40|$|In recent years, {{environmental}} {{authorities in}} Sweden are reporting about high content of antimony in waste {{water that is}} discharging from polyester textile dyeing industries. It is known from available scientific publications that, antimony and its compound is harmful for both human and environment. While dyeing of polyester textiles have a commercial importance and {{in regards to the}} environmental issues, the industries are looking for the factors those results in high concentrations of antimony in their dyeing waste water. Dyeing of polyester textile requires high-temperature application in association with dyes and process aid chemicals. The waste water that is being produced after dyeing contains a complex mixture of chemicals, where antimony is one of that mixture. To comply with the industries interest, this master thesis work involved the exhaust dyeing of polyester fabrics/yarns and analyzing the dyeing waste water, to determine the amount of antimony diffusion. According to literature studies, the antimony compounds are widely used as catalyst for polyethylene terepthalate (PET) polymerization and hence antimony is present in polyester textiles. The entire experimental work intended to understand the variation of antimony concentration and the factors that are causing high antimony diffusion from polyester textiles during dyeing. The materials which are polyester yarn and fabrics were collected from 3 different dyeing industries of Sweden and the materials were in 9 different types. From material analysis (before dyeing) it has been found there were variations in antimony concentration among the materials. The process parameters that have varied during exhaust dyeing were dyeing temperature, cycle time and process aid chemical (leveling agent) adding options. With the variation in process parameters, the dyeing has performed and the dyeing waste waters have analyzed through inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectroscopy (ICP-SFMS). The expectations from the experiments were, under specific dyeing process and with same antimony concentration, the materials varying in filament/fiber diameter; big diameter filament/fiber will diffuse less antimony compared to the small diameter filaments. Also, process-wise the antimony diffusion ratio among the materials will accordingly follow the Fick’s diffusion model. To face the environmental issues with sustainability, entire thesis work could provide concentrated knowledge’s with literature evidence for the dyeing industries. As literature study indicates, the dyeing temperature, temperature ramp set and cycle time play major factor while comparing for the expected diffusion ratio. As a gentle process parameter, comparatively lower temperature and cycle time results lower antimony diffusion. The use of <b>levelling</b> <b>agent</b> could be reduced to a level with the appropriateness while added for dyeing. Also, a strong follow-up is needed in the supply chain, for lowering the initial antimony content in the materials. Overall, the findings of this thesis work also keep an importance to do further research on the polyester textile, as during the experiments most of the materials haven’t reacted accordingly as they were expected to react with the Fick’s diffusion model...|$|E
