40|$|SUMMARY. A {{number of}} {{minerals}} and residual glasses from absarokites, shoshonites, and latites have been analysed by electron probe. Clinopyroxenes show very little iron-enrichment and these rocks are thus distinguished from thoteiites and alkali basalts. Glasses from this group are also distinct fromtholeiites and alkali basalts and occupy a separate field on a CaO-Na 20 -K~O diagram. WHEN attention (Joplin, I 965) {{was drawn to}} the close resemblance between certain lavas on the south coast of New South Wales, the absarokite-shoshonite-banakite series of Wyoming (Iddings, 1895), and the latites of Sierra Nevada (Ransome, I 898), it was suggested that these rocks might be related to the alkali basalts or might even represent a distinct magma-type. A review of world occurrences of shoshonitic rocks (Joplin, I 968) has shown that compositions may range from ultramafic absarokites to felsic toscanites and <b>liparites</b> and that there is little iron enrichment. Thus, the shoshonitic rocks have some affinities with the calcalkaline andesitic suite and the suggestion that they may be related to th...|$|R

Very often they have minute irregular steam cavities which make the broken surfaces of specimens of these rocks rough and irregular, {{and from this}} character they have derived their name. It was first given to certain rocks of this class from Auvergne, and was long used in a much wider sense than that defined above; in fact it included quartz-trachytes (now known as <b>liparites</b> and rhyolites) and oligoclase-trachytes, which are now more properly assigned to andesites. The trachytes are often described as being the volcanic equivalents of the plutonic syenites. Their dominant mineral, sanidine feldspar, very commonly occurs in two generations, i.e. both as large well-shaped porphyritic crystals and in smaller imperfect rods or laths forming a finely crystalline groundmass. With this there is practically always a smaller amount of plagioclase, usually oligoclase; but the potassium feldspar (sanidine) often contains a considerable proportion of the sodium feldspar (albite), and has rather the characteristics of anorthoclase or cryptoperthite than of pure sanidine. Rhomb porphyry is an example with usually large porphyritic rhomb shaped phenocrysts embedded in a very fine-grained matrix.|$|R

The outcrops are largely hidden under laterite. The median zone is composed largely of crystalline rocks with granites and some Palaeozoic unfossiliferous rocks.

40|$|Owing to a tectonic {{disturbance}} {{that occurred during}} the Eogene, central Japan was subjected to dislocation, resulting in a great fracture -Naumann's fossa magna or Yabe's Itoigawa-Sunto Line-that severed the geological continuation of Japan between southwestern and northeastern Japan. It is highly probable that this disturbance was responsible for the vulcanism that operated at the boundary of these two large geologic units of Japan in the early Neogene. So great was the vulcanism that in many districts at the boundary, volcanic rocks and pyroclastic sediments are the chief representatives of the lower Neogene formations. Since that time vulcanism has operated in these districts repeatedly with alternate renewal and decay of activity. The Idu district occupies the Pacific side of the boundary between southwestern and northeastern Japan. The volcanic history, as inferred from the sequence of volcanic rocks of this district, is briefly summarized as follows : 1. Miocene vulcanism. The oldest vulcanism occurred during early Miocene or a little before it, with submarine eruptions of andesites. This oldest vulcanism was followed, probably some time later when the formations practically composed of the oldest andesites had more or less deformed, by submarine eruptions of <b>liparites</b> and dacites. This phase of vulcanism, was succeeded by a subordinate phase of activity, characterized by minor extrusions of andesites. All these Miocene volcanic rocks were subjected more or less to alterations-chloritization, silicification, sericitization, etc. The succession of these rocks implies considerable time, although its actual duration is a question we have no means of answering at present. The only precise datum is that afforded by faunal evidence, which assigns the dacitic volcanics lying some distance above the base of the complex to lower Miocene. 2. Pliocene vulcanism. Regarding vulcanism during late Miocene and early Pliocene, we are largely in the dark as only a few rocks have been identified with these ages. In the latest Pliocene age, eruptions of dacites and andesites took place. They were again largely submarine eruptions. 3. Pleistocene vulcanism. At the close of the Tertiary, or {{in the beginning of the}} Pleistocene, Idu peninsula was subjected to crustal movement, generally in the sense of uplift. It was not until some time after the movement that raised so much of the Tertiary sea-floor into land had taken place, that Pleistocene vulcanism became vigorous. It was chiefly concentrated in the northern part of the peninsula; while in the southern part, Tertiary vulcanism was succeeded by Pleistocene and Recent relative quiescence. The andesitic volcanoes Amagi, Usami, Taga and Yugawara, together with other yet uriinvestigated volcanoes in the northwestern part of the peninsula, are, as also the dacitic masses in the vicinity of Atami, products of Pleistocene vulcanism. The basaltic Oomuroyama group represents the last vulcanism, which probably occurred some time later, at the time when the early Pleistocene volcanoes Usami, Taga, etc., were subjected to more or less dislocation and dissection. 4. Recent vulcanism. In the Idu peninsula, none of the latest volcanoes is known to have erupted in historic times; while the numerous hot-springs there are displaying post-volcanic thermal activity. In the Idu Sitito, on the contrary, liparitic and basaltic vulcanism was active during historic times. An examination of the materials that were erupted during the whole course of the vulcanism and so fully recorded in the geology of the Idu district, reveals the fact that andesitic and liparitic or dacitic rocks have played their role in every age froin lower Miocene up to Recent. Thus, a discrimination of the two lineages-andesitic and liparitic or dacitic-is essential to a proper understanding of the vulcanism of the district. As to the genetical relationship between the two lineages, very little can be said now. If we assume in the meantime that the rocks of these two lineages were derived from a common stockmagma, then their differentiation from this magma must be explained by one or other of two alternatives : (1) Either the partial magmas that separated out during early Tertiary had remained throughout succeeding ages as available sources of the andesitic rocks on the one hand and of the liparitic or dacitic rocks on the other, and that further differentiation had gone on within them; or (2) that differentiation to an advanced stage had proceeded repeatedly along definite lines at wide intervals of time. Of these two alternatives, the writer is inclined to accept the former, agreeing with S. Tsuboi in the opinion that the basaltic and liparitic rocks which erupted during Recent time in the Idu Sitito territory are descendants respectively of the andesitic and liparitic or dacitic rocks that erupted during the Tertiary and early Pleistocene in the Idu peninsula. Examples presenting close analogies with the volcanic sequence of the Idu district could be cited from adjoining districts : Sinano, Asigara, and Oiso. The distribution of the sites of vents of liparitic and dacitic rocks shows distinct zones parallel with each other in the direction from N. E. to S. W. The directions of these zones are very remarkable in contrast with the Huzi Volcanic Zone, which runs in the N. N. W. - S. S. E. direction, and in which direction the Quaternary andesitic and basaltic volcanoes of the district are aligned. The zones of these two directions-N. E. -S. W. and N. N. W. -S. S. E. -seem to represent the underground fracture lines connected with available sources, respectively, of the acidic volcanic rocks and the basic volcanic rocks...|$|R

The sedimentary structures of the sandstone layers and lithology of conglomerates of the upper most formation have been described. The sequence of the Palaeozoic formations is as follows (in descending order) : 1. sandstone formation 1750 m k. chert formation 210 m j. shale formation 640 m i. chert formation 480 m h. schalstein formation 290 - 390 m g. shale-sandstone formation 460 m+ The thickness of the entire formations measured in this district is 3850 m, and the total thickness of the Palaeozoic formations (from the lowermost a. formation in the former report to the uppermost 1. formation in this paper) attains up to about 8000 m. The greater part of the formations in this district is regarded to be Middle Permian in age. The formations form as a whole a synclinal structure plunging to the west. The low angle thrust reported by FUJIWARA and SAWADA (1940) (the "Kumogahata thrust") must be denied so far as this district is concerned. In the 1. sandstone formation, many strata possess the character of turbidite, and some ill-preserved sole marks (flute cast, loaded flute cast and groove cast) were found in the formation. Examples of internal structures of the formation are shown in Figures (3, 4). A few muddy conglomerate beds were found in the 1. sandstone formation. Pebbles of the beds are ill-sorted and round-subround in general. There are andesite, dacite, <b>liparite,</b> quartz-porphyry, quartz diorite, granite, gneiss, shale, sandstone, chert, and others in the pebbles of conglomerates. These pebbles clearly show that there had been an upheaval of lands in the Honshu geosyncline, that had been composed of acidic and intermediate volcanic rocks covering palaeozoic sedimentaries, and granitic rocks had intruded into these rocks, Besides, a few orthoquartzitic pebbles were discovered in the conglomerate. The occurrence of Monotis (Entomonotis) ocotica, found in a block of rock on a river-bed in this district, was noted, which indicates the extent of the palaeogeography of the Triassic period in southwest Japan...|$|E

Spodosols of the Toba highland areas require special attention because these forested lands are gradually cleared, but then abandoned because they are {{not suitable for}} agricultural development, causing land degradation. This study aimed to evaluate mineralogical and chemical characteristics of Toba highland Spodosols, North Sumatra, and their implication on agricultural development.  Three pedons of the Toba highland Spodosols from Humbang Hasundutan regency were studied, consisted of soils developed from volcanic sand overlying <b>liparite</b> tuff under the influence of low temperature and high rainfall. Field observation was conducted in January 2008. Fifteen soil samples were collected from the three pedons based on the depth of soil horizon.  Results indicated that the formation of these Spodosols were influenced by parent material, high elevation (1676 - 1821 m) above sea level), and by high amount of rainfall (2167 mm).  The Spodosols in Toba highland {{were still in the}} early stage of development as characterized by shallow effective soil depth (22 - 23 cm), domination of weatherable minerals (39 - 81 %) in the sand fraction and dominated by amorphous mineral as shown by sum of A 1 + 1 / 2 Fe extracted by ammonium oxalate as much as 0. 6 - 12. 8 %. The Spodosols were also characterized by coarse texture (66 - 95 % sand fraction in E and B horizons), high organic-C content (1. 4 - 37. 7 %), acid soil reaction (pH 3. 7 -  5. 3), very high K 2 O in Oa horizon (552 - 933 mg kg- 1) and B spodic or C horizon (812 - 2028 mg kg- 1), and low base saturation (< 5 %). The existence of biological processes in the surface layer was indicated by accumulation of exchangeable bases (0. 88 - 1. 14 cmolc kg- 1 in Oa horizon and 0. 09 - 0. 25 cmolc kg- 1  in B horizon), P 2 O 5 (181 - 298 mg kg- 1 in Oa horizon and 3 - 24 mg kg- 1  in E horizon), and K 2 O (552 - 933 mg kg- 1 in Oa horizon and 13 -  30 mg kg- 1 in E horizon). However, these nutrients were easily leached after deforestation. With the sandy texture, loose structure, and no vegetation cover, the erosion hazard is high in the deforested areas. Therefore, lands with Spodosols of the Toba highland, especially are not recommended for agricultural development, rather they should be kept as forest lands...|$|E
40|$|When {{volcanic}} activity {{began in the}} region studied {{is a matter of}} conjecture. There is no doubt, however, that volcanoes were already in existence in Eocene times, seeing that the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands are composed almost exclusively of andesitic rocks, both explosive and effusive, with a few intercalated Eocene limestones. If these islands were located on the submarine ridge that underlies the insular volcanoes of the Huzi volcanic zone, it would be more than likely that the Ogasawara volcanics are products of the earliest recognized forerunner of {{volcanic activity}} in that zone, but their more or less outlying position seem to militate against this view. However, notwithstanding the lack of positive evidence indicating structural similarity, the writer presents the above view as a possible explanation, because the Ogasawara andesites show the same general characteristics, both microscopical and chemical, as the allied rocks from the Huzi volcanic zone. The first indisputable record of volcanic activity in the Huzi volcanic zone dates to early Miocene. This {{seems to be the case}} not only with the Idu region, in the study of which the writer is chiefly concerned, but also with the much larger region of the "fossa magna", of which Idu forms but a small part. Through the whole of the period that succeeded it, the same general sequence of volcanic activity has beeu maintained in most parts of the fossa magna with certain local differences. It is therefore highly probable that, although local volcanic activity had already manifested itself in Eocene times in the Ogasawara Islands, more active and more regional activity had started contemporaneously with the tectonic disturbances, the result of all which is the fossa magna, which severed the geologic continuation between southwestern and northeastern Japan. As to whether or not the Ogasawara Islands were subjected to the same disturbances, the writer is unable to say. The lower Miocene volcanism in Idu, which occurred beneath the sea of that time, is represented by a thick series of highly altered volcanics (lavas and pyroclastics), referred to as the Yugasima beds (or the propylite series). This series consists for the most part of basaltic and andesitic rocks, although dacites and liparites are also represented, especially in the upper horizons of the series. The succession of these rocks implies considerable time, during which certain structural deformations might possibly have recurred, resulting in several periods of volcanic accumulation. But its actual duration is a question we have no means of answering at present, the only precise datum being the faunal evidence (Lepidocyclina limestone from Simo-Siroiwra and Miogypsina limestone from Nasimoto), which assigns certain dacitic volcanics lying some distance above the base of the series to lower Miocene. The propylite series is invaded by numerous minor intrusives (dikes, sheets, and necks) of various rock-types―diabase, porphyrite, basalt, andesite, dacite, and <b>liparite</b> (quartz-porphyry). Although these intrusives are evidently later than the propylite series, not all of them were formed contemporaneously. The basic intrusives (including diabase, porphyrite, basalt, and andesite) are mostly older, all being altered in the same way as the propylite series in which they are found, whereas the more acid intrusives are mostly somewhat younger, being probably correlated with the acid volcanics that overlie unconformably the propylite series. The lower Miocene volcanism was followed, probably during upper Miocene, by submarine eruptions of liparites and dacites, with subordinate andesites, all of'which are distributed mostly in south Idu and rather locally in north Idu. As just mentioned, some of the minor intrusives in the propylite series, especially those of acid rocks, might be the feeders of the upper Miocene volcanics. In contrast with the propylite series, these upper Miocene volcanics are either quite fresh or are but little altered. The foregoing phase of volcanism was succeeded, most probably during lower Pliocene, by a subordinate phase of activity characterized by minor intrusions (dikes) and extrusions of andesites. Regarding volcanism during this period, however, we are largely in the dark as only a few rocks in Idu have been identified with that period. In the uppermost Pliocene, eruptions of basalts, dacites, and andesites, occurred only locally in Idu, and these were again exclusively submarine. At the close of the Tertiary or the beginning of the Pleistocene, Idu peninsula was subjected like the other regions in the fossa magma to crustal movement, generally in the sense of uplift, and it was not until some time after this movement, which raised so much of the Tertiary sea-floor into land, that Pleistocene volcanism became vigorous. This volcanism was concentrated mainly in the northern part of the peninsula, while in the southern part, Tertiary volcanism was succeeded by that relative quiescence which marked the Pleistocene aud Recent epochs. The first phase of lower Pleistocene volcanism is thus represented by eruptions of basalts, andesites, and dacites, all occurring in the forms of tuff and tuff-breccia that now occupy the bulk of the lacustrine deposits (Ono beds, Simo-Hata beds, and Simo-Tanna beds) accumulated during that period on the erosion reliefs of the Tertiary formations. It was followed at the end of lower Pleistocene and in the upper Pleistocene, when the lower Pleistocene deposits had been more or less deformed, by eruptions of central volcanoes. The volcanoes Tensi, Usami, Taga, Yugawara, Asitaka, Amagi, Hakone, and others in the northwestern part of the Idu peninsula yet unstudied, as also the dacitic masses in the vicinity of Atami, are ^ all products of this phase of activity, with however certain differences in the times when the activities began and in the period for which they lasted. The basaltic- Omuro-yama group represents the last volcanism in the peninsula, which probably occurred some time later when the older volcanoes Tensi, Usami, Taga, etc., were subjected to more or less dislocation and dissection; while the numerous hot-springs there represent a stage of post-volcanic thermal activity. So far as its visible part is concerned, Huzi may date from a much later age, probably Recent. That one of the earliest lava-flows from the volcano is younger than the older somma of Hakone has been definitely proved by field evidence. All the insular volcanoes of the Seven Idu Islands and the Southern Islands are undoubtedly products of Quaternary volcanism, whatever may be the history of their foundation. Of these, the dissected basaltic volcanoes Utone-sima, To-sima, Mikura-sima, Higasi-yama (Hatizyo-sima), Tori-sima, and Kita lo-sima probably date to Pleistocene. With the exception of Tori-sima 111), we have no record of eruption of any of them. The basaltic volcanoes 0 -sima, Miyake-sima, Nisi-yama (Hatizyo-sima), and Aoga-sima have been active in Recent times, all displaying lava out-flows in historic times. The liparitic volcanoes Nii-sima and Kodu-sima, according to records, also have had one eruption each. With the exception of the rarer alkaline rocks (potash-liparite and trachyandesite), the rocks that erupted in the course of the volcanism just outlined above have all several characteristics in common, mineralogical as well as chemical, with however certain differences due to local peculiarities. Whether chemically or mineralogically, there seems to be no systematic difference between the Tertiary and Quaternary series, excepting that the former usually has a higher water-content than the latter. A petropraphic similarity in the Ogasawara rocks to allied rocks from Idu is quite apparent. Of the various rock-types represented, the basalts and basaltic andesites are most predominant besides being regional in distribution, while the others are rather local. These regional rock-types are usually characterized by phenocrysts of calcic plagioclase (anorthite to calcic labradorite) and pyroxenes (augite or hypersthene or both), with or without olivine, in a groundmass containing less calcic plagioclase (bytownite to sodic labradorite), pigeonite, magnetite, and one or more of silica minerals (cristobalite, tridymite, and quartz). It is notable that most of the young lavas from Miyake-sima, Hatizyo-sima, Aoga-sima, etc., are poor in phenocrysts or almost aphyric, while the old lavas from these volcanoes are sometimes strongly porphyritic with large phenocrysts of anorthite. Like the latter, most of the lavas from the Pleistocene basaltic volcanoes (Kita lo-sima, Tori-sima, Mikura-sima, etc.), as also the basalts in the Tertiary series, are strongly porphyritic, sometimes with large phenocrysts of anorthite, the less porphyritic or almost-aphyric rocks being rarely met with. The variation diagram of the aphyric and aphanitic rocks (magma variation diagram) from both the Tertiary series and the Quaternary volcanoes shows smooth curves for all oxides, showing the probable variations in the magmatic liquids from which most of the volcanic rocks of the present region seem to have been derived. The variation diagram of type-averages of the Tertiary porphyritic rocks is identical with the same diagram of the Quaternary porphyritic rocks. The two are again similar to the variation diagram of the well-differentiated rocks of one volcano, namely, Amagi, with the result that either of these two diagrams will represent the chemical variation for rocks of the entire region. The variation on the whole follows that of type-averages of the Japanese volcanic rocks, thus showing the common characteristics that distinguish them from corresponding type-averages of the world's igneous rocks: namely, in containing higher lime, lower alkalies, and larger ratios of iron-oxides to magnesia. But, as compared. with type-averages of the Japanese volcanic rocks, the corresponding type-averages of the present region are usually a little higher in soda but lower in potash. So also do the latter as compared with the rocks from the two other volcanic zones in Japan, namely, the medial volcanic zone of NE. Japan and the Ryukyu volcanic zone. The rocks of the region studied, except a few alkaline rocks, may be treated as a connected suite, all belonging to what Peacock calls the "calcic series", with high alkali-lime index, 62 ・ 5 for the Tertiary series and 65 ・ 7 for the Quaternary series. If the entire suite has originated from a common magma, we would have to admit that acid rocks such as liparites were derived by processes of differentiation from a basaltic magma. During the whole period since the Tertiary, however, volcanism in the present region has been alternately basaltic (or andesitic) and liparitic (or dacitic). This recurrence of similar rock-types points to one of two explanations : (1) either a body of acid magna that had separated out during early Tertiary or before it had remained throughout succeeding ages as an available source of the acid rocks that erupted during several distinct epochs, or (2) that differentiation to an advanced stage had proceeded repeatedly along definite lines at wide intervals of time. Although, of these two alternatives, the former is the more simple, the latter process also must have operated at certain local centres in the region, seeing that well-differentiated rocks intimately related, structurally as well as petrologically, occur in certain central volcanoes such as Amagi. Although the rocks of the so-called Huzi volcanic zone may be treated on the whole as a connected magmatic suite, we find certain differences among them due to local peculiarities, mineralogical as well as chemical. Thus the Huzi rocks differ from the allied rocks of Idu and the Southern Islands in that the former are distinctly higher in alkalies, especially potash, and lower in lime than the latter. So also do the rocks from the volcanoes Kayaga-take and liduna-yama compared with the allied rocks of Idu and the Southern Islands. Although these two volcanoes lie farther north of Huzi, they belong in a wide sense to the Huzi volcanic zone. From these facts in view, the writer believes that the Huzi volcanic zone may be divided petrologically into two subzones, namely, the northern inland zone referred to as the Huzi Volcanic Zone proper, and the southern oceanic zone referred to as the O-sima Volcanic Zone. The Huzi volcanic zone proper includes the inland volcanoes Huzi, Kayaga-take, liduna-yama Kurohime-yama, and many others (Myoko-zan, Yatuga-take volcano group, etc.) yet unstudied, all of which are linearly arranged in a NNW. -SSE. direction on the fossa magna, while the 0 -sima volcanic zone includes, in addition to the volcanoes of the Idu peninsula, the insular and submarine volcanoes of the Pacific―the Seven Idu Islands and the Southern Islands. To generalize, although the rocks of the so-called Huzi volcanic zone, with the exception of a feiv alkaline rocks, belong on the whole to a calcic series, the rocks from its northern inland part―the Huzi volcanic zone proper―are higher in alkalies and loiver in lime than those from the southern oceanic part―the O-sima volcanic zone. Whether or not the chemical differences of these two sub-zones are in any way connected with some differences in the geotectonic structure and in the nature of rocks of their foundation is a question we have no means of answering at present. The O-sima volcanic zone just proposed has two kinds of alkaline rocks, namely, potash-liparite (Manzo-yama and Kodu-sima) and trachyandesite (Io-sima). As to the genesis of the potash-liparite, a possible explanation was offered in an earlier paper 112). As to the genesis of the trachyandesite, little can be said with certainty at present except that its local distribution in the Volcano Islands group and the occcurrence in it of porphyritic olivine and augite, both of which are similar in microscopic characters to the respective minerals in the basalts from the same group, make it possible that it is genetically related to these basalts. In this connection the distribution of the sites of volcanic vents in the Volcano Islands group calls for notice. Although the general trend of this group is from NNW. to SSE. ―that is, the trend of the so-called Huzi volcanic zone―, lo-sima, besides being elongated in outline from NE. to SW., has numerous solfataras which are aligned on fissures running in the same direction. The trachyandesitic submarine volcano, "Sin-to Volcano", also lies on a line running NE. -SW. through the basaltic volcano, Minami lo-sima. Similar relation holds between the basaltic and liparitic volcanoes of the Seven Idu Islands 11 ' 0. Therefore, if the sites of volcanic vents were fixed by dislocation or lines of weakness in the earth's crust, these two trends―the NNW. -SSE. trend of the basaltic (or andesitic) volcanoes and the NE. -SW. trend of the liparitic (or dacitic) and trachyandesitic volcanoes―may be a surface manifestation of the underground structure of the region, the former representing a principal fracture (Daly's "abyssal fissure") 114) connected with deep-seated reservoirs of a regional basaltic magma, and the latter a subsidiary fracture connected with shallow-seated reservoirs of local differentiates, either liparitic or trachyandesitic, from the basaltic magma. In conclusion, a few remarks should be added here regarding the alteration through secondary changes of the Tertiary volcanics in Idu, although on this point the writer has not yet been able to gather much information. As already noted, the only rocks that are altered to any important extent are these of the propylite series and the minor intrusives in that series. The common secondary minerals in them are chlorite, calcite, sericite, epidote, limonite, haematite, pyrite, zeolite, albite, and quartz, with amorphous silica, two or more of these minerals always occurring together. The alteration, however, has not advanced to the same degree and in the same way throughout the series. In some parts of the series, most of the rocks are almost unchanged, although, as a rule, incipient alteration of the constituent minerals is found only to a very slight extent, while in many others the alteration is considerable, resulting in virtual disappearance of the original structure of the rock, whether viewed microscopically or in the field. We often find that complete recrystallization has occurred, showing a mosaic of quartz and feldspar, with occasional flakes of sericite and chlorite. Since the alteration of the propylite series has advanced farther not only at and near the contacts with minor intrusives in the series, but also in the intrusives themselves than at distances away from the contacts, it could only have been caused by local and chemical effects, that, is to say, by chemical reactions between the original rocks of the series and some hydrothermal solutions 115 'that possibly generated in a post-magmatic stage subsequent to the minor intrusions rather than by regional and dynamic agencies. The metamorphic changes justifying the name, propylite, were probably caused by a sodiferous hydrothermal solution, possibly related to the basic intrusives (diabase, porphyrite, basalt, and andesite). The product of this intense mineralization which is so economically important and which has been worked in several parts of the propylite series in the region, was generated probably by a hydrothermal solution rich in silica generally related to the acid intrusives (dacite and <b>liparite</b> or quartz-porphyry). K. Sugi divided the metamorphism of the Misaka series of the Nakagawa district adjoining the northern part of Hakone, which is intruded by a large quartz-diorite mass, and which is a lower Miocene series correlated with the propylite series of Idu, into two stages: dynamic metamorphism caused by a mountain-building movement generated within a geosynclinal area before the intrusion of the quartz-diorite and contact metamorphism at the time of that intrusion 116). The writer is of the opinion that the dynamic metamorphism, if it did occur, must have been due merely to local stresses that generated outside the boundary of the quartz-diorite mass at the beginning of the intrusion of that mass, seeing that the metamorphism is quite local in the Misaka series both at and near the contacts with the intrusive, and that such metamorphism is never met with in the propylite series of Idu, which belongs to the same geotectonic unit as the Misaka series...|$|E
