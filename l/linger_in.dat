5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the primary method of infection in animals is through ingestion. It is thought that prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of dead animals and via urine, saliva, and other body fluids. They may then <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> the soil by binding to clay and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body. This act {{was seen as a}} way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said to <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.|$|E

5|$|Tomb of Horrors {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a D {{campaign}} setting. In Tomb of Horrors, the adventurers {{encounter a}} number of tricks and traps while attempting to penetrate the tomb of a dead wizard. As the scenario begins, the players are told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all.|$|E

25|$|In 1819, The Treaty of Calhoun ended all Cherokee {{claims to}} the Smokies, and Tsiya'hi was {{abandoned}} shortly thereafter. The Cherokee would <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> the surrounding forests, however, occasionally attacking settlers until 1838 when they were removed to the Oklahoma Territory (see Trail of Tears).|$|E

25|$|Sound {{was also}} used to express ideas of paradise. The {{interior}} of the mausoleum has a reverberation time (the time taken from when a noise is made until all of its echoes have died away) of 28 seconds. This provided an atmosphere where the words of those employed to continually recite the Qu'ran (the Hafiz), in tribute and prayer {{for the soul of}} Mumtaz, would <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> the air.|$|E
25|$|By early August, Zissu and the Mossad {{were again}} collaborating on {{the rescue of}} Hungarian Jews {{escaping}} the Holocaust. His work was tolerated by Antonescu, on condition that no refugees {{would be allowed to}} <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> Romania-proper. In all, Zissu claimed to have personally rescued some 14,000 of his coreligionists by obtaining them safe passage to Turkey. He is also credited with having sent over seven individual transports, of which the Mefküre was torpedoed by the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The new realms {{were not}} long at peace. Soon after coming into power, George II of Kakheti {{launched}} an expedition against Kartli, intending to depose King David X and conquer his kingdom. David's brother Bagrat successfully defended the kingdom {{and managed to}} capture George II in an ambush. Peace didn't <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> the west either, as David X faced incursions from Alexander II of Imereti, who was somewhat less successful than his Kakhetian counterpart. In 1513 the Kingdom of Kartli conquered Kakheti {{but only for a}} short time – the Kingdom of Kakheti was restored with the support of local nobles by Levan of Kakheti, son and heir of George II, in 1520.|$|E

25|$|Carpathia docked at 9:30p.m. on 18 April at New York's Pier 54 and {{was greeted}} by some 40,000people waiting at the {{quayside}} in heavy rain. Immediate relief {{in the form of}} clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the Travelers Aid Society of New York, and the Council of Jewish Women, among other organisations. Many of Titanics surviving passengers did not <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> New York but headed onwards immediately to relatives' homes. Some of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to take them home, and the Pennsylvania Railroad laid on a special train free of charge to take survivors to Philadelphia. Titanics 214 surviving crew members were taken to the Red Star Line's steamer , where they were accommodated in passenger cabins.|$|E
25|$|Several {{phenomena}} {{are well}} documented during witnessed meteorite falls {{too small to}} produce hypervelocity craters. The fireball that occurs as the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere can appear to be very bright, rivaling the sun in intensity, although most are far dimmer and {{may not even be}} noticed during daytime. Various colors have been reported, including yellow, green, and red. Flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up. Explosions, detonations, and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls, which can be caused by sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can be heard over wide areas, with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers. Whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard, but are poorly understood. Following passage of the fireball, {{it is not unusual for}} a dust trail to <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere for several minutes.|$|E
25|$|Concerns about The Barrier's {{instability}} due to volcanic, tectonic {{or heavy}} rainfall activity prompted {{the provincial government}} to declare the area immediately below it unsafe for human habitation in 1980. This led to the evacuation of the small resort village of Garibaldi nearby and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone. Should The Barrier completely collapse, Garibaldi Lake would be entirely released and downstream damage in the Cheakamus and Squamish rivers would be considerable, including major damage {{to the town of}} Squamish and possibly an impact-wave on the waters of Howe Sound that would reach Vancouver Island. The landslide area {{is referred to as the}} Barrier Civil Defence Zone. Although landslides are unlikely to happen in the near future, warning signs are posted at the zone to make visitors aware of the potential danger and to minimize the chance of fatalities in the event of a slide. For safety reasons, BC Parks recommends visitors not to camp, stop or <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> the Barrier Civil Defence Zone.|$|E

25|$|Three {{recent studies}} by the Washington Department of Ecology showed that toxic {{chemicals}} banned decades ago continue to <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish collected from 45 sites. The toxic substances included PCBs; dioxins, two chlorinated pesticides, DDE and dieldrin, and PBDEs. As {{a result of the}} study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the Washington State Department of Health is advising the public not to eat mountain whitefish from the Wenatchee River from Leavenworth downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also indicated high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.|$|E
500|$|Christopher John Farley of Time {{magazine}} {{wrote that}} the album ranged from being [...] "relaxing" [...] to [...] "cathartic", and [...] "these vocals {{from one of the}} best country singers <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> the mind". The album's preceding singles—"The Heart Won't Lie" [...] (a duet with then-labelmate Vince Gill) and [...] "Take It Back"—were Top 10 hits on the Billboard country chart, reaching No. 1 and No. 5 respectively. Like its preceding album, It's Your Call sold over a million copies, eventually certifying by the RIAA in sales of double-platinum.|$|E
500|$|The {{tiger shark}} is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter. It is notable {{for having the}} widest food {{spectrum}} of all sharks, {{with a range of}} prey that includes crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, sea snakes, dolphins, and even other smaller sharks. It also has a reputation as a [...] "garbage eater", consuming a variety of inedible, man-made objects that <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> its stomach. [...] Though apex predators, tiger sharks are sometimes taken by groups of killer whales. It is considered a near threatened species due to finning and fishing by humans.|$|E

500|$|Chaco Canyon is watered by winter {{storms and}} {{localized}} summer rains that fill the arroyos. Chaco Wash is deep, and it drains {{to the water}} table located [...] below the canyon floor. Farming terraces on the mesa wall behind Chetro Ketl {{may have been used}} for growing specialized crops such as tobacco, and canals running from Pueblo Bonito to Chetro Ketl probably carried rain water. Chetro Ketl's position in downtown Chaco and its proximity to South Gap further aided agricultural efforts near the great house, as summer storms tended to <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> the opening, funneling moisture to the area.|$|E
500|$|Theodore {{meets with}} Catherine at a {{restaurant}} to sign the divorce papers and he mentions Samantha. Appalled {{that he can be}} romantically attached to what she calls a [...] "computer," [...] Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal with real human emotions. Her accusations <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> his mind. Sensing that something is amiss, Samantha suggests using a sex surrogate, Isabella, who would simulate Samantha {{so that they can be}} physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but is overwhelmed by the strangeness of the experience. Terminating the encounter, he sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between himself and Samantha.|$|E
500|$|VanOrd gave {{high marks}} to the pack's {{frightening}} atmosphere, stating that [...] "haunting new music instills a palpable sense of tension, {{and the dark}} interior spaces provide a sinister contrast to the shimmering waterfalls and scorching lava rivers on the planet's surface." [...] The IGN review observed that the visuals and audio surpass many side quests of the main game. Critics also highlighted very positively the story. Eurogamer opined that the ending was effective and unexpected, while VanOrd remarked that the ending cutscene [...] "features some uncomfortable images that will <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> your mind even after you've returned to the [...]" [...] Despite evaluating the pack's short length, VanOrd concluded that [...] "Overlord" [...] "is one downloadable delight Mass Effect 2 fans shouldn't miss." ...|$|E
