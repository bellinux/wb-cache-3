Schumacher {{retired from the}} inaugural race of the season , and scored {{a point in the}} second race in Malaysia. In China Schumacher started on the front row {{alongside}} Rosberg on pole, but retired due to a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> after a mechanics error during a pit stop.|$|E
5|$|On lap 241, {{the pace}} car {{came out for}} the eighth and final caution, after Joey Logano {{collided}} with the outside wall. McMurray led on the restart, but Stewart reclaimed the lead on lap 247. Seven laps later, Johnson was forced to pit due to a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel.</b> By lap 257, Stewart had a lead of over one second. Five laps later, Hamlin claimed sixth from Harvick. During the 263rd lap, Bowyer passed McMurray for second. Four laps later, Newman passed Kyle Busch for tenth position. After 269 laps, Stewart lead was over Bowyer was 1.6 seconds. Six laps later, Hamlin moved into fifth position after passing Earnhardt. During lap 290, Hamlin passed McMurray for third. With two laps remaining, Stewart and Burton both ran out of fuel, handing the lead back to Bowyer. Bowyer maintained the lead to win his first race of the 2010 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of McMurray in third, Earnhardt in fourth, and Harvick in fifth.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{performances}} {{came from}} Berger, {{who took the}} final podium position despite being delayed {{during one of his}} routine pit stops due to a problem with a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> nut; Mika Häkkinen, who finished fourth for the McLaren team despite its new car proving to be uncompetitive in pre-season testing; and Mika Salo, who drove strongly {{in the first half of}} the race to run third in his first Grand Prix for the Tyrrell team, only to suffer from a cramp and drop back to seventh place at the finish. Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell was standing in for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team could produce a wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car's initial cockpit design had proved to be too narrow for him to drive comfortably.|$|E
25|$|Earnhardt then battled a {{struggling}} car at New Hampshire, where he finished 14th. After the final off week, he found some consistency with finishes of 6th at Indianapolis and 5th at Pocono, while battling <b>loose</b> <b>wheels</b> and vibrations in {{a span of}} two weeks.|$|R

50|$|As {{the field}} {{came down the}} mainstretch for the start, Billy Foster was among those jockeying for position. As the green flag fell, he nearly touched wheels with Gordon Johncock and lost control. He spun {{directly}} into the outside wall, just beyond the start/finish line, and triggered a huge pileup. Fourteen cars were involved, with debris and <b>loose</b> <b>wheels</b> bouncing all over the racing surface.|$|R
5|$|Four laps later, Gordon passed Johnson {{to become}} the leader. On lap 218, the seventh caution was given after Logano's engine failed. Most of the front-runners made pit stops during the caution. At the lap 225 restart, Gordon was the leader, ahead of Kyle Busch, Harvick, and Stewart, while Johnson {{restarted}} in ninth, after having an 18-second pit stop. By lap 236, Johnson had moved up to the fifth position. Four laps later, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. made pit stops because of a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel.</b> By lap 244, Gordon had a 1.1 second lead over Kyle Busch. Gordon continued to increase his lead over the second position, while Martin passed Menard for the 11th position. On the following lap, Stewart moved into the third position. By the 277th lap, Gordon had a 1.8 second lead over Kyle Busch in second. On lap 282, Kyle Busch made a pit stops, one lap before Gordon, Stewart, and Harvick made pit stops. On lap 284, Johnson made a pit stop, as the eighth caution was given after Andy Lally collided with the wall. At the lap 290 restart, Stewart was the leader, ahead of Kyle Busch, Gordon, and Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Mansell {{was putting}} {{pressure}} on Prost, who had trouble with a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel,</b> and made a daring move through the chicane on lap 63 to take second. Soon afterward, Prost was forced to stop to change the wheel and dropped down to fifth. Senna took his fourth win in four ahead of Mansell, Alesi, Moreno, Prost and Emanuele Pirro.|$|E
25|$|At Bristol in August, Busch {{started on}} the outside row and led 54 laps early, before a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> caused him to go behind the wall, {{resulting}} in a 31st-place finish, 26 laps down. However, he bounced back over the following two weeks, with a fourth-place finish at Atlanta. The following week at Richmond, Busch started second and {{had one of the}} strongest cars of the night, ultimately finishing second to Carl Edwards. This also marked Furniture Row Racing's first ever appearance in the Chase.|$|E
50|$|Ryan Blaney made an {{unscheduled}} {{stop for}} a <b>loose</b> right-front <b>wheel</b> on lap 48. Earnhardt made an unscheduled stop on lap 71 for a shredded right-rear tire. Harvick won the first stage and the first caution of the race flew for {{the completion of the}} stage.|$|R

25|$|At Chicagoland, Busch {{opened the}} Chase with a fourth-place finish. He {{then had a}} 13th-place finish at New Hampshire. At Dover, Busch {{finished}} 21st, three laps down, after he had to pit for a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel.</b> At Kansas, Busch was forced {{to start at the}} rear of the field when he crashed in practice and had to bring out a backup car. He managed to work his way through the field to finish second. This brought Busch up to ten top-five and fifteen top-ten finishes over 30 races. Busch would go on to finish tenth in the final standings.|$|E
25|$|Earnhardt Jr. {{opened the}} Challenger Round with a 12th-place finish at Chicagoland. At New Hampshire, he ran up front {{for most of}} the day, but an {{emergency}} fuel stop with two laps to go led him to finish 25th, two laps down, and {{at the bottom of the}} Chase cutline. At Dover, despite falling back at a few points, Earnhardt Jr. was locked in a battle with Jamie McMurray for control of the final transfer spot into the Contender Round. He almost did not make it into the next round, with his chances being saved thanks to a caution for Brett Moffitt's crash on lap 357 keeping him from having to make a green flag pit stop to replace a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel.</b> On the last restart, Earnhardt Jr. overtook McMurray on the outside, and finished third, clinching the final transfer spot and bumping McMurray out of the Chase.|$|E
25|$|At Atlanta, Earnhardt Jr. {{came home}} with another third-place finish and at Las Vegas, he {{finished}} fourth, scoring his third Top 5 finish after taking two tires during green flag pit-stops with 30 laps to go. At Phoenix, he had his worst finish of the year, with a last place finish after a tire-blowout. At Auto Club, he finished 6th. At Martinsville, he also ran inside the Top 20 until a tire-blowout made him {{get involved in a}} massive pileup that destroyed the front end of his car. Because of this crash, he would go on to finish 36th. At Texas, he narrowly was beaten by Kevin Harvick for second place. At Bristol, he ran as high as third until a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> put him down two laps down. Although he never got them back, he was able to bring home a 16th-place finish only two laps down. At Richmond, he ran in the Top 10 all day until he and Tony Stewart made contact but managed to finish 14th.|$|E
50|$|Truex got the {{superior}} restart and took back {{the lead on}} lap 108. Harvick settled into second, but made an unscheduled stop for {{what turned out to}} be a <b>loose</b> left-rear <b>wheel</b> on lap 125. Rounding Turn 1 on lap 141, Matt DiBenedetto suffered a right-front tire cut and slammed the wall, bringing out the third caution. The red flag was displayed two laps later for lightning in the area, and the ensuing downpour, for over 90 minutes (1:39.56). When the red flag was lifted shortly after 9:30 p.m., the field paced a few laps under yellow to help the drying process.|$|R

25|$|At Dover, Earnhardt won {{his second}} pole of the season, setting a new {{qualifying}} speed record of 161.849mph. This {{was the first}} time since 2002 that he had recorded more than one pole during a season. During the race, Earnhardt would lead 80 laps, but would finish 2nd to Jimmie Johnson. The following week at Kansas, he finished 8th. Making his 500th Cup start at Charlotte, Earnhardt led 19 laps early, but finished 15th while battling a tight race car. The following week at Talladega, Earnhardt led 38 laps and was about to receive a push from Austin Dillon to overtake Jamie McMurray on the last lap when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. tapped Dillon, causing that driver to spin out and then get hit by Casey Mears, leaving Earnhardt with a 2nd-place finish. The following week at Martinville, Earnhardt earned an 8th-place finish. The next week at Texas, he had a solid night, finishing 2nd to Johnson {{for the third time in}} the season (after Daytona and Dover). The next week at Phoenix, Earnhardt started by being forced to pit with a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> early, putting him a lap down. However, a caution allowed him to use the free pass to get back on the lead lap and salvage a 4th-place finish.|$|E
25|$|Haryanto {{fell behind}} Coletti who passed {{him for a}} virtual fourth place at the first corner. Sato took a ten-second stop-and-go penalty on lap 13 {{for his role in}} the lap three {{accident}} with Jeffries. Trummer took advantage of a battle between Binder and Izawa to pass both drivers in the same passing manoeuvre in the opening corners for third place on the 14th lap. He passed Daly for second position two laps later. Bertbon went into the pit lane from the lead on lap 18 and narrowly avoided colliding with Trummer as he attempted to enter the pit lane. After leaving the pit lane, Berthon was affected by wheel nut problem that caused him to slow with a suspected <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> before returning to the pit lane. Leal was heavily delayed by Markelov allowing Palmer to pull away. Meanwhile, Trummer remained on track and lost small amounts of his pace by pushing hard. Vandoorne reduced Trummer's lead to eight seconds by the time Trummer made his pit stop at the end of lap 30. He was followed by Coletti, Pic and Nasr with the late-stopping Quaife-Hobbs and Izama moving through the field courtesy of having newer soft compound tyres installed on their cars.|$|E
500|$|Romain Grosjean {{received}} particular {{praise for}} his drive to fifth place, collecting a second Driver of the Day award in a row. His race was saved by an attentive mechanic who replaced a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> nut on his left-rear wheel, which {{would otherwise have}} caused Grosjean to retire. Valtteri Bottas was further penalised for his collision with Hamilton {{at the start of}} the race by having two penalty points added to his licence. Jenson Button expressed frustration at his retirement, feeling that it lost him a possible point-scoring position. In contrast, his replacement teammate Vandoorne scored his first point on debut, describing it as a [...] "bonus" [...] to a successful weekend.|$|E
2500|$|The Chase-Opening race at Chicagoland Speedway {{started with}} {{qualifying}} being rained-out and Kyle Busch starting on Pole {{for being the}} fastest in first practice, and Chase Seed #1 Brad Keselowski wound up starting 25th for the 267 lap event. Busch led 46 laps early on, but the race saw comers and goers as it saw only a few cautions for the first 3/4 of the event. Jeff Gordon, Jamie McMurray, Keselowski, and Kevin Harvick (who led a race-high 79 laps) took turns at the front {{over the course of}} 100 laps of green. Keselowski and Harvick both suffered <b>loose</b> <b>wheels</b> and had to start at the tail-end of the lead lap. Chase driver Aric Almirola was leading on series of green flag pit stops with 30 to go when his engine blew and was forced to retire. Rookie Kyle Larson wound up taking the lead in the late going with a superior machine, battling Harvick, Gordon, and Keselowski in the late going with Keselowski making a three-wide move in between Larson and Harvick, taking the lead for good. With less than 10 laps to go, the final caution came out after Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. and Danica Patrick got together in Turn 4. On the final restart, Keselowski got away easy, Harvick fell to 5th, and Keselowski the #1 seed scored his 5th win of the season and second at Chicagoland. Gordon beat Larson for 2nd, and Joey Logano blew up out of Turn 4, but streaked across the finish line up in smoke to finish 4th. “I don’t really know what happened," [...] Keselowski said. [...] "I just know we got to the lead. I saw Kyle and Kevin racing each other really hard, they were aggressively side drafting and I was waiting for an opportunity to strike and it came. The car stuck and everything came together." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1979: In a {{race that}} was seen on ABC's Wide World of Sports, Darrell Waltrip and Richard Petty hooked horns in a memorable duel. The lead changed four times between them on Lap 365 and three times on the final lap; Waltrip prevailed over Petty when he cleared Petty in Turn Three and Donnie Allison tried to shoot the gap, instead getting hung {{alongside}} Petty. During the race, David Pearson made a pit stop, and thought the Wood brothers were going to change only two tires. With the lug nuts loosened all the way around, Pearson sped out of the pits after two tires had been replaced. The <b>loose</b> inside <b>wheels</b> flew off near the pit road, ending Pearson's day. A week later, Pearson and the Wood Brothers split, despite scoring 43 wins from 1972 to 1978 with the Virginia-based team.|$|R
25|$|Earnhardt {{returned}} to Bristol {{looking for his}} first win at that track since 2004. He qualified 26th and after the first caution came out he would pit. During the pit stop the crew would leave a <b>wheel</b> <b>loose</b> and Earnhardt would pit again. After going a lap down multiple times in the race, he got the Lucky Dog and got back on the lead lap. After moving {{up to the top}} 5 later on in the race, he would settle for a 9th-place finish.|$|R
500|$|During {{the sixth}} {{hour of the}} race Gary Hirsch lost power in his Greaves Gibson-Nissan through the Esses {{and came to a}} halt; the car would later be {{abandoned}} after Hirsch was unable to repair a broken battery terminal. The No. 71 Ferrari was forced to the garage to fix starter motor problems, bowing out of its battle with Corvette and Aston Martin in LMGTE Pro. As dusk settled on the circuit, the No. 18 Porsche of Dumas braked too late for Mulsanne Corner and hit a tyre barrier. The car was able to return to the pit lane, only requiring new front bodywork, but the car fell to fifth position. Not long after Paul-Loup Chatin crashed his Signatech Alpine at Mulsanne Corner, bringing the safety cars out for the third time of the race. During this slow period Rob Bell pulled the No. 97 Aston Martin off course and onto the inside run-off area at the Mulsanne Straight and retired. When racing resumed, Hülkenberg was able to attack the leaders, first overtaking Webber's Porsche around the outside on the opening lap then passing Rast when he made a scheduled pit stop. Webber was later given a one-minute stop and go penalty for passing in a yellow flag zone, dropping him to fourth place. Nissan lost one of their three LMP1 entries when Tsugio Matsuda's No. 21 car stopped at Arnage with a suspension failure that caused its front-left wheel to detach from the vehicle and was unable to continue. The No. 22 Nissan also suffered a setback when it hit a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> out on the Mulsanne Straight at [...] and required a lengthy repair to its front-end.|$|E
500|$|The Benetton and Williams {{teams were}} {{employing}} different pit stop strategies – the Benetton team were planning a threestop strategy whereas the Williams team were only planning for twostops. Schumacher made a pit stop on lap18, but was momentarily baulked by the slowing Jordan car of Barrichello {{as he was}} entering the pitlane. Schumacher exited the stop behind Berger, but overtook the Austrian driver {{at the beginning of}} the next lap. Hill, who had remained close behind Schumacher before the German made a pit stop, made his own stop on lap21, exiting the pitlane in front of Schumacher. Coulthard took the lead of the race for one lap, before pitting and dropping behind the two leaders and the yet-to-stop Häkkinen and Berger. Häkkinen and Berger were the final drivers of the leading teams to pit, however, the McLaren mechanics had trouble getting the fuel hose off the Finn's car when he stopped on lap23, losing him tenseconds. Several other teams experienced problems with attaching and detaching the refuelling nozzles, and occasional small sprays of fuel were observed, reinforcing the problem experienced by McLaren with the equipment before the race meeting. Berger, adopting a strategy of pitting late, was the only driver not to have stopped by lap24 and thus was third, with Hill, Schumacher, Coulthard, Alesi and Salo the other drivers in the top six places. Salo's stop had been faultless, gaining him significant time on those drivers who had been running in front of him. By this stage Gachot had retired his Pacific car after it got stuck in fifth gear. Berger made his stop on lap 27, but had problems leaving the pit lane after a communication problem between him and his mechanics nearly led to him leaving the pit lane with a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> nut on the front right-hand wheel. The pit [...] "lollipop", signalling the driver when to leave, was raised and lowered again in quick succession, preventing Berger from leaving until the wheel nut was sufficiently tightened. The miscommunication cost Berger 13seconds, dropping him back to seventhposition. Alesi fell behind Salo and Häkkinen after the firstset of pitstops, Salo overtaking him on lap25, with Häkkinen moving past threelaps later as Alesi was held up behind the lapped Montermini.|$|E
2500|$|Hamlin, who {{recovered}} from a speeding penalty and <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> to finish third, said he [...] "had a great car. We definitely got it a lot better {{there at the end}} and proud that we’re able to come back from two laps down and get a good finish out of it, but still a good overall day for our FedEx Express Camry. Just came up a little short." ...|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 51. McMurray didn't get a {{good start}} and was about spun out by Joey Logano. This allowed teammate Brad Keselowski to retake the lead. Danica Patrick took her car to the garage on lap 60 after the left-front hub of her car burned out. Kyle Busch made an unscheduled stop for a tire vibration on lap 63. The culprit was a <b>loose</b> left-rear <b>wheel.</b> Kevin Harvick made a charge at the lead, but Brad Keselowski was able to lead the entire third segment as the third caution of the race flew to conclude segment 3. Everybody pitted under this caution. Matt Kenseth exited with the lead. Greg Biffle and Tony Stewart were tagged for speeding on pit road and Dale Earnhardt Jr. was tagged for his crew being over the wall too soon. All three restarted the race from the tail-end of the field.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{clear blue}} Kansas skies, Brad Keselowski led {{the field to}} the green flag at 2:34 p.m. He began pulling away from the field after the first five laps. After 15 laps, Kevin Harvick cued his radio to say he {{thought there was a}} {{vibration}} in the car and that [...] "it's going to blow up." [...] Despite this, he passed Keselowski for the lead in turn 4 on lap 29. The first caution of the race flew on lap 30 for a single-car wreck in turn 2. J. J. Yeley suffered a right-front tire blowout and slammed the wall. After making his stop, crew chief Rodney Childers told Harvick that the cause of the vibration was a <b>loose</b> right-rear <b>wheel</b> weight. This caution period was longer than normal as drivers were radioing into NASCAR race control that the oil hadn't been thoroughly cleaned up.|$|R
500|$|Kahne {{appeared}} in victory lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season earning him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a <b>wheel</b> <b>loose,</b> we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} <b>wheel</b> <b>loose,</b> we know we got them tight." ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{a massive}} {{management}} overhaul, with Sergio Marchionne and Maurizio Arrivabene replacing di Montezemolo and Mattiacci as Ferrari President and Team Principal respectively, the team enjoyed an improved {{start to the}} [...] season, with Sebastian Vettel taking third in Australia. However, Räikkönen was forced to retire from the race due to a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel.</b> The team ended their 34-race winless streak in Malaysia when Vettel held off both Mercedes cars to claim his first victory since leaving Red Bull {{at the end of}} the previous year. Sebastian Vettel managed to win twice more for Ferrari in 2015, at the 2015 Hungarian Grand Prix, and finally at the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix. Vettel and Räikkönen finished third and fourth respectively in the Drivers' standings.|$|E
2500|$|At Charlotte, Earnhardt, Jr was {{battling for}} a {{position}} inside the top 10 when he made contact Carl Edwards and hit the wall ending up 29th. At Kansas, Earnhardt, Jr had to pit for a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> under green and ended up finishing 21st, 2 laps down. Heading into Talladega, he basically needed to win to advance. He led 61 laps, but he slid his tires coming onto pit road and ended up having to take 2 tires instead of fuel only while others were taking fuel only. He {{ended up on the}} front row, heading into the only GWC. But a wreck behind him ended up cutting it short and he ended up 2nd upon a review, eliminating him from the championship. At Martinsville, the week after he was eliminated from Chase Contention, he was strong all race taking home a 4th-place finish at the track. [...] At Texas the following week Earnhardt recovered from an early spin to finish 6th. Earnhardt Jr. managed to get his 3rd victory of the season at Phoenix, after the race was called for rain. At the season finale at Homestead Earnhardt crashed early in the race, winding up 40th. For the 13th consecutive year, Earnhardt won the NMPA Most Popular Driver Award.|$|E
2500|$|... {{would be}} Mansell's finest season. He started {{the year with}} five {{straight}} victories (a record not equalled until Michael Schumacher in [...] ). At the sixth round {{of the season in}} Monaco, he took pole and dominated much of the race. However, with seven laps remaining, Mansell suffered a <b>loose</b> <b>wheel</b> nut and was forced into the pits, emerging behind Ayrton Senna's McLaren-Honda. Mansell, on fresh tyres, set a lap record almost two seconds quicker than Senna's and closed from 5.2 to 1.9 seconds in only two laps. The pair duelled around Monaco for the final four laps but Mansell could find no way past, finishing just 0.2 seconds behind the Brazilian. Mansell became the most successful British driver of all time when he won the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, as he surpassed Jackie Stewart's record of 27 wins with his 28th. Mansell was crowned Formula One World Champion early in the season at the Hungarian Grand Prix, the 11th round of that season, where his second-place finish clinched the Drivers' Championship, securing the title in the least number of Grands Prix since the 16-race season format started. Mansell also set the then-record for the most number of wins in one season (9); both records stood until broken by Schumacher in 2002. He managed 14 pole positions that year, a record only broken by Sebastian Vettel in 2011 in the Brazilian Grand Prix on 26 November. He also held the record for the most races before becoming World Champion with 180 races; this record was broken by Nico Rosberg in 2016 with 206 races.|$|E
50|$|The hubs in centerset {{wheels are}} set {{equidistant}} from each {{lip of the}} wheel. Centerset wheels tend {{to have the most}} grip, because they have large inner lips, and it is the inner lip of a longboard wheel that grips the most. Some longboarders prefer centerset wheels for sliding because they wear more evenly and when they become coned they can be flipped and still have the same feel. Centerset wheels are more difficult to break <b>loose</b> than other <b>wheels,</b> and more speed is lost during the slide, but the slide is more controlled because of the grip the wheel has.|$|R
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 94 laps to go. A {{number of}} drivers began pitting with 57 laps to go. Truex hit pit road with 54 laps {{to go and}} handed the lead to Matt Kenseth. Truex came back down pit road because of a <b>loose</b> right-front <b>wheel.</b> The wheel was on crooked because of a jammed bracket behind the wheel. After the race, Truex said he [...] "couldn’t believe it. I went around Turns 1 and 2 and I was like ‘Wheel loose.’ I kept telling myself that maybe it’s not me, maybe it’s just shaking because it has tape on it or something stupid. It was loose and I knew it right away. Frustrating, but that’s how it goes.” Kenseth pitted with 53 laps to go and handed the lead to Logano. He pitted with 52 laps to go and handed the lead to Brad Keselowski. He pitted with 50 laps to go and handed the lead to Tony Stewart. Kyle Busch passed entering turn 3 to retake the lead with 36 laps to go.|$|R
40|$|In the Road Condition Model {{one wants}} to be able to predict the {{transition}} between different winter road conditions. One such example is the transition from loose snow all across the driving lane to loose snow except in wheel tracks, where the condition is changed to ice or bare road. Each vehicle passing as long as there is loose snow across the whole driving lane will remove a certain amount of loose snow from the developing wheel tracks. The amount of removed loose snow is assumed to vary between different types of vehicles. The Road Weather Information System, RWIS, delivers information on the amount of loose snow falling on the road. The traffic flow is measured by inductive loops. The amount of <b>loose</b> snow in <b>wheel</b> tracks is measured intermittent. Then one has information of traffic flow and the amount of removed <b>loose</b> snow from <b>wheel</b> tracks (determined as the difference between the amount af loose snow falling on the road and the amount remaining in the wheel tracks). Trough regression analysis one can determine the statistical relation between traffic flow and amount of removed loose snow. However, one problem is that on some occasions there is no loose snow at all remaining in the wheel tracks at the time of observation. In that case one can assume that the observed amount of traffic flow would have removed more snow if the snow fall would have been heavier. Those observations are considered censurered since the actual amount of removed loose snow exceeds the observed...|$|R
