The analysis {{is aimed at}} finding an optimum weight of <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>head</b> of pressure vessel due to maximum working pressure that ensures its full charge with stresses by using imperialist competitive algorithm and genetic algorithm. In head of pressure vessel the region of its joint with the cylindrical shell is loaded with shear force and bending moments. The load causes high bending stresses {{in the region of}} the joint. Therefore, imperialist competitive algorithm was used here to find the optimum shape of a head with minimum weight and maximum working pressure which the shear force and the bending moment moved toward zero. Two different size <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>head</b> examples are selected and studied. The imperialist competitive algorithm results are compared with the genetic algorithm results...|$|R

40|$|In {{designing}} the pressure vessel equipment, the nozzle connection requires a careful study of many regions. One {{of the critical}} aspects in designing pressure vessels is the nozzle connections in the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>head</b> of two intersecting shells. Two {{of the most important}} design guide (codes and standards) for {{designing the}} pressure vessel are ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) pressure vessel code and WRC (Welding Research Council) bulletins. Both ASME and WRC standards do not directly address procedures or provide acceptance criteria for the effect of external forces and moments imposed by a piping system to the nozzle, and do not deal with <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heads.</b> Therefore, a parametric study was carried out in this research. The aim is to understand the behavior of the nozzle connections in radial and non-radial orientation to <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>head</b> vessel subjected to the internal pressure and various external loading using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method. All the results analysis for both radial and non-radial nozzle are presented as graphs of non-dimensional parameters against stress concentration factor (SCF) for each load case applied. For validation, an analytical investigation using thin shell theory was utilized for the radial nozzle due to applied internal pressure loading. The comparison results between both methods show that the FEA method was valid with less than 10 % differences...|$|R
40|$|Electroencephalography (EEG) is a {{valuable}} tool for clinical and cognitive applications. EEG allows for measuring and imaging of scalp potentials emitted by brain activity and allows researchers to draw conclusions about underlying brain activity and function. However EEG is limited by poor spatial resolution due to various factors. One reason {{is the fact that}} EEG electrodes are separated from current sources in the brain by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the skull, and the scalp. Unfortunately the conductivities of these tissues are not yet well known which limits the spatial resolution of EEG. Based on prior research, spatial resolution of the EEG can be improved via use of various mathematical techniques that provide increased accuracy of the representation of scalp potentials. One such method is the surface Laplacian. It {{has been shown to be}} a direct approach to improving EEG spatial resolution. Yet this approach depends on a geometric head model and much work has been done on assuming the human head to be spherical. In this project, we will develop a mathematical model for <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>head</b> geometry based on surface Laplacian calculations by Law [1]. The <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>head</b> model is more realistic to the human head shape and can therefore improve accuracy of the EEG imaging calculations. We will construct a computational program that utilizes the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>head</b> geometry in hopes to provide a more accurate representation of data fits compared to the spherical head models. Also, we will demonstrate that the spline surface Laplacian calculations do indeed increase the spatial resolution thereby affording a greater impact to the clinical and cognitive study community involving EEG.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generic method {{for addressing the}} issue of 3 D model-based head pose estimation. The method proposed relies on the downhill simplex optimization method and on the combination of motion and texture features. A proper initialization based on a block matching procedure associated with 3 D/ 2 D matching depending on texture and optical flow information leads to an accurate recovery of the pose parameters. By using a 3 D head model, the procedure {{takes into account the}} motion of the entire head and not a set of characteristic parts. Similarly, unlike feature-based methods, the whole head is tracked and no constraint by some features vanishing from view is needed. We show that the accuracy of the pose estimation is increased when considering a 3 D head-like synthesized surface by using a limited Fourier expansion instead of <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>head</b> model. We demonstrate that this method is stable over extended sequences including large head motions, occultations, various head posture [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{sensitivity analyses}} of the neutronic designs of {{the main components of}} a fission converter-based epithermal neutron beam for neutron capture therapy. Results for the fission converter, the neutron filters and the collimator are presented. In the {{analyses of the}} fast neutron filter/moderator and collimator designs, great emphasis was laid on in-phantom figures of merit using a water-filled <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>head</b> phantom to evaluate beam performance. In addition, various neutronic calculations required for the engineering design (e. g., reactivity insertion due to the fission converter) were performed. This study intensively employed the general purpose Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle) for the analyses. In the sensitivity analysis of the fission converter design, the effect of using different fuel configurations (multi-plate reactor type MITR-II fuel vs. single plate type fuel) was examined with the expectation that the reduced volume fraction of coolant in the single plate fuel fission converter might offset the disadvantage of the H 2 0 coolant which overmoderates a useful portion of the neutron spectrum without commensurate reduction of fast contamination...|$|R
40|$|Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a gram-negative, facultative, {{anaerobic}} bacterium that colonizes {{the human}} oral cavity {{and the upper}} respiratory tract. This bacterium is strongly associated with localized aggressive periodontitis and adult periodontitis and is the causative agent for other serious systemic infections. Recently, we have identified a protein, EmaA (extracellular matrix protein adhesin A), that mediates the adhesion of A. actinomycetemcomitans to collagen. The conserved sequence and predicted secondary structure suggest that EmaA is an orthologue of the Yersinia enterocolitica adhesin YadA. Electron microscopy examinations of A. actinomycetemcomitans have identified antenna-like protrusions associated with {{the surface of the}} bacterium. These structures are absent on emaA mutant strains and can be restored by transformation of the mutant strain with emaA in trans. The loss of these structures is associated with a decrease in the binding of this bacterium to collagen. The antenna-like structures are composed of a long rod that terminates in an <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>head</b> region. The analysis of these structures using image processing techniques has provided an initial estimate of the overall dimensions, which suggests that the appendages are oligomeric structures formed by either three or four subunits. Together, the data suggest that emaA is required for the expression of novel appendages on the surface of A. actinomycetemcomitans that mediate the adhesion of the bacterium to collagen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We present forward {{modeling}} {{solutions in}} the form of array response kernels for electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), assuming that a multilayer el-lipsoidal geometry approximates the anatomy of the head and a dipole current models the source. The use of an ellipsoidal geom-etry is useful in cases for which incorporating the anisotropy of the head is important but a better model cannot be defined. The structure of our forward solutions facilitates the analysis of the inverse problem by factoring the lead field into a product of the current dipole source and a kernel containing the information cor-responding to the head geometry and location of the source and sensors. This factorization allows the inverse problem to be ap-proached as an explicit function of just the location parameters, which reduces the complexity of the estimation solution search. Our forward solutions have the potential of facilitating the solution of the inverse problem, as they provide algebraic representations suitable for numerical implementation. The applicability of our models is illustrated with numerical examples on real EEG/MEG data of N 20 responses. Our results show that the residual data after modeling the N 20 response using a dipole for the source and an el-lipsoidal geometry for the head is in average lower than the residual remaining when a spherical geometry is used for the same esti-mated dipole.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 115 - 119). Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed December 20, 2011). The two ways to produce electricity using solar radiation are (1) direct, {{by the use of}} photovoltaic cells or (2) indirect with an intermediate step of production of solar thermal energy. Solar thermal energy is being produced by solar power plants, which consist of a power tower with a central solar receiver on top where concentrated solar radiation coming from a heliostat field is reflected, absorbed and later transformed into electricity. The work presented in this thesis contributes to the design of a prototype for such a central solar receiver called the small particle solar receiver. It {{is part of a larger}} project and builds on an older design for the small particle heat exchange receiver first conceived 30 years ago. This thesis has the main goal of giving calculations and a feasible design for a much larger, pressurized, more efficient version of the above-mentioned solar receiver. The theoretical base comprises the previously published literature on the subject, as well as an investigation of similar products or products that share one or more features with the concept developed in this research. The methodology includes the study of theory of thin shells of revolution and follows the logical steps of a traditional design process. The techniques include finite element analysis of the model, structural optimization and other relevant studies such as failure theories and the study of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Following this research, it is shown how a final, feasible and efficient design can be built on an initial simple concept of a pressure vessel that is 3 meters in diameter and 5 meters deep with windows on the end exposed to solar radiation, called the aperture structure. Each individual window mounts in its own special flange welded onto the aperture porthole and its own secondary concentrator is also mounted onto the flange. The secondary concentrators are mirrors that redirect scattered and lost sunlight into the receiver through the window. It is suggested that they are made out of highly reflective aluminum. Stainless and carbon steels were analyzed and the final product was suggested to be an austenitic stainless steel pressure vessel with custom <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>heads</b> and with 6 same-size fused silica windows mounted on the aperture head. The presence of portholes on the aperture structure increases the maximum stress concentration by 167 %. Several thermal and structural analyses were performed on the receiver model for different work conditions. The receiver walls were calculated to be a minimum of 1. 7 cm for the ideal work conditions of 5 bar pressure and 100 - 400 ??C wall temperature and 2. 7 cm thick for 8 bar pressure and the same wall temperature. The window calculations showed that a theoretical minimum of 0. 75 cm thickness is necessary for the spherical cap profile and 0. 2 cm for a custom designed ellipsoidal shape for temperatures as high as 800 ??C and 5 bar pressure...|$|R
40|$|Mimivirus was {{investigated}} by {{atomic force microscopy}} in its native state following serial degradation by lysozyme and bromelain. The 750 -nm diameter virus is coated with a forest of glycosylated protein fibers of lengths about 140. nm with diameters 1. 4. nm. Fibers are capped with distinctive <b>ellipsoidal</b> protein <b>heads</b> of estimated Mr= 25. kDa. The surface fibers {{are attached to the}} particle through a layer of protein covering the capsid, which is in turn composed of the major capsid protein (MCP). The latter is organized as an open network of hexagonal rings with central depressions separated by 14. nm. The virion exhibits an elaborate apparatus at a unique vertex, visible as a star shaped depression on native particles, but on defibered virions as five arms of 50. nm width and 250. nm length rising above the capsid by 20. nm. The apparatus is integrated into the capsid and not applied atop the icosahedral lattice. Prior to DNA release, the arms of the star disengage from the virion and it opens by folding back five adjacent triangular faces. A membrane sac containing the DNA emerges from the capsid in preparation for fusion with a membrane of the host cell. Also observed from disrupted virions were masses of distinctive fibers of diameter about 1. nm, and having a 7 -nm periodicity. These are probably contained within the capsid along with the DNA bearing sac. The fibers were occasionally observed associated with toroidal protein clusters interpreted as processive enzymes modifying the fibers. © 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{detailed}} {{fluid mechanics}} of sperm propulsion are fundamental {{to our understanding}} of reproduction. In this paper, we aim to model a human sperm swimming in a microscope slide chamber. We model the sperm itself by a distribution of regularized stokeslets over an <b>ellipsoidal</b> sperm <b>head</b> and along an infinitesimally thin flagellum. The slide chamber walls are modelled as parallel plates, also discretized by a distribution of regularized stokeslets. The sperm flagellar motion, used in our model, is obtained by digital microscopy of human sperm swimming in slide chambers. We compare the results of our simulation with previous numerical studies of flagellar propulsion, and compare our computations of sperm kinematics with those of the actual sperm measured by digital microscopy. We find that there is an excellent quantitative match of transverse and angular velocities between our simulations and experimental measurements of sperm. We also find a good qualitative match of longitudinal velocities and computed tracks with those measured in our experiment. Our computations of average sperm power consumption fall within the range obtained by other authors. We use the hydrodynamic model, and a prototype flagellar motion derived from experiment, as a predictive tool, and investigate how sperm kinematics are affected by changes to head morphology, as human sperm have large variability in head size and shape. Results are shown which indicate the increase in predicted straight-line velocity of the sperm as the head width is reduced and the increase in lateral movement as the head length is reduced. Predicted power consumption, however, shows a minimum close to the normal head aspect ratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{motion of}} a {{homogeneous}} viscous fluid confined in a latitudinally librating, oblate spheroidal cavity with arbitrary eccentricity gamma is investigated via direct three-dimensional numerical simulation using an EBE (Element-By-Element) finite element method. When the spheroidal cavity has moderate or large eccentricity with topographic coupling being dominant, an inviscid analytical solution describing the fluid motion driven by latitudinal libration is derived {{for the purpose}} of illustrating the nature of the fluid motion. It suggests that, in contrast to the fluid motion driven by <b>longitudinal</b> libration in <b>ellipsoidal</b> cavities, resonance of a spheroidal inertial wave mode with azimuthal wavenumber m = 1 can occur when the non-dimensional frequency of forced latitudinal libration is close to omega(resonance) = 2 /(2 - gamma(2)), as predicted by the inviscid analytical solution. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulation at non-resonant frequencies, which includes the full effect of viscosity and nonlinearity, is carried out, showing a satisfactory agreement between the inviscid analytical solution and the numerical simulation. Emphasis of the numerical simulation is then placed on the strongly nonlinear librating flow at the exact resonance. The simulation reveals the existence of strong retrograde mean zonal flow due to nonlinear effects in the viscous boundary layer and different profiles of the zonal flow dependent upon the size of the libration frequency. Implications of the result for planetary evolution are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
