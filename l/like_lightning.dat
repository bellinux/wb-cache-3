5|$|The sultan besieged him and {{discovered}} {{him in a}} certain mountain where the Wallachian {{was supported by the}} natural strength of the place. There Vlad had hidden himself along with 24,000 of his men who had willingly followed him. When Vlad realized that he would either perish from hunger or {{fall into the hands of}} the very cruel enemy, and considering both eventualities unworthy of brave men, he dared commit an act worthy of being remembered: calling his men together and explaining the situation to them, he easily persuaded them to enter the enemy camp. He divided the men so that either they should die bravely in battle with glory and honor or else, should destiny prove favorable to them, they should avenge themselves against the enemy in an exceptional matter. So, making use of some Turkish prisoners, who had been caught at twilight when they were wandering about imprudently, at nightfall Vlad penetrated into the Turkish camp with part of his troops, all the way up the fortifications. And during the entire night he sped <b>like</b> <b>lightning</b> in every direction and caused great slaughter, so much so that, had the other commander to whom he had entrusted his remaining forces been equally brave, or had the Turks not fully obeyed the repeated orders from the sultan not to abandon their garrisons, the Wallachian undoubtedly would have gained the greatest and most brilliant victory. But the other commander (a boyar named Galeş) did not dare attack the camp from the other side as had been agreed upon....Vlad carried out an incredible massacre without losing many men in such a major encounter, though many were wounded. He abandoned the enemy camp before daybreak and returned to the same mountain from which he had come. No one dared pursue him, since he had caused such terror and turmoil. I learned by questioning those who had participated in this battle that the sultan lost all confidence in the situation. During that night the sultan abandoned the camp and fled in a shameful manner. And he would have continued to this way, had he not been reprimanded by his friends and brought back, almost against his will.|$|E
25|$|The uses of Vril in {{the novel}} amongst the Vril-ya vary from {{destruction}} to healing. According to Zee, {{the daughter of the}} narrator's host, Vril can be changed into the mightiest agency over all types of matter, both animate and inanimate. It can destroy <b>like</b> <b>lightning</b> or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend ways through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and healthier than that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms. Vril can be harnessed by use of the Vril staff or mental concentration.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Ondaatje {{writes in}} The Independent that the {{existence}} of a Hemingway industry tends to overshadow his posthumous work. He considers Hemingway's African stories to be among his best although the posthumous work about Africa has been disregarded or overlooked. In her piece for Nation, [...] Brenda Wineapple describes the book as [...] "poignant but not particularly good". However, she points out that it [...] "reminds us of Hemingway's writing at its most touching, acute and beautiful best".

500|$|Dota 2 {{received}} universal acclaim, {{according to}} review aggregator Metacritic. In {{a preview of}} the game in 2012, Rich McCormick of PC Gamer thought that Dota 2 was [...] "an unbelievably deep and complex game that offers the purest sequel to the original Defense of the Ancients. Rewarding like few others, but tough". Adam Biessener, the editor who authored the announcement article for Dota 2 for Game Informer in 2010, praised Valve for maintaining the same mechanics and game balance that made Defense of the Ancients successful nearly a decade prior and Quintin Smith of Eurogamer described Dota 2 as the [...] "supreme form of the MOBA which everyone else working in the genre is trying to capture <b>like</b> <b>lightning</b> in a bottle". The most frequently praised aspects of the game were its depth, delivery, and overall balance. Chris Thursten of PC Gamer described the gameplay as being [...] "deep and rewarding".|$|E
500|$|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. In The New York Times Book Review, author Stephen King stated the Goblet of Fire was [...] "every bit {{as good as}} Potters1 through 3" [...] and praised the humour and subplots, although he commented that [...] "there's also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling...it's a teenage thing". Kirkus Reviews called it [...] "another grand tale of magic and mystery...and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is". However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two [...] "bad guys" [...] stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave [...] "many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable". For The Horn Book Magazine, Martha V. Parravano gave a mixed review, saying [...] "some will find [...] wide-ranging, compellingly written, and absorbing; others, long, rambling, and tortuously fraught with adverbs". A Publishers Weekly review praised the book's [...] "red herrings, the artful clues and tricky surprises that disarm the most attentive audience" [...] and saying it [...] "might be her most thrilling yet." [...] Writing for The New Yorker, Joan Acocella noted that [...] "where the prior volumes moved <b>like</b> <b>lightning,</b> here the pace is slower, the energy more dispersed. At the same time, the tone becomes more grim." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stanley came up {{with the}} name while he, Simmons and Criss were driving around New York City.

[...] Frehley created the now-iconic logo, making the [...] "SS" [...] look <b>like</b> <b>lightning</b> bolts, when he went to write the new band name over [...] "Wicked Lester" [...] on a poster outside the club where they were going to play. (Some of Wicked Lester's artwork included one lightning bolt for the [...] "S" [...] in Lester.) Later, Stanley designed the logo with a Sharpie and a ruler and accidentally drew the two S's nonparallel because he did it [...] "by eye."

[...] So the [...] "wise drawer" [...] should [...] "watch" [...] and [...] "catch these lovely graces, witty smilings, and these stolen glances which suddenly <b>like</b> <b>lightning</b> pass and another countenance taketh place". His normal technique (except for duplicates of royal images) was to paint the whole face {{in the presence of}} the sitter, probably in at least two sittings. [...] He kept a number of prepared flesh-coloured blanks ready, in different shades, to save time on laying the [...] "carnation" [...] ground. [...] He then painted the outlines of the features very faintly with a [...] "pencil", actually a very fine pointed squirrel-hair brush, before filling these out by faint hatchings. [...] He added to the techniques available, especially for clothes and jewels, often exploiting the tiny shadows cast by thick dots of paint to give a three-dimensionality to pearls and lace. [...] A few half-finished miniatures give a good idea of his working technique. [...] He probably made few drawings; certainly few have survived.|$|E
2500|$|The ball game, called [...] "Batey", {{was played}} in the {{ceremonial}} ball court, which they also called a [...] "Batey", situated {{in the middle of}} the village. The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a [...] "U". The ball was called Batu and made of rubber and vegetable leaves, which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. One team to the west and the other to the east. The fathers and sons played on the opposite teams. The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain amount of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed. The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived. According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas the game was {{played in the}} following manner: [...] "One team served the ball and the other team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at shoulder height, it was returned <b>like</b> <b>lightning.</b> When it came in near the ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks.
