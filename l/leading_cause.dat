5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based {{primarily}} at Pennsylvania State University, was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation was the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> {{of death in}} their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.|$|E

5|$|A {{hospital}} was established at Fort Russell for U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps personnel. In August 1840, the Army surgeon {{at the hospital}} treated 103 patients, including 23 for fever and 26 for dysentery. Dysentery was the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of death at the fort, followed by malaria, tuberculosis, gunshot wounds and alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of death in the United States, and it is currently the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of death (30%) amongst {{women in the}} United States, and the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women {{under the age of}} 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the suicide rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury. In young people with SCI, suicide is the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of death. Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, {{and the fifth}} commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) {{by the time they}} are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E

With regards to the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> of mortality, lifestyle-related diseases like cardiovascular diseases and cancer top the list, replacing the communicable diseases.|$|R
5|$|Many {{accidents}} when driving personal {{vehicles are}} caused by distracted driving. According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), distraction plays a factor in 60% of moderate to serious teen car crashes. Specifically, passenger and cell phone interaction accounted for 27% of crashes, the <b>leading</b> <b>cause.</b> Drivers looking away from the target (roadway) also accounted for 19%.|$|E
5|$|Norovirus is the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of {{gastroenteritis}} {{among adults}} in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically occur when {{groups of people}} spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. Norovirus {{is the cause of}} about 10% of cases in children.|$|E

5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} {{high risk for}} respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) are the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections and respiratory infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of strep throat usually improve within {{three to five}} days, irrespective of treatment.

5|$|Acute cholangitis {{carries a}} {{significant}} risk of death, the <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> being irreversible shock with multiple organ failure (a possible complication of severe infections). Improvements in {{diagnosis and treatment}} {{have led to a}} reduction in mortality: before 1980, the mortality rate was greater than 50%, but after 1980 it was 10–30%. Patients with signs of multiple organ failure are likely to die unless they undergo early biliary drainage and treatment with systemic antibiotics. Other causes of death following severe cholangitis include heart failure and pneumonia.|$|E
