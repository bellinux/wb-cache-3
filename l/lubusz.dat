5|$|Around 980, in the west, <b>Lubusz</b> Land {{also came}} under Mieszko's control and another {{important}} gord {{was built in}} Włocławek much further east. Masovia was still more loosely associated with the Piast state, while the Sandomierz region was for a while their southern outpost.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the new era until 140 AD two local groups existed in northwest Poland. The Gustow group (named after Gustow on Rügen) people lived in the area settled in the past by the Oder group, and south of there, by the middle section of the Oder River was the <b>Lubusz</b> group, in the area previously inhabited by the Gubin group. Those were of an intermediate character, between the Elbe cultural circle to the west, and the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures to the east (the last one replaced the Oksywie culture after 30 AD).|$|E
5|$|Much circumstantial {{evidence}} points to the participation of Germanic people from Polish lands in the events {{that took place in}} the first half of the 1st century BC and found their culmination in Gaul in 58 BC, as related in Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico. At the time of the Suebi tribal confederation led by Ariovistus arrival in Gaul, a rapid decrease of settlement density can be observed in the areas of the upper and middle Oder River basin. In fact the Gubin group of the Jastorf culture disappeared then entirely, which may indicate this group's identity with one of the Suebi tribes. The western regions of the Przeworsk culture were also vacated (Lower Silesia, <b>Lubusz</b> Land and western Greater Poland), which is where the tribes accompanying the Suebi tribes must have come from. Burial sites and artifacts characteristic of the Przeworsk culture have been found in Saxony, Thuringia and Hesse, on the route of the Suebi offensive. The above-mentioned regions of western Poland had not become repopulated and economically developed again until in the 2nd century AD.|$|E
5|$|The 13th century brought {{fundamental}} {{changes to the}} structure of Polish society and its political system. Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western Farther Pomerania broke its political ties with Poland {{in the second half of}} the 12th century and from 1231 became a fief of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the Sławno and Słupsk areas. Pomerelia or Gdańsk Pomerania became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, Bolesław II the Bald granted <b>Lubusz</b> Land to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the Neumark and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border. In the south-east, Leszek the White was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the Halych area of Rus', a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions.|$|E
5|$|The Marcomannic Wars fought during 166–180 AD {{were caused}} by the {{pressure}} exerted by the northern Germanic peoples (settled around the area of today's Poland) on the tribes located {{in the vicinity of}} Roman limes, the Empire's defended border. Expansion of the Proto-Gothic Wielbark culture displaced from northern Greater Poland and Masovia the Przeworsk culture people; they in turn, moving south and east, crossed during the third quarter of the 2nd century the Carpathian Mountains. The ethnic composition of the Przeworsk population at this stage is not known, as the Lugii tribes no longer seem to be mentioned. Related to the Przeworsk culture was the Wietrzno-Solina type, a cultural unit with Celtic and then Dacian elements, situated within the more eastern part of the Beskids range (San River basin) during the 100–250 AD period. The Kotins tribe Celtic survivors with their Púchov culture disappeared now for good, {{as a result of their}} migration and involvement in the Marcomannic Wars. There were also changes in northwest Poland, on the border of the Elbe cultural sphere region. The <b>Lubusz</b> group there was absorbed by the new Luboszyce culture (Luboszyce, Krosno Odrzańskie County), that occupied the middle Oder basin during the 140–430 AD period. Its birth was related to the arrival from the east of population groups strongly influenced by the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures. Gradually a new branch of Germanic people, the Burgundians, whose origins are traced back to Scandinavia and the Bornholm island in particular and whose ancestors then migrated to the northwest Przework culture area, developed and evolved under new favorable conditions here. On the other hand, the Gustow group left western Pomerania, to be replaced after 70 years by the Dębczyn group (Dębczyn, Wschowa County), established by the arrivals from the Elbe cultures and lasting between 210 and 450 AD.|$|E
25|$|Lower Silesian Voivodeship is {{bordered by}} <b>Lubusz</b> Voivodeship to the north-west, Greater Poland Voivodeship to the north-east, Opole Voivodeship to the south-east, the Czech Republic to the south, and Germany (the State of Saxony) to the west.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, {{most of the}} {{historic}} Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among <b>Lubusz,</b> Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while {{the eastern half of}} Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.|$|E
25|$|In the forests, {{one also}} {{encounters}} game animals, such as red deer, roe deer and wild boars. In eastern Poland {{there are a}} number of ancient woodlands, like Białowieża forest, that have never been cleared or have been disturbed much by people. There are also large forested areas in the mountains, Masuria, Pomerania, <b>Lubusz</b> Land and Lower Silesia.|$|E
25|$|Władysław died on 2 March 1333 in Kraków. His son, Casimir III the Great, {{inherited}} Lesser Poland, the Duchy of Sandomierz, Greater Poland, Kuyavia, and the Duchies of Łęczyca and Sieradz. However, Silesia and <b>Lubusz</b> Land to the west, {{along with}} Gdańsk Pomerania, Western Pomerania, and Mazovia to the north, still remained outside the kingdom's borders. Nevertheless, Władysław's reign {{was a major}} step {{on the road to}} restoration of the Kingdom of Poland.|$|E
25|$|The {{administrative}} {{division of}} Silesia within Poland has changed several times since 1945. Since 1999, {{it has been}} divided between <b>Lubusz</b> Voivodeship, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Opole Voivodeship, and Silesian Voivodeship. Czech Silesia {{is now part of}} the Czech Republic, forming the Moravian-Silesian Region and {{the northern part of the}} Olomouc Region. Germany retains the Silesia-Lusatia region (Niederschlesien-Oberlausitz or Schlesische Oberlausitz) west of the Neisse, which is part of the federal state of Saxony.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Silesia was bounded to {{the west}} by the Kwisa and Bóbr Rivers, while the {{territory}} west of the Kwisa was in Upper Lusatia (earlier Milsko). However, because part of Upper Lusatia {{was included in the}} Province of Silesia in 1815, in Germany Görlitz, Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis and neighbouring areas are considered parts of historical Silesia. Those districts, along with Poland's Lower Silesian Voivodeship and parts of <b>Lubusz</b> Voivodeship, make up the geographic region of Lower Silesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} of the former margraviate, {{commonly known as the}} , lies in present-day eastern Germany and western Poland. Geographically it encompassed the majority of the present-day German states Brandenburg and Berlin, the Altmark (the northern third of Saxony-Anhalt), and the Neumark (now divided between Poland's <b>Lubusz</b> and West Pomeranian Voivodeships). Parts of the present-day federal state Brandenburg, such as Lower Lusatia and territory which had been Saxon until 1815, were not parts of the Mark. Colloquially but not accurately, the federal state Brandenburg is sometimes identified as the Mark or Mark Brandenburg.|$|E
25|$|The current {{administrative}} unit of Silesian Voivodeship {{is just a}} fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the <b>Lubusz</b> Voivodeship. On the other hand, {{a large part of the}} current {{administrative unit}} of the Silesian Voivodeship is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).|$|E
25|$|In 1007 Henry {{denounced the}} Peace of Poznań, which caused Bolesław's {{attack on the}} Archbishopric of Magdeburg {{as well as the}} re-occupation of the marches of Lusatia, through he stopped short of retaking Meissen. The German counter-offensive began three years later, in 1010, but it was of no {{significant}} consequence. In 1012, a five-year peace was signed. Bolesław broke the peace, however, and once again invaded Lusatia. Bolesław's forces pillaged and burned the city of <b>Lubusz</b> (Lebus). In 1013, a peace accord was signed at Merseburg. As part of the treaty, Bolesław paid homage to Henry II for the March of Lusatia (including the town of Bautzen) and Sorbian Meissen as fiefs. A marriage of Bolesław's son Mieszko with Richeza of Lotharingia, daughter of the Count Palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia and granddaughter of Emperor Otto II was also performed. During the brief period of peace on the western frontier that followed, Bolesław took part in a short campaign in the east, towards the Kievan Rus' territories.|$|E
2500|$|The Free State of Saxony ( [...] ) is a {{landlocked}} {{federal state}} of Germany, bordering the federal states of Brandenburg, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia, and Bavaria, {{as well as}} the countries of Poland (Lower Silesian and <b>Lubusz</b> Voivodeships) and the Czech Republic (Karlovy Vary, Liberec and Ústí nad Labem Regions). Its capital is Dresden, and its largest city is Leipzig.|$|E
2500|$|At its inception, {{landlord}} {{of actual}} tenement (then at Bahnhoffstraße 71) was Theodore Flöther, {{who was the}} founder of a firm producing agricultural machines in Jasień, <b>Lubusz</b> Voivodeship. Both the actual building and the neighbouring one (N°58, non existent today) {{have been used to}} showcase the production of the factory till end of World War I. In the 1930s, the building housed a coffee shop roasting and grinding coffee, run by W.J. Luczkowski ...|$|E
2500|$|The homage is then a {{separate}} issue, since, {{according to the}} chronicle of Thietmar, Mieszko [...] actually paid tribute to the Emperor from the lands usque in Vurta fluvium (up to the Warta River). In all probability Mieszko decided to pay tribute {{in order to avoid}} an invasion similar to the one that Lusatia had suffered. This homage would take place in 965, or in 966 at the latest. Very likely the tribute applied only to the <b>Lubusz</b> land, which was in the German sphere of influence. This understanding of the tribute issue explains why already in 967 Mieszko I was described in the Saxon chronicles as the Emperor's friend (or ally, supporter, Latin: amicus imperatoris).|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} Mieszko I took over from his father, the Polans' tribal {{federation}} of Greater Poland had {{for some time}} been actively expanding. Continuing this process, perhaps {{in the first years}} of Mieszko's reign, if it had not been done already by his father, Mieszko I conquered Masovia. Likely also during that period or earlier, at least partially Gdańsk Pomerania was obtained. [...] Mieszko's interests were then concentrated mainly on areas occupied by the eastern (near the Oder River) branches of the Polabian Slavs; some of them became soon subordinated by him. As Widukind of Corvey wrote, Mieszko ruled over the tribe called the Licicaviki, now commonly identified with the Polabian <b>Lubusz</b> Land. Having the control over those more western (in respect to the original homeland of the Polans) tribes, Mieszko had entered the German sphere of influence.|$|E
2500|$|Sorbs ( [...] , , [...] ), known also {{by their}} former autonyms Lusatians and Wends, are a West Slavic ethnic group {{predominantly}} inhabiting their homeland in Lusatia, a region divided between Germany (the states of Saxony and Brandenburg) and Poland (the provinces of Lower Silesia and <b>Lubusz).</b> According to Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, Serbs from the Balkan peninsula {{have the same}} orgins as Lusatians and Kashubians. He also claims that Serbs inhabitated the areas between the rivers Elbe and Vistula, on the southern coast of the Baltic sea. They traditionally speak the Sorbian languages (also known as [...] "Wendish" [...] and [...] "Lusatian"), {{closely related to the}} Polish, the Kashubian, the Czech and the Slovak. Sorbian is an officially recognized minority language in Germany. The Sorbs are linguistically and genetically closest to the Czechs and Poles. Due to a gradual and increasing assimilation between the 17th and 20th centuries, virtually all Sorbs also spoke German by the late 19th century and much of the recent generations no longer speak the language. The community is divided religiously between Roman Catholicism (the majority) and Lutheranism. An indicator of the degree of assimilation {{is the fact that the}} current Prime Minister of Saxony is a Sorb, Stanislaw Tillich – who speaks Sorbian as well as Polish.|$|E
50|$|In 1125 Bolesław Wrymouth {{established}} the new Diocese of <b>Lubusz</b> (Lebus) seated in <b>Lubusz</b> (Lebus), with its diocesan territory comprising the <b>Lubusz</b> Land (Land of Lebus), then {{part of the}} Polish reign, on both banks of the Oder.

50|$|Henry {{resigned}} {{his claim}} to Kraków because Margrave Konrad II of Lusatia seized <b>Lubusz</b> Land. Duke Władysław III gained possession of <b>Lubusz</b> in 1206, but lost it soon after. The possession of <b>Lubusz</b> directly affected Henry's sovereignty and he sent his forces to the Polish western border. Initially, he tried {{to settle the dispute}} peacefully, sending ambassadors to the court of Emperor Otto IV at Altenburg to obtain the return of <b>Lubusz</b> to Silesia. They returned without a response, and Henry organized an armed expedition. No military action was needed. On 6 May 1210, Margrave Konrad II died, and Henry took <b>Lubusz</b> and the Lusatian town of Guben, which he held until 1218.|$|E
5000|$|Nowy <b>Lubusz</b> [...] (Neu Lebus) is {{a village}} in the {{administrative}} district of Gmina Słubice, within Słubice County, <b>Lubusz</b> Voivodeship, in western Poland, close to the German border.|$|E

50|$|As to secular rule <b>Lubusz</b> Land {{was finally}} {{separated}} from Silesia, according to canon law however, the Lebus diocese, comprising most of <b>Lubusz</b> Land, remained {{subordinate to the}} Gniezno metropolia. Meanwhile, the Brandenburg margraves forwarded the incorporation of <b>Lubusz</b> Land into their New March, created and expanded further to the northeast after the acquisition of the Santok castellany in 1296 on the forest areas between the Duchy of Pomerania and Greater Poland.|$|E

50|$|Polish and Soviet {{authorities}} expelled {{most of the}} German {{population from}} the Polish annexed part of <b>Lubusz</b> Land.

The largest city of the Polish <b>Lubusz</b> Voivodeship today is Gorzów Wielkopolski (Landsberg an der Warthe), which however {{was not part of}} the historical <b>Lubusz</b> Land (cf. map above).|$|E
50|$|The medieval <b>Lubusz</b> Land on {{both sides}} of the Oder River up to the Spree in the west, {{including}} <b>Lubusz</b> (Lebus) itself, also formed part of Mieszko's realm. Poland lost <b>Lubusz</b> when the Silesian duke Bolesław II Rogatka sold it to the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg in 1248. Brandenburg also acquired the castellany of Santok from Duke Przemysł I of Greater Poland and made it the nucleus of their Neumark ("New March") region. The Bishopric of Lebus remained a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Gniezno until 1424, when it passed under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg.
