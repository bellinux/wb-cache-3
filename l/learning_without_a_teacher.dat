But existing algorithms of these two paradigms also expose some hard problems in many different applications. In this paper, we first analyze the general problems of these two paradigms, and some successful techniques for boosting their performance. Then we propose a novel algorithm that can overcome some existing problems through a mixture of these two paradigms. The algorithm is tested with a robot language-learning task. Equipped with this algorithm, our robot is able to acquire short audio information online, and gradually understand the audio input through human's intensive teaching. 1.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Creating a {{classification}} is typically {{the first step}} in developing a theory about a collection of observations or phenomena. This process is a form of learning from observation (<b>learning</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher),</b> and its goal is to structure given observa- tions i. nto a hierarchy of meaningful categories. The problem of automatically ereat ing such a hierarchy has so far received little attention in AI. Yet creating classifications is a very basic and widely practiced intellectual process. Past work on this problem was done mostly outside AI under the headings of numerical taxonomy and cluster analysis (Anderberg, 1973). Those methods are based on the application of a mathematical measure of similarity between objects, defined over a finite, a priori given set of object attributes. Classes of objects are taken as collections of objects with high intraclass and low interclass similarity. The methods assume that objects. are characterized by sequences of attribute/value pairs a...|$|E
40|$|The {{resurgence}} {{of the field of}} neural networks in the 1980 's was primarily fueled by supervised learning, exemplified by the backpropagation algorithm. In supervised learning, a desired output signal is provided to the learner together with an input signal, and the system adjusts parameters so that its response in the future will be closer to the desired signal. While supervised learning has been dominant in machine learning, much of our intelligence, in particular perception, is acquired without a teacher. Through mere exposure humans and animals learn how to analyze their environments and recognize relevant objects and events. For instance, consider our experience of sorting out apples from oranges by their appearances, an ability that can be gained before naming them. This calls for unsupervised learning- <b>learning</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher,</b> also known as self-organization. Unsupervised learning has been studied in neural networks since the early days. But in recent years there has been a steady shift of research focus from supervised learning to unsupervised learning, and the latter now becomes a predominant subject in neural networks. The book, Unsupervised learning: Foundations of neural computation, collects 21 papers published in the journal Neural Computation in the 10 year period since its founding in 1989 by Terrence Sejnowski.

40|$|Learner {{autonomy}} in Indonesian educational institutions has not commonly been {{listed as a}} teaching-learning objective, and most teachers seem to be hardly acquainted with learner autonomy (LA).   Therefore, it is very essential  to conduct a study of LA as perceived and experienced by school teachers {{and to find out}} the importance of LA training for professional development. A questionnaire was used to collect the data about English teachers’ perceptions regarding LA and LA-based practices. In addition, an LA training was conducted to see its significance for professional development.   After the data were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed, {{it was found that the}} participating teachers tended to maintain that autonomy should be inculcated among learners, and that the LA concept should not be misinterpreted as <b>learning</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher.</b> Concerning choices and decisions by  the learners, it was believed that learners’ making choices about how they learned and what activities they did, and involving them to decide what and how to learn could promote autonomy among learners. As regards LA-based teaching-learning practices, it was revealed that most teachers desired to implement LA principles in their teaching-learning contexts, although they identified that many of the LA principles were not that feasible to apply in their situation. It was also found that LA training could improve the teachers’ perceptions regarding LA concepts and principles. There were some constraints which could make learner autonomy difficult to develop among Indonesian learners in general: limited time allotted for the implementation of the curriculum, learners’ lack of autonomous learning experience, too much focus on national examinations, and insufficient proficiency of English.   LA-based teaching-learning practices were most desired; however, many were considered as having insufficient feasibility. In this respect, commitment is certainly the key to success in inculcating LA principles as well as implementing them in the classroom setting...|$|E

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} of how recognition categories {{can be learned}} {{in response to a}} temporal stream of input patterns. Interactions between an attentional subsystem and an orienting subsystem enable the network to self-stabilize its <b>learning,</b> <b>without</b> <b>an</b> external <b>teacher,</b> as the code becomes globally self-consistent. Category learning is thus determined by global contextual information in this system. The attentional subsystem learns bottomup codes and top-down templates, or expectancies. The internal representations formed in this way stabilize themselves against recoding by matching the learned top-down templates against input patterns. This matching process detects structural pattern properties in addition to local feature matches. The top-down templates can also suppress noise in the input patterns, and can subliminally prime the network to anticipate a set of input patterns. Mismatches activate an orienting subsystem, which resets incorrect codes and drives a rapid search for new or more appropriate codes. As the learned code becomes globally self-consistent, the orienting subsystem is automatically disengaged and the memory consolidates. After the recognition categories for a set of input patterns self-stabilize, thos...|$|R

40|$|As the Web {{increasingly}} pervades {{our everyday}} lives, {{we are faced}} with an overload of information. We often <b>learn</b> on-the-job <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> and <b>without</b> didactically prepared <b>learning</b> resources. We not only learn on our own but also collaboratively on social platforms where we discuss issues, exchange information and share knowledge with others. We actively learn with resources we find on the Web such as videos, blogs, forums or wikis. This form of self-regulated learning is called resource-based learning. An ongoing challenge in technology enhanced learning (TEL) and in particular in resource-based learning, is supporting learners in finding learning resources relevant to their current needs and learning goals. In social tagging systems, users collaboratively attach keywords called tags to resources thereby forming a network-like structure called a folksonomy. Additional semantic information gained for example from activity hierarchies or semantic tags, form an extended folksonomy and provide valuable information about the context of the resources the learner has tagged, the related activities the resources could be relevant for, and the learning task the learner is currently working on. This additional semantic information could be exploited by recommender systems to generate personalized recommendations of learning resources. Thus, the first research goal of this thesis is to develop and evaluate personalized recommender algorithms for a resource-based learning scenario. To this end, the resource-based learning application scenario is analysed, taking an existing learning platform as a concrete example, in order to determine which additional semantic information could be exploited for the recommendation of learning resources. Several new hybrid graph-based recommender approaches are implemented and evaluated. Additional semantic information gained from activities, activity hierarchies, semantic tag types, the semantic relatedness between tags and the context-specific information found in a folksonomy are thereby exploited. The proposed recommender algorithms are evaluated in offline experiments on different datasets representing diverse evaluation scenarios. The evaluation results show that incorporating additional semantic information is advantageous for providing relevant recommendations. The second goal of this thesis is to investigate alternative evaluation approaches for recommender algorithms for resource-based learning. Offline experiments are fast to conduct and easy to repeat, however they face the so called incompleteness problem as datasets are limited to the historical interactions of the users. Thus newly recommended resources, in which the user had not shown an interest in the past, cannot be evaluated. The recommendation of novel and diverse learning resources is however a requirement for TEL and needs to be evaluated. User studies complement offline experiments as the users themselves judge the relevance or novelty of the recommendations. But user studies are expensive to conduct and {{it is often difficult to}} recruit a large number of participants. Therefore a gap exists between the fast, easy to repeat offline experiments and the more expensive user studies. Crowdsourcing is an alternative as it offers the advantages of offline experiments, whilst still retaining the advantages of a user-centric evaluation. In this thesis, a crowdsourcing evaluation approach for recommender algorithms for TEL is proposed and a repeated evaluation of one of the proposed recommender algorithms is conducted as a proof-of-concept. The results of both runs of the experiment show that crowdsourcing can be used as an alternative approach to evaluate graph-based recommender algorithms for TEL...|$|R
