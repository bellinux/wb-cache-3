25|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles, {{which featured}} a combined gasoline and electric powertrain, {{were seen as}} a balance, offering an environmentally friendly image and improved fuel economy, without being hindered by the low range of electric vehicles, albeit at an increased price over comparable gasoline cars. Sales were poor, the lack of interest attributed to the car's small size and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> for a fuel-efficient car at the time. The 2000s energy crisis brought renewed interest in hybrid and electric cars. In America, sales of the Toyota Prius (which had been on sale since 1999 in some markets) jumped, {{and a variety of}} automakers followed suit, releasing hybrid models of their own. Several began to produce new electric car prototypes, as consumers called for cars that would free them from the fluctuations of oil prices.|$|E

2500|$|In other dialogues, the Sophist, Statesman, Republic, and the Parmenides, Plato himself {{associates}} {{knowledge with}} the apprehension of unchanging Forms and their relationships {{to one another}} (which he calls [...] "expertise" [...] in Dialectic), including through the processes of collection and division. More explicitly, Plato himself argues in the Timaeus that knowledge is always proportionate to the realm from which it is gained. In other words, if one derives one's account of something experientially, because the world of sense is in flux, the views therein attained will be mere opinions. And opinions are characterized by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> and stability. On the other hand, if one derives one's account of something {{by way of the}} non-sensible forms, because these forms are unchanging, so too is the account derived from them. That apprehension of forms is required for knowledge may be taken to cohere with Plato's theory in the Theaetetus and Meno. Indeed, the apprehension of Forms may be {{at the base of the}} [...] "account" [...] required for justification, in that it offers foundational knowledge which itself needs no account, thereby avoiding an infinite regression.|$|E

But this vastness was not empty. On the contrary it was occupied by a great city. There were streets much wider than Piccadilly, all bordered by houses, though these, I observed, were roofless, very fine houses, some of them, built of white stone or marble. There were roadways and pavements worn by the passage of feet. There, farther on, were market-places or public squares, and there, lastly, was a huge central enclosure one or two hundred acres in extent, which was filled with majestic buildings that looked like palaces, or town-halls; and, in the midst of them all, a vast temple with courts and a central dome. For here, notwithstanding the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity,</b> its builders seemed to have adhered to the Over-world tradition, and had roofed their fane.|$|E
