The consequences of this discovery probably will also have to be realised on a longer timescale.” The team found that visible light from the star had undergone <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> of around 16%. If the birefringence had been caused by light passing through interstellar gas or plasma, the effect should have been no more than 1%. Definitive proof would require repeating the observation at other wavelengths and on other neutron stars. At X-ray wavelengths the polarization from the quantum fluctuations should be near 100%. Although no telescope currently exists that can make such measurements, there are several proposed X-ray telescopes that may soon be able to verify the result conclusively such as ESO's European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), China's Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) and NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).|$|E

50|$|The best {{explanation}} of the phenomenon of optical molasses {{is based on the}} principle of polarization gradient cooling. Counterpropagating beams of circularly polarized light cause a standing wave, where the light polarization is linear but the direction rotates along the direction of the beams at a very fast rate. Atoms moving in the spatially varying <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> have a higher probability density of being in a state that is more susceptible to absorption of light from the beam coming head-on, rather than the beam from behind. This results in a velocity dependent damping force that is able to reduce the velocity of a cloud of atoms to near the recoil limit.|$|E

At the distance of this system, this angle is equivalent to a physical separation of about 106 AU, which places it inside the debris disk. It is a main sequence star with about 95% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The system has a higher optical <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> than expected for its distance from the Sun; this has been attributed to light scattered off the disk from {{the secondary}}. Prior to its 1993 identification using an adaptive optics coronagraph, this companion may have been responsible for the spectral anomalies that were attributed to the primary star. There is a candidate stellar companion at an angular separation of 32.3 arcseconds.|$|E
50|$|The helix in {{the antenna}} can twist in two {{possible}} directions: right-handed or left-handed, {{as defined by}} the right-hand rule. In an axial-mode helical antenna the direction of twist of the helix determines the polarisation of the radio waves. Two mutually incompatible conventions are in use for describing waves with circular polarisation, so the relationship between the handedness (left or right) of a helical antenna, and the type of circularly-polarised radiation it emits cannot be stated without ambiguity. Helical antennas can receive signals with any type of <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation,</b> such as horizontal or vertical polarisation, but when receiving circularly polarised signals the handedness of the receiving antenna must be the same as the transmitting antenna; left-hand polarised antennas suffer a severe loss of gain when receiving right-circularly-polarised signals, and vice versa.|$|E

We have exploited the low system temperature and high bandwidth of the receiver to obtain profiles which have good signal to noise {{for most of our}} sample at this relatively high frequency. Although, as expected, a number of profiles are less linearly polarised at 3. 1 GHz than at lower frequencies, we identify some pulsars and particular components of profiles in other pulsars which have increased <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> at this frequency. We discuss the dependence of <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> with frequency {{in the context of a}} model in which emission consists of the superposition of two, orthogonally polarised modes.
