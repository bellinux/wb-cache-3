2500|$|Studies {{based on}} genetically {{engineered}} mouse models of EPAC1 have provided valuable insights into understanding the in vivo functions of EPAC1 under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

This makes EPAC1 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention as the on-target toxicity of EPAC-based therapeutics will likely be <b>low.</b> <b>Up</b> to data, genetic and pharmacological analyses of EPAC1 in mice have revealed that EPAC1 plays important roles in cardiac stresses and heart failure, leptin resistance and energy homeostasis, [...] chronic pain, infection, cancer metastasis and metabolism.|$|E

The disco song has its protagonist going through a variety of emotions, from high to <b>low,</b> <b>up</b> to the point where she declares [...] "you got me feeling emotions".

The earlier (Mark I and Mark II - the differences being slight) exchanges could handle up to 2,000 customers.

Thabal chongba provided the only chance for girls to meet and talk to boys. In earlier times, this dance was performed in the moonlight accompanied by folk songs. The music is rhythmic beating of drums accompanied by other instruments. It is performed in every locality on all the five days of the festival. As soon as the moon rises over the hills, the flute, drums and cymbals start.

50|$|Fischer et al. (2003) {{proposed}} an exact solver to this minimal enclosing ball problem, though the algorithm {{does not have}} a polynomial running time in the worst case. The algorithm is purely combinatorial and implements a pivoting scheme similar to the simplex method for linear programming, used earlier in some heuristics. It starts with a big ball that covers all points and gradually shrink it until it can not be shrunk further. Author's major contributions are correct termination rules in cases of degeneracies, overlooked by other authors, and efficient handling of partial solutions, which produced a major speed-up. The authors verified that the algorithm is efficient in practice in low and moderately <b>low</b> (<b>up</b> to 10,000) dimensions and claim it does not exhibit numerical stability problems in its floating-point operations. A C++ implementation of the algorithm is available as an open-source project.|$|E
50|$|This channel {{nowadays}} needs {{repairs and}} is wasting water and recently {{the water level}} has become deadly <b>low,</b> <b>up</b> to three feet causing danger for thousands of fish. There is also a water channel which was constructed {{at the same time}} by the British to convert the snow and rain water near Spin Kaarez, coming from Murdar Mount, as surplus for filling the water in this lake. The channel was destroyed by a heavy flood in 1976 and has still not been re-constructed. The loss of the snow and rain water was wasted causing Hanna Lake to fully dry up between 1999 and January 2005. If the Hanna Lake Development Authority (HLDA), the custodians of Hanna Lake, do not take any measures to bring water through the surplus channel the lake will be soon dry again.|$|E
50|$|Heath {{barberry}} is a <b>low</b> (<b>up</b> to ½ m {{high and}} over 1 m wide in the wild) shrub. The mature twigs have a warm brown color, with 3-branched, flattened, light brown spines (1-1½ cm long) under each short side shoot. The thick, narrow leaves are semi-deciduous, linear in shape (1-2 cm long), somewhat bluish-green, with entire, rolled-under margins, and pointed, often purplish tips that may later die-down to a light brown. The flowers are radially symmetrical (about ½ cm), occur late in spring individually {{or in small}} umbels, are yolk yellow hinting towards orange. As in other Berberis species, the tepals are set in four whorls of three to five and equal in shape and color, so {{it is difficult to}} separate sepals from petals. The filament has a tooth on each side near its upper end, where the anther is attached. The fruit is a globose, blue-black berry of about 7 mm in diameter.|$|E

Stock indexes, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite, collapsed and rebounded very rapidly.

50|$|The pin-pen merger {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{recognized}} features of Southern speech.

Today there is very little variation throughout the Southern States in general, except that Savannah, Austin, Miami, and New Orleans are excluded from the merger. The area of consistent merger includes southern Virginia and most of the South Midland, and extends westward to include much of Texas. The northern limit of the merged area shows a number of irregular curves. Central and southern Indiana is dominated by the merger, but there is very little evidence of it in Ohio, and northern Kentucky shows a solid area of distinction around Louisville.|$|E
