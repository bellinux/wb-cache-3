30|$|Consider the sectoral {{composition}} of <b>labour</b> demand. Employment <b>intensities</b> differ across sectors, {{implying that the}} {{composition of}} demand matters for labour demand. The linkage from production to employment is complicated by several mechanisms: (a) different sectors have different <b>labour</b> <b>intensities,</b> and therefore, the nature/composition of shocks matters for the employment effects of a given change in GDP, and (b) firms may not adjust labour input immediately due to anticipation effects or explicit/implicit costs of adjustment work input. Even if labour in principle is perfectly substitutable across sectors in the long run, there {{are likely to be}} non-trivial costs of relocating labour across sectors. 21 Whether a reallocation of labour is socially desirable depends {{on the extent to which}} changes are purely cyclical (transitory) or include structural (permanent) elements.|$|R

Our theoretical model suggests that firm heterogeneity plays a crucial role for the link between employment protection and relocation. Stricter employment protection laws in the home country discourages firms’ relocation activity. While larger, more productive firms and firms with higher <b>labour</b> <b>intensities</b> have, ceteris paribus, higher propensities to relocate, these firms also face higher exit barriers if the country from which they consider relocating has strict employment protection laws. Our theoretical predictions are supported empirically, with consistent results for firms operating in the manufacturing sector...|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} of {{the common}} lands of the forest with fencing to enable grazing was and remains somewhat controversial with {{some members of the}} public. Exploring alternatives to enclosure, the conservators undertook a close-shepherded grazing pilot project from 2007 to 2010 with funding from the HLS scheme. A flock of Hebridean sheep, ultimately 300 in number, was guided by a shepherd and an assistant to graze unenclosed areas of the forest heathland. Among the advantages of this approach were that no fencing was required and grazing could be targeted on the most overgrown areas; among the disadvantages were its high <b>labour</b> <b>intensity,</b> high costs and low impact. The conservators have now begun using temporary electric fencing, which can be moved around to isolate different parts of the heathland, to enable the flock to graze without requiring close supervision by a shepherd.|$|E
5000|$|Agricultural Involution: The Processes of Ecological Change in Indonesia {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous of the early works of Clifford Geertz. Written for a {{particular}} US-funded project on the local developments and following the modernisation theory of Walt Whitman Rostow, Geertz examines in this book the agricultural system in Indonesia. The two dominant forms of agriculture are swidden and sawah. Swidden is also known as slash and burn and sawah is irrigated rice paddy. The geographical location of these different types is important. Sawah is the dominant form in both Java and Bali where nearly three quarters of Indonesia's population live and swidden more common in the less central regions. Having looked at the agricultural system the book turns to an examination of the systems historical development. Of particular note is Geertz's discussion of what he famously describes as the process of [...] "agricultural involution". This is his description of the process in Java where both the external economic demands of the Dutch rulers and the internal pressures due to population growth led to intensification rather than change. What this amounted was increasing the <b>labour</b> <b>intensity</b> in the paddies, increasing output per area but not increasing output per head.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century was marked with the {{appearance}} of hydraulic forging presses that started to replace hammers at forging works. Forging in forging presses is carried out by two dies of which one makes reciprocal movements and the other one remains stationary. This is the reason for relatively low productivity and high <b>labour</b> <b>intensity</b> of conventional forging in presses. The forging of low-ductility and hard-to-deform steels and alloys by two dies using conventional forging methods is very difficult and sometimes is practically impossible because of high tensile stresses in deformation zone leading to various forging defects and high percentage of rejected products.In the 1970s the mechanical radial forging machines (RFM) started to be used for the large-scale production of long-axis forgings where a work piece is reduced in radial directions simultaneously by several pairs of dies. The process of radial forging in mechanical RFM features high productivity of forging. However small single reductions of a work piece restricted by the design of these machines lead to localization of strains mainly in surface zones of the work piece while metal in the core zone remains unworked. [...] In 80-90s hydro-mechanical and hydraulic radial forging machines appeared that do not have the disadvantages inherent to mechanical RFM. Nevertheless, radial forging machines are very specific and very expensive equipment in comparison with multipurpose forging presses. The application of such machines at enterprises {{with a wide range of}} forgings manufactured is economically disadvantageous and inexpedient.The problem of manufacturing long-axis forgings by radial forging method in open-die hydraulic forging presses can be solved with use of multi-die forging devices. First such devices different in design and principle of operation appeared in the 1980s. At present, the most widespread and famous is the four-die forging device of the above described design engineered by Ukrainian and Russian scientists. The four-die forging devices have no analogues in the world now. They are successfully used at works in Russia, Ukraine, Spain, China and Germany.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for calculating {{the potential impact}} of the new socio-ecological transition away from fossil fuels on employment in EU energy supply. The methodology is based on “employment factors” (i. e. <b>labour</b> <b>intensities)</b> of different energy technologies. These employment factors are applied to changing energy mixes as projected by the decarbonisation scenarios of the European Commission’s Energy Roadmap 2050. In particular, we analyse quantitative (number of jobs) and qualitative (qualification levels) impacts on employment in extraction and processing of primary (fossil) fuels and in the power sector for the years 2020, 2030 and 2050. The results show that the energy sector will provide not only more jobs as the new socio-ecological transition unfolds, but also jobs requiring higher-level qualifications when compared with the current energy sector...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} firms' {{output and}} factor demands before, during, and after episodes of lumpy investment. By using a rich employer-employee panel data set for two manufacturing industries and one service industry, {{we focus on}} simultaneous variations in output, capital, materials, man hours, labour productivity, and the skill composition and hourly cost of labour. Investment spikes are followed by roughly proportional changes in sales, labour, and materials, and significant increases in capital intensity. The changes in labour productivity {{that are associated with}} the investment spikes are small, which indicates that productivity improvements are not related to instantaneous technological change through investment spikes. Focusing on sectoral differences, capital adjustments are found to be smoother in the service industry than in the two manufacturing industries which may be related to differences in <b>labour</b> <b>intensities</b> between the industries.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{understand}} the relationship between the labour and energy intensity for firms drawn from pulp and paper industries in Indian manufacturing. Pulp and paper industry accounts for a considerable share of the industrial enterprises, production, employment and exports in the Indian economy and, one of the energy intensive industries in Indian manufacturing. This paper uses data from the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), at the unit level for the period 1992 to 2000. Analysis from the cross-tabulation of energy and <b>labour</b> <b>intensity</b> of the firms in this industry suggests that energy intensity is higher for the BSE listed firms however, the <b>labour</b> <b>intensity</b> is found higher for the nonlisted firms. Further, energy and <b>labour</b> <b>intensity</b> is higher for the domestic when compared to foreign firms. The econometric analysis of the energy intensity and other firm specific characteristics suggests that <b>labour</b> <b>intensity</b> has a negative relationship with energy intensity, suggesting a substitution possibility between energy and labour for the pulp and paper industries in India. Further we found that higher labour intensive firms are more energy intensive. Profitability of the firm emerged negatively related to energy intensity. The listed firms are found to be more energy intensives as compared to the non-listed firms. More importantly, technology import is found negatively related to the energy intensity of the firms, suggesting that firms in these industries could be using technology import and knowledge sharing from their foreign collaborators for savings on energy.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} a dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} to analyse different aspects of financial reforms in a two sector closed economy. Market structure {{in one of the}} sectors is perfectly competitive, while the other sector is monopolistically competitive. The perfectly competitive firms {{do not have access to}} the equity markets, whereas the imperfectly competitive firms finance their fixed cost needs through the equity market and operate under increasing returns to scale. Both types of firms depend on the banks for working capital finance. Financial reform is modeled as a one shot process of either increasing the efficiency of the equity market or decreasing the cash-reserve ratio of the banks. We analyse a steady state solution of the dynamic structure. Simulation exercises with alternative plausible parametric specifications regarding capital and <b>labour</b> <b>intensities</b> in the production process throw light on the issues of brand proliferation (emergence of new firms) and relative impact on the two sectors, following the initiation of a financial reform programme.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which a term like “globalization”, {{especially}} in its sense of implying the existence of a system, or of dominant features favouring development towards some system, is adaptable to a theory of a world economy which is to take due notice of the structure of the exchange value of commodities on the world market. A leading idea is that religious outlooks, in the way they were conceptualized by Karl Marx, have a strong bearing upon the difference in <b>labour</b> <b>intensities</b> in countries contributing to the world market, and thereby upon the differences in international values and prices. These differences are expressed in a scale-based, rigid structure on the world market itself—a structure which gives us the fundamental reason why certain specific countries or areas may get steadily poorer in relative terms, while others may constantly get relatively richer through the same mechanism. Consequently, when (as it is done here) religion is taken to express the quintessence of the cultural level of societies, it can be said that the comparative study of religions gives us a key to the understanding of crucial economic differences between nations. The differences in question are primarily those prevailing between capitalist societies on the one hand, and non-capitalist, or what is here called patrimonial societies, on the other...|$|R

The model is investigated by means of local stability and computer numerical analysis.

Convergence towards the low-growth steady state, associated with the unskilled labour intensive technology, occurs under adverse structural conditions, such as marked initial skill shortage and high skill upgrade costs.
