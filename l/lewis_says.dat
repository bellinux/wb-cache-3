25|$|Bernard <b>Lewis</b> <b>says</b> that {{classical}} Islamic civilization granted free Muslim women {{relatively more}} property rights than {{women in the}} West, even as it sanctified three basic inequalities between master and slave, man and woman, believer and unbeliever. Even in cases where property rights were granted in the West, they were very limited and covered only upper class women. Over time, while women's rights have improved elsewhere, those in many Muslim-dominated countries have remained comparatively restricted.|$|E
500|$|According to William Montgomery Watt religion, for Muhammad, was not {{a private}} and {{individual}} matter but [...] "the total response of his personality to the total situation in which he found himself. He was responding ... to the religious and intellectual aspects of the situation {{but also to the}} economic, social, and political pressures to which contemporary Mecca was subject." [...] Bernard <b>Lewis</b> <b>says</b> there are two important political traditions in Islam– Muhammad as a statesman in Medina, and Muhammad as a rebel in Mecca. His view believed Islam as a great change, akin to a revolution, when introduced to new societies.|$|E
500|$|St Fflewin, to {{whom the}} church is dedicated, was a Christian who {{was active in the}} 6th century. He is {{described}} as the son of Ithel Hael, who came to Britain from Armorica (present-day northern France) {{towards the end of the}} 5th century. He established a Christian site at the location of the present church in 630 (according to the Diocese of Bangor and a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey), although a 19th-century guide to Wales by the writer Samuel <b>Lewis</b> <b>says</b> that it was sometime early in the 7th century. No part of a building from that period survives. [...] There was a church here by 1254, since it is recorded in the Norwich Taxation of that year. [...] The present building is thought by Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales) to be [...] "probably built upon Medieval foundations", albeit that the earliest dateable feature of the structure is from the late 18th century. After some repairs in the early part of the 19th century, St Fflewin's was partially rebuilt ("judiciously", says a 2009 guide to the buildings of north-west Wales) in 1864 and further restored during the 1930s. The Welsh poet and clergyman Morris Williams (better known by his bardic name [...] "Nicander") was rector here from 1859 until his death in 1874; he was buried at Llanrhuddlad, one of the other Anglesey churches for which he had responsibility.|$|E

2500|$|Calormen: A great {{empire of}} many provinces, lush vistas, vast trading networks, and {{magnificent}} palaces. Their society is strict, hierarchical, elegant. <b>Lewis</b> <b>says</b> it best: [...] "the Calormenes have dark faces and long beards. They wear flowing robes and orange colored turbans, {{and they are}} a wise, wealthy, courteous, cruel, and ancient people." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{moral and}} outline of 'The Monk' are taken, as <b>Lewis</b> <b>says</b> {{in a letter}} to his father ('Life, etc.', vol. i. pp. 154-158), and as was pointed out in the 'Monthly Review' for August, 1797, from Addison's [...] "Santon Barsisa" [...] in the 'Guardian' (No. 148). The book was {{severely}} criticized on the score of immorality. Mathias ('Pursuits of Literature', Dialogue iv.) attacks Lewis, whom he compares to John Cleland, whose 'Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure' came under the notice of the law courts: ...|$|E

Then he told me some interestin' news. You see he's been worryin' about this gang thet's rangin' around Buffalo Park, an' he's {{tried to get a}} line on them. Somebody took a shot at him in the woods. He couldn't swear it was one of that outfit, but he could swear he wasn't near shot by accident.

5000|$|Albucasis follows Paulus almost {{word for}} word but then {{describes}} {{a different sort of}} knife, that is [...] "sharp on two sides" [...] (Spinks and <b>Lewis</b> <b>say</b> it is difficult to reconcile the drawing of the knife to the procedure). Albucasis also adds using forceps instead of the scoop and chisel of Ammonius to break up the stone. Albucasis also uses a [...] "drill" [...] for stones impacted in the urethra, a technique not recorded earlier.|$|R
50|$|Ferdinand leaves town after {{receiving}} a letter from his father. Several months later, he {{send a letter to}} <b>Lewis</b> <b>saying</b> that he has seen his singer, and has found out that she is to marry another man. Upon recognizing Ferdinand, she faints into the arms of Professor X———. Lewis finds this especially strange, since Professor X——— hasn't once left town in the intervening time. He wonders if the Turk's prophecy has in fact been fulfilled by psychic bonds making their way into everyday life.|$|R
5000|$|Metaxas {{was raised}} in the Greek Orthodox Church and while he has not {{formally}} left it (saying he has [...] "great respect" [...] for it) he attends an Evangelical Episcopal church in New York. Metaxas describes himself as a [...] "Mere Christian" [...] after the works of C.S. <b>Lewis,</b> <b>saying</b> his books [...] "don't touch upon anything at all where Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox Christians differ. They express just the basics of the faith, from a basic, ecumenical Christian viewpoint. They only talk about the Christian faith that they have agreement on." ...|$|R

5000|$|Originator James [...] "Leon" [...] <b>Lewis</b> <b>says</b> {{the group}} came {{together}} in the late 1990s when he was singing, a cappella, {{in the locker room}} at the post office in Richmond, and a co-worker a few lockers over picked up the tune.

5000|$|Woodward's third album, Hooked! (Verve, 2010), was {{recorded}} at Stratosphere Sound in New York City and Jim Henson Studios in Hollywood. It {{was produced by}} Tony Visconti and included contributions by Tim K., Justin Stanley, and Itaal Shur. Woodward wrote much of the album with Dan Petty and Michelle <b>Lewis,</b> <b>saying</b> {{that she had been}} inspired by the music of Peggy Lee and Django Reinhardt. The song [...] "Another Woman" [...] was written for her by longtime inspiration Nellie McKay, who sang background vocals. A reviewer at AllMusic compared the album to Dusty Springfield and Brill Building pop.|$|R

50|$|On January 16, 2009, Bank of America {{announced}} that Merrill suffered an unexpected loss of $15 {{billion for the}} fourth quarter of 2008. Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis said that, without $138 billion in government assistance, including the infusion of $20 billion from the federal government, he would have pulled out of the Merrill deal, which had been approved by Bank of America shareholders in early December. People close to <b>Lewis</b> <b>say</b> his relationship with Thain was strained by Merrill's massive fourth quarter loss. Lewis himself faced criticism for rushing to buy Merrill for $28 billion after less than two days of due diligence.|$|R

5000|$|During the 1880s, many Anti-Chinese Leagues {{were formed}} which {{organised}} many Anti-Chinese demonstrations {{to persuade the}} government to cease immigration from China. On Saturday 5 May 1888, one such demonstration in Brisbane, fuelled by alcohol, turned into a riot, where the mob of an estimated 2000 people attacked Chinese homes and businesses. The riot spread to Chinese premises {{in other parts of}} Brisbane, including South Brisbane and Fortitude Valley. The police did little to quell the riot with Police Inspector <b>Lewis</b> <b>saying</b> afterwards that [...] "the majority {{of the people in the}} street were respectable citizens and would probably have been injured had this been done!". The only person arrested was subsequently acquitted.|$|R
50|$|This {{point is}} where capital {{accumulation}} {{catches up with}} population {{so that there is}} no longer any surplus labor left. <b>Lewis</b> <b>says</b> that it the point where capital accumulation comes to a stop can come before also that is if real wages rise so high so as to reduce capitalists' profits to the level at which profits are all consumed and there is no net investment.|$|E
5000|$|On {{an ironic}} note, in 1959 she was {{featured}} on {{an episode of}} the N.B.C.-T.V. series Startime. This particular episode was an adaptation of Samson Raphaelson's play [...] "The Jazz Singer" [...] starring Jerry Lewis, in which she played Lewis's mother, Sarah Rabinowitz. In one scene, <b>Lewis</b> <b>says</b> the line, referring to Picon as his mother, [...] "She's still in our presence, ladies and gentlemen, the Matchmaker".|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} for AllMusic, Dave <b>Lewis</b> <b>says</b> about the album that [...] "is a splendidly {{recorded}} and mastered CD, and inasmuch as Roscoe Mitchell as classical composer is concerned, {{this is very}} close to where it truly starts." [...] The Penguin Guide to Jazz says that [...] "it's a rather bewitching set altogether, and a useful notebook on what Chicago's playing élite were looking into at the period." ...|$|E
5000|$|Before Porter Rogers {{could call}} to Signalman Jones {{to release the}} ground frame lock, the {{stopping}} train arrived. The youth, Thompson, collected the tablet for the Montgomery-Abermule section from {{the driver of the}} stopping train, and was heading back to the station buildings {{to put it in the}} tablet instrument when he met Lewis returning from the goods yard. He gave the tablet to <b>Lewis,</b> <b>saying</b> that he had to go and collect the tickets (although only one passenger had alighted from the train). He did not mention that he had yet to exchange the tablet for one for the Abermule-Newtown section (which he could not have done, because the Abermule-Newtown tablet machine was still locked). Thompson also mistakenly told Lewis that the express was still [...] "about Moat Lane", presumably from having overheard some of Jones's earlier telephone conversation.|$|R

5000|$|The special {{threat of}} this fallacy lies {{in that it}} applies equally {{to the person who}} errs as to that person's opponent. Taken to its logical consequence, it implies that all {{arguments}} are unreliable and hence undermines all rational thought. <b>Lewis</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Until Bulverism is crushed, reason can play no effective part in human affairs. Each side snatches it early as a weapon against the other; but between the two reason itself is discredited." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackson's {{idea for}} [...] "Black Cat" [...] {{was based on}} a warning to a rebel {{involved}} in substance abuse, in addition to the consequences of drug addiction. Its composition compares the theme to the folklore superstitions of cats having nine lives and black cats foreshadowing a negative omen or misfortune. She also related its title to the bold nature of a panther, saying [...] "I have always felt some kind of connection between myself and a panther. They're not afraid of anything, they're willing to take on anything–that's the way I feel about my work." [...] Regarding its development, she said, [...] "I was getting dressed and ready to go to the studio. The television was on - some commercials and other stuff. I just started humming a melody. I don't know why and it kept sticking in my head. So I put it down on tape." [...] She later recalled Jam & <b>Lewis</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "they thought it was something that might work."
