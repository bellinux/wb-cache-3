500|$|The Doni Tondo is {{believed}} to be the only existing panel picture Michelangelo painted without the aid of assistants; and, unlike his Manchester Madonna and Entombment (both National Gallery, London), the attribution to him has never been questioned. [...] The juxtaposition of bright colors foreshadows the same use of color in Michelangelo’s later Sistine ceiling frescoes. The folds of the drapery are sharply modeled, and the skin of the figures is so smooth, it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> medium is marble. The surface treatment of the massive figures resembles a sculpture more than a painting. [...] The nude figures in the background have softer modeling and look to be precursors to the ignudi, the male nude figures in the Sistine Ceiling frescoes. Michelangelo’s technique includes shading from the most intense colors first to the lighter shades on top, using the darker colors as shadows, a technique called cangiante. By applying the pigment in a certain way, Michelangelo created an [...] "unfocused" [...] effect in the background and focused detail in the foreground. [...] The most vibrant color is located within the Virgin’s garments, signifying her importance within the image. [...] X-rays of the painting show that Michelangelo incorporated every known pigment used at the time. [...] The masculinity of Mary could be explained by Michelangelo’s use of male models for female figures, as was done for the Sistine Chapel.|$|E
2500|$|Typical of Brewster's portraits is [...] "Francis O. Watts with Bird" [...] (1805), showing [...] "an {{innocent}} looking {{boy with}} manly features" [...] wearing a nightslip {{and holding a}} bird on his finger and with a string. The surrounding landscape is [...] "strangely low and wildly out of scale—the young boy towers over trees and dwarfs distant mountains. He looks like a giant," [...] Genocchio has written. Or he <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> viewer must be lying down, {{looking up at the}} child from the ground. Brewster always struggled with the relationship of his figures to the background.|$|E
2500|$|Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first {{appeared}} opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. While Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner [...] "easy to like and sharp with her timing", {{he was disappointed}} to see her as [...] "the love interest, {{which is not the}} same as a rounded character." [...] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as [...] "less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words “enter generic female lead” in [...] screenplay)." [...] Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner – [...] "always happy and always pleasant to everyone" [...] – against type. David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she [...] "proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised an [...] "inspired, seemingly effortless, performance" [...] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she [...] "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before." [...] Garner then appeared in Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), sharing scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey. In 2011, she had a supporting role in Arthur as the villainous arranged bride of Russell Brand's character.|$|E
