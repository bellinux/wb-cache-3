5000|$|During {{the sixties}} we were {{concerned}} with stripping away. Chaikin and the Open Theater actors worked to reveal the actor's imagination as projected by the actor's presence. We showed that full, exciting theatrical productions could be done with nothing but actors and two benches or four chairs or only a bare stage. It {{was not only a}} matter of economics, it was essential to demonstrate the profound power of the actor's imagination and the actor's ability to create place; i.e. scenery through the power of belief via total technique and through the use of transformation not only of character but of time and place. The Open Theater formed as an offshoot of the <b>Living</b> <b>Theater.</b> The <b>Living</b> <b>Theater</b> initially divided because actor Joseph Chaikin felt that the troupe had become less interested in artistic exploration and experimentation, and more interested in political activism. He felt that actors needed specific training to do the sorts of pieces that the <b>Living</b> <b>Theater</b> did.|$|R

5|$|Its fourth artistic {{director}} Chris Coleman {{took over in}} May 2000, and recruited experienced actors to the company. Coleman had previously co-founded Actor's Express in Atlanta, Georgia, and was the {{artistic director}} there. Coleman initially signed on for a three-year contract. Before Coleman began as artistic director with PCS, the company was already the largest <b>live</b> <b>theater</b> production company in Portland. However, the organization was facing sporadic attendance at performances as well as financial difficulties, with a deficit {{at the end of}} 1999 of $700,000. In 2000 PCS had a deficit of $880,000 and a base of 10,000 subscribers. The financial position of the company later stabilized, and Coleman had a 2000 budget of $3.2million to work with when he came on. A 2003 consultant's report, however, found that PCS relied more heavily on gifts and grants to fund its operations than its peers around the company.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was founded}} in New York City {{by a group of}} former {{students}} of acting teacher Nola Chilton, and joined shortly thereafter by director Joseph Chaikin, formerly of The Living Theatre, and Peter Feldman. Chaikin founded the Open Theater after leaving the <b>Living</b> <b>Theater</b> following the arrest of Julian Beck and Judith Malina for tax evasion. [...] He felt that the <b>Living</b> <b>Theater</b> had become less interested in artistic exploration and experimentation, and more interested in political activism. He felt that actors needed specific training to do the sorts of pieces that the <b>Living</b> <b>Theater</b> did. [...] The group's intent was to continue Chilton's exploration of a [...] "post-method", post-absurd acting technique, by way of a collaborative and wide-ranging process that included exploration of political, artistic, and social issues, which were felt to be {{critical to the success of}} avant-garde theatre. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and Viola Spolin, created well-known exercises, such as [...] "sound and movement" [...] and [...] "transformations", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with Jerzy Grotowski's [...] "poor theater" [...] in Poland. According to playwright Megan Terry the notion of a minimalist aesthetic was fueled by the company's quest to achieve narrative insight and political accountability through the body of the actor: ...|$|R
