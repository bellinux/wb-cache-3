5|$|In {{a series}} of {{published}} and unpublished studies in the 1930s, Whorf argued that Mayan writing was to some extent phonetic. While his work on deciphering the Maya script gained some support from Alfred Tozzer at Harvard, the main authority on Ancient Maya culture, J.E.S. Thompson, strongly rejected Whorf's ideas, saying that Mayan writing lacked a phonetic component and is therefore impossible to decipher based on a <b>linguistic</b> <b>analysis.</b> Whorf {{argued that it was}} exactly the reluctance to apply <b>linguistic</b> <b>analysis</b> of Maya languages that had held the decipherment back. Whorf sought for cues to phonetic values within the elements of the specific signs, and never realized that the system was logo-syllabic. Although Whorf's approach to understanding the Maya script is now known to have been misguided, his central claim that the script was phonetic and should be deciphered as such was vindicated by Yuri Knorozov's syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|By {{introducing}} {{a distinction between}} diachronic and synchronic analyses of language, he laid {{the foundation of the}} modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of <b>linguistic</b> <b>analysis</b> that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).|$|E

40|$|This review {{examined}} {{previous research}} applications of <b>linguistic</b> discourse <b>analysis</b> {{to assess the}} language of adults with aphasia. A comprehensive literature search of seven databases identified 165 studies that applied linguistic measures to samples of discourse collected from people with aphasia. Analysis of methodological applications revealed an increase in published research using <b>linguistic</b> discourse <b>analysis</b> over the past 40 years, particularly to measure the generalisation of therapy outcomes to language in use. Narrative language samples were most frequently subject to analysis though all language genres were observed across included studies. A total of 536 different linguistic measures were applied to examine language behaviours.

5|$|According to sinologists Denis C. Twitchett and Klaus-Peter Tietze, it is {{generally}} held that the Khitans emerged from the Yuwen branch of the Xianbei people. Following a defeat {{at the hands of}} another branch of the Xianbei in 345, the Yuwen split into three tribes, one of which was called the Kumo Xi. In 388 the Kumo Xi itself split, with one group remaining under the name Kumo Xi and the other group becoming the Khitans. This view is partially backed up by the Book of Wei, which describes the Khitans as being of Xianbei origins. There are also several competing theories on the origin of the Khitans. Beginning in the Song dynasty, some Chinese scholars suggested that the Khitans might have descended from the Xiongnu people. While modern historians have rejected the idea that the Khitan were solely Xiongnu in origin, there is some support for the claim that they are of mixed Xianbei and Xiongnu origin. Beginning with Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in the fourteenth century, several Western scholars have theorized that the Khitans were Mongolic in origin, and in the late 19th century Western scholars made the claim that the Khitans were Tungusic in origin—modern <b>linguistic</b> <b>analysis</b> has discredited this claim.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000 BC, the Maya spoke {{a single}} language, dubbed proto-Mayan by linguists. <b>Linguistic</b> <b>analysis</b> of reconstructed Proto-Mayan {{vocabulary}} {{suggests that the}} original Proto-Mayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands, although the evidence is not conclusive. Proto-Mayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups {{that make up the}} family, including Huastecan, Greater K'iche'an, Greater Q'anjobalan, Mamean, Tz'eltalan-Ch'olan, and Yucatecan. These groups diverged further during the pre-Columbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times. The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as Ch'olan; Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu, in the highlands, also appears to be in, or related to, Ch'olan. The use of Ch'olan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace – it may have been equivalent to Medieval Latin as a ritual or prestige language. Classic Ch'olan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite, used in inter-polity communication such as diplomacy and trade. By the Postclassic period, Yucatec was also being written in Maya codices alongside Ch'olan.|$|E
5|$|India Knight, {{a novelist}} and {{columnist}} for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 {{that she had}} been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a début novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply. Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for <b>linguistic</b> <b>analysis</b> which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E

40|$|Background: Understanding of {{informed}} consent forms (ICFs) for clinical research remains insufficient despite attempts to simplify them. Through <b>linguistic</b> discourse <b>analysis,</b> {{we sought to}} identify pitfalls within the text of ICFs that could hinder readers' understanding of participation in research. Methods: We conducted a <b>linguistic</b> discourse <b>analysis</b> on a qualitative sample of 19 ICFs approved by research ethics committees (RECs) for oncology protocols and explored whether our findings also applied to standard U. S. documents available online. Results: We identified five major categories of language patterns that were problematic with respect to ensuring {{informed consent}}. We categorized them as follows: “bypassing consent,” “seeker–supplier inversion,” “interlocking Russian dolls,” “vanishing author,” and “one size fits all. ” At least one instance of these findings existed in all analyzed forms (median 10 per ICF, range 1 – 18) and in national templates and U. S. documents. Conclusions: <b>Linguistic</b> discourse <b>analysis</b> identified recurrent pitfalls {{in the language of}} REC-approved ICFs and templates.

25|$|<b>Linguistic</b> <b>analysis</b> is a sub-discipline {{of applied}} {{linguistics}} {{used by many}} governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.

Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like English. Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved. Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality.

Likewise optimal sets via SVM-SFFS and single feature relevance by information gain ratio calculation are presented. Overall classification is realised by diverse ensemble approaches. Among base classifiers Kernel Machines, Decision Trees, Bayesian classifiers, and memory-based learners are found. Acoustics only tests ran on a database comprising 39 speakers for speaker independent accuracy analysis. Additionally the public Berlin Emotional Speech database is used.
