The Lax–Wendroff scheme (Lax and Wendroff 1960), {{which is one of}} the earliest second-order finite difference schemes, can be obtained from the Taylor series expansion. The Lax–Wendroff scheme has predominantly <b>lagging</b> <b>phase</b> error except for large wave numbers with 0.5 < ν < 1, where ν is the Courant number.

On the other hand, the Lax–Wendroff method has opposite phase errors for 0 < ν < 1. Therefore, a linear combination of the two methods can reduce the dispersive error of the scheme. Fromm’s method of zero-average phase error (Wesseling 2001) is based on this observation.|$|E

40|$|When {{micro-organisms}} are in environments {{with multiple}} nutrients, they often preferentially utilise one first. A second is only utilised once {{the first is}} exhausted. Such a two-phase growth pattern is known as diauxic growth.

The anaerobic digestion of high solids raw manure and also co-digested manure were conducted in a 4 L batch anaerobic tank which operated under mesophilic conditions at ambient temperature. The co-digestion with grass (as substitute for rice straw) and bran were carried out to determine whether any of these two materials inhibited or promote the greater production of biogas. This co-digestion of high solids raw manure were conducted with a ratio of total solid of chicken manure to co digested material of 90 : 10 for both co-digestion.

40|$|The <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> is {{the initial}} {{phase of a}} culture that precedes {{exponential}} growth and occurs when {{the conditions of the}} culture medium differ from the pre-inoculation conditions. It is usually defined by means of cell density because the number of individuals remains approximately constant or slowly increases, and it is quantified with the lag parameter l. The <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> has been studied through mathematical modelling and by means of specific experiments. In recent years, Individual-based Modelling (IbM) has provided helpful insights into <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> studies. In this paper, the definition of <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> is thoroughly examined. Evolution of the total biomass and the total number of bacteria during <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> is tackled separately. The <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> lasts until the culture reaches a maximum growth rate both in biomass and cell density. Once in the exponential phase, both rates are constant over time and equal to each other. Both evolutions are split into an initial phase and a transition phase, according to their growth rates. A population-level mathematical model is presented to describe the transitional phase in cell density. INDividual DIScrete SIMulation (INDISIM) is used to check the outcomes of this analysis. Simulations allow the separate study of the evolution of cell density and total biomass in a batch culture, they provide a depiction of different observed cases in lag evolution at the individual-cell level, and are used to test the population-level model. The results show that the geometrical lag parameter l is not appropriate as a universal definition for the <b>lag</b> <b>phase.</b> Moreover, the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> cannot be characterized by a single parameter. For the studied cases, the <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> of both the total biomass and the population are required to fully characterize the evolution of bacterial cultures.

The R 2 experienced a <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> in methane production of 2  days in cycle 1 and 4  days in cycle 2 and 3. The <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> is the time needed by the microorganisms to acclimatize to a new environment (Echiegu 2015) and substrates. Generally, the physiological processes by which microorganisms adapt to the new environment or substrates dictates {{the length of the}} <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> (Rolfe et al. 2012). Non-fiber carbohydrates have been found easily accessible to microbial degradation (Janke et al. 2015) with short <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> whereas substrates with increased fiber content such as the cellulose fed to R 2 were reported to exhibits increased <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> (Nielfa et al. 2015).

Individual <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> of about 100 (i) ndividual cells per condition were examined and calculated using a linear extrapolation method. Generation times were calculated out of the slope. The obtained data were analyzed at three different levels: in a first approach, the mean values were calculated for each set of environmental conditions and compared to predictions made by the USDA's Pathogen Modeling Program (PMP) for analogous growth conditions. The PMP predictions of the generation times {{were in the same}} order of magnitude as the obtained data, although a persistent underestimation could be observed. The observed individual cell lag data differed from <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> predictions by PMP. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Secondly, histograms of individual <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> measurements were constructed for the different temperature-pH combinations. In this way, the influence of both factors on the variability of individual <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> could be estimated. At low stress levels, most individual cells showed a short <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> resulting in a compression of the histograms at the zero-lag level, while, at high stress levels, the histograms shifted to longer <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> with a significant increase in variability. Thirdly, 37 different distribution types were fitted to the datasets to reveal the distributions that fitted best the obtained data. The gamma distribution was preferred at moderate stress levels, while the Weibull distribution was chosen for harsher growth conditions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

The objectives of this study were to identify and quantify chemical compounds suspected to induce and affect bacterial <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> termination and to characterize the role of gravity in <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> termination by correlating effects on chemical concentration gradients. The organism used for this study was Escherichia coli ATCC 4157. Acetic acid was not found in the extracellular environment of E. coli at the end of <b>lag</b> <b>phase.</b> Lactic acid was found in the extracellular environment of E. coli at the end of <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> in small amounts. Evidence was not found to support the hypothesis that either lactic acid or CO? are critical by-products for <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> termination. At a significance level of ? = 0. 05, lactic acid (20 and 30 mg/L) supplementation increased E. coli <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> length. At a significance level of ? = 0. 10, CO? supplementation via bubbling through 5 % CO? in air from a pressurized canister and equilibration of media with CO? in a flask increased <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> length by 1. 39 and 2. 12 hours, respectively. Based on mathematical analysis, gravity does not affect the mass transfer of lactic acid and CO? away from a single E. coli cell, but does affect the mass transfer of proteins having diffusivities on the order of 1 to 10 []m?/s. Mass transfer for such proteins is greater when gravity is present. Evidence was not found to support the hypotheses that lactic acid and CO? are critical components for <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> termination. This conclusion was supported by the outcome of the supplementation experiments, and the relative movement and by-product concentration gradient analyses. The latter two analyses indicate by-products the size of lactic acid (D = 2200 []m?/s) and CO? (D = 2800 []m?/s) readily diffuse away from a single E. coli cell while by-products with diffusivities closer to 1 to 10 []m?/s will remain at higher concentrations closer to the cell. Therefore, working with the supposition that critical by-products are necessary for <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> termination it is suggested that by-products having diffusivities on the order of 1 to 10 []m?/s are likely candidates to be critical by-products for <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> termination...|$|R

For all temperature-pH combinations, the individual cell <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> was determined using a three-phase linear growth model.

Beside this, the variability observed was lower than at higher precultural temperatures. Regarding the precultural pH effect, at pH 7. 4 the mean values of the <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> were shorter at lower preincubation temperatures; while at pH 5. 7 small pH transitions produced shorter individual <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> at all precultural temperatures.

A 45 -second light pretreatment followed by 4 hours of darkness is sufficient to remove the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> from cotyledons with hooks, while hookless cotyledons require 2 hours of continuous illumination followed by 1 hour of dark incubation to break the <b>lag</b> <b>phase.</b> The effect of hooks on cotyledon greening is enhanced if the hooks are shielded from light. Cutting off the hooks after <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> removal caused a marked decrease in chlorophyll accumulation in the cotyledons. These observations may indicate that the hypocotyl hooks produce a substance or substances needed in the greening process, which are translocated to the cotyledons. Indoleacetic acid, abscisic acid, gibberellin A 3, 6 -benzylamino purine and δ-aminolevulinic acid do not show any activity; on the other hand, ethylene appears to replace partially the hypocotyl hooks...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> is {{a complex}} and yet not completely understood phenomenon. Many studies on the microbial <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> have been published but few report a systematic study; moreover, previous lag studies have involved the effect of multiple confounded factors. Here, the effect of sudden temperature rises on an exponentially growing Escherichia coli culture is systematically investigated. Experiments are performed in a computer-controlled bioreactor where E. coli K 12 MG 1655 is grown under aerobic conditions in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. This experimental set-up is used to characterise the effect of (i) the amplitude of the temperature shift, (ii) the pre-shift temperature level and (iii) the post-shift temperature level on the occurrence and length of a <b>lag</b> <b>phase.</b> Besides temperature, no other environmental changes {{take place at the}} moment of the temperature shift. To quantify the length of the induced <b>lag</b> <b>phase,</b> the experimental data are described with a common growth model. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae {{differ in}} {{colonization}} prevalence {{and the likelihood}} of causing disease. In vitro growth in brain heart infusion broth with or without 5 % fetal calf serum (FCS) was compared for 47 clinical isolates representing 15 pneumococcal serotypes. Serotype-specific colonization prevalence and odds ratios for the invasive potential were obtained from an international and a local epidemiological study. The duration of the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> increased with the invasiveness and was inversely associated with the colonization prevalence of a serotype. Supplementation with FCS shortened the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> preferentially in serotypes associated with invasive disease (P= 0. 007). Reduction of oxidative stress by addition of manganese (Mn(2 +)), Tiron, mannitol or catalase did not influence the duration of the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> significantly. Serotype specific invasiveness and colonization prevalence of S. pneumoniae are associated with the length of the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> during in vitro growth. This may correlate with serotype specific selection in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although LDL {{resistance}} to copper-induced oxidation is a time-honoured method, {{how it is}} modulated by the physiologic variability of lipid phenotype and what influences the protective action of homologous HDL and exogenous alanine is still unclear. Methods: In 159 subjects without severe dyslipidemias, LDL {{resistance to}} copper-induced oxidation (<b>lag</b> <b>phase)</b> was measured under standardised conditions, with alanine and with autologous HDL. Results: <b>Lag</b> <b>phase</b> was normally distributed and averaged 68 +/- 10 min (range: 40 - 105 min). Both VLDL-triglycerides (37 +/- 5, 52 +/- 7, 59 +/- 7, 53 +/- 5 mg/dl, p< 0. 05) and LDL-triglycerides (27 +/- 2, 27 +/- 1, 30 +/- 2, 35 +/- 3 mg/dl, p< 0. 01) increased across quartiles of <b>lag</b> <b>phase.</b> The relative LDL enrichment in triglycerides (triglycerides percent or triglycerides/cholesterol ratio) was strongly related to <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> (r= 0. 29 and r= 0. 31, p< 0. 0005 for both) independently of age, gender, BMI, and presence of diabetes or hypertension. The protective effect of HDL was variable (+ 42 +/- 18 min) and largely dependent on the capacity of HDL to resist oxidation (r= 0. 69,p< 0. 0001). Alanine induced a rather constant <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> prolongation (+ 32 +/- 7 min) that was weakly related only to baseline <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> (r= 0. 17,p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Relative triglyceride abundance protects LDL from ex-vivo oxidation, HDL particles protect LDL mainly through substrate dilution and alanine probably through a direct anti-oxidant effect.

40|$|In {{studies on}} the {{pasteurization}} of milk at ultra high temperatures {{it was observed that}} the surviving bacteria (less than 100 per ml) ex-hibited a prolonged <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> during subsequent incubation of the heat treated milk sample (Kaufmann, 1957). Penfold (1914) concluded that, among other things, the size of the inoculum affects the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> of growth as determined by the generation time over the first 2 hr of the growth period. He reported little, if any pro-longation of the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> when the initial cell level ranged from about 100 to 4000 cells per ml. A lengthening of <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> was observed, how-ever, when the inoculum was about 2 cells per ml. The prolonged <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> observed following exposure to ultra high temperatures, therefore, may be attributed in part, to the low level of survivors. Heat has also been observed by Tobias et al. (1955) to affect the rapidity of bacterial recovery; these workers reported slow bacterial develop-ment with a heat-resistant Micrococcus MIS 102 even when the initial level of survivors was greater than 100 per ml. On the basis of this work, the high heat treatment rather than the low survivor level may have induced the prolonged lag. The present study was undertaken to de-termine the effect of heat on the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> ob-served on subculture of the surviving cells under conditions providing constant initial levels of inocula.

40|$|The <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> {{has been}} widely studied for years {{in an effort to}} {{contribute}} to the improvement of food safety. Many analytical models have been built and tested by several authors. The use of Individual-based Modelling (IbM) allows us to probe deeper into the behaviour of individual cells; it is a bridge between theories and experiments when needed. INDividual DIScrete SIMulation (INDISIM) has been developed and coded by our group as an IbM simulator and used to study bacterial growth, including the microscopic causes of the <b>lag</b> <b>phase.</b> First of all, the evolution of cellular masses, specifically the mean mass and biomass distribution, is shown to be a determining factor {{in the beginning of the}} exponential phase. Secondly, whenever there is a need for an enzyme synthesis, its rate has a direct effect on the lag duration. The variability of the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> with different factors is also studied. The known decrease of the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> with an increase in the temperature is also observed in the simulations. An initial study of the relationship between individual and collective <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> is presented, as a complement to the studies already published. One important result is the variability of the individual lag times and generation times. It has also been found that the mean of the individual lags is greater than the population lag. This is the first in a series of studies of the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> that we are carrying out. Therefore, the present work addresses a generic system by making a simple set of assumptions.
