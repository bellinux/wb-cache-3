5|$|The {{development}} of high-explosive shells made {{the use of}} iron armor plate on warships necessary. In 1859 France launched , the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had {{the profile of a}} ship of the <b>line,</b> <b>cut</b> to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys, Gloire was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor. Gloire prompted further innovation from the Royal Navy, anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.|$|E
5|$|When Angel {{was first}} opened, a long {{dead-end}} siding was provided for train stabling, converging {{from the left}} onto the northbound line {{just south of the}} station. This was retained over the years but eventually it was closed on 23 January 1959 (along with the signal box {{at the south end of}} the platform) to simplify through running. The siding lay derelict and unused until the rebuilding scheme. Part of the siding was used as the northbound diversion tunnel, which branched off the existing northbound <b>line,</b> <b>cut</b> through into the end of the siding and continued along it until it branched off left to the new northbound platform.|$|E
5|$|Only a rearguard of the Fourth Army was {{captured}} at Amman. The {{remainder of the}} garrison was already retreating northwards, following orders received from Liman von Sanders on 21 September, four days before Chaytor's attack. Those who had escaped by train, before the line was cut by Chaytor's Force during the night of 24/25 September, were forced to detrain south of Deraa. Here they found the railway <b>line</b> <b>cut</b> by Arab Sherifial forces. A retreating column of 3,000 infantry and cavalry, 300 horse transport and guns, and 600 camels was seen at Mafrak, withdrawing northwards from Amman {{in the early morning}} of 25 September. Ten Australian aircraft bombed Mafrak between 06:00 and 08:00. The railway station, a long train and several dumps were destroyed, and the railway was completely blocked. A number of trains continued to arrive at Mafrak from Amman during the day, but each was attacked by aircraft. No. 1 Squadron AFC bombed the area three times, dropping four tons of bombs and firing almost 20,000 machine gun rounds. The survivors were forced to abandon their wheeled-transport, and only a few thousand managed to escape on foot or horse towards Deraa and Damascus.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the railway had a {{dramatic}} impact on Sandvika. First of all is spurred the centralization of many commercial activities in Sandvika, with the subsequent increase to population. Secondly the <b>line</b> <b>cut</b> through the town. This creased a social divide, with workers and craftsmen settling north of the station, and the bourgeois settling on the south side, along the fjord. The railway also brought some tourism with people on day trips from Oslo.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s the {{operator}} of interstate freight, the National Rail Corporation, {{made the decision}} to divert Sydney- Perth traffic from the Blue Mountains section, to travel via the Main South line to Cootamundra, and then via the cross country line to Parkes. This resulted in reduced goods traffic and subsequent reduction of the line between Wallerawang and Tarana from double to single track. Significant flooding saw the <b>line</b> <b>cut</b> between Nyngan and Bourke in April 1989, and the army destroyed a section of track north of Nyngan to relieve flood waters surrounding the town. It was not financially viable to repair and maintain the line, and the line was thus abandoned between Nyngan and Bourke.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding the {{introduction}} of electric services, the Rickmansworth branch suffered {{in the face of}} the more direct services to London provided by the Metropolitan. Traffic was also eroded by the increased bus competition and private car ownership. Passenger services ceased in 1952 and most of the branch closed entirely in 1960 although track remained in place for a number of years afterwards. Rickmansworth (Church Street) railway station and the tracks leading to it continued to be used for goods services until 1967 when it was completely closed and the <b>line</b> <b>cut</b> back to one of the intermediate freight sidings.It served a papermill near Croxley Green between circa 1940 and circa 1984, as OS maps of the time show. Today the track has been removed and the platforms and station buildings have been demolished. A considerable length of the trackbed is now used as the Ebury Way Cycle Path.|$|E

25|$|The LIRR {{bought the}} {{steamboat}} Cleopatra from Cornelius Vanderbilt, then {{known for his}} ferry empire, to cover the Long Island Sound crossing, and began operating to Stonington, Connecticut on August 10. Vanderbilt {{was elected to the}} LIRR board of directors on November 26. The opening of the Cobble Hill Tunnel along the Brooklyn and Jamaica west of downtown Brooklyn on December 3, 1844 decreased the grade to the waterfront and allowed locomotives to run through to South Ferry, eliminating a horse car transfer. The LIRR began operating the Worcester and New Haven steamboats in 1845, and established a second route to Boston via steamboat to Allyn's Point and the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and Boston and Worcester Railroad. But competition from the Hartford and New Haven Railroad (completed 1844) and steamboats from New York caused the LIRR to sell the Worcester and Cleopatra to the N in July 1846, and the early 1847 completion of the Fall River <b>Line</b> <b>cut</b> into profits enough that the New Haven was sold to Jacob Vanderbilt, ending Boston express service.|$|E

500|$|DeForest Kelley {{returns as}} Leonard McCoy, {{doctor and the}} carrier of Spock's living spirit. Kelley has the {{majority}} of the film's memorable scenes, but admitted to occasional difficulties in acting with and being directed by his longtime co-star. However, he has declared that he had no doubts about Nimoy's ability to direct the film. Responding to suggestions that Star Trek copied Star Wars, Kelley asserted that the opposite was true. Playing the other crew members are James Doohan, as Montgomery Scott, the chief engineer; George Takei, as Hikaru Sulu, Enterprises helmsman; Walter Koenig, as Pavel Chekov, navigation and acting science officer; and Nichelle Nichols, as Uhura, the ship's communications officer. Nichols had always insisted on wearing a skirt; although the standard female uniform used trousers, the costume designer created a skirted version specifically for her. Takei was dismayed to hear that his character was called [...] "Tiny" [...] by a guard at McCoy's cell during the film, and argued with the film's producer to have the <b>line</b> <b>cut.</b> When Takei saw the first screening of the film, he changed his mind and promptly apologized.

500|$|At the Twenty-Second Congress of the CPSU in October {{that year}} Khrushchev openly {{attacked}} the Albanian leadership, proclaiming Hoxha a [...] "leftist nationalist deviationist" [...] {{and calling for}} his overthrow, declaring that, [...] "We are certain the time will come when the Albanian communists and the Albanian people will have their say, and then the Albanian leaders will have to answer for the harm they have done their country, their people {{and the cause of}} socialist construction in Albania." [...] He further stated that [...] "The imperialists are always prepared to pay thirty pieces of silver to those who split the Communist ranks." [...] To this Hoxha replied in a November 7 speech, [...] "the Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver'... They would rather die honourably on their feet than live in shame on their knees." [...] Nicholas C. Pano noted that [...] " [...] pronouncements , at least insofar as the Soviet leadership was concerned, had made the policies of de-Stalinization, peaceful coexistence, and reconciliation with Yugoslavia adopted at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU binding upon the members of the communist system." [...] Despite Albanian calls for the continued existence of state relations between the two countries, the Soviet government formally withdrew its ambassador on November 25 and on December 3 withdrew [...] "the whole personnel of its embassy and commercial representation from the PRA, {{while at the same time}} demanding that the personnel of the Albanian embassy and the Albanian commercial adviser should leave the territory of the Soviet Union." [...] "Thus," [...] the Albanian account continues, [...] "the Khrushchev revisionist group, consistent in its <b>line,</b> <b>cut</b> off all relations with socialist Albania at a time when it maintained contacts with and was drawing ever closer to the most reactionary regimes of the world." ...|$|E

5000|$|Multipatterning for {{advanced}} nodes is already underway. There are two styles being used. Pitch splitting such as LELELE triple patterning is preferred for bidirectional layouts, but {{is harder to}} scale. Spacer-based patterning makes use of 1D-type layouts, but requires additional masks for cutting. <b>Cutting</b> <b>lines</b> to form irregular patterns uses {{the maximum number of}} masks. However, minimum pitch <b>lines</b> with dense <b>cut</b> locations contribute to higher capacitance by adding more locations and more area of minimum spacing. 2D patterning is generally preferred, but requires sufficient exposed feature pitch, followed by sufficient splitting or division of the pitch. On the other hand, LELE, LELELE, and SADP (SID) can avoid <b>line</b> <b>cuts,</b> while SATP or SAQP with grid routing can minimize <b>line</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The second {{portion of}} {{what became the}} North Auckland Line was built as a {{temporary}} measure. [...] Timber interests around the Kaipara Harbour had poor access to markets in Auckland, so accordingly, a line was built overland from the Kaipara to a wharf in Riverhead for transshipment. [...] The Auckland Provincial Council began construction on 31 August 1871, but on 1 January 1872, the central government took over work. Due to delays with acquiring rails, construction was delayed and the line did not open until 29 October 1875. [...] The section from {{the shores of the}} Kaipara at a station named Helensville South to Kumeu became part of the North Auckland Line; the rest to Riverhead became a branch. [...] This brief <b>line</b> <b>cut</b> transport costs and time in comparison to a bullock team or lengthy coastal shipping.|$|E
2500|$|In 1866 the B began {{constructing}} the Metropolitan Branch west out of Washington, and {{was completed in}} 1873 after years of erratic effort. Before this line was laid, rail traffic west of Washington had to travel first to Relay or Baltimore before joining the main line. The <b>line</b> <b>cut</b> {{a more or less}} straight line from Washington to Point of Rocks, Maryland, with many grades and large bridges. Upon the opening of this line, through passenger traffic was rerouted through Washington, and the Old Main Line from Point of Rocks to Relay was reduced to secondary status as far as passenger service was concerned. The Washington to Gaithersburg section of the Met Branch was double-tracked during 1886–1893. Rebuilding in the early 20th century and complete double tracking of the branch by 1928 increased capacity; the [...] "branches" [...] became the de facto mainline, though the Old Main Line was retained as a relief route.|$|E

Understandably, Papen vehemently objected to being taken into custody, but he later came to the realization that Göring had indeed saved his life.|$|E
