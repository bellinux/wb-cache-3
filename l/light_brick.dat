25|$|The seven-story Masonic Temple Building was {{designed}} by South Carolina architect Charles McMillan and built by Carolina Construction Co. Upon completion, the building was praised for its innovative construction due {{to the use of}} reinforced concrete, a new concept in building materials.

The rest of the building consists of <b>light</b> <b>brick</b> ornamented with terra cotta.|$|E
500|$|Early wooden domes {{are known}} {{only from a}} {{literary}} source, {{but the use of}} wooden formwork, concrete, and unskilled labor enabled domes of monumental size in the late Republic and early Imperial period, such as the so-called [...] "Temple of Mercury" [...] bath hall at Baiae. Nero introduced the dome into Roman palace architecture in the 1st century and such rooms served as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. The Pantheon's dome, the largest and most famous example, was built of concrete in the 2nd century and may have served as an audience hall for Hadrian. Imperial mausolea, such as the Mausoleum of Diocletian, were domed beginning in the 3rd century. Some smaller domes were built with a technique of using ceramic tubes in place of a wooden centering for concrete, or as a permanent structure embedded in the concrete, but <b>light</b> <b>brick</b> became the preferred building material {{over the course of the}} 4th and 5th centuries. Brick ribs allowed for a thinner structure and facilitated the use of windows in the supporting walls, replacing the need for an oculus as a light source.|$|E

50|$|The 1980 train catalog enticed Lego {{fans with}} {{nighttime}} dioramas featuring lampposts and lights inside the trains. Even though <b>light</b> <b>bricks</b> {{of the same}} size were available in both 12-volt and 4.5-volt guise, the train headlight/taillight (using unique prisms and holder bricks) and lamppost sets were normally only available with the expensive 12-volt <b>light</b> <b>bricks</b> included. Making these theoretically universal features available only as 12-volt items served to further elevate the 12-volt system away from the more limited 4.5-volt system.|$|R

2500|$|Saint Cecilia Conservatory of Music was {{designed}} by Oscar D. Bohlen and constructed between 1911 and 1913, {{the same time as}} Guerin Hall. The Conservatory is located [...] "on the site of the second Saint Mary-of-the-Woods village church and cemetery." [...] The three-story, Italian Renaissance Revival-style Conservatory was constructed of <b>light</b> <b>brick</b> and Bedford limestone. It has Ionic details and Beaux-Arts influences. The Conservatory was dedicated along with Guerin Hall on October 12, 1913, and contained music studios, practice rooms, classrooms, and offices. Cecilian Auditorium, which [...] "seats up to 720 people on the main floor and balcony", provides a theatrical space that includes a proscenium stage and theatrical lighting.|$|E
6000|$|... § XIX. I {{stated that}} the {{building}} was, for the most part, composed of yellow brick. This yellow is very nearly pure, much more positive and somewhat darker than that of our English <b>light</b> <b>brick,</b> and the material of the brick is very good and hard, looking, in places, almost vitrified, and so compact as to resemble stone. Together with this brick occurs another of a deep full red, and more porous substance, which is used for decoration chiefly, while all the parts requiring strength are composed of the yellow brick. Both these materials are cast into any shape and size the builder required, either into curved pieces for the arches, or flat tiles for filling the triangles; and, what is still more curious, {{the thickness of the}} yellow bricks used for the walls varies considerably, from two inches to four; and their length also, some of the larger pieces used in important positions being {{a foot and a half}} long.|$|E

40|$|Utilization {{of waste}} {{materials}} {{in the production of}} burnt clay bricks can behelpful in reducing the landfill burden. This study aims to develop lighterand eco-friendly burnt clay bricks incorporating sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA). Clay bricks were manufactured in a local brick manufacturing industrial kiln,incorporating SBA by weight of clay in different proportions. To study the properties of bricks, differentmechanical and durability tests were performed as per ASTM C 67. Results showedthat SBA can be helpful in manufacturing of <b>lighter</b> <b>bricks.</b> Bricks incorporating SBA exhibit compressive strength lesser than traditional clay bricks; however, burnt clay bricks incorporating 5 % SBA by clay weight fulfilled the minimum requirement for compressive strength according to the Building code of Pakistan. Moreover, efflorescence was improved after adding the SBA in burnt clay <b>bricks.</b> Therefore, <b>lighter</b> and sustainable <b>bricks</b> can be produced after utilization of small amount of SBA (i. e., 5 %) in burnt clay bricks...|$|R
