5000|$|Logistics Support Analysis was codified into a {{military}} standard in 1973 {{with the publication}} of Military Standard 1388-1. <b>Logistic</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Analysis</b> (LSA) guidelines and requirements were established by Department of Defense (DOD) Instruction 5000.2, Major System Acquisition Procedures, and DOD Directive 5000.39, Acquisition and Management of Integrated Logistic Support for Systems and Equipment, to create a single, uniform approach by the Military Services to improve supportability of military weapon systems through a disciplined approach to defining the required operational support other Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) objectives during the acquisition development phase. 1388-1A was updated in 1983 and 1991 before being downgraded from a standard to a best practice on 26 November 1996. 1388-2A was updated in 1991 and 1993, and was also cancelled as a standard in 1996. [...] The definitions for the database records of LSA were established by the Logistics Support Analysis Record, MIL-STD-1388-2A, on 20 JULY 84.|$|E

Pop et al. (1998) studied 583 perimenopausal women randomly selected from a community cohort in the Netherlands. Depression (defined as a score of 12 or higher in the self-rating Edinburgh Depression Scale) was found in 134 cases (23  %) and AbTPO in 58 cases (10  %). Multiple <b>logistic</b> regression <b>analysis</b> <b>supported</b> an association between positive AbTPO and depression (odds ratio 3.0; 95  % confidence interval 1.3 – 6.8).|$|R

In order to integrate such methodologies inside the actual ILS (Integrated Logistic Support) process, new database parameters and stress/failure physics categorization classes needs to be defined. This article discusses this problematic and proposes some extensions of the ASD S 3000 L LSA data model...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the domain}} of {{software}} engineering, capability sustainment equates {{to the ability to}} continually implement and field modifications within required timescales on an affordable basis. However the unique nature of software means that support analysis cannot be performed using traditional hardware oriented <b>Logistic</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Analysis</b> (LSA) techniques. Software LSA guidance provided within Defence Standard 00 - 60 is inappropriate and incomplete, which has lead to software related supportability decisions becoming ill-informed, unjustified and untraceable. As a result of this, the MOD has increased its exposure to contractor exploitation during system support activities. This project, based on a case study of LSA applied to the Royal Air Force’s Future Offensive Air System project, identifies significant inadequacies in the guidance covering the application of LSA to software and suggests more appropriate approaches and techniques for the purpose of maturing the software LSA process, improving capability sustainment, and reducing the through life cost of support...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{the present}} work, a {{mechanical}} valve which got its application in many fields of engineering is designed by Design for Reliability (DFR) technique. This technique is used at different phases of new product development life cycle (NPDLC). In {{order to improve}} reliability of a system, {{the design of the}} system has been analysing for its potential Failure modes and its effects on the total system. The design of mechanical valve is started with the concept of Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) which is done by using MIL-STD 1629 A Method. Along with increase in performance and Reliability on an assembly, the results are also useful to the manufacturer, designer and maintenance engineer for the evaluation of other criteria like maintainability, safety analysis, survivability and vulnerability, <b>logistic</b> <b>support</b> <b>analysis,</b> maintenance plan analysis for preventive maintenance, warranty estimation, failure detection and isolation subsystem design, cost estimation, ease of design, availability of technology and availability of resources for selecting the final concept before initiating the actual design and prototype for the mechanical assembly...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{literature}} suggests that victim-offender relationship and motive are two primary characteristics that have traditionally been used to disaggregate homicide events. Previous research has clearly identified normative homicide characteristics as expressive motives between intimates and instrumental motives between strangers. However, the present research examines the prevalence of deviant homicides, or homicides with nonnormative characteristics, in Chicago. The authors test the hypothesis that deviant homicides are more likely among individuals with weak ties to social institutions. Results of a <b>logistic</b> regression <b>analysis</b> <b>support</b> {{the hypothesis that the}} likelihood of deviant circumstances is significantly greater when homicides involve Hispanics, African Americans, and males. In addition, deviant homicides were significantly more likely when they involved gang circumstances and, on the national level, after the appearance of crack cocaine. These findings have important implications to the explanatory power of criminological theory...|$|R
