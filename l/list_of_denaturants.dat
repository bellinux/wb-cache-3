40|$|Guanidine-stable chymoelastase (GUSCE), a {{component}} of the protease mixture known as Pronase, {{has been shown to be}} stable and active under conditions which denature and inactivate most proteins. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant,</b> this enzyme has shown proteolytic specificity for phenylalanyl, tyrosyl, and leucyl peptide bonds. In the presence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant,</b> however, the cleavage specificity has not been defined. In order to determine the effects <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> on the cleavage specificity of GUSCE, six small peptides of known amino acid sequence were hydrolyzed by GUSCE in the presence and absence of 6. OM guanidinium chloride. The site of GUSCE cleavage was acertained by dansylation of the new N-terminal amino acids, which were produced by proteolysis, followed by thin layer chromatographic identification of the resulting dansylated amino acids. The results indicate that GUSCE catalyzed the hydrolysis of phenylalanyl and tyrosyl peptide bonds in the absence as well as the presence of 6. OM guanidinium chloride. Of the tyrosyl and phenylalanyl peptide bonds hydrolyzed, all were between non-terminal amino acids, which illistrates the endo-peptidase characteristics of GUSCE. With one exception, only those peptide bonds cleaved by GUSCE in the absence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> were cleaved in the presence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant.</b> In the case of oxytocin, the presence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> was actually required for the cleavage of the Tyr(2) -Ile(3) peptide bond. The demonstrated predictablilty of GUSCE cleavage in the presence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> should greatly enhance its utility in the sitespecific proteolysis of insoluble or otherwise proteolysisresistant protein substrates.

40|$|We {{present a}} lattice Monte Carlo study {{to examine the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>denaturants</b> on the folding rates of {{simplified}} models of proteins. The two-dimensional model is made from a three-letter code mimicking the presence of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and cysteine residues. We show {{that the rate of}} folding is maximum when the effective hydrophobic interaction epsilon H is approximately equal to the free energy gain epsilon S upon forming disulfide bonds. In the range 1 < or = epsilon H/ epsilon S < or = 3, multiple paths that connect several intermediates to the native state lead to fast folding. It is shown that at a fixed temperature and epsilon S the folding rate increases as epsilon H decreases. An approximate model is used to show that epsilon H should decrease {{as a function of the}} concentration <b>of</b> <b>denaturants</b> such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride. Our simulation results, in conjunction with this model, are used to show that increasing the concentration <b>of</b> <b>denaturants</b> can lead to an increase in folding rates. This occurs because denaturants can destabilize the intermediates without significantly altering the energy of the native conformation. Our findings are compared with experiments on the effects <b>of</b> <b>denaturants</b> on the refolding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and ribonuclease T 1. We also argue that the phenomenon of denaturant-enhanced folding of proteins should be general...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the behavior of}} a polypeptide consisting of the genetic fusion of a structurally stable single-domain protein, EGFP (an analog of the green fluorescent protein) with an amyloidogenic sequence, retroCspA (known to readily form amyloid fibrils). Refolding of the fusion protein through single-step removal <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> and salt results in precipitation into amyloid aggregates displaying fibrillar morphology, thioflavin T binding as well as green fluorescence. Refolding through step-wise reduction <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> concentration in the presence of salt yields a soluble aggregate containing a folded, thermally-stable, non-fluorescent EGFP domain. Together, these results indicate that retroCspA forces the fusion protein to aggregate; however, the EGFP domain remains folded in a native-like structural format in both soluble aggregates and precipitates...|$|R

With single-molecule FRET, this question can be addressed even under near-native conditions, where most molecules are folded, allowing us to probe a wide range <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> concentrations and temperatures. We find a compaction of the unfolded state of a small cold shock protein with increasing temperature in both the presence and the absence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant,</b> with good agreement between the results from single-molecule FRET and dynamic light scattering. Although dissociation <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> from the polypeptide chain with increasing temperature accounts for part of the compaction, the results indicate an important role for additional temperature-dependent interactions within the unfolded chain. The observation of a collapse of a similar extent in the extremely hydrophilic, intrinsically disordered protein prothymosin Î± suggests that the hydrophobic effect is not the sole source of the underlying interactions. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water show changes in secondary structure content with increasing temperature and suggest a contribution of intramolecular hydrogen bonding to unfolded state collapse...|$|R

This intermediate has a 70 % native secondary structure, binds less 8 -anilinonaphthalene- 1 -sulphonic acid than the native dimer {{and has a}} sedimentation coefficient of 4. 24 +/- 0. 15. The variations of free energy in the absence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> [DeltaG(H(2) O) ] and its coefficients of urea dependence (m), calculated by the linear extrapolation model, were 36. 15 +/- 2. 3 kJ. mol(- 1) and 19. 87 +/- 0. 71 kJ. mol(- 1).

Analysis of the calculated thermodynamical parameters indicate the instability of the dimer in the presence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant,</b> and that the major exposure to the solvent is due to dimer dissociation.

Here, we use this technique to investigate contact formation in the denatured state of CspTm, a small cold-shock protein from Thermotoga maritima, engineered to contain a single trypto-phan residue (W 29) and a single cysteine residue at the C terminus (C 67). At all concentrations <b>of</b> <b>denaturant,</b> the decay rate of the W 29 triplet of the unfolded protein is more than tenfold faster than the rate observed for the native protein (, 104 s 21). Experiments on the unfolded protein without the added C-terminal cysteine residue show that this fas-ter rate results entirely from contact quenching by C 67.

Such a negative activation volume can be accounted for by a decrease in volume resulting from the dehydration of hydrophobic groups, primarily the heme group. Dehydration, which increases the entropy of the protein system, compensates for a decrease in the entropy accompanying the formation of the more compact and ordered transition state. We, therefore, propose that the positive change in the activation entropy for the folding reaction is due to the dehydration of hydrophobic groups. Furthermore, dehydration entropically promotes the protein folding reaction...|$|R

Even upon a jump to strongly native conditions, neither ubiquitin nor common-type acyl-phosphatase contract {{prior to the}} major folding event. Circular dichroism and fluorescence indicate that negligible amounts of secondary and tertiary structures form in the burst phase.

We have applied the procedure of measuring the effects <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> on the H/ 2 H-exchange of amide protons of barnase, the folding pathway of which is well established. ResultsThe addition of relatively low concentrations <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> causes the mechanism of exchange of amide protons of barnase to change from EX 2 to EX 1 for the residues that require global unfolding for exchange to occur. This change of mechanism, which would have been missed by some of the standard tests, causes artefacts that could be easily misinterpreted. We also present the thermodynamic argument that measurements at equilibrium cannot give the order of events in folding.

40|$|Chemical denaturants are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used agents for unfolding proteins and are thought to act by better solvating the unfolded state. Improved solvation is expected to lead to an expansion of unfolded chains with increasing denaturant concentration, providing a sensitive probe <b>of</b> the <b>denaturant</b> action. However, experiments have so far yielded qualitatively different results concerning the effects of chemical denaturation. Studies using FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and other methods found an increase in radius <b>of</b> gyration with <b>denaturant</b> concentration, but most small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies found no change. This discrepancy therefore challenges our understanding of denaturation mechanism and more generally the accuracy of these experiments as applied to unfolded or disordered proteins. Here, we use all-atom molecular simulations to investigate the effect of urea and guanidinium chloride on the structure of the intrinsically disordered protein ACTR, which can be studied by experiment over a wide range <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> concentration. Using unbiased molecular simulations with a carefully calibrated denaturant model, we find that the protein chain indeed swells with increasing denaturant concentration. This is due to the favorable association of urea or guanidinium chloride with the backbone of all residues and with the side-chains of almost all residues, with denaturant-water transfer free energies inferred from this association in reasonable accord with experimental estimates. Interactions <b>of</b> the <b>denaturants</b> with the backbone are dominated by hydrogen bonding, while interactions with side-chains include other contributions. By computing FRET efficiencies and SAXS intensities at each denaturant concentration, we show that the simulation trajectories are in accord with both experiments on this protein, demonstrating that there is no fundamental inconsistency between the two types of experiment. Agreement with experiment also supports the picture of chemical denaturation described in our simulations, driven by weak association <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> with the protein. Our simulations support some assumptions needed for each experiment to accurately reflect changes in protein size, namely, that the commonly used FRET chromophores do not qualitatively alter the results and that possible effects such as preferential solvent partitioning into the interior of the chain do not interfere with the determination of radius of gyration from the SAXS experiments...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to improve our {{understanding}} of the properties of the free energy barriers in protein folding. We used the small all-[beta]-sheet protein tendamistat as a model protein. Tendamistat contains two disulfide bridges and folds and unfolds in apparent two-state reactions. However, previous studies on disulfide variants demonstrated that tendamistat folds in at least two sequential steps with a high-energy intermediate. Elucidation of the properties of the free energy barriers by studying different tendamistat variants and various fragments provide a good insight into the underlying complexity of apparent two state folders. To obtain this information several approaches have been used in this work: we studied the combined influence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant,</b> temperature, structural variation and sodium sulfate on folding and stability; furthermore, we analysed the properties and stability of different fragments of tendamistat. Multiple perturbation analysis was used to gain information on the shape of the free energy barriers in tendamistat folding. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> and temperature as perturbations revealed transition state movement according to the Hammond postulate. Hammond behaviour is more pronounced in the early transition state compared to the late transition state where only small transition state movement was observed. The results suggest that the early transition state is rather broad compared to the late transition state. These results emphasized the importance of multiple perturbation analysis to test the shape of the free energy barriers in protein folding. Determination of the activation parameters revealed less difference between both transition states. However, the <b>denaturant</b> dependence <b>of</b> the activation parameters of the transition states differs significantly. The results confirm our previous suggestion that the early transition state is broad and structurally less well defined, whereas the late transition state shows a rather narrow and structurally well-defined maximum.

A major problem is the difficulty in collecting kinetic data, which are crucial to understanding any reaction.

Our analyses show that the major unfolding step in the SDS-induced denaturation of bacteriorhodopsin involves a reduction in Î±-helical structure and proceeds with a large free-energy change; both our equilibrium and kinetic measurements predict that the free energy of unfolding in the absence <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> is + 20 kcalÂ·molâ 1, with an associated m-value of 25 kcalÂ·molâ 1.

40|$|The time-resolved {{fluorescence}} decay and anisotropy of Cu/Zn human superoxide dismutase (HSOD) were studied {{as a function}} <b>of</b> temperature and <b>denaturant</b> concentration. In addition, circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on HSOD as a function <b>of</b> <b>denaturant</b> concentration in the amide and aromatic regions. The time-resolved {{fluorescence decay}} results reveal the existence of structural microheterogeneity in HSOD. Furthermore, CD measurements and a global analysis decomposition of the time-resolved fluorescence decay over denaturant concentration shows {{the presence of an}} intermediate in the unfolding of HSOD by guanidinium hydrochloride. Considering our previous measurements of partially denatured HSOD as a function of protein concentration (Mei et al., Biochemistry 31 (1992) 7224 - 7230), our results strongly suggest that the unfolding intermediate is a monomer that displays a molten globule state.
