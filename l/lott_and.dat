The guest judges were Geri Halliwell, Natalie Imbruglia, Katy Perry, Pixie <b>Lott</b> <b>and</b> Nicole Scherzinger. On 11 June, Minogue was confirmed by ITV to return for the judges' houses stage.

5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball first {{to begin the}} game, and returned the opening kickoff to their own 24-yard line. They were unable to move the ball in threeplays, and punted the ball to Connecticut. The Huskies took possession on their own 18-yard line and drove down the field with alternating rushes by running back Donald Brown and quarterback Tyler Lorenzen, earning two first downs. On 2nddownand5 from the UConn 49-yard line, Lorenzen was sacked by Buffalo's Sherrod <b>Lott</b> <b>and</b> fumbled; the ball was recovered by UConn right tackle Mike Hicks, allowing the Huskies to retain possession. A holding penalty on the next play called on UConn left tackle William Beatty set up 3rd-and-24.

5|$|The San Francisco 49ers {{matched the}} Giants {{with their own}} 10–0 start in the 1990 season. Although both teams lost in week 12 to stand at 10–1, their week 13 matchup was still highly anticipated. The game took place in front of 66,092 fans at Candlestick Park. The 49ers scored the only {{touchdown}} {{of the game in}} the second quarter on a 23-yard pass from Joe Montana to John Taylor. With four minutes left, they stopped the Giants on four passes from the 49ers' 9-yard line and went on to win, 7–3, after which 49ers safety Ronnie <b>Lott</b> <b>and</b> Simms had a heated verbal exchange. The Giants defense performed well in the loss. They held the 49ers to 152 passing yards, 88 rushing yards, and limited All-Pro Wide receiver Jerry Rice to one reception for 13yards. 49ers defensive end Charles Haley recorded five tackles, 1.5 sacks, and two forced fumbles in the victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} was split into several stages: auditions, bootcamp, judges' houses and live shows. Auditions took place throughout June and July 2010, with Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Cheryl Cole returning as judges. Minogue missed the auditions and bootcamp due to being on maternity leave, so Geri Halliwell, Natalie Imbruglia, Katy Perry, Pixie <b>Lott</b> <b>and</b> Nicole Scherzinger {{were brought in}} as guest judges. Cole missed the auditions in Manchester and bootcamp because she had malaria. Following bootcamp, successful acts were split into four categories: Boys (male soloists aged 16 to 28), Girls (female soloists aged 16 to 28), Over 28s (soloists aged 29 and over) and Groups. Minogue and Cole returned for the judges' houses stage, and each judge mentored eight acts through judges' houses. The live shows started on 9 October 2010. Four acts eliminated at judges' houses were brought back as wildcards, making this the first series to have 16 acts perform in the live shows.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing tennis}} {{he took up}} {{volunteer}} coaching, training French children in Paris every Sunday. In the sixth straight United States–France Davis Cup final the American team had a great start thanks to Bill Tilden, who handed Borotra the first loss of the tie. Cochet equalized against George Lott, winning in straight sets. In the doubles Cochet—Brugnon were selected to compete against Wimbledon champions John van Ryn and Wilmer Allison. Contrary to expectations it was Borotra who was the engine of the French pair. He won every service game, except for the third set where Cochet {{made a lot of}} errors at the net, and the French pair took the victory. Borotra thrilled the French spectators by beating <b>Lott</b> <b>and</b> keeping the Cup in France for another year. The dead rubber between Cochet and Tilden was won by the former. At {{the end of the year}} Cochet was ranked number one by Wallis Myers and Pierre Gillou but came second in the unofficial list of Bill Tilden behind Borotra.|$|E

5|$|After these losses Cochet {{took two}} weeks off to recover. Despite {{the rest in}} the 1931 Wimbledon Championships he shocked the tennis world by losing {{in the very first}} round to Nigel Sharpe. In the mixed doubles Cochet and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall were not more successful, falling in the fourth round. The doubles final {{remained}} unconquered for Brugnon and Cochet as the team of George <b>Lott</b> <b>and</b> John Van Ryn came back from 3–2 down in the fifth set to win the match. In July the Four Musketeers were ready to be challenged for the fifth time in the Davis Cup final. This time the opponent was the British Davis Cup team. In the first rubber Cochet was facing two set points for a two sets-love lead by Bunny Austin but fought back to claim the second set and won the next two for the match. Fred Perry battled through Borotra while the doubles were won by Cochet and Brugnon. Austin brought back the British hopes after a four set victory over the exhausted Borotra. The match was suspended multiple times due to rain, which made the court almost unsuitable for playing, which left its mark on the deciding rubber between Cochet and Perry. The recurring slight rain in the first set led Perry to drop the set from a 4–1 advantage. The second set went to Perry after he utilized passing shots as a counter for Cochet's net play. The third and fourth set however were taken by Cochet which gave the French team its fifth successive Davis Cup.|$|E

25|$|M. lottorum {{was first}} {{described}} and named by Axel Hungerbühler, Bill Mueller, Sankar Chatterjee and Douglas P. Cunningham in 2013.

It is known from two complete skulls, the holotype TTU-P10076 and the paratype TTU-P10077 housed at Texas Tech University. The skulls were collected at Patricia Site (TTU Vertebrate Paleontology Locality 3870), 13km South of Post, Garza County of west Texas, from the upper unit of the Norian Cooper Canyon Formation, Dockum Group. Other vertebrates known from this site include TTU-P10074, a partial skull referred to Machaeroprosopus sp., a phytosaur postcranial skeleton, fish, a temnospondyl amphibian, Typothorax, Postosuchus, Shuvosaurus and a theropod dinosaur.|$|E

The sole exception was Maine's 2nd congressional district. Of the forecasters who published results on the district, the Times gave Trump a 64% chance of winning and PredictWise a 52% chance, FiveThirtyEight gave Clinton a 51% chance of winning in polls-only and 54% in polls-plus, Princeton gave her a 60% chance, Cook labelled it a toss-up, and Sabato leaned it towards Trump.
