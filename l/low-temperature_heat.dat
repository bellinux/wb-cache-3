25|$|When a uranium nucleus fissions {{into two}} {{daughter}} nuclei fragments, about 0.1 {{percent of the}} mass of the uranium nucleus appears as the fission energy of ~200MeV. For uranium-235 (total mean fission energy 202.5MeV), typically ~169MeV appears as the kinetic energy of the daughter nuclei, which fly apart at about 3% of the speed of light, due to Coulomb repulsion. Also, an average of 2.5neutrons are emitted, with a mean kinetic energy per neutron of ~2MeV (total of 4.8MeV). The fission reaction also releases ~7MeV in prompt gamma ray photons. The latter figure means that a nuclear fission explosion or criticality accident emits about 3.5% of its energy as gamma rays, less than 2.5% of its energy as fast neutrons (total of both types of radiation ~ 6%), and the rest as kinetic energy of fission fragments (this appears almost immediately when the fragments impact surrounding matter, as simple heat). In an atomic bomb, this heat may serve to raise the temperature of the bomb core to 100million kelvin and cause secondary emission of soft X-rays, which convert some of this energy to ionizing radiation. However, in nuclear reactors, the fission fragment kinetic energy remains as <b>low-temperature</b> <b>heat,</b> which itself causes little or no ionization.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the global}} trends of rising energy demand and the {{increasing}} utilization of low-grade renewable energy, <b>low-temperature</b> <b>heating</b> systems can play key roles in improving building energy efficiency while providing a comfortable indoor environment. To meet the need to retrofit existing buildings in Nordic countries for greater energy efficiency, this study focused on human subjects’ thermal sensation, thermal comfort, thermal acceptability, draft acceptability, and perceived air quality when three <b>low-temperature</b> <b>heating</b> systems were used: conventional radiator, ventilation radiator, or floor heating with exhaust ventilation. Human subject tests were {{carried out in the}} climate chamber at the Technical University of Denmark. In total, 24 human subjects, 12 females and 12 males, participated in the tests during the winter season. The results show that no significant differences in thermal sensation and thermal comfort between the three heating systems. Ventilation radiator promised a comfortable indoor environment with a decreased water supply temperature and floor heating with exhaust ventilation can provide a basic thermal comfort level. Thermal acceptability and draft acceptability show variations in different heating systems. Gender has significant influences on thermal sensation, draft acceptability, and preference of clo values. Personal thermal preference is observed between males and females. The males prefer to dress lighter than the females, but both can get the same thermal comfort level. It is concluded that <b>low-temperature</b> <b>heating</b> systems using exhaust air ventilation are a potentially solution when buildings are being retrofitted for improved energy efficiency and comfort of the occupants...|$|R

However, it also does not involve the release of any radioactive material from the rocket, unlike open cycle designs which would cause nuclear fallout if used in a planetary atmosphere (e.g. Project Orion).

These energy forms typically include some combination of: heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, mechanical energy and electric power. Often, these additional forms of energy are produced by a heat engine, running on a source of high-temperature heat.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} new buildings with <b>low-temperature</b> <b>heating</b> systems in terms of energy consumption and thermal comfort, and to pay some attention to energy savings and indoor air quality. To reach this aim, on-site measurements as well as building energy simulations using IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (ICE) 4 were performed. Results show that the investigated buildings with <b>low-temperature</b> <b>heating</b> system could meet the energy requirements of Swedish regulations in BBR (Boverkets byggregler), {{as well as provide}} a good level of thermal comfort. Implementing variable air volume ventilation instead of constant flow, i. e. decreasing the ventilation air from 0. 35 to 0. 10 l·s- 1 ·m- 2 during the whole unoccupancy (10 hours), gave up to 23 % energy savings for heating the ventilation air. However, the indoor air quality was not acceptable because VOC (volatile organic compound) concentration was slightly above the acceptable range for one hour after occupants arrive home. So, in order to create acceptable indoor air quality a return back to the normal ventilation requirements was suggested to take place two hours before the home was occupied. This gave 20 % savings for ventilation heating. The results of this study are in line with the European Union 20 - 20 - 20 goal to increase the efficiency of buildings by 20 % to the year 2020.

5000|$|A thermo{{galvanic}} cell {{is a kind}} of {{galvanic cell}} in which heat is employed to provide electrical power directly. These cells are electrochemical cells in which the two electrodes are deliberately maintained at different temperatures. This temperature difference generates a potential difference between the electrodes. The electrodes can be of identical composition and the electrolyte solution homogeneous. This is usually the case in these cells. This is in contrast to galvanic cells in which electrodes and/or solutions of different composition provide the electromotive potential. As long as there is a difference in temperature between the electrodes a current will flow through the circuit. A thermogalvanic cell can be seen as analogous to a concentration cell but instead of running on differences in the concentration/pressure of the reactants they make use of differences in the [...] "concentrations" [...] of thermal energy. The principal application of thermogalvanic cells is the production of electricity from <b>low-temperature</b> <b>heat</b> sources (waste heat and solar heat). Their energetic efficiency is low, in the range of 0.1% to 1% for conversion of heat into electricity.|$|E
