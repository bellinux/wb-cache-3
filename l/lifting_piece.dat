50|$|The show takes guests through {{demonstrations of}} the design of Universal Pictures films special effects, which are added during a films post-production. It {{includes}} interactive elements, and {{is similar to the}} original former Special Effects Stages version of the attraction. The live attraction has two hosts: an older, practical effects guru and a younger, digital effects artist. It <b>lifts</b> <b>pieces</b> from Universals Horror Make-Up Show at Universal Studios Florida.|$|R
60|$|Nobody was visible; {{but ever}} and anon a whitish {{something}} moved above the bank from behind, and vanished again. This {{was a small}} human hand, {{in the act of}} <b>lifting</b> <b>pieces</b> of fuel into the fire; but for all that could be seen the hand, like that which troubled Belshazzar, was there alone. Occasionally an ember rolled off the bank, and dropped with a hiss into the pool.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Lifted {{inference}} {{approaches have}} rendered large, previously intractable probabilistic inference problems quickly solvable by employing symmetries to handle whole sets of indistinguishable random variables. Still, in many {{if not most}} situations training relational models will not benefit from lifting: symmetries within models easily break since variables become correlated by virtue of depending asymmetrically on evidence. An appealing idea for such situations is to train and recombine local models. This breaks long-range dependencies and allows to exploit lifting within and across the local training tasks. Moreover, it naturally paves the way for online training for relational models. Specifically, we develop the first lifted stochastic gradient optimization method with gain vector adaptation, which processes each <b>lifted</b> <b>piece</b> one after the other. On several datasets, the resulting optimizer converges to the same quality solution over {{an order of magnitude}} faster, simply because unlike batch training it starts optimizing long before having seen the entire mega-example even once. ...|$|R

50|$|Obstetrical hooks: A common {{instrument}} used by Roman and Greek doctors. There were two basic types of hooks: sharp hooks and blunt hooks. Blunt hooks were used primarily as probes for dissection and for raising blood vessels.

6000|$|They went, a merry party. The canal was weedy, {{with only}} a few inches of water at the shallows, and so they went in three Canadian canoes. Kipps had learned to paddle--it had been his first {{athletic}} accomplishment, and his second--with {{the last three or four}} of ten private lessons still to come--was to be cycling. But Kipps did not paddle at all badly; muscles hardened by <b>lifting</b> <b>pieces</b> of cretonne could cut a respectable figure by the side of Coote's executions, and the girl with the freckles, the girl who understood him, came in his canoe. They raced the Walshinghams, brother and sister; and Coote, in a liquefying state and blowing mightily, but still persistent and always quite polite and considerate, toiled behind with Mrs. Walshingham. She could not be expected to paddle (though, of course, she [...] "offered") and she reclined upon specially adjusted cushions under a black and white sunshade and watched Kipps and her daughter, and feared at intervals that Coote was getting hot.|$|R

5|$|Construction on Intimidator began {{during the}} summer of 2009 with land {{clearing}} and footings being constructed. Track pieces first began to arrive at Carowinds on August 7, 2009. About 3 weeks later, Intimidator was officially announced on August 26, 2009 by Carowinds. Along with the announcement, Carowinds reached a licensing agreement with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to utilize the Dale Earnhardt brand as part of the ride. One of Earnhardt's sons, Kerry Earnhardt, was on-hand for the press conference announcing the attraction and endorsed the ride on behalf of the family. The first supports and track for Intimidator were installed on September 1, 2009. The lift hill was erected on October 1, 2009 and was completed on October 13, 2009. In order to install the last <b>lift</b> <b>piece,</b> 3 cranes were required. Construction on the roller coaster layout continued through November and December with the final track piece installed on December 21, 2009. Construction on the station, mechanics, and landscaping of Intimidator took place during the months of January and February. On February 4, 2010, testing of Intimidator commenced with the new roller coaster officially opening to the public on March 27, 2010.|$|R
5000|$|... 2003 {{was a year}} {{of change}} for UM. New drummer Kris Myers had to learn their {{extensive}} repertoire of originals and covers. The band continued their grueling tour schedule, logging over 150 shows for the year. The band began experimenting with a new [...] "Lego" [...] style of songwriting which involved piecing together original sections and <b>lifted</b> <b>pieces</b> of [...] "Jimmy Stewart" [...] improvisations to create new songs, such as Ocean Billy, #5, and Wife Soup. That summer, UM entered the recording studio in Chicago for their first studio album with Myers. In the Fall, the UM Live program was started by [...] "Sound Caresser" [...] Kevin Browning. Each night's show would be offered on CD, for sale directly after the show. This soon translated into a partnership with Disc Logic for online distribution, {{and a few years}} later all of the band's shows would be moved to UMLive.net. In November, the band released their first DVD, Live from the Lake Coast, and later that month their first official release featuring Kris Myers, Local Band Does Oklahoma (Recorded on April 23 in Oklahoma City).|$|R

50|$|Kajandu (also written kayendo, kajendo, kadiendo, or kadiandou) is a long-handled fulcrum shovel {{used by the}} Jola (Diola) {{people of}} Senegal, Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau to till and prepare rice paddy fields.

60|$|Suddenly the Spanish officer, {{when their}} prow was {{not more than}} twenty paces from him, ceased to shout, and <b>lifting</b> his <b>piece</b> fired.

Suddenly there was a sound of something snapping--a sound that could be heard even through the yell of terror from the soldiers in the boat. It was the bowsprit which had gone, leaving the jib flying loose like a great pennon.|$|R
