40|$|AbstractAdditive {{manufacturing}} (AM) is most used in prototype {{production and}} other processes upstream of series production. However, {{in recent years}} additive manufacturing has also moved into series production environments substituting for established systems. With AM, {{it is possible to}} improve production in terms of material consumption, manufacturing costs, and lightweight design. Accordingly, it is possible to create complexly arched <b>laminating</b> <b>moulds</b> directly from the CAD-model instead of milling them from solid material as is frequently done for the production of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) components in autoclaves. This work analyses the potential of CFRP-laminating moulds as rapid tooling moulds generated by fused deposition modeling. A rounded cuboid will be considered with different reinforcement patterns as well as various wall thicknesses. Normal autoclave conditions will be simulated with pressure variation and high temperature stress varying over time. In conclusion, the results prove the capability of rapid tooling thermoplastic <b>laminating</b> <b>moulds</b> for manufacturing CFRP components in autoclaves...|$|R

A linear thermoelastic {{approach has been}} applied to predict the related residual stress state before demoulding, giving an estimate of the stress induced by polymerisation strain. The results from the linear approach are confirmed by a viscoelastic finite element model including the cure conversion and related change in viscosity. It is concluded that the curvature measurement of unsymmetrical laminates is an accurate method for the prediction of the transverse residual stress, making it suitable as a benchmark for complex stress modelling. keyterms: residual stress, thermoset, cure shrinkage, viscoelastic, finite elements...|$|R
40|$|Regular {{composite}} production moulds {{often lack}} material and energy efficiency. These moulds either milled out of solid blocks or laminated over a master model, {{take long to}} produce and come at a high cost. In addition, the durability of <b>laminated</b> <b>moulds</b> is limited. The goal {{of this research is}} the development and technical-economical validation of faster producible, cheaper, longer lasting and material and energy efficient moulds based on plastically deformed metal sheets. Two equally spaced metal sheets are used to create a cavity through which a heat transferring fluid can flow, ensuring fast and homogenous cooling or heating resulting in reduced residual stresses in the produced composite material. Since the sheets are reasonably thin, less material has to undergo temperature changes resulting in a faster and a more energy efficient process with material-efficient moulds. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Continuous casting is {{a process}} in which liquid steel is cooled in a {{bottomless}} mould into semi-finished steel products called billets, blooms or slabs depending on their cross section. In the process of continuous casting, two of the major problems encountered are cracks and breakouts. Breakouts usually result in temporary shutdown of the caster and huge amounts of downtime. Primary cracks which form before the solidifying strand exits the mould, are invariably linked to breakouts. Controlling primary cracks results in reduced chances of breakouts. This work aims at designing a breakout prediction neural network model. In this paper, a two-layer feed forward backpropagation neural network model is developed for predicting the existence of primary cracks that might lead to a breakout. The network obtains its inputs in form of temperature values from rows of thermocouples attached to the <b>mould</b> <b>tube.</b> Based on solidification characteristics of steel, the neural network is supplied with various inputs (of temperature values) and targets and is trained to predict the crack status in the mould. Training is performed using the Levernberg-Marquardt (trainlm) training algorithm, and the log sigmoid transfer function was used for both the hidden and output layer. The output from this neural network was a logical 1 (if a primary crack is present) and a logical 0 (if no primary crack is present). The neural network model is validated by simulating i...|$|R

In this study the use of alternative mineral additions such as expanded perlite, expanded vermiculite, and microspheres as the fillers to paper pulp acquired from waste-paper for the use for the elements of mould sprue/gate systems or also other applications for the contact with liquid metal are presented.

40|$|The {{high cost}} of raw materials, high labour costs and lengthy cycle times have limited the use of {{conventional}} ply-based composites in the automotive industry. This thesis seeks to identify the potential of using low cost discontinuous fibre composites (DFCs) for structural applications. Properties of DFCs are governed by the degree of homogeneity of the reinforcement and discontinuities at the fibre ends, which cause stress concentrations; thereby limiting the mechanical performance of the material. This work focuses on material characterisation of <b>laminates</b> <b>moulded</b> from discontinuous carbon fibre preforms manufactured by a robotic spray process. Through the culmination of this work, a suitable design methodology for automotive applications has been identified. Design procedures for aerospace have also been considered. An analytical model has been developed to determine the tensile stiffness and strength of a discontinuous carbon fibre preform composite. The model can be used within automotive and aerospace design methodologies to define material properties, {{but a number of}} other factors must be considered. Areal mass of the preform has been identified as the governing factor in achieving target compaction levels. Poor homogeneity in thin parts prevents the ability to achieve high volume fractions, which determines mechanical performance. It has been demonstrated that the matrix has a greater influence on the properties of DFCs when compared to continuous fibre composites. Toughened resins were particularly effective in improving tensile strength of DFCs that exhibited poor homogeneity. Damage tolerance of DFCs has been evaluated through open-hole and compression after impact testing. Higher property retention was observed compared to continuous fibre equivalents. Greater damage tolerance of DFCs could lead to increased weight-saving in structural applications. However, current safety factors based on conventional laminates may be too conservative and could lead to over-engineering thus limiting the potential of the material...|$|R

40|$|Seamless bra cup {{moulding}} is {{an important}} manufacturing technique for the apparel industry,and in particular,for bra production. Polyurethane(PU) foams and/or fabric-foam <b>laminated</b> sheets are <b>moulded</b> into a desirable cup shape in order to fit the three-dimensional(3 D) breast contour. Such foam cups not only provide {{a wide range of}} designs combined with different levels of softness and support,but also reduce production costs with minimum cutting and sewing of seams. In this study,two selected PU foam and fabric materials typically used for bra cup moulding were examined. Their respective performance behaviour in relation to different moulding temperatures and time changes were recorded and analyzed. The results reveal that cup heights are greatly affected by the use of foam and/or fabric-foam <b>laminated</b> materials. High <b>moulding</b> temperatures and/or prolonged dwell time could be required when deforming laminated materials and setting large cup sizes. Nevertheless,cup height cannot be taken as the only criteria to determine the optimal moulding conditions,and this is especially the case for large cup sizes. The design of mould heads is a major factor that affects the dimension changes of foam cups. In this respect,to control the foam moulding process,it is suggested that bra manufacturers examine the fabric/foam material properties to determine the optimal moulding condition,and quantify the shape of foam cups to enhance the design and development process of aluminum mould heads.

This thesis has investigated the use of heated tooling {{as an alternative to}} the use of autoclave and oven curing. A design and development methodology for heated tools has been proposed while a number of heated tooling options have been identified and described. Three representative heated tool options using heater mats, electro-conductive textiles and wire heater elements have been evaluated. The curing capability of a prototype heated tool incorporating wire heater elements has been proved by carrying out a number of curing tests on RFI (Resin Fihn Infusion) <b>laminates.</b> The <b>moulded</b> <b>laminates</b> indicate that a 78 - 83 % extent of cure is achieved prior to post-cure. The fibre and void content of cured laminates has also been verified through acid digestion and microscopy, where an acceptable fibre volume fraction (Vf) of 55 - 57 % and a void content of less than 2 % have been achieved. The usefulness of ID and 3 D thermal Finite Element Analysis for the design and simulation of heated tooling has also been studied. A manufacturing and cost analysis study carried out has identified potential production implications, while the cost effectiveness of heated tooling compared to oven and autoclave processmg has been indicated. Cost reductions are noted in capital investments, operational costs and production set-up costs per part. The work described in this thesis gives valuable information for the implementation of heated tooling as a new processing method for aerospace composite products.

40|$|Autoclave {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most popular techniques for manufacturing polymer-based composite materials for aeronautical and automotive applications. During the process, consolidation of the composite takes place by applying a temperature and pressure cycle to the laminate, which has been preshaped according to the desired part, located on a tool and bagged. Autoclave manufacturing of composite materials is chosen when a medium/low manufacturing rate product with high long fiber content, low dimensional tolerances and repeatable material properties is required. The autoclave essentially is a pressurized cylindrical oven to achieve the prescribed program of pressure and temperature to obtain the final high performances composite product. The autoclave molding {{technology is}} a pressure forming technology where the work piece to be realized is sealed by a vacuum bag and its shape is defined by the supporting tool. In particular, the combination of the vacuum applied upon the work piece with the pressure exerted by the fluid pressure inside the autoclave allows to obtain a minimal presence of voids within the laminate and to achieve the highest mechanical performance now achievable with a composite material.

This polyimide was synthesized and evaluated {{for use as}} a neat resin and a matrix resin for advanced composites. Three 30 % w/w solids polyamic acid/N-methypyrrolidone solutions were prepared using 2, 3 and 4 % stoichiometric imbalances end-capped with phthalic anhydride to provide polyimides with theoretical number average molecular weights of approximately 22 800, 15 100 and 11 400 g mol− 1 respectively. Unidirectional IM 7 carbon fibre prepreg was prepared from these three resins using the Langley multipurpose tape machine. Thermal and rheological properties and the solvent/volatile depletion rates along with crystallization kinetics were characterized for the resin scraps taken from the prepreg tapes. Processing characteristics of the LARCTM-SCI resin were thoroughly understood from these results, and a workable moulding cycle was designed for this composite. Composite <b>laminates</b> were <b>moulded</b> at 410 C at either 200 or 300 psi, which consistently yielded good consolidation and high-quality panels as measured by C-scan, acid digestion and optical photomicrography.

Excellent fracture toughness of 6. 9 in-lb/in 2 was obtained. Excellent values of transverse flexural strength and longitudinal tensile strength indicated a good translation of fibre properties into the composite. Un-notched longitudinal compression strength of 163 ksi was comparable to typical thermoplastic composites.

In cyclic loading conditions strain levels or amplitudes of about 20, 000 µm/m are possible. The high elasticity stems from the stress-induced phase transformation of the SMA.

This {{study investigated the}} effects of four processing variables {{in the manufacture of}} Camembert cheese using UF and their impact on cheese quality. Using an incomplete block design, sixteen unique treatments were produced with combined processing variables (high-fat or low-fat; brine-salted or retentate-salted; acidified to pH 5. 2 or pH 4. 9; set in tubular moulds and small moulds). The cheeses were matured for seven weeks at 4 ± 1 ºC and were analysed for total solids, fat, salt, non-protein nitrogen (NPN) and soluble nitrogen (SN) contents during the maturation period (seven weeks). Major defects were evaluated by experienced cheese graders in the fourth week. pH was measured and instrumental analysis was also conducted. Sensory evaluation on consumer acceptance was also conducted in the fourth week. All the cheese samples exhibited similar increases in rind and core pH, NPN/TN and SN/TN ratios, and were generally characterised by thick rind and softness. The lowfat cheese samples had significantly lower NPN/TN ratio and higher overall acceptance in sensory evaluation. The salt content was also significantly higher. The retentate-salted cheese samples had significantly lower NPN/TN ratios and more defects in rind discolouration and deformation, and saltiness. The cheese samples acidified to pH 5. 2 had significantly lower NPN/TN ratios and fewer defects in rind discolouration, softness, sourness, and bitterness.

40|$|Conformal cooling {{channels}} {{follow the}} cavity shape and {{can provide a}} better cooling performance in injection <b>moulds.</b> <b>Laminated</b> tooling {{is one of the}} techniques for manufacturing injection moulds with conformal cooling systems. A laminated tool is made by stacking metal sheets of varying thicknesses from which pre–calculated profiles have been cut. The stacked sheets result in a jagged die surface that has to be finished before use. Although larger number of small thickness sheets result in small irregularities that can be finished easily, it increases the cost of profile cutting process. Therefore, one of the issues in laminated tooling is determination of sheet thicknesses so that the laminated die can be made optimally. In this paper, an optimization method is presented to find the best size of the various laminas based on CAD model surface geometry such that the surface jaggedness and the number of slice is reduced at the same time. The final mould is fabricated based on suggested optimization method. It is then tested to show the improvement in cooling performance as compared to the same die with conventional cooling channels.

The pump effects fluid displacement by direct actuation of the tube wall as opposed to excitation by an external body. The actuator consists of a DE <b>tube</b> <b>moulded</b> from silicone, held in a negative pressure chamber, which is used for prestraining the tube. The pump is coupled with custom designed polymeric check valves in order to rectify the fluid flow and assess the performance of the unit.

40|$|The {{performance}} of peristaltic pumps is mainly governed by their tubing or hose materials. Research {{and development in}} this area is therefore very important for peristaltic pump manufacturers to keep in front of the competition and to open up new applications to enable further market penetration. Another aspect of this is of course price; performance and cost have to be in balance. As an approach to fabricate a new tube material, the field of negative Poisson's ratio (or: auxetic) materials is explored. The combined deformations of tensile, compression and shear in a peristaltic pump tube may well benefit from the specific characteristics of auxetic materials. Materials can be designed to keep their dimensions constant in directions perpendicular to an applied load. This is referred to as "auxetic balancing". Finite element modelling shows that lowering the Poisson's ratio will rapidly decrease the maximum stresses in the cross-section of an occluded tube. Optimum values for the Poisson's ratio are found to be between - 0. 1 and + 0. 1, preferentially being o. The re-entrant honeycomb structure is selected for initial trials, but manufacturing of this structure at the desired dimension proved to be too difficult at this time. Instead, electrospun nanofibre membranes are selected as the reinforcement structure. A liquid silicone elastomer is used as the matrix material. Key characteristics for the new material are derived from baseline test results on existing tubing. Laminates are manufactured from electrospun nylon 6 nanofibre membranes coated with a liquid silicone rubber. Compression moulding is used to cure the nylon 6 - silicone rubber laminate, to give two effects: it ensures impregnation of the membrane and the compression deforms the nanofibre structure {{in such a way that}} it will become auxetic through-the-thickness. Flat sheet laminates of 2 mm thickness are manufactured with 14 layers of reinforcement. A reinforcing effect and substantial lowering of the through-the-thickness Poisson's ratio is observed for the laminates at low strains. At higher strains (> 50 %) the effect of the reinforcement diminishes and the Poisson's ratio of the laminate and pure silicone rubber equalises. Finally, tubular laminates are manufactured and the resulting tubes are tested in a peristaltic pump with some promising results (> 1 million occlusions before failure). Tube performance is not yet at the required level, but with further optimisation of the <b>laminating</b> process, <b>mould</b> design and (post-) curing large steps forward can be made.

These concern the effect of the processing conditions of these materials on interlaminar shear strength and impact properties and the influence of the synergy between processing, microstructure and properties on the impact performance of commingled composite structures. With this aim, flat plaques of E-glass/polypropylene commingled composites with a different fibre architecture (two-and three-dimensional) were non-isothermally compression moulded under various moulding conditions and then tested. The test programme included falling weight impact tests with a staircase procedure, Charpy impact tests and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) tests.

The veneers were arranged with 5 layers into three types of moulded shapes of furniture components namely i) 100 % S ii) alternate S and I and iii) surface S & core I. The suitable pressure, temperature and time were set as important parameters. The arrangements of veneer quality were pressed using V-shape mould through hot press machine with three parameters pressure 1500 psi, 2000 psi and 2500 psi. Two types of adhesives namely UF and PF were used to produce MLVOP. The mechanical properties of the composites were tested with three bending types i. e. flat bending, type-V bending, and type-OV in accordance with BS EN 310 : 1993. The results showed {{that most of the}} samples bonded with UF-resin have better strengths (MOR and MOE) when tested with the three bending tests compared to the samples bonded with PF-resin. However, the results vary depends on the veneer arrangements. </p...|$|R

40|$|Early-age {{shrinkage}} {{and cracking}} have become reoccurring problem in concrete construction. Conditions such as reduced maximum aggregate size, increased amount of fines, presence of retarding admixtures, increased binder content and deficient covering and curing {{all contribute to}} this problem. At early age, when the cement paste is young and has poorly developed mechanical properties, autogenous and evaporating shrinkage, both incorporated in the plastic shrinkage, are the two main driving forces for cracking. For modern concretes developing large autogenous shrinkage, as the high performance and self-compacting concrete (SCC), early-age cracking is a highly topical and important area. When the concrete dries out due to evaporation there will be formation of water menisci near the concrete surface. The distance between the particles then tends to be reduced and the concrete will contract. These contracting capillary forces are in reverse ratio to the meniscus radius. The capillary tension stresses will therefore increase with decreasing interparticle spaces. For a concrete where the evaporation is prevented, the negative capillary pressure will also start to develop as the concrete sets. As a solid skeleton starts to form the chemical shrinkage is not totally transformed into external volume change and, if the water supply is restricted, empty pores will be formed inside the paste and water meniscus occurs. In this work, early age (< 24 h) autogenous deformation and crack tendency due to plastic shrinkage was measured. For the autogenous deformation, a specially developed digital dilatometer was used with great satisfactory, generating accurately measures of the linear displacements of the concrete cast in a vapor proof flexible <b>tube</b> <b>mould.</b> The plastic shrinkage cracking tendency was evaluated, using a modified Nordtest method (NT BUILD 433), where the concrete sample was exposed to early drying conditions and where the restraining inner steel ring causes development of tangential stresses which if sufficiently high leads to cracking. As the underlying mechanisms are not quantified by the ring-test and as plastic shrinkage strongly {{are related to the}} negative capillary pressure in fresh concrete, the test was complimented with transducer recording the development of the pore pressure. In some cases, pore pressure development was also measured on sealed specimens, referring to the autogenous deformation tests. A large number of different SCC constituents and mix compositions have been investigated; e. g. w/c-ratio from 0. 38 to 0. 67, coarse aggregate content, silica fume, fly ash, cement type, extra water and different admixtures (accelerator, retarder, shrinkage reducer, air entraining agent, superplasticizer dosage). For comparison, tests with standard concrete were made. The crack tendency test was also performed on mixes with different fibers and curing compounds. The influence of different constituents and mixes on the autogenous deformation and plastic shrinkage crack tendency was significantly observed. The results indicated that: • High crack tendency was generated when: - large autogenous shrinkage (silica addition, low w/c, high fineness) - high water evaporation (extra water, high w/c, low fineness) - retardation (retarder, slow hardening cement, high superplastisizer dosage), - low content of coarse aggregate • Minimum crack tendency at w/c 0. 55 IV • Reduced crack tendency by: - shrinkage reducing admixture (large positive effect on both autogenous shrinkage and evaporation, without influencing the time to initial- and final set) - acceleration (accelerator, rapid cement) - air entraining agent - fibers - wax membrane (effectively for concretes with high evaporation) Finally the ring-test method and the experimental results were clearly verified by field studies...|$|R
