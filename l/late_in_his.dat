5|$|<b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, {{from the}} {{electric}} period on, Davis repeatedly disregarded his earlier work, {{such as the}} music of Birth of the Cool or Kind of Blue. In Davis' view, remaining static stylistically was the wrong option.|$|E

5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers have suggested that this style {{may have been a}} result of Innis' illness <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career.|$|E
5|$|Born in Connecticut, Baldwin {{originally}} {{was a teacher}} in Maryland and Connecticut before moving to Ohio in the late 1820s. He {{became part of the}} lyceum movement, and situated himself in Berea, Ohio. He opened up Baldwin Institute in 1846 upon seeing the dissolution of the Norwalk Seminary. Nine years later, the Institute became Baldwin University. He moved to Kansas around 1857, laying the foundation for Baldwin City, Kansas, as well as Baker University.

5|$|In November 1827, Jane {{gave birth}} to Mary Prudentia Hogg after a {{difficult}} pregnancy. Mary Prudentia only lived 18 months, however, dying in May 1829. During Jane's pregnancy, Mary Shelley learned that Jane had spoken openly of Percy Shelley's attraction to her and coolness towards Mary <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life. These revelations significantly hurt Mary's feelings. Their friendship survived, however, and Mary Shelley {{was selected as the}} godmother of Jane's daughter Prudentia Sarah Jefferson Hogg in 1836.|$|E
5|$|Kelly {{attracted}} {{the most attention}} as part of Miles Davis' band from 1959, including an appearance on the trumpeter's Kind of Blue, often mentioned as the best-selling jazz album ever. After leaving Davis in 1963, Kelly played with his own trio, which recorded for several labels and toured the United States and internationally. His career did not develop much further, and he had difficulty finding enough work <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career. Kelly, who was prone to epilepsy, died {{in a hotel room}} in Canada following a seizure, aged 39.|$|E
5|$|<b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> reign, Christian IV {{also became}} an early proponent of Baroque {{which was to}} {{continue}} for a considerable time with many impressive buildings both in the capital and the provinces. Neoclassicism came initially from France but was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of Historicism ultimately merged into the 19th century National Romantic style.|$|E

5|$|Most playwrights of {{the period}} {{typically}} collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same, mostly early and <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career. Some attributions, such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays, remain controversial while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well-attested contemporary documentation. Textual evidence also supports the view {{that several of the}} plays were revised by other writers after their original composition.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his career, Wilson {{was known}} for championing causes that were at times unpopular, {{including}} {{the abolition of slavery}} and workers' rights for both blacks and whites. Massachusetts politician George F. Hoar, who served in the United States House of Representatives while Wilson was a Senator, and later served in the Senate himself, believed Wilson to be the most skilled political organizer in the country. However, Wilson's reputation for personal integrity and principled politics was somewhat damaged <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Senate career by his involvement in the Crédit Mobilier scandal.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, to the extent that <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bohemia (then part of Austrian Empire) as a German-speaking Jew of humble circumstances, Mahler {{displayed}} {{his musical}} gifts {{at an early}} age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 {{as director of the}} Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life he was briefly director of New York's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic.|$|E

5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's {{management of the}} vehicles under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} high school at Curie High School in Chicago where he won Naismith and Mr. Basketball USA {{recognition}} as national player of the year. He did not play organized basketball until eighth grade, but by <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> freshman season he became a notable contributor to his high school's varsity team. He was ranked among the top 20 prospects in the national class of 2014 prior to his sophomore season. As a junior, he moved into the top 10 of the national class and was recognized as an All-American. By {{the beginning of his}} senior season, he was considered to be a top 5 player by most talent evaluators and his stock was still on the rise. Following a Martin Luther King Day performance during his senior year against the number one team in the country, many experts considered him to be {{the best player in the}} national class of 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1612, having {{determined}} the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate {{knowledge of their}} orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem {{from time to time}} during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer, such as that of John Harrison. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.|$|E
50|$|Charles Lisner (1928 - 1988) was {{the founder}} and first artistic {{director}} of the Queensland Ballet.
