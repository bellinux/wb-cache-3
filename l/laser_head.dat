40|$|Abstract. We discuss power {{scaling of}} passively mode-locked lasers using {{multiple}} <b>laser</b> <b>heads</b> in the resonator. We experimentally compared two different approaches for the cavity design, both using three side-pumped Nd:YAG <b>laser</b> <b>heads.</b> We obtained a record-high average output power {{of up to}} 27 W with close to diffraction-limited beam quality, a pulse duration of 19 ps, a pulse energy of 0 : 5 mJ, and 23 kW peak power. Single-pass second-harmonic generation in a 10 -mm-long LBO crystal yields 16 : 2 W of 532 -nm radiation. PACS: 42. 55. Xi; 42. 60. Fc Passively mode-locked lasers with high average power and good beam quality are interesting for numerous applications, particularly those involving nonlinear frequency conversion.

5000|$|A common {{misconception}} is {{that the}} disc spins first in one direction, and then another, either for PTP or OTP recording, when in fact DVD-Writers always spin a disc in the clockwise direction. A simpler way to understand what's written above is {{to think of the}} little hole in the centre of the DVD as the [...] "inside" [...] and the rim of the DVD as the [...] "outside". Since dual-layer DVDs have two data layers, placed {{one on top of the}} other - Layer 0 (L0) and Layer 1 (L1), there are two ways in which these two layers may be written to - L0, inside to outside and then L1 inside to outside again (PTP), or L0 inside to outside and then L1 outside to inside (OTP). OTP is usually used for DVD-Video, to prevent the inherent delay that PTP involves: in PTP, the <b>laser</b> <b>head</b> moves from the outside edge of the DVD to the inside to start reading L1 when it reaches the end of L0. This results in the video skipping or freezing up for some time as the <b>laser</b> <b>head</b> repositions itself and the system waits to start receiving data again.|$|E

50|$|In the AAS method, {{the set of}} servo systems (focus, tracking, sled, and spindle servos) {{keeps the}} laser beam focused on the spiral track, and allows disc {{rotation}} and <b>laser</b> <b>head</b> motion during the scanning. The amplification/detection board (DAB) is integrated into the CD/DVD drive unit and incorporates a photosensor and electronic circuitry to amplify the RF signal extracted from the photodiode transducer. The photosensor generates a trigger signal when detecting the trigger mark. Both signals are brought to the USB2.0 data acquisition board(DAQ) for digitization and quantification.|$|E
50|$|The layer jump is {{a switch}} (jump) between the layer {{closer to the}} <b>laser</b> <b>head</b> (referred as L0) to the farther layer (referred as L1), or vice versa. Jumping layers is already {{necessary}} for reading multiple layer optical media (so far market released products are limited to two layers despite some research prototypes having up to eight layers), {{as well as for}} recording them with Sequential Recording. However the layer jump during the recording occurs only once, at the position called Middle Area, during a Sequential Recording, while it may occur multiple times with Layer Jump Recording.|$|E

40|$|This {{report will}} detail the {{experimental}} results and observations obtained while investigating {{the feasibility of}} temporally overlapping the two laser pulses from a Quantel EverGreen 200 Laser. This laser was specifically designed for Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) applications and operate by emitting two 532 nm laser pulses that are seperated by an adjustable finite time (typically {{on the order of}} ten to hundreds of microseconds). However, the use of this model laser has found recent application for Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) testing, especially for rotorcraft research. For this testing, it is desired to only use one laser pulse. While this is easily done by only firing one of the <b>laser</b> <b>heads,</b> more excitation energy could conceivably be had if both <b>laser</b> <b>heads</b> are fired with zero pulse separation. In addition, recently large field-of-view PIV measurements have become possible and need ever increasing laser power to illuminate the larger areas. For this work, two different methods of timing the laser are investigated using both a traditional power meter to monitor laser power as well as a fast photodiode to determine pulse separation. The results are presented here as well as some simple implications for PIV experiments using these methods...|$|R

50|$|Direct laser {{engraving}} of flexographic printing cylinders and plates {{has been an}} established process since the 1970s. This first began {{with the use of}} a carbon dioxide laser used to selectively ablate or evaporate a variety of rubber plate and sleeve materials to produce a print ready surface without the use of photography or chemicals. With this process there is no integral ablation mask as with direct photopolymer laser imaging (see below). Instead a high-power carbon dioxide <b>laser</b> <b>head</b> burns away, or ablates, unwanted material. The aim is to form sharp, relief images with steep first relief and contoured shoulder supported edges to give a high standard of process color reproduction. A short water wash and dry cycle follows, which is a lot less involved than in the post-processing stages for direct laser imaging or conventional flexo platemaking using photopolymer plates. After engraving, the photopolymer is exposed through the imaged black layer and washed out in the traditional photopolymer process requiring photography and chemicals. See below.|$|E
