In response, this paper proposes that researchers need to explore ways to enhance {{the value of this}} video material and suggests that one approach might be to formalise the role of collaborative conversations within the data analysis phase of the research work. Here pairs or groups of researchers formally discuss the video data in detail, with these conversations being recorded and then layered onto to the video or transcript material. This collaborative approach was used within one <b>longitudinal</b> <b>play</b> study and achieved a number of positive outcomes including opportunities to see 'other' in the video texts, the production of enhanced theorising through the creation of a collective identity and the achievement of a layered report.

Research has documented relations between features of pretend play, such as the quality of expressed fantasy and the quantity of expressed affect, and varied developmental outcomes. Although there is theoretical and empirical support {{for the importance of}} both cognitive and affective facets of play in development, little is known about changes in the form and function of play across childhood. This investigation evaluated the structure and development of children’s pretend play in a diverse community sample of 250 children across three <b>longitudinal</b> <b>play</b> assessments at ages 4, 6, and 8. The data supported a two-factor play structure across childhood and in diverse groups with regard to child gender, race/ethnicity, and poverty status. Multilevel models documented the level and linear change patterns in cognitive and affective play factors over time. Although Hispanic race/ethnicity was associated with lower levels of the cognitive play factor at age 4, and poverty status was associated with lower levels of the cognitive play factor and the affective play factor at age 4, no predictors accounted for the significant variance that remained in the linear change parameter for the cognitive, but not the affective, factor. Together, these findings extend the literature on pretend play by evaluating competing models of the structure of play and documenting patterns of cognitive and affective development in children’s pretend play over time and in diverse groups.

Evaluation of IBS in ERLs, where beam distribution is non-Gaussian, requires special treatment. Here we describe the IBS and Touschek effects with application to ERLs. In circular accelerators both the Touschek effect and IBS were found important. The generalized formulas for Touschek calculations are available and are already being used in advanced tracking simulations of several ERL-based projects. The IBS (which is diffusion due to multiple Coulomb scattering) is not expected to cause any significant effect on beam distribution in ERLs, unless one considers very long transport of high-brightness beams at low energies. Both large and small-angle Coulomb scattering can contribute to halo formation in future ERLs with high-brightness beams, as follows from simple order-of-magnitude estimates.

We address {{the fundamental question}} by studying posterior crossvein (PCV) development in Drosophila as a model, in which long-range BMP transport from the <b>longitudinal</b> veins <b>plays</b> a critical role during the pupal stages. Here, we show that RhoGAP Crossveinless-C (Cv-C) is induced at the PCV primordial cells by BMP signaling and mediates PCV morphogenesis cell-autonomously by inactivating members of the Rho-type small GTPases. Intriguingly, we find that Cv-C is also required non-cell-autonomously for BMP transport into the PCV region, while a long-range BMP transport is guided toward ectopic wing vein regions by loss of the Rho-type small GTPases. We present evidence that low level of ß-integrin accumulation at the basal side of PCV epithelial cells regulated by Cv-C provides an optimal extracellular environment for guiding BMP transport. These data suggest that BMP transport and PCV morphogenesis are tightly coupled. Our study reveals a feed-forward mechanism that coordinates the spatial distribution of extracellular instructive cues and morphogenesis.

However, the information obtained by a measurement of the nuclear suppression R_AA is not very sensitive to medium properties. Thus, more differential observables are needed. Here we focus on the pattern of angular correlation of hadrons associated with a hard trigger. These show rich pattern when going from low p_T to high p_T associate momentum. At low p_T, the pattern of associate hadrons can be understood in terms of Mach shocks excited by the energy lost from the away side parton while the parton itself is absorbed by the medium. At high p_T, fluid dynamics is not applicable any more and the correlations become dominated by the punchtrough of the away side parton with subsequent fragmentation.

These interactions may appear as modifications of the near-side jet peak compared to pp collisions. In these measurements, the associated per-trigger yield is calculated from the relative azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity between a trigger particle with higher p_ T (1 GeV/c < p_ T < 8 GeV/c) and an associated particle. Subsequently, the near-side peak width and shape are extracted {{as a function of}} p_ T and centrality. Results obtained by the ALICE detector from Pb-Pb and pp collisions are presented. In Pb-Pb collisions, a significant broadening of the peak in central events at low p_ T is observed in the data, and is more pronounced in the Δη direction than in the Δφ direction. A novel feature is also observed at low p_ T in central events: the peak departs from the Gaussian shape, and a depletion around its center appears.

40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to {{understand}} effluent dispersion in shallow tidal waters, a two-dimensional analysis of advection and diffusion in a reversing flow has been carried out. The flow speed varies linearly with time, passing through zero at time t = 0. A point source discharges contaminant into this flow at a steady rate, so that water which is close. to the source around the time of flow reversal will become highly contaminated. Thus a peak in the contaminant concentration field will appear, moving downstream after the reversal at a speed close to that of the flow. This concentration peak has certain characteristics similar to a cloud of contaminant from an instantaneous discharge at t = 0. The solution of the advection-diffusion equation {{is in the form of}} an integral of concentration fields due to instantaneous releases of contaminant at all previous times. At large times after the flow reversal, asymptotic analysis yields good approximations to this integral. The use of Laplace's method is equivalent to ignoring longitudinal diffusion (the boundary-layer approximation); however, the expansion obtained in this way is not uniformly valid near the concentration peak, indicating that <b>longitudinal</b> diffusion <b>plays</b> an important role in the development of this peak. Uniformly valid expansions are obtained for the concentration around the peak, and also around the source where the boundary-layer approximation always breaks down.

Doing so removes much of the influence of large-scale variability across the ABSL sector region (e. g., due to the southern annular mode), allowing a clearer understanding of ABSL variability and its effect on the regional climate of West Antarctica. Using ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) fields, the annual cycle of the relative central pressure of the ABSL for the period from 1979 to 2011 shows a minimum (maximum) during winter (summer), differing considerably from the earlier studies based on actual central pressure, which suggests a semiannual oscillation. The annual cycle of the longitudinal position of the ABSL is insensitive to the background pressure, and shows it shifting westward from 250 ° to 220 °E between summer and winter, in agreement with earlier studies.

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{improving}} the ice physics inderpinning time-dependent glacier flowline models, three independent approaches for solving longitudinal stresses in glaciers are discussed and verified by application to Haut Glacier'Aro la. To highlight any shortcomings, the reduced and much utili ed driving stress approximation is also applied and compared. Modelled velocity patterns using the three full stress schemes exhibit consistency {{with one another and}} good coincidence with observed velocities for the 1991 summer melt season. Furthermore, these stress patterns indicate that longitudinal stresses are significant and of a similar order of magnitude as the basal shear stress components. However, the driving stress approximation yields erratic fluctuations in the stress and velocity fields which are neither realistic in terms of mass continuity nor agree with observations. Basal decoupling experiments indicate a complex relationship between basal velocity and englacial stresses with considerable dampening of any basal perturbation occuring as it is dissipated towards the surface and transferred throughout the ice mass. The driving stress approximation fails to account at all for any such coupling. Experiments to identify the length scale over which longitudinal effects operate indicate that they are significant even up to 10 ice thicknesses. The implication here is that <b>longitudinal</b> stresses <b>play</b> a significant role in determining glacier dynamics on length scales up to at least 2 km and that the predictive power of models of glacier flow based purely on the driving stress approximation is therefore subject to significant limitations.
