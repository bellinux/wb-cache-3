50|$|Testamentary {{capacity}} is generally governed by <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> testator's <b>domicile</b> at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> his death, <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument {{in most countries}} either by <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> his <b>domicile</b> or <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place where the will was made, at his option. <b>The</b> old rule <b>of</b> English <b>law</b> was to allow the former alternative only. The law was altered for the United Kingdom in 1861 by the Wills Act 1861 (known as Lord Kingsdown's Act), by which a will made out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom by a British subject is, as far as regards personal estate, good if made according to the forms required by <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place where it was made, or by <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> testator's <b>domicile</b> at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> making it, or by <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> his <b>domicile</b> of origin. Subsequent change of domicile does not avoid such a will. Another act passed on the same day, <b>the</b> <b>Domicile</b> Act 1861, enacted that by convention with any foreign government foreign domicile with regard to wills could not be acquired by a testator without a year's residence and a written declaration of intention to become domiciled. By the same act foreign consuls may by convention have certain authority over the wills and property of subjects of foreign states dying in England.|$|R

That is the case whether the 13th Duke was domiciled in England, in Australia or in California." ...|$|E
50|$|In the United States {{some states}} have adopted the narrow policy of {{enacting}} by statute the old common law rule, and providing that no will is valid unless made in the form required by {{the law of the}} state of the testator's domicile. The capacity of the testator, revocation and construction of a will, are governed by the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domicile</b> of the testator at the time of his death—except in cases affected by Lord Kingsdown's Act, as he must be supposed to have used language in consonance with that law, unless indeed he express himself in technical language of another country. A good instance is Groos' Case (1904), Prob. 269, where it was held that the will of a Dutch woman (at the time of her death domiciled in England) duly made in Holland was not revoked by her marriage, that being no ground of revocation by the law of Holland.|$|E
50|$|Status is {{relevant}} {{for a wide}} array of issues. Self-evidently, unless the proposed litigant has legal personality, there will be no jurisdiction. It will also be relevant to immigration, entitlement to social security and similar benefits, family law, contract, etc. The choice of law rule is the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domicile</b> (lex domicilii) if the forum is common law, or law of nationality (lex patriae) or habitual residence if the forum is civil law applies to determine all question of status and its legal attributes. The lex fori determines the domicile, nationality or habitual residence, and applies that law to establish an in rem set of rights and capacities. Thus, under some laws, the status of illegitimate affects the rights of inheritance {{in the case of an}} intestacy, etc. As to corporations, the choice of law rule is the law of incorporation (the lex incorporationis) for all matters of capacity, validity, shareholders' rights, etc.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> {{applicable to}} <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> incapable foreign domiciliaries has generated much controversy in private international law. Arguments have favoured application either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foreign <b>domicile</b> or <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local <b>law,</b> yet neither solution {{has been consistently}} adopted. <b>The</b> author is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> view that such controversy amongst proponents of competing yet justifiable solutions is immanent in law and that both solutions {{must be seen as}} representing <b>the</b> private international <b>law</b> <b>of</b> incapable persons. He therefore argues in favour of a disjunctive reference of such questions to one or <b>the</b> other <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>laws</b> in conflict, depending on which best serves <b>the</b> objective <b>of</b> protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incapable. Such a solution is incompatible with <b>the</b> unilateral application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forum, and notions of governmental interest or <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> « immediate application » are therefore inapplicable...|$|R
25|$|The {{court is}} {{required}} to analyse the pleadings prepared by the parties and to assign each component element to the most appropriate juridical concept or category. <b>The</b> rules <b>of</b> any given system <b>of</b> <b>law</b> are arranged under different categories, addressing procedure, status, contract, tort, divorce, nullity etc. For each category, there is one or more choice <b>of</b> <b>law</b> rule(s). Thus, for example, all questions as to <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> a person before a court (a minor or adult, legitimate, legitimated or illegitimate, married or not, mentally incapacitated or not, bankrupt or not etc.) will all be governed by the person's personal <b>law,</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> nationality (<b>the</b> lex patriae) or habitual residence in a civil law state, or <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>domicile</b> (<b>the</b> lex domicilii) in a common law state.|$|R

[...] He criticized the Obama administration for allowing federal agencies like <b>the</b> Departments <b>of</b> State and Education to choose <b>the</b> [...] "place <b>of</b> celebration" [...] rule when federal statutes do not specify how to determine <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> a marriage even though [...] "these agencies have no inherent legal authority to define marriage."

5000|$|The {{persons who}} are to take under a will are decided by {{different}} rules according as the property is movable or immovable, the former being governed by the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domicile,</b> the latter by the lex loci rei sitae. It was held, however, in 1881 by the court of appeal in England that, under the will of an Englishman domiciled in Holland, leaving personal property to children, children legitimated per subsequens matrimonium could take, as they were legitimate by the law of Holland, though not by the law of England (re Goodman's Trusts, 17 Ch. D. 266). This principle was carried further in re Grey's Trusts (1892), 3 Ch. 88, where it was held that a legitimated child was entitled to share in a devise of English realty. But {{it is to be}} noted that a person born out of lawful wedlock, though legitimated, could not succeed as heir to real estate in England [...] (Birtwhistle v. Vardill, 2 Cl. and F. 895). A will duly executed abroad is generally required to be clothed with the authority of a court of the country where any property affected by the will is situate.|$|E
50|$|If the talaq is {{executed}} {{in a state}} where it is effective to terminate the marriage, this potentially affects the status and capacity of the spouses so that they are then free to remarry. Within the conflict system, the enforcement of foreign judgments is a reasonably well-regulated area. But this form of divorce is only quasi-judicial at best, so it falls outside the normal rules. The general expectation as to choice of law depends on the characterization of the issue. As a form of divorce, the rule might be that the lex loci actus (the law of the place where the transaction took place) should be applied and recognized universally so that the parties would avoid a limping marriage (i.e. that whether they are considered married will change depending on which states they visit or reside in). However, this may be against public policy because one of the parties is seeking to evade some mandatory provisions of law or it is not {{in the best interests of}} any children (see parens patriae). If the characterization is status/capacity, this will be determined under the lex domicilii (the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domicile)</b> in a common law state, and under the lex patriae (the law of the nationality) or habitual residence in a civil law state. Alternatively, the court seized of the matter might apply the lex fori (the municipal law of the forum state).|$|E
40|$|No {{question}} in the Conflict of Laws has given to the jurists of continental Europe greater difficulty during {{the last thirty years}} than the so-called renvoi theory. The following example may serve to suggest the problem. Suppose a citizen of the United States, formerly a resident of the State of New York, dies domiciled in Italy, leaving personal property in the State of New York, and that a question arises before the New York courts with respect to the distribution of such property The obvious answer is : The lex fori having adopted the rule that the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domicile</b> of the deceased {{at the time of his}} death shall govern the distribution of his personal estate, Italian law is to be applied. But what is meant by Italian law? Is the New York judge to apply the Italian statute of distributions, or is he directed by the lex fori to apply Italian law in its totality, i. e., including its rules governing the Conflict of Laws? Should the lex fori refer to Italian law in the latter sense it would be found that in the Italian system of Private International Law the lex patrice has supplanted the lex domicilii in the present instance. If the question came before an Italian judge the personal estate would be distributed in accordance with the law of the country of which the deceased was a citizen or subject at the time of his death, that is, New York law...|$|E
40|$|SUBJECT to diversified state legislation, divorce {{presents}} a particularly difficult conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> {{problem in this}} country. The foundation fur this problem was laid when divorces were granted fur causes recognized by local legislation (lex fori) without reference to <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrimonial <b>domicile.</b> And <b>the</b> question was further complicated when married women were allowed to acquire domiciles separate from those of their husbands. Since divorce strikes deep into our social life and is basically a religious or moral issue, state laws reflecting widely divergent views on the subject extend from extreme strictness to the greatest liberality. Causes for divorce range {{all the way from}} adultery as the sole ground to 2 ̆ 2 extreme 2 ̆ 2 mental cruelty. Consequently, persons living in states under whose laws they cannot obtain a divorce seek to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> more liberal jurisdictions. The migratory divorce problem has become even more intensified in recent times, for several states have changed their divorce legislation with <b>the</b> ex-press purpose <b>of</b> attracting non-residents. Nevada, the first to enter the divorce business, reduced its residence requirement, in 1927, to three months and in 1931, to six weeks. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mexican states have gone even further, granting divorces without reference to domicile or residence, and in some cases by mail. All efforts to remedy the situation have failed. Even the most conspicuous, the Uniform Marriage Annulment and Divorce Act, has received <b>the</b> approval <b>of</b> only three states. An amendment to the Federal Constitution giving Congress power, similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian and Australian legislatures, to deal with <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> marriage and divorce is perhaps the only real solution to the problem...|$|R
