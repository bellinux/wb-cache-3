They worked on it again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about four years now and each time we approached it we {{seemed to be going}} down the same old paths. It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song. It's simply {{trying to find a way}} of doing it which excites us. And we may have found a way, at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and we have so lost the plot on this song. Please don't <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> the case." [...] The band failed to find an arrangement that satisfied them, and the song remained unreleased.|$|E

2500|$|Christianity first {{spread in}} the {{predominantly}} Greek-speaking {{eastern half of the}} Roman Empire. The Apostles traveled extensively throughout the empire, establishing communities in major cities and regions, with the first community appearing in Jerusalem, followed by communities in Antioch, Ethiopia and others. Early growth also occurred in the two political centers of Rome and Greece, as well as in Byzantium (initially a minor centre under the Metropolitan of Heraclea, but which later became Constantinople). Orthodoxy believes in the apostolic succession that they believe was established by the Apostles in the New Testament; this {{played a key role in}} the communities' view of itself as the preserver of the original Christian tradition. Historically the word [...] did not mean a building or housing structure (for which Greek-speakers might have used the word [...] "basilica") but meant a community or gathering of like peoples (see ekklesia). The earliest Ecclesiology would posit that the Eucharistic assembly, under the authority and permission of a Bishop, is what constitutes a Church. As St. Ignatius of Antioch said, [...] "Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. <b>Let</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [...] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [...] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast." ...|$|E
2500|$|The young priestess enters, {{concerned}} at how pale Norma looks. Norma makes her swear {{to do everything}} she asks and, upon her agreement, tells her that she is entrusting the two children to her care and states {{that they should be}} taken to the Roman camp to their father Pollione, a man whom she hopes will make a better mate for Adalgisa than he was for her. [...] Adalgisa is aghast. Norma: [...] "I beg you for his children's sake." [...] (Duet, first Norma: Deh! con te, con te li prendi, Li sostieni, li difendi / [...] "Please, take them with you, support them and protect them; I don't ask you for honour or power, <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> kept for your own children.") Adalgisa tells her that she'll never leave Gaul and only agreed to the request in order to do what was good for Norma. (Duet, Adalgisa: Vado al campo, ed all'ingrato Tutti io reco i tuoi lamenti.) In the duet, Adalgisa agrees to go to the Roman camp and tell Pollione of Norma's grief but her hope is to persuade him to return to Norma. She then renounces Pollione: (Duet: Mira, o Norma / [...] "O Norma, look at your dear children of yours on your knees. Be moved by pity for them, even if you have no pity for yourself.") They sing together, each expressing her own thoughts and feelings until Norma realises that Adalgisa will give up Pollione and remain with her: (Cabaletta: Duet, Norma and Adalgisa: Si fino all'ore estreme, compagna tua m'avrai / [...] "Yes, you will have me as your friend until your last hour; the world is large enough to be a shelter to both of us together.") ...|$|E
