40|$|ABSTRACT: Immediate <b>land</b> <b>impact</b> {{analysis}} {{during and}} {{right after the}} occurrence of any catastrophic disaster provides crucial function for producing timely information to stimulate proper disaster reduction measures. In this area of interest, remote sensing has thus been widely applied and rapidly developed {{in terms of its}} high spatial resolution and multiple spectrogram. However given the concern of cost of high spatial resolution image, and complex socio-ecological system in the Southeast Asia, estimating direct <b>land</b> <b>impacts</b> of typhoon related hazards from interpreting delicate landscapes at fine scale is still challenging. Interpreting hurts of agricultural land that also refers to crops and trees uprooted or broken by windstorm and/or debris/mud flow is of criticality. This study presents an Object-Based Image Analytical (OBIA) method using SPOT 5 satellite imageries (10 m resolution) to analyze <b>land</b> <b>impacts</b> in Compostela Valley, Mindanao in the strike of typhoon Pablo in December 2012. Various object-based features are integrated including spectra, texture and geometry of 4 spectral bands to assess especially the hurts of cultivated fields and the windthrow effects. The accuracy assessment shows that the accurate classification of debris/mud flow reaches 88. 9 % and of windthrow attains 83. 3 %. The result reinforces that distinguishing windthrow from debris/mud flow or flood is possible. This analytical method highlights the importance to enable a fast regional-scale assessment of typhoon damages and especially cost-effective option for inaccessible areas...|$|R

After several more orbital corrections, on 11 September, the vehicle began its descent to the lunar surface. Contact with the spacecraft was lost at 07:48 UT at the previously determined point of lunar <b>landing.</b> <b>Impact</b> coordinates were 3°34' north latitude and 56°30' east longitude, near the edge of the Mare Fecunditatis ("Sea of Fertility").

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{a method}} to reduce the <b>landing</b> <b>impact</b> force is {{proposed}} for a stable dynamic walking of a humanoid robot. To measure the meaningful <b>landing</b> <b>impact</b> force, a novel foot mechanism, which uses FSRs (Force Sensing Resistors), is introduced as well. Humanoid robot might become unstable during the walking due to the impulsive contact force from the sudden landing of its foot. Therefore a new control method to decrease the <b>landing</b> <b>impact</b> force has been required. In this paper, time domain passivity control approach is applied for this purpose. Ground and {{the foot of the}} robot are modeled as two one-port network systems which are connected and exchanging energy each other. And, the time domain passivity controller which has the <b>landing</b> <b>impact</b> force as input and foot’s position to trim off the force as output, is implemented. Unlike previous works, the proposed controller can guarantee the stability of the robot system without any dynamic model information at all. The small sized humanoid robot, HanSaRam-VI which has 25 DOFs, with the proposed foot mechanism is developed to verify the proposed approach through dynamic walking experiments. I...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effects of different figure skating boots on kinetic and kinematic properties of the <b>landing</b> <b>impact.</b> The focus was on the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) and kinematic differences between the examined boots duringthe <b>landing</b> <b>impact</b> as well as the material and construction design differences between the boots. The hypothesis was that different figure skating boots (Graf Edmonton and Edea Concerto) differently affect the VGRF and kinematics during the <b>landing</b> <b>impact</b> so some figure skating boots may reduce the impact at landing and could therefore possibly prevent injuries. Method: Six subjects each simulated figure skating landings wearing two different types ofskates from two different heights, on artificial ice. Differences were investigated between the boots in angular position of individual body segments and in the VGRF that acts between the skate and a force platform underneath a plastic ice surface, as well as the force which acts between the skate and the foot. The landings were examined with a Pedar-X in-shoe pressure measuring system, a Kistler force plate and a Qualysis motion capture system. The obtained values of each variable were statistically compared between the boots using SPSS. Results: Statistically significant (p≤ 0. 05) differences between the boots were seen in the degree of right ankle and knee joint flexion during the initial <b>landing</b> <b>impact,</b> in the degree of right ankle joint peak flexion, {{as well as in the}} force magnitude experienced by the right foot during the landing impacts as well as for the area under the max force-time curve. Furthermore, differences were seen in the construction design, materials, sizes of the outsole and in the stiffness. Conclusions: This research suggests there are differences in lower extremity VGRF and kinematic effects of <b>landing</b> <b>impact</b> when using different boots. It also suggests that some figure skating boots reduce the loading on the human body during the landing impacts more than others and therefore could help in preventing injuries...|$|E
