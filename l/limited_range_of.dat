5|$|In the game, {{the player}} assumes control of American forces and must {{eliminate}} all Japanese forces around the atoll by air or naval combat. The Battle For Midway received largely negative reviews upon release.

5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only be relevant to a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> depths. As the parameters {{move away from the}} base conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis {{is found}} {{throughout}} the highly <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the Lundy cabbage, including sheer sea cliffs and further inland at Millcombe House.

It had been hypothesised that P. luridipennis and Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes may help pollinate the Lundy cabbage, but observations of the taxa indicate that neither visit flowers. While there are no honey bees on Lundy, other species of winged insects are present. The plant may rely primarily upon pollen beetles of the genus Meligethes and the wind for pollination.|$|E

5|$|The flank vents have erupted {{andesite}} and dacite, {{belonging to}} a potassium-poor calcalkaline series. Such a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> composition is typical for these volcanoes but might reflect {{the small amount of}} research conducted on them. Tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by Monte Burney during the Pleistocene, according to compositional data. Holocene eruptions have near-identical composition. Minerals found in Burney rocks include amphibole, plagioclase and pyroxene; foreign components include clinopyroxene and olivine crystals as well as granite xenoliths stemming from the Patagonian batholith.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{clarinet}} {{developed from}} a Baroque instrument called the chalumeau. This instrument {{was similar to}} a recorder, but with a single-reed mouthpiece and a cylindrical bore. Lacking a register key, it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> about {{one and a half}} octaves. It had eight finger holes, like a recorder, and two keys for its two highest notes. At this time, contrary to modern practice, the reed was placed in contact with the upper lip.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{correlation}} between <b>limited</b> shoulder <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion in persons {{with spinal cord injury}} at discharge and the performance of activities, wheeling performance, transfers and participation one year later. Design: Multicentre prospective cohort study. Subjects: A total of 146 newly injured subjects with spinal cord injury. Methods: Shoulder <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion was measured at discharge. One year later, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), transfer ability, wheelchair circuit and Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities (PASIPD) were assessed. Corrections were made for possible confounding factors (age, gender, level and completeness of injury, time since injury and shoulder pain). Results: All subjects with <b>limited</b> shoulder <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion at discharge had a lower FIM motor score and were less likely (total group 5 times, and subjects with tetraplegia 10 times less likely) to be able to perform an independent transfer one year later. Subjects with <b>limited</b> shoulder <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion in the total group needed more time to complete the wheelchair circuit. No significant associations with the PASIPD were found in either group. Conclusion: Persons with spinal cord injury and <b>limited</b> shoulder <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion at discharge are more limited in their activities one year later than those without <b>limited</b> shoulder <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion...|$|R

5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E

5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} from the Admiralty required a detailed geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, particularly whether they rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and the effects of tides measured with specially constructed gauges. He chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival on 1 April the entire crew set to work. Darwin found a coconut economy, serving both the small settlement and wildlife. There was a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> native plants and no land birds, but hermit crabs everywhere. The lagoons teemed with a rich variety of invertebrates and fish, and he examined the atoll's structure in view of the theory he had developed in Lima, of encircling reefs becoming atolls as an island sank. This idea was supported by the numerous soundings FitzRoy had taken showing a steep slope outside the reef with no living corals below 20–30 fathoms (10–15m).|$|E
5|$|On 20 June, Company C, 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry (C/2-503) {{discovered}} {{the bodies of}} a Special Forces CIDG unit that had been missing for four days on Hill 1338, the dominant hill mass south of Dak To. Supported by A/2-503, the Americans moved {{up the hill and}} set up for the night. At 06:58 the following morning, Alpha Company began moving alone up a ridge finger and triggered an ambush by the 6th Battalion of the 24th PAVN Regiment. Charlie Company was ordered to support, but heavy vegetation and difficult terrain made movement extremely difficult. Artillery support was rendered ineffective by the <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> visibility. Close air support was impossible for the same reasons. Alpha Company managed to survive repeated attacks throughout the day and night, but the cost was heavy. Of the 137 men that comprised the unit, 76 had been killed and another 23 wounded. A search of the battlefield revealed only 15 dead North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking the silhouette of a small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E

To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{establishing}} exterior shots, {{and those}} of Tooms' house, were filmed around Hastings Street in Vancouver. When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a storm drain, the production crew arrived too late to secure the street for filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. The ventilation system through which the first victim is attacked at night {{was meant to be}} of a multistory car park. However, to avoid a costly tenting operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of the ventilation system was built in a lower level of the car park. Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the pilot episode. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> shots it afforded; most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street.|$|E
5|$|The later German monuments {{constructed}} by the Nazi government were substantial, but communicated a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> symbolic messages, focusing on German heroism, conservative nationalism sentiments and masculinity. Use of mass graves symbolised the sense of German community. When Paul von Hindenburg died in 1935, the Tannenberg Memorial was then used as his mausoleum, commemorating elite military leadership during the war. The Nazi government attempted to have the Jewish names removed from the war memorials, but this proved impractical and instead a law was passed forbidding their addition to any future memorials. The government also removed more experimental earlier war memorials which were felt to communicate an inappropriate message about the war, such {{as the work of}} Ernst Barlach.|$|E
