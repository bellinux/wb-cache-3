25|$|Respiration rate {{also appears}} to be {{influenced}} significantly by caste.

25|$|Bacon is a {{meat product}} {{prepared}} from cured pork. It is first cured using {{large quantities of}} salt, either a brine or a dry packing. Fresh bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, {{or it may be}} boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating. Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat. It can be made from the pork belly or from back cuts, which has <b>less</b> <b>fat</b> than the belly.|$|E

25|$|The major {{landmark}} {{of puberty}} for males is spermarche, the first ejaculation, which occurs, on average, at age 13. For females, it is menarche, {{the onset of}} menstruation, which occurs, on average, between ages 12 and 13. The age of menarche is influenced by heredity, but a girl's diet and lifestyle contribute as well. Regardless of genes, a girl must have a certain proportion of body fat to attain menarche. Consequently, girls who have a high-fat diet and who are not physically active begin menstruating earlier, on average, than girls whose diet contains <b>less</b> <b>fat</b> and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise (e.g. ballet and gymnastics). Girls who experience malnutrition or are in societies in which children are expected to perform physical labor also begin menstruating at later ages.|$|E
25|$|The {{fat content}} of meat can vary widely {{depending}} on the species and breed of animal, {{the way in which}} the animal was raised, including what it was fed, the anatomical part of the body, and the methods of butchering and cooking. Wild animals such as deer are typically leaner than farm animals, leading those concerned about fat content to choose game such as venison. Decades of breeding meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for meat with <b>less</b> <b>fat.</b> The fatty deposits that exist with the muscle fibers in meats soften meat when it is cooked and improve the flavor through chemical changes initiated through heat that allow the protein and fat molecules to interact. The fat, when cooked with meat, also makes the meat seem juicier. However, the nutritional contribution of the fat is mainly calories as opposed to protein. As fat content rises, the meat's contribution to nutrition declines. In addition, there is cholesterol associated with fat surrounding the meat. The cholesterol is a lipid associated with the kind of saturated fat found in meat. The increase in meat consumption after 1960 is associated with, though not definitively the cause of, significant imbalances of fat and cholesterol in the human diet.|$|E
500|$|McGovern's Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs {{expanded}} its scope to include national nutrition policy. In 1977 it issued {{a new set}} of nutritional guidelines for Americans that sought to combat leading killer health conditions. Titled Dietary Goals for the United States, but also known as the [...] "McGovern Report", it suggested that Americans eat <b>less</b> <b>fat,</b> less cholesterol, less refined and processed sugars, and more complex carbohydrates and fiber. While many public health officials had said all of this for some time, the committee's issuance of the guidelines gave it higher public profile. The recommendations proved controversial with the cattle, dairy, egg, and sugar industries, including from McGovern's home state. The McGovern committee guidelines led to reorganization of some federal executive functions and became the predecessor to the more detailed Dietary Guidelines for Americans later issued twice a decade by the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion.|$|E

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) –associated fat-redistribution syndrome {{is still a}} subject of controversy. There is, as yet, little agreement on the definition, etiology, and prevalence of the syndrome. Many studies have examined medication or disease-related factors. Fewer studies have examined patient-related factors. Illicit drug use is an important risk factor for HIV infection, yet the role of drug use in fat distribution has not been well described. We examined fat distribution, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, in relation to drug use, smoking, and alcohol use in Hispanic patients with HIV infection and control group of HIV-negative drug users. Our results suggest that neither drug use nor alcohol consumption are predictors of fat distribution. However, among men, smoking was independently associated with <b>less</b> total <b>fat,</b> <b>less</b> trunk <b>fat,</b> and more appendicular fat. The role of patient-specific factors in the etiology of HIV-associated fat-redistribution syndrome warrants further investigation. Although there is, as yet, no agreed-on definition of HIV-associated fat redistribution (or lipodystrophy) syndrome, there is general agreement that this syn-drome may include 1 features, including the accu-mulation of fat in the visceral area of the abdomen,...|$|R
2500|$|A supertaster is {{a person}} whose sense of taste is {{significantly}} more sensitive than average. The cause of this heightened response is likely, at least in part, due to an increased number of fungiform papillae. Studies have shown that supertasters require <b>less</b> <b>fat</b> and sugar in their food {{to get the same}} satisfying effects. However, contrary to what one might think, these people actually tend to consume more salt than the average person. This is due to their heightened sense of the taste of bitterness, and the presence of salt drowns out the taste of bitterness. (This also explains why supertasters prefer salted cheddar cheese over non-salted.) ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the cell}} location {{can alter the}} size of the larva and eventually determine which female Vespula vulgaris is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the hierarchy of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have <b>less</b> <b>fat</b> stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the [...] "higher" [...] the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate.
