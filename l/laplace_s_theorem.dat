40|$|In this Essay, we contest one of {{the main}} {{arguments}} for restricting corporate board voting to shareholders. In justifying the limitation of the franchise to shareholders, scholars have repeatedly turned to social choice theory — specifically, Arrow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> — to justify the exclusive shareholder franchise. Citing to the theorem, corporate law commentators have argued that lumping different groups of stakeholders together into the electorate would result in a lack of consensus and, ultimately, the lack of coherence that attends intransitive social choices, perhaps even leading the corporation to self-destruct. We contend that this argument is misguided. First, we argue that scholars have greatly overestimated the relative likelihood of cyclical outcomes with an expanded electorate. Second, even if a nascent intransitivity were to occur, there is almost no chance that it would manifest itself in inconsistent corporate decisions, much less ones that would cause a firm to self-destruct. Moreover, the exclusive shareholder franchise, like any other preference aggregation system, may avoid violating {{one of the}} conditions of Arrow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> only by violating another — a tradeoff that has never been explicitly acknowledged or defended.

In 1967, Sarason proved his commutant lifting theorem for H∞(D), from which an operator theoretic proof of the classical Nevanlinna-Pick theorem followed. Several competing noncommutative generalizations arose {{as a consequence of}} Sarason 2 ̆ 7 s result, and two strategies emerged for proving generalized Nevanlinna-Pick theorems: via a commutant lifting theorem or via a resolvent, or displacement, equation. We explore the difference between these two approaches. Specifically, we compare two theorems: one by Constantinescu-Johnson from 2003 and one by Muhly-Solel from 2004. Muhly-Solel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> is stated in the highly general context of W*-correspondences and is proved via commutant lifting. Constantinescu-Johnson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem,</b> while stated in a less general context, has the advantage of an elegant proof via a displacement equation. In order to make the comparison, we first generalize Constantinescu-Johnson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> to the setting of W*-correspondences in Theorem 3. 0. 1. Our proof, modeled after Constantinescu-Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s, hinges on a modified version of their displacement equation.

More specifically, interpolation in the sense of Muhly-Solel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> implies interpolation in the sense of Theorem 3. 0. 1, but the converse is not true. Nevertheless, we identify a commutativity assumption under which the two theorems yield the same result.
