25|$|On {{the same}} day the reichsmark {{replaced}} the <b>litas</b> as the official currency of the region, with 1 <b>litas</b> being exchanged for 40 pfennig. Until 20 May 1939 inhabitants of the Memelgebiet could exchange <b>litas</b> for reichsmarks.|$|E
25|$|On 25 June 1993, the <b>litas</b> {{was finally}} {{introduced}} {{at the rate}} of 1 <b>litas</b> to 100 talonas. 1 U.S. dollar was worth 4.5 litai and decreased to about 4.2 a couple of weeks later. Even the introduction of the <b>litas</b> was followed by a scandal. The government allowed the changing of unlimited amounts of talonas to the <b>litas</b> without having to show the source of the talonas. This allowed criminal groups to legalize their funds.|$|E
25|$|The Lithuanian <b>litas</b> (ISO {{currency}} code LTL, symbolized as Lt; plural litai (nominative) or litų (genitive)) was {{the currency of}} Lithuania, until 1 January 2015, when it {{was replaced by the}} euro. It was divided into 100 centų (genitive case; singular centas, nominative plural centai). The <b>litas</b> was first introduced on 2 October 1922 after World War I, when Lithuania declared independence and was reintroduced on 25 June 1993, following a period of currency exchange from the ruble to the <b>litas</b> with the temporary talonas then in place. The name was modeled after the name of the country (similar to Latvia and its lats). From 1994 to 2002, the <b>litas</b> was pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of 4 to 1. The <b>litas</b> was pegged to the euro at the rate of 3.4528 to 1 since 2002. The euro was expected to replace the <b>litas</b> by January 1, 2007, but persistent high inflation and the economic crisis delayed the switch. On 1 January 2015 the <b>litas</b> was switched to the euro at the rate of 3.4528 to 1.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} undercard matches was between <b>Lita</b> and Trish Stratus for the WWE Women's Championship. <b>Lita</b> engaged herself in a feud with Trish Stratus, after <b>Lita</b> and Edge {{interrupted}} Stratus' title match with Mickie James. <b>Lita</b> and Edge {{then went on to}} attack Stratus', only to involve Carlito, who was in an on-screen relationship with Stratus, to brawl with <b>Lita</b> and Edge. A scheduled tag team match between <b>Lita</b> and Edge versus Stratus and Carlito occurred, in which Edge and <b>Lita</b> were the winners. On the edition of August 28, 2006 of Raw, <b>Lita</b> revealed that Stratus would retire following Unforgiven, which was later confirmed by Stratus. On the edition of September 4 of Raw, Stratus challenged <b>Lita</b> to a match at Unforgiven for the WWE Women's title, for her retirement match, in which <b>Lita</b> accepted.|$|R
5|$|James {{dropped the}} WWE Women's Championship on August 14 to <b>Lita,</b> after <b>Lita</b> hit James {{with the title}} belt. After the Women's Championship was vacated due to the {{retirement}} of Trish Stratus, James entered a tournament to determine the new champion. She defeated Victoria and Melina {{en route to the}} finals at Cyber Sunday, where she lost to <b>Lita.</b> James transitioned into a face after she and <b>Lita</b> wrestled in a series of matches in which <b>Lita</b> chose stipulations to hinder James' wrestling ability. The feud between James and <b>Lita</b> ended at Survivor Series, where James defeated <b>Lita,</b> in the latter's retirement match, to win her second Women's Championship.|$|R
25|$|The <b>litas</b> became Lithuania's {{currency}} {{once more}} on June 25, 1993, when it replaced the temporary talonas currency {{at a rate}} of 1 <b>litas</b> to 100 talonas.|$|E
25|$|In November 1991, the Currency Issue Law {{was passed}} and the <b>Litas</b> Committee was created. It {{had the power to}} fix the date for the <b>litas</b> to come into circulation, the terms for the {{withdrawal}} from circulation of the ruble, the exchange rate of the <b>litas</b> and other conditions. Officials waited for a while for the economy to stabilize to not to expose the young <b>litas</b> to inflation. About 80% of Lithuania's trade was with Russia and the government needed {{to find a way to}} smooth the transition from the ruble zone. Also, Lithuania needed to gather funds to form a stabilization fund.|$|E
25|$|Coins were {{introduced}} in 1925 in denominations of 1 centas, 2 centai, 5 centai, 10, 20, 50 centų, and 1 <b>litas,</b> 2 litu, 5 litai, with the <b>litas</b> coins in silver. 10 litų coins {{were introduced}} in 1936. All these coins were designed by the sculptor Juozas Zikaras (1881–1944). The <b>litas</b> coins displayed Jonas Basanavičius and Vytautas the Great, which {{was replaced by a}} portrait of President Antanas Smetona.|$|E
40|$|Laser-induced thermal {{acoustics}} (<b>LITA)</b> is a four-wave mixing {{technique that}} may be employed to measure sound speeds, transport properties, velocities, and susceptibilities of fluids. It is particularly effective in high-pressure gases (> 1 bar). An analytical expression for <b>LITA</b> signals is derived {{by the use of}} linearized equations of hydrodynamics and light scattering. This analysis, which includes full finite-beam-size effects and the optoacoustic effects of thermalization and electrostriction, predicts the amplitude and the time history of narrow-band time-resolved <b>LITA</b> and broadband spectrally resolved (multiplex) <b>LITA</b> signals. The time behavior of the detected <b>LITA</b> signal depends significantly on the detection solid angle, with implications for the measurement of diffusivities by the use of <b>LITA</b> and the proper physical picture of <b>LITA</b> scattering. This and other elements of the physics of <b>LITA</b> that emerge from the analysis are discussed. Theoretical signals are compared with experimental <b>LITA</b> data...|$|R
50|$|Abraham's {{daughter}} {{explains to}} Bardagul {{that her father}} pawned half of his land to <b>Lita.</b> When {{it was time to}} pay up, <b>Lita</b> did not return the land. In fact, when <b>Lita</b> was about to resell her land, Abraham borrowed some money to get the land back to him; <b>Lita</b> then stopped the sale. The daughter does not even know how <b>Lita</b> transferred the land deeds to her name.|$|R
25|$|<b>Lita</b> also feuded with Trish Stratus {{over the}} WWE Women's Championship. On the October 25 episode of Raw, Stratus {{approached}} <b>Lita</b> backstage {{and told her}} that she had gained weight from her pregnancy, which led to <b>Lita</b> attacking Stratus. That same night, a match was made between the two for the Women's Championship at Survivor Series, in which Stratus defeated <b>Lita</b> by disqualification after <b>Lita</b> hit Stratus with a steel chair. On the November 22 episode of Raw, Stratus defeated <b>Lita</b> and Molly Holly in a Triple Threat match for the title. After the match, <b>Lita</b> attacked Stratus and caused Stratus's nose to bleed. On the December 6 episode of Raw, <b>Lita</b> defeated Stratus in the main event to capture the Women's Championship after performing a moonsault. On the January 3 episode of Raw, a rematch for the title was set for New Year's Revolution. The same night, Kane returned after weeks of inactivity to save <b>Lita</b> from being double-teamed by Snitsky and Trish Stratus.|$|R
25|$|This made it {{the last}} of the three Baltic states to adopt the euro, after Estonia (2011) and Latvia (2014). Before then, its currency, the <b>litas,</b> was pegged to the euro at 3.4528 <b>litas</b> to 1 euro.|$|E
25|$|Lietuvos Rytas journalists {{investigated}} {{the production of}} the <b>litas</b> and found that for a while it was purposely held back. For example, 6 million <b>litas</b> designated to pay for printing the banknotes stayed in a zero interest bearing account for a year in a bank in Sweden. By 1992, the <b>litas</b> was ready for introduction, but the banknotes were of extremely low quality (one could easily counterfeit them with a simple color printer; especially the 10, 20, and 50 litų banknotes).|$|E
25|$|The <b>litas</b> was {{established}} at {{a value of}} 10 litų = 1US dollar and was subdivided into 100 centų. In the face of worldwide economic depression, the <b>litas</b> appeared {{to be quite a}} strong and stable currency, reflecting the negligible influence of the depression on the Lithuanian economy. One <b>litas</b> was covered by 0.150462grams of gold stored by the Bank of Lithuania in foreign countries. In March 1923, the circulation amounted to 39,412,984 <b>litas,</b> backed by 15,738,964 in actual gold and by 24,000,000 in high exchange securities. It was required that at least one third of the total circulation would be covered by gold and the rest by other assets. By 1938, 1 U.S. dollar was worth about 5.9 litai, falling to about 20 U.S. cents before its disappearance in 1941.|$|E
500|$|<b>Lita</b> {{competed in}} the women's {{division}} throughout early 2004, winning a battle royal to become the number one contender for the Women's Championship on the April 5 episode of Raw. Victoria defeated <b>Lita</b> to retain the Women's Championship at Backlash on April 18. The next night on Raw, <b>Lita</b> was reunited with Matt Hardy when Hardy attacked Kane {{in an attempt to}} prevent him from harming <b>Lita,</b> beginning a new storyline involving the trio. In the following weeks, Kane began repeatedly assaulting Hardy and attempting to seduce <b>Lita.</b> During the course of the storyline, he kidnapped <b>Lita</b> and held her tied up backstage, and he persuaded Eric Bischoff to give her a title shot at Bad Blood on June 13, where she was defeated by Trish Stratus in a Fatal Four Way match that also included Gail Kim and defending champion Victoria. The next night on Raw, <b>Lita</b> revealed that she was pregnant. One week later, it appeared that Hardy was going to propose to <b>Lita,</b> but he was interrupted by Kane, who claimed to be the father of <b>Lita's</b> child. Two months later, it was revealed that Kane was, in fact, the father. Hardy and Kane feuded for several months, culminating in a [...] "Till Death Do Us Part" [...] match on August 15 at SummerSlam, with the stipulation that <b>Lita</b> would be obliged to marry the winner of the match. Kane won the match, leading to he and a reluctant <b>Lita</b> marrying one another on the August 23 episode of Raw. Despite being married to Kane, <b>Lita</b> thwarted him during his matches, constantly aiding his opponents. On the September 13 episode of Raw, <b>Lita</b> miscarried after Gene Snitsky struck Kane with a chair, resulting in him falling on <b>Lita.</b> The miscarriage led to <b>Lita</b> and Kane joining forces in order to take revenge on Snitsky.|$|R
50|$|The sixth {{match was}} a {{standard}} wrestling {{match for the}} WWF Women's Championship. Ivory defended the title against <b>Lita.</b> Early on in the contest, during an enziguri kick by <b>Lita,</b> one of Ivory's boots struck <b>Lita's</b> cheek, causing it to bleed heavily throughout the match. Ivory dominated much of the match, and towards the end Steven Richards came out and interfered on Ivory's behalf. But when Richards and Ivory consulted outside the ring, <b>Lita</b> attacked both of them by flying over the top rope. Back in the ring, <b>Lita</b> tried to perform a Moonsault, which she called Litasault on Ivory but Richards dragged Ivory out of the ring. The referee was distracted by Richards. Ivory took advantage and grabbed the Women's Championship, trying to hit <b>Lita</b> with it but <b>Lita</b> ducked and suplexed Ivory. She tried to perform a Litasault but Ivory used the title and <b>Lita</b> instead landed on the title. With the referee dealing with Richards, Ivory hit <b>Lita</b> with the Women's title belt and covered her for the pinfall. After the match, the crowd gave <b>Lita</b> a standing ovation due to her effort.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lita</b> and Josh {{traced the}} stolen bag {{to the park}} where the thief left it. It seems when the thief {{retrieved}} the voicemail, it triggered something which could be traced. <b>Lita</b> tries to explain this but Josh disagrees. <b>Lita</b> returns playful remarks then suddenly embraces Josh and gives him a passionate kiss. <b>Lita</b> says [...] "YES" [...] but Josh is confused. <b>Lita</b> reminds him of the dream he told her many times about proposing on the Spanish Steps in Italy, but didn't when they actually were on vacation there. This was enough for Josh {{to pull out the}} engagement ring from his pocket and confesses waiting for the right moment and puts it on <b>Lita's</b> finger. Both relieved, they hug and kiss then <b>Lita's</b> phone rings. Instead of another call to investigate another crime, it's a text from <b>Lita's</b> mother saying her phone was on and she heard the whole proposal. Josh picks up his phone reading a message that <b>Lita's</b> parents called his parents about the news. Thinking that all surprises have been revealed, <b>Lita</b> briefly mentions a baby shower in a comment peaking Josh's curiosity. The viewer is left wondering if <b>Lita</b> was distressed in the beginning because she was pregnant but not married to Josh or maybe she was just hinting at wanting to be.|$|R
25|$|Due to poor {{banknote}} quality (both talonas {{and early}} <b>litas)</b> {{it was easy}} to counterfeit them. Most shops were forced to acquire ultra violet lamps to check for forgeries. One group, for example, printed 500 talonas banknotes in Turkey. It is estimated that their notes totaled 140,000 <b>litas.</b>|$|E

25|$|Officials {{started to}} prepare for the {{introduction}} of the <b>litas</b> even before independence was declared, it was thought to introduce the <b>litas</b> alongside the ruble even if Lithuania remained a part of the Soviet Union. In December 1989, artists were asked to submit sketches of possible coin and banknote designs. Also, a list of famous people was compiled in order to determine who should be featured.|$|E
5|$|The {{match that}} {{followed}} was a Fatal 4-Way Match for the WWE Women's Championship, with Victoria defending the title against Trish Stratus, <b>Lita,</b> and Gail Kim. The {{start of the}} match saw Victoria and <b>Lita</b> double team Stratus, however, Stratus avoided the assault, as she rolled out of the ring. <b>Lita</b> and Victoria went on to double team Kim, however, Stratus pulled <b>Lita</b> out of the ring, afterward Victoria performed a moonsault and landed on Kim's torso. <b>Lita</b> then drove Kim's head into the mat.

25|$|In July, {{circulation}} of the talonas was stopped and on 1 August 1993, the <b>litas</b> {{became the only}} legal tender. Following the reintroduction of the <b>litas,</b> there {{was an effort to}} weed out U.S. dollars from the market. The talonas was never really trusted by the people and the ruble was very unstable. Thus, people started using U.S. dollars as a stable currency. Another alternative was the German mark, but it was not available in larger quantities. A lot of shops printed prices in several different currencies, including dollars, and the economy was very “dollarized” as it was legal to make trades in foreign currencies.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>litas</b> was {{introduced}} on 2 October 1922, replacing the ostmark and ostruble, {{both of which}} had been issued by the occupying German forces during World War I. The ostmark was known as the auksinas in Lithuania.|$|E
