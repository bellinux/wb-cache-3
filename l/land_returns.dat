[...] 110 [...] Such is not Charles' too, too active age, [...] Which, govern'd by the wild distemper'd rage [...] Of some black star infecting all the skies, [...] Made {{him at his}} own cost, like Adam, wise. [...] Tremble, ye nations, which, secure before, [...] Laugh'd at those arms that 'gainst {{ourselves}} we bore; [...] Roused by the lash of his own stubborn tail, [...] Our lion now will foreign foes assail. [...] With alga[21] who the sacred altar strews? [...] To all the sea-gods Charles an offering owes: [...] 120 [...] A bull to thee, Portumnus,[22] shall be slain, [...] A lamb to you, ye Tempests of the main: [...] For those loud storms that did against him roar, [...] Have cast his shipwreck'd vessel on the shore. [...] Yet as wise artists mix their colours so, [...] That by degrees they from each other go; [...] Black steals unheeded from the neighbouring white, [...] Without offending the well-cozen'd sight: [...] So on us stole our blessed change; while we [...] The effect did feel, but scarce the manner see. [...] 130 [...] Frosts that constrain the ground, and birth deny [...] To flowers that in its womb expecting lie, [...] Do seldom their usurping power withdraw, [...] But raging floods pursue their hasty thaw. [...] Our thaw was mild, the cold not chased away, [...] But lost in kindly heat of lengthen'd day. [...] Heaven would no bargain for its blessings drive, [...] But what we could not pay for, freely give. [...] The Prince of peace would like himself confer [...] A gift unhoped, without the price of war: [...] 140 [...] Yet, as he knew his blessing's worth, took care, [...] That we should know it by repeated prayer; [...] Which storm'd the skies, and ravish'd Charles from thence, [...] As heaven itself is took by violence. [...] Booth's[23] forward valour only served to show [...] He durst that duty pay we all did owe. [...] The attempt was fair; but Heaven's prefixed hour [...] Not come: so like the watchful traveller, [...] That by the moon's mistaken light did rise, [...] Lay down again, and closed his weary eyes. [...] 150 [...] 'Twas Monk whom Providence design'd to loose [...] Those real bonds false freedom did impose. [...] The blessed saints that watch'd this turning scene, [...] Did from their stars with joyful wonder lean, [...] To see small clues draw vastest weights along, [...] Not in their bulk, but in their order, strong. [...] Thus pencils can by one slight touch restore [...] Smiles to that changed face that wept before. [...] With ease such fond chimeras we pursue, [...] As fancy frames for fancy to subdue: [...] 160 [...] But when ourselves to action we betake, [...] It shuns the mint like gold that chemists make. [...] How hard was then his task! at once to be, [...] What in the body natural we see! [...] Man's Architect distinctly did ordain [...] The charge of muscles, nerves, and of the brain, [...] Through viewless conduits spirits to dispense; [...] The springs of motion from the seat of sense. [...] 'Twas not the hasty product of a day, [...] But the well-ripen'd fruit of wise delay. [...] 170 [...] He, like a patient angler, ere he strook, [...] Would let him play a while upon the hook. [...] Our healthful food the stomach labours thus, [...] At first embracing what it straight doth crush. [...] Wise leeches will not vain receipts obtrude, [...] While growing pains pronounce the humours crude: [...] Deaf to complaints, they wait upon the ill, [...] Till some safe crisis authorise their skill. [...] Nor could his acts too close a vizard wear, [...] To 'scape their eyes whom guilt had taught to fear, [...] 180 [...] And guard with caution that polluted nest, [...] Whence Legion twice before was dispossess'd: [...] Once sacred house; which, when they enter'd in, [...] They thought the place could sanctify a sin; [...] Like those that vainly hoped kind Heaven would wink, [...] While to excess on martyrs' tombs they drink. [...] And as devouter Turks first warn their souls [...] To part, before they taste forbidden bowls: [...] So these, when their black crimes they went about, [...] First timely charm'd their useless conscience out. [...] 190 [...] Religion's name against itself was made; [...] The shadow served the substance to invade: [...] Like zealous missions, they did care pretend [...] Of souls in show, but made the gold their end. [...] The incensed powers beheld with scorn from high [...] An heaven so far distant from the sky, [...] Which durst, with horses' hoofs that beat the ground, [...] And martial brass, belie the thunder's sound. [...] 'Twas hence at length just vengeance thought it fit [...] To speed their ruin by their impious wit. [...] 200 [...] Thus Sforza, cursed with a too fertile brain, [...] Lost by his wiles the power his wit did gain. [...] Henceforth their fougue[24] must spend at lesser rate, [...] Than in its flames to wrap a nation's fate. [...] Suffer'd to live, they are like helots set, [...] A virtuous shame within us to beget. [...] For by example most we sinn'd before, [...] And glass-like clearness mix'd with frailty bore. [...] But, since reform'd by what we did amiss, [...] We by our sufferings learn to prize our bliss: [...] 210 [...] Like early lovers, whose unpractised hearts [...] Were long the May-game of malicious arts, [...] When once they find their jealousies were vain, [...] With double heat renew their fires again. [...] 'Twas this produced the joy that hurried o'er [...] Such swarms of English to the neighbouring shore, [...] To fetch that prize, by which Batavia made [...] So rich amends for our impoverish'd trade. [...] Oh! had you seen from Schevelin's[25] barren shore, [...] (Crowded with troops, and barren now no more,) [...] 220 [...] Afflicted Holland to his farewell bring [...] True sorrow, Holland to regret a king! [...] While waiting him his royal fleet did ride, [...] And willing winds to their lower'd sails denied. [...] The wavering streamers, flags, and standard out, [...] The merry seamen's rude but cheerful shout: [...] And last the cannon's voice, that shook the skies, [...] And as it fares in sudden ecstasies, [...] At once bereft us both of ears and eyes. [...] The Naseby,[26] now no longer England's shame, [...] 230 [...] But better to be lost in Charles' name, [...] (Like some unequal bride in nobler sheets) [...] Receives her lord: the joyful London meets [...] The princely York, himself alone a freight; [...] The Swiftsure groans beneath great Gloster's[27] weight: [...] Secure as when the halcyon breeds, with these, [...] He that was born to drown might cross the seas. [...] Heaven could not own a Providence, and take [...] The wealth three nations ventured at a stake.

[...] The <b>land</b> <b>returns,</b> and, in the white it wears, [...] The marks of penitence and sorrow bears. [...] But you, whose goodness your descent doth show, [...] Your heavenly parentage and earthly too; [...] By that same mildness, which your father's crown [...] Before did ravish, shall secure your own. [...] Not tied to rules of policy, you find [...] 260 [...] Revenge less sweet than a forgiving mind. [...] Thus, when the Almighty would to Moses give [...] A sight of all he could behold and live; [...] A voice before his entry did proclaim [...] Long-suffering, goodness, mercy, in his name. [...] Your power to justice doth submit your cause, [...] Your goodness only is above the laws; [...] Whose rigid letter, while pronounced by you, [...] Is softer made. So winds that tempests brew, [...] When through Arabian groves they take their flight, [...] 270 [...] Made wanton with rich odours, lose their spite. [...] And as those lees, that trouble it, refine [...] The agitated soul of generous wine; [...] So tears of joy, for your returning spilt, [...] Work out, and expiate our former guilt. [...] Methinks I see those crowds on Dover's strand, [...] Who, in their haste to welcome you to land, [...] Choked up the beach with their still growing store, [...] And made a wilder torrent on the shore: [...] While, spurr'd with eager thoughts of past delight, [...] 280 [...] Those, who had seen you, court a second sight; [...] Preventing still your steps, and making haste [...] To meet you often wheresoe'er you past. [...] How shall I speak of that triumphant day, [...] When you renew'd the expiring pomp of May![28] [...] (A month that owns an interest in your name: [...] You and the flowers are its peculiar claim.)

5000|$|The València plains {{are known}} for their olive, mulberry, ilex, algaroba, orange, and palm trees, with the {{appearance}} of an [...] "immense garden". Such is the fertility of the soil, that two and three crops in the year are generally obtained, and the greater part of the <b>land</b> <b>returns</b> eight per cent. The rice crops are the most valuable, and are chiefly produced in the tract which is irrigated by the Albufera, a large lake in the neighbourhood of València. Rice being the principal food of the lower classes, the crop is generally consumed in the province, {{with the exception of a}} small quantity which finds its way into Castile and Andalusia. The other chief product is the white mulberry, once the source of great wealth: it was worked in the silk-factories of València. In 1828, the produce of silk from the vega of València amounted to one million of pounds yearly, the greater part of which was exported in its raw state, but the produce has greatly increased since, owing to demands from the manufacturers of Lyon and other towns in the south of France. The province of València is a notable producer of satins, silk ribbons, and velvets. The export of fruit from Valencia is also considerable, particularly of raisins. The raisins are of two kinds, the muscatel, and an inferior and smaller raisin, called pasa de legia. The export of figs, oil, and wine from the province and ports of València is also considerable, with a wine known as Beni Carlo, which as of 1843 was shipped to Cette. Mercury, copper, sulphur, arsenic, argentiferous lead, iron, coal, etc. are among the mineral products, but they are procured only in small quantities. Today, tourism is a major source of income, with the city of Valencia and the resort towns along the coast being the primary earners during the summer months.|$|E

In contrast, its impact on China’s stock market was moderate, with no structural change being detected in its returns and only weak structural change being found in the dynamics of its volatility.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{understand}} the impact of large-scale foreign land acquisitions on rural households. In order to address the research question, I consider four key pathways of influence of LSLA on rural households: Access to <b>land,</b> <b>returns</b> to <b>land,</b> <b>returns</b> to labour and price of agricultural goods. After an introductory first chapter, the second chapter defines the four pathways, {{provides an overview of}} the challenges that rural households face through the development process analyses how LSLA can integrate such process. The chapter shows the importance of national policy and institutional frameworks for shaping LSLA’s effect on rural households. The third chapter identifies the international, regional and national policy tools that regulate LSLA and rural households, including land access, environmental standards, labour rights and food security. The chapter highlights the differences in the land tenure system of Ethiopia and Tanzania, while describing the similar efforts by national governments to attract LSLA. The fourth chapter looks at the available qualitative evidence on the impact of LSLA on rural households in the two countries. The chapter’s main takeaway is that, despite the policy differences between Ethiopia and Tanzania, there are several elements of similarity in the reported effect of LSLA on the defined indicators of households’ welfare. The fifth chapter employs household survey data for both countries as well as data on land acquisitions to provide quantitative evidence of the impact of LSLA on rural communities. The chapter contributes to the newly-developing body of quantitative literature on the topic, providing a mixed picture of the impact of LSLA on the four defined pathways...|$|E
40|$|After a short {{representation}} of the population theory and the law of diminishing <b>land</b> <b>returns,</b> the author characterises the world wheat market, drawing {{attention to the fact}} that already for many years the rate of wheat growth exceeds that of population growth.

The world wheat reserves also show a growing tendency — what in turn has its effect on prices on the world market. The author dwells next on efforts to bring some order in the world wheat market. He puts forward an opinion that something must change in the world demographic picture. The pressure to increase wheat production cannot have a permanent character.

40|$|Abstract. The {{homogeneous}} {{and repeated}} data cov-erage over coastal regions from satellite radar altimetry is one important data source for oceano-graphic and geodetic applications. However, the sea surface heights (SSH) {{extracted from the}} al-timeter data are often in error close to the coast, {{due in part to}} the complex nature of echoes returned from rapidly varying coastal topographic surfaces (both land and sea) and the generally rougher sea state. This paper presents improved SSH results derived from ERS- 2 altimeter waveform data (two cycles of 35 -day repeat orbit, March to May 1999) near the Australian coast using a coastal retracking system. This system was developed based upon a systematic and comprehensive analysis of return waveforms. Central to the system is the use of two retracking techniques: the iterative least squares fitting and the threshold retracking algorithms. Using the AUSGeoid 98 geoid grid as a quasi-independent ground reference and comparing with a broad contaminated distance of ~ 10 km obtained from a previous study before retracking, the use of the retracking system is able to reduce this con-taminated distance to ~ 5 km. However, improved SSH data cannot be recovered by waveform re-tracking less than ~ 5 km from the coastline due to predominant <b>land</b> <b>returns</b> in the waveform range window...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the shoreline {{is the basis for}} defining boundaries between private, state, and federal ownership and jurisdictions, including the territorial sea and the Exclusive Economic Zone. Though the use of airborne lidar bathymetry (ALB) is not new, there is still a need for more reliable results using ALB in defining the shorelines. Previous algorithms for defining the shoreline (land-water determination) have used; (1) the presence of a saturated peak in the infrared-channel waveforms, or (2) a ratio between the green-channel, red- channel and infrared-channel waveforms. Research and development for both algorithms were applied to the older SHOALS- 400 lidar that varies in dynamic range and waveform record length from the current SHOALS- 1000 / 3000 lidars. Observations of the red-channel waveforms show a strong dependence between the waveform and the presence of water. Different waveform characteristics are found from water and <b>land</b> <b>returns</b> (bare earth and vegetation coverage). We present here an algorithm for distinguishing land or water using the lidar red-channel waveforms. The data for this study are from (1) the 2000 - 2001 USGS surveys in Lake Michigan and Lake Tahoe, CA using the SHOALS- 400 lidar system and (2) the NOAA survey in the Isles of Shoals, NH-ME using the SHOALS- 1000. The algorithm shows good preliminary results both for the older and the current SHOALS systems. Aerial photogrammetry was used as reference data to support the findings...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we use CryoSat- 2 SAR (delay-Doppler synthetic-aperture radar) data in the Mekong River Basin to {{estimate}} water levels. Compared to classical pulse limited radar altimetry, medium- and small-sized inland waters can be observed with CryoSat- 2 SAR data with a higher accuracy due to the smaller along track footprint. However, even with this SAR data the estimation of water levels over a medium-sized river (width less than 500 m) is still challenging with only very few consecutive observations over the water. The target identification with land–water masks tends to fail as the river becomes smaller. Therefore, we developed a classification approach to divide the observations into water and <b>land</b> <b>returns</b> {{based solely on the}} data. The classification is done with an unsupervised classification algorithm, and it is based on features derived from the SAR and range-integrated power (RIP) waveforms. After the classification, classes representing water and land are identified. Better results are obtained when the Mekong River Basin is divided into different geographical regions: upstream, middle stream, and downstream. The measurements classified as water are used in a next step to estimate water levels for each crossing over a river in the Mekong River network. The resulting water levels are validated and compared to gauge data, Envisat data, and CryoSat- 2 water levels derived with a land–water mask. The CryoSat- 2 water levels derived with the classification lead to more valid observations with fewer outliers in the upstream region than with a land–water mask (1700 with 2 % outliers vs. 1500 with 7 % outliers). The median of the annual differences that is used in the validation is in all test regions smaller for the CryoSat- 2 classification results than for Envisat or CryoSat- 2 land–water mask results (for the entire study area: 0. 76 m vs. 0. 96 m vs. 0. 83 m, respectively). Overall, in the upstream region with small- and medium-sized rivers the classification approach is more effective for deriving reliable water level observations than in the middle stream region with wider rivers...|$|E
