40|$|Lysolecithins {{are added}} to poultry diets to promote the {{intestinal}} absorption of nutrients, in particular of dietary fats. Lysolecithins contain a mixture of phospho- and lysophospholipids and differ in composition depending on the conditions and source of the lecithin used for its production. The importance of the lysolecithin composition and its interaction with the fat type was investigated in vitro in a fat digestion model and in vivo in a digestibility trial with broilers (24 to 28 d age). The in vitro digestion of soybean oil and <b>pig</b> <b>lard</b> was investigated without and with the inclusion of soybean or rapeseed lysolecithin. Correspondingly, for the digestibility trial, 108 Ross 308 male broilers were assigned to 6 dietary treatments: a basal diet with either soybean oil (5. 3 %) or <b>pig</b> <b>lard</b> (5. 8 %), each basal diet supplemented with 250 ppm soybean lysolecithin, and each basal diet supplemented with 250 ppm rapeseed lysolecithin. In vitro <b>pig</b> <b>lard</b> digestibility was significantly lower compared to soybean oil digestibility. Although in vivo no significant difference was observed for crude fat digestibility, broilers fed the basal diet with <b>pig</b> <b>lard</b> had a lower (P < 0. 05) DM digestibility, nitrogen retention, and AMEn compared to those fed the basal diet with soybean oil. Lysolecithin supplementation showed a significant interaction with the fat type, both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro hydrolysis of <b>pig</b> <b>lard,</b> but not of soybean oil, increased (P < 0. 001) with supplementation of soybean and rapeseed lysolecithin. Moreover, soybean and rapeseed lysolecithin supplementation improved (P < 0. 05) DM digestibility of the basal diet with <b>pig</b> <b>lard</b> by 5. 1 and 5. 7 %, respectively; nitrogen retention by 2. 8 and 3. 1 [*]g/kg, respectively; and AMEn by 182 and 199 kcal/kg, respectively. Despite the major difference in molecular composition, there was, however, no impact of the lysolecithin composition on in vitro and in vivo fat digestibility. This study demonstrates that the improvements {{that can be made}} with lysolecithin supplementation are highly dependent on the fat incorporated in broiler feeds. status: publishe...|$|R

Dry matter (DM) digestibility, nitrogen retention and AMEn were lower (P< 0. 05) for T 2 compared to T 1. Addition of lysolecithin improved (P< 0. 05) DM digestibility of the <b>pig</b> <b>lard</b> diet by 5. 1 %, nitrogen retention by 2. 8 g/kg and AMEn by 760 kJ/kg.

However, bioremediation processes - using microorganisms to degrade these hazardous materials - can provide a solution for this problem. Several rhodococci are able to assimilate many hydrophobic materials converting them into biomass and CO 2.

40|$|The {{digestion}} of {{fats and}} oils in broilers is a complex process. It involves emulsification, hydrolysis and absorption of the ingested fats. Several factors can affect the fat digestion process by interfering {{with one or more}} of these steps. In order to promote the digestion and absorption of nutrients, in particular of dietary {{fats and oils}}, lysophospholipids under the form of lysolecithin are supplemented to the diet. It is postulated that together with bile salts, the lysophospholipids act as an emulsifier within the first stages of lipid digestion. Yet, only few researchers have investigated lysophospholipid supplementation to broiler diets and the exact mode(s) of action of these lysophospholipids remain(s) to be elucidated. The present dissertation includes complementary in vitro and in vivo studies to investigate the impact of supplemented lysophospholipids on fat digestion in broilers. The first objective was to determine the impact of lysophospholipids on lipid hydrolysis and absorption. A novel in vitro lipid hydrolysis model and an in vitro lipid absorption model were developed to investigate these particular stages in lipid digestion. The hydrolysis of straight palm oil, palm oil supplemented with soybean lecithin and palm oil supplemented with soybean lysolecithin were compared in simulated intestinal conditions with low bile salts. The triglyceride hydrolysis rate was significantly lower in palm oil supplemented with soybean lecithin than in straight palm oil. In contrast, the triglyceride hydrolysis rate was significantly higher in palm oil supplemented with soybean lysolecithin. The digests obtained after in vitro hydrolysis were subjected to the in vitro absorption model. The absorption of both monoglycerides and free fatty acids was higher for the digests of palm oil supplemented with lysolecithin than for those of straight palm oil and of palm oil supplemented with lecithin. These results proved that both hydrolysis and absorption of lipids is improved by lysophospholipid supplementation. The findings suggest that lysophospholipids improved the hydrolysis on the one hand by reducing the size of the emulsion droplet, thereby increasing the available surface area for enzymes and on the other hand by displacing monoglycerides and free fatty acids from the oil-water interface of the emulsion droplet. In contrast, phospholipids likely impaired the adsorption of the colipase-lipase complex to the surface of the emulsion droplet by competing for the available surface area. The mechanism behind the improved absorption of lipids remains unclear. Possibly lysophospholipids improved absorption of lipids by their participation in micelle formation. Lysophospholipids may also alter the membrane structure and its properties. The second objective was to reveal the interactions between bile salts and supplemented lysophospholipids. These interactions were investigated by subjecting five distinct mixtures of phospholipids and lysophospholipids to an in vitro lipid hydrolysis model. The hydrolysis rate significantly improved with increasing bile salt concentrations. Additionally, a significant interaction between the phospho- and lysophospholipids and the bile salt concentration was found. The majority of phospholipids and lysophospholipids showed a negative correlation with triglyceride hydrolysis at the theoretically low concentration of 0. 2 g/L of bile extract, a positive correlation at 2. 0 g/L and no correlation at 20. 0 g/L. These finding suggest that especially when a limited amount of bile is secreted (e. g. in young animals) the hydrolysis can be improved by including lysophospholipids in the diet. The findings were confirmed in a digestibility trial with young broilers. The crude fat digestibility, the dry matter digestibility and the apparent metabolisable energy were higher in broilers fed the basal diet supplemented with lysolecithin than in those fed the basal diet without supplementation. The third objective was to demonstrate the interactions between fat type in the diet and supplemented lysophospholipids. These interactions were first investigated in vitro in a lipid hydrolysis model. The in vitro hydrolysis of soybean oil and <b>pig</b> <b>lard</b> was investigated without and with the inclusion of soybean or rapeseed lysolecithin. The hydrolysis rate of <b>pig</b> <b>lard</b> was significantly lower than that of soybean oil. Supplementation of soybean and rapeseed lysolecithin significantly increased the hydrolysis of <b>pig</b> <b>lard.</b> In contrast, hydrolysis of soybean oil was not significantly improved by soybean or rapeseed lysolecithin supplementation. The findings were confirmed in a digestibility trial with broilers fed diets formulated with either soybean oil or <b>pig</b> <b>lard.</b> Although in vivo no significant difference was observed for crude fat digestibility, broilers fed the basal diet with <b>pig</b> <b>lard</b> had a lower dry matter digestibility, nitrogen retention and apparent metabolisable energy compared to those fed the basal diet with soybean oil. Soybean and rapeseed lysolecithin supplementation improved dry matter digestibility, nitrogen retention and apparent metabolisable energy of the basal diet with <b>pig</b> <b>lard.</b> In contrast, soybean and rapeseed lysolecithin supplementation did not significantly improve the digestibility and energy value of the basal diet with soybean oil. An objective of this work was also to investigate the importance of the chemical composition of lysolecithins. Throughout this work different mixtures of phospho- and lysophospholipids under the form of (lyso) lecithin were subjected to in vitro lipid hydrolysis experiments and to in vivo trials with broilers. The outcome of a particular broiler digestibility trial revealed that not only lysophosphatidylcholine, but also other phospho- and lysophospholipids contribute to the beneficial effects of (lyso) lecithins in broiler feeds. A comparison between different (lyso) phospholipid mixtures in an in vitro model and in an in vivo digestibility trial suggested that lysophospholipids rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids are less effective than those containing saturated fatty acids. Overall, the beneficial effect of lysophospholipid supplementation was most pronounced with the use of the soybean lysolecithin with the highest degree of saturated lysophospholipids. In conclusion, the present research (1) confirms that lysolecithins are able to improve the digestibility and metabolisable energy values of feed, (2) reveals that, in addition to the emulsification of lipids, lysophospholipids are able to improve the hydrolysis and absorption of lipids, (3) demonstrates that the influence of phospho- and lysophospholipids on the lipid hydrolysis process depends both on the type of the phospho- and lysophospholipids and on the concentrations of bile present in the digestive fluids, (4) shows that the beneficial effects lysophospholipid supplementation are particularly pronounced in young broilers, (5) proves that the beneficial effects lysophospholipid supplementation are more pronounced when the diets are formulated with saturated fat sources, (6) provides evidence that not only lysophosphatidylcholine, but also other phospho- and lysophospholipids contribute to the beneficial effects of (lyso) lecithins in broiler feeds and (7) establishes that the phospho- and lysophospholipid composition (phosphatidyl substituent and fatty acid profile) of lecithins and lysolecithins is an important factor affecting their potential to improve nutrient digestibility in broiler diets. This means that in practice the supplementation of broiler diets with lysophospholipids is especially of importance in the starter phase of broiler production and when more saturated fats are included in the diet. Additionally, the modes of action of phospholipids provided by lecithins included in the diet clearly differ from those of lysophospholipids provided by lysolecithins supplemented to the diet.

Hold 20 strands of pubic hair in the mouth, and swallow the juice. This will prevent the snake's toxin from entering the abdomen.Human pubic hair is good for treating dystocia with transverse or footling presentation. Burn l4 pieces of pubic hair of the patient's husband, blend the residue with <b>pig</b> <b>lard,</b> and make into pills the size of soy beans. Swallow the pills. - Qiaijin Yaofang (Essential Prescriptions worth a Thousand Gold).Li Shizhen: Female pubic hair is good for treating stranguria of five types and the Yinyangyi syndrome (febrile disease transmitted by sex).Prescriptions Two prescriptions collected recently.Prescription 52.26.1: To treat the Yinyangyi syndrome (febrile disease transmitted by sex): After a man has just recovered from a serious disease, and he has sex too soon, his scrotum will become swollen and will shrink into his abdomen. This will be accompanied by severe colic. Burn female pubic hair into ash and take it by mouth right away. Also drink water in which female genitalia have been washed. - Puji Fang (Prescriptions for Universal Relief).Prescription 52.26.2: To treat an ox that is dying {{from the effects of}} a distended abdomen: Wrap female pubic hair in straw and feed it to the ox. This will work. - Waitai Miyao (Medical Secrets of an Official). (tr. Luo 2003: 4178)Luo (2003: 4133) explains translating [...] "Clause" [...] instead of [...] "Drug" [...] in chapter 52: [...] "As most of the [...] "drugs" [...] from human being are no more used medically, it seems rude to list them as drugs." [...] Note the medical terms [...] "A slow or difficult labor or delivery" [...] and stranguria (i.e., [...] "A painful, frequent need to urinate, when the bladder is largely empty or with little urine production").|$|R
40|$|Background: Increasing {{prevalence}} of obesity and overweight in the Western world, {{continue to be a}} major health threat and is responsible for increased health care costs. Dietary intervention studies show a strong positive association between saturated fat intake and the development of obesity and cardiovascular disease. This study investigated the effect of positional distribution of palmitic acid (Sn- 1, 2 & 3) of palm oil on cardiovascular health and development of obesity, using weaner pigs as a model for young children. Methods: Male and female weaner piglets were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatment groups: 1) pork lard (LRD); 2) natural palm olein (NPO); 3) chemically inter-esterified PO (CPO) and 4) enzymatically inter-esterified PO (EnPO) as the fat source. Diets were formulated with 11 % lard or with palm olein in order to provide 31 % of digestible energy from fat in the diet and were balanced for cholesterol, protein and energy across treatments. Results: From 8 weeks onwards, pigs on EnPO diet gained (P < 0. 05) more weight than all other groups. Feed conversion efficiency (feed to gain) over the 12 week experimental period did not vary between treatment groups. Plasma LDL-C content and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio in pigs fed natural PO tended to be lower compared to all other diets. The natural PO lowered (P < 0. 02) the plasma triglyceride (TG) content relative to the lard or EnPO diets, but was not different from the CPO diet. The natural PO diet was associated with lower (P < 0. 05) saturated fat levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue than the CPO and EnPO diets that had lower saturated fat levels than the <b>lard</b> diet. Female <b>pigs</b> had lower lean and higher fat and fat:lean ratio in the body compared with male pigs. No difference in weight gain or blood lipid parameters was observed between sexes. Conclusions: The observations on plasma TG, muscle and adipose tissue saturated fatty acid contents and back fat (subcutaneous) thickness suggest that natural palm oil may reduce deposition of body fat. In addition, dietary supplementation with natural palm oil containing palmitic acid at different positions in meat producing animals may lead to the production of meat and meat products with lower saturated fats. An increase in fat content and a decrease in lean content in female pigs resulted in an increased body fat:lean ratio but gender had no effect on blood lipid parameters or insulin concentrations. <br /...|$|R
