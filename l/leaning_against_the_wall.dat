5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to the painting about an hour after it was first displayed. He had forgotten a hammer and nails to hang the painting, and had left it <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> for an hour. Shortly after he returned, city aldermen, police officers and local reporters arrived at the scene, leading to a dramatic confrontation between aldermen and other students, while Nelson remained incognito nearby.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> looking into the shed. Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} the first album by the band {{released}} on the Harvest label. The cover artwork shows a Droste effect featuring the group, with a picture {{hanging on the wall}} showing the same scene, except that the band members have switched positions. The cover of the original LP varies between the British, American/Canadian and Australian releases. The British version has the album Gigi <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> immediately above the [...] "Pink Floyd" [...] letters. At a talk given at Borders bookstore in Cambridge on 1 November 2008, as part of the [...] "City Wakes" [...] project, Storm Thorgerson explained that the album was introduced as a red herring to provoke debate, and that it has no intended meaning. On most copies of American and Canadian editions, the Gigi cover is airbrushed to a plain white sleeve, apparently because of copyright concerns, but the earliest American copies do show the Gigi cover, and it was restored for the American remastered CD edition. On the Australian edition, the Gigi cover is completely airbrushed, not even leaving a white square behind. The house used as the location for the front cover of the album is located in Great Shelford, near Cambridge.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the first}} dawn of {{daylight}} appeared, giving fresh hopes {{to the few}} survivors. There were now only some six or eight standing by the window, and a few standing or <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> around. <b>The</b> room itself was heaped high with the dead.|$|R

500|$|Bassist Frank Zincavage met Iyall at the SF Art Institute; the two {{hit it off}} and {{discussed}} putting a band together. They formed one with Woods and Derrah a few weeks later, drawing inspiration from the [...] "burgeoning local punk and post-punk scenes". Iyall recruited Woods because she enjoyed playing {{with him in the}} Mommers and Poppers. [...] " [...] seemed only natural that we invite Peter Woods to join us [...] played clean and was a natural on rhythm guitar." [...] Romeo Void officially formed on Valentine's Day in 1979. According to Iyall, the name Romeo Void referred to [...] "a lack of romance" [...] and came to mind after they saw a local magazine with the headline [...] "Why single women can't get laid in San Francisco." [...] The band practiced in Iyall's flat in Mission District. It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement. [...] "Even though I was going to the [...] so much, I also had criticisms: Everyone was <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> wearing black," [...] Iyall said. [...] "I guess we were considered new wave, but for me Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached blond and everything being about despair and no future, when I thought the do-it-yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions, and all the different colors. [...] I was proud of being American Indian, so I purposely never bleached my hair blond." ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{the music}} videos for [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] "Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)", and [...] "Diva", {{the one for}} [...] "Ego" [...] was shot in black and white. The word [...] "bitch" [...] is muted out when Beyoncé sings, [...] "I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch!". [...] "Ego" [...] is the first video from I Am... Sasha Fierce in which she has curly afro hair, {{similar to the one}} in [...] "Work It Out". It is also the first video from the Sasha Fierce disc of her album where she does not don her robot-glove. The video {{features}} Beyoncé and her two backup female dancers all dressed in silver leotards and performing similar choreography, which has reminiscence of that of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Later, Beyoncé sits on a white glittery chair in front of the same tiled background; she is wearing black coat and the two dancers are still dancing in unison around her. There are a few shots of her on the chair facing the back of the camera with the dancers doing the same. Beyoncé then gets up to join the dance being executed by the two female around the chair. This scene ends as they walk {{to the left of the}} camera, into the next scene. Beyoncé is still with the tiled background. She and her dancers are now holding poles as props with which they dance. During the same pole scene, some shots of her singing in the chair are intercut. In the next scene, with the same tiled background, Beyoncé is <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> as the bridge of the song has been reached. Her dancers spin in heels around her, and they all then continue to dance against the wall. The last scene shows Beyoncé in the chair, without the black jacket and still dancing until the song ends.|$|E
2500|$|I {{had these}} pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to put}} together. I had a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And {{all of a sudden he}} got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ... I had these sections, and I knew what order they were going to go in, but it was just a matter of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|E

2500|$|George de Mohrenschildt {{testified that}} he [...] "knew that Oswald disliked General Walker." [...] Regarding this, de Mohrenschildt and his wife Jeanne {{recalled}} an incident that occurred the weekend following the Walker assassination attempt. The de Mohrenschildts testified that on April 14, 1963, just before Easter Sunday, they were visiting the Oswalds at their new apartment and had brought them a toy Easter bunny to give to their child. As Oswald's wife Marina was showing Jeanne around the apartment, they discovered Oswald's rifle standing upright, <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> inside a closet. Jeanne told George that Oswald had a rifle, and George joked to Oswald, [...] "Were you the one who took a pot-shot at General Walker?" [...] When asked about Oswald's reaction to this question, George de Mohrenschildt told the Warren Commission that Oswald [...] "smiled at that." [...] When George's wife Jeanne was asked about Oswald's reaction, she said, [...] "I didn't notice anything"; she continued, [...] "we started laughing our heads off, big joke, big George's joke." [...] Jeanne de Mohrenschildt testified {{that this was the}} last time she or her husband ever saw the Oswalds.|$|E

40|$|Photograph {{of guests}} {{sitting on the}} veranda of the Florence Hotel in San Diego, ca. 1888.

40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of American Expeditionary Force {{barracks in}} Europe during World War I, ca. 1915. About twenty-five uniformed soldiers {{are standing in}} front of and {{to the left of the}} barracks.

The barracks themselves are composed of several long rectangular buildings with peaked roofs and wooden walls. There are several small square windows lining the sides.

60|$|The host, and the candle, forsook {{us at the}} door. The stanza {{would have}} been in {{complete}} darkness, save for that rushing bouquet of new flames in the chimney, like fresh flowers. By this firelight we saw the room. It was like a dungeon, absolutely empty, with an uneven, earthen floor, quite dry, and high bare walls, gloomy, with a handbreadth of window high up. There was no furniture at all, save a little wooden bench, a foot high, before the fire, and several home-made-looking rush mats rolled up and <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> Furthermore a chair before the fire on which hung wet table-napkins. Apart from this, it was a high, dark, naked prison-dungeon.|$|R

60|$|Followed by Mike, {{he turned}} in {{at one of the}} doors. A group of men <b>leaning</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite}} <b>wall</b> looked at them without curiosity.
