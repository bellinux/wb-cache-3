5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and <b>Lewy</b> <b>Body</b> dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and <b>Lewy</b> <b>body</b> formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E

40|$|X-linked {{inhibitor}} of apoptosis protein (XIAP) {{blocks the}} apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting caspases- 3, 7, and 9. XIAP is negatively {{regulated by the}} mitochondrial serine protease, HtrA 2 /Omi. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the role of XIAP and the relationship between XIAP and HtrA 2 /Omi in patients with Parkinson's disease or dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies.</b> We conducted immunohistochemical studies on XIAP in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from eight normal participants, 10 patients with Parkinson's disease, five patients with dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies,</b> and seven patients with Alzheimer's disease, and then double-labeling immunohistochemistry for XIAP and HtrA 2 /Omi in sections from the Parkinson's disease and dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> cases. Brainstem-type and cortical <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> were intensely immunostained for XIAP, and XIAP immunoreactivity was localized to the halos of brainstem-type <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> and to the entire <b>bodies</b> of cortical <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies.</b> Double immunofluorescence analyses showed that XIAP and HtrA 2 /Omi immunoreactivities were colocalized to both types of <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies.</b> Our results suggest that XIAP may be partially associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aetiology}} {{of visual}} hallucinations is poorly understood in dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies.</b> Pathological alterations in visual cortical excitability {{may be one}} contributory mechanism. AIMS: To determine visual cortical excitability in people with dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> compared with aged-matched controls and also the relationship between visual cortical excitability and visual hallucinations in dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies.</b> METHOD: Visual cortical excitability was determined by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the occiput to elicit phosphenes (transient subjective visual responses) in 21 patients with dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> and 19 age-matched controls. RESULTS: Phosphene parameters were similar between both groups. However, in the patients with dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies,</b> TMS measures of visual cortical excitability correlated strongly with the severity of visual hallucinations (P = 0. 005). Six patients with dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> experienced visual hallucination-like phosphenes (for example, seeing people or figures on stimulation) compared {{with none of the}} controls (P = 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Increased visual cortical excitability in dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> does not appear to explain visual hallucinations but it may be a marker for their severity...|$|R

25|$|Currently, an {{estimated}} 60 to 75% of diagnosed dementias {{are of the}} Alzheimer's and mixed (Alzheimer's and vascular dementia) type, 10 to 15% are <b>Lewy</b> <b>body</b> type, with the remaining types being of an entire spectrum of dementias, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (Pick's disease), alcoholic dementia, pure vascular dementia, etc. Dementia with Lewy bodies tends to be under-recognized.

50|$|Lewy neurites are {{abnormal}} neurites in diseased neurons, containing {{granular material}} and abnormal α-synuclein filaments {{similar to those}} found in <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies.</b> Like <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies,</b> <b>Lewy</b> neurites are a feature of α-synucleinopathies such as dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies,</b> Parkinson's disease, and multiple system atrophy.

5000|$|The {{first major}} {{proposed}} cause of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is the bundling, or oligomerization, of proteins. The protein alpha-synuclein has increased {{presence in the}} brains of Parkinson's Disease patients and, as α-synuclein is insoluble, it aggregates to form <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> (shown to left) in neurons. Traditionally, <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> {{were thought to be}} the main cause of cell death in Parkinson's disease; however, more recent studies suggest that <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> lead to other effects that cause cell death. Regardless, <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> are widely recognized as a pathological marker of Parkinson's disease.|$|R
25|$|In most cases, motor {{symptoms}} predominate at early PD stages, while cognitive disturbances (such as dementia) emerge later. Until recently, {{the onset}} of parkinsonism in PD relative to dementia {{was used as an}} arbitrary criterion to clinically distinguish PD dementia (PDD) and <b>Lewy</b> <b>body</b> dementia (DLB) using a ‘one-year rule’. Dementia onset within 12-months of or {{at the same time as}} motor dysfunctions qualified as DLB, whereas in PDD, parkinsonism had to precede dementia by at least one year. Some researchers have proposed elimination of this arbitrary criterion, although consensus has not been reached at this time.|$|E
25|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} in parkinsonian syndromes {{for a variety of}} reasons. An overlap exists between PD and <b>Lewy</b> <b>body</b> dementia, so that where Lewy bodies are present in the visual cortex, {{hallucinations}} may result. Hallucinations can also be brought about by excessive dopaminergic stimulation. Most hallucinations are visual in nature, often formed as familiar people or animals, and are generally not threatening in nature. Some patients find them comforting; however, their caregivers often find this part of the disease most disturbing, and the occurrence of hallucinations is a major risk factor for hospitalisation. Treatment options consist of modifying the dosage of dopaminergic drugs taken each day, adding an antipsychotic drug such as quetiapine, or offering caregivers a psychosocial intervention to help them cope with the hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 {{the first}} climbers from Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Tunisia reached {{the summit of}} Mount Everest. Only two other people from North Africa have summited Everest, one from Algeria and the other from Morocco. The {{youngest}} Australian woman to summit Mount Everest was Alyssa Azar. She returned to Australia safely, but a bittersweet victory for Australia after the loss of another Australian woman who was also trying to summit that May with her husband. The youngest Japanese woman also summited (and returned alive) {{at the age of}} 19. Another woman record-breaker in 2016 was the first woman from Thailand to summit Mount Everest, Napassaporn Chumnarnsit, who was granted an audience with the Prime Minister of Thailand for her achievement. The first person with Cystic Fibrosis also summited Mount Everest on his third try. Also, a 61-year old summited with two artificial knees. He had been trying for several years and had lost his Nepali friend Sherpa Nawang Tenzing in the 2015 earthquakes. He was not alone in being grief-stricken, as many climbers connected with the Everest mountaineering community lost climbing buddies in two years of disasters.

40|$|Dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> is {{characterized}} by the accumulation of <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> and <b>Lewy</b> neurites in the CNS, both of which are composed mainly of aggregated a-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser 129.

In the present study we applied array tomography, a microscopy technique that combines ultrathin sectioning of tissue with immunofluorescence allowing precise identification of small structures, to quantitatively investigate the synaptic phosphorylated a-synuclein pathology in dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies.</b> We performed array tomography on human brain samples from five patients with dementia with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies,</b> five patients with Alzheimer’s disease and five healthy control subjects to analyse the presence of phosphorylated a-synuclein immunoreactivity at the synapse and their relationship with synapse size.

Parkinson's disease is usually associated with a degraded substantia nigra pars compacta, but recent evidence suggests that PD affects a number of sites in the brain.

2500|$|Pathologically, DLB is {{characterized}} by the development of abnormal collections of (alpha-synuclein) protein within the cytoplasm of neurons (known as Lewy bodies). These intracellular collections of protein have similar structural features to [...] "classical" [...] Lewy bodies, seen subcortically in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, those affected by DLB experience a loss of dopamine-producing neurons (in the substantia nigra) {{in a manner similar to}} that seen in Parkinson's disease. A loss of acetylcholine-producing neurons (in the basal nucleus of Meynert and elsewhere) similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease also is known to occur in those with DLB. Cerebral atrophy also occurs as the cerebral cortex degenerates. [...] Autopsy series have revealed the pathology of DLB is often concomitant with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. That is, when <b>Lewy</b> <b>body</b> inclusions are found in the cortex, they often co-occur with Alzheimer's disease pathology found primarily in the hippocampus, including senile plaques (deposited beta-amyloid protein), and granulovacuolar degeneration (grainy deposits within and a clear zone around hippocampal neurons). Neurofibrillary tangles (abnormally phosphorylated tau protein) are less common in DLB, although they are known to occur, and astrocyte abnormalities are also known to occur. Presently, whether DLB is an Alzheimer's variant or a separate disease entity is not clear. Unlike Alzheimer's disease, the brain may appear grossly normal with no visible signs of atrophy.|$|E

In recent postmortem studies, we documented increased numbers of torpedoes (Purkinje cell axonal swellings) in ET patients without <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies.</b> Purkinje cell loss, however, has never been rigorously assessed. Objective: To quantitatively assess the number of Purkinje cells in brains of ET patients and similarly aged controls. Methods: Postmortem cerebellar tissue was available in 14 ET cases (6 with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> and 8 without <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies)</b> and 11 controls. Calbindin immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections of the cerebellum. Images were digitally recorded and blinded measurements {{of the number of}} Purkinje cells per millimeter of cell layer (linear density) were made. Results: Purkinje cell linear density was inversely correlated with age (r=- 0. 53, P=. 006) and number of torpedoes (r=- 0. 42, P=. 04). Purkinje cell linear density differed by diagnosis (mean [SD], controls, 3. 46 [1. 27] cells/mm; ET cases with <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies,</b> 3. 33 [1. 06] cells/mm; and ET cases without <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies,</b> 2. 14 [0. 82] cells/mm; P=. 04), with the most significant difference between ET cases without <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> and controls, where the reduction was 38. 2 % (P=. 04). In an adjusted linear regression analysis that compared ET cases without <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> with controls, decreased linear density (outcome variable) was associated with ET (β=. 56, P=. 03). Conclusions: We demonstrated a reduction in Purkinje cell number in the brains of patients with ET who do not have <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies.</b> These data further support the view that the cerebellum is anatomically, as well as functionally, abnormal in these ET cases...|$|R

5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies.</b> According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> and <b>Lewy</b> neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of <b>Lewy</b> <b>bodies</b> is common in cortical areas.
