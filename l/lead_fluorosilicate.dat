5|$|Very pure lead can be {{obtained}} by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the Betts process. Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of <b>lead</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (PbSiF6). Once electrical potential is applied, impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the impurities in solution.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electrolyte}} {{for this}} process {{is a mixture of}} <b>lead</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (PbSiF6) and hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) operating at 45 °C (113 °F). Cathodes are thin sheets of pure lead and anodes are cast from the impure lead to be purified. A potential of 0.5 volts is applied. At the anode, lead dissolves into solution, as do metal impurities that are less noble than lead. Impurities that are more noble than lead, such as silver, gold, and bismuth, flake from the anode as it dissolves and settle {{to the bottom of the}} vessel as [...] "anode mud." [...] Pure metallic lead plates onto the cathode, with the less noble metals remaining in solution. Because of the high cost of electrolysis, {{this process is}} used only when very pure lead is needed. Otherwise pyrometallurgical methods are preferred, such as the Parkes process followed by the Betterton-Kroll process.|$|E
40|$|A novel Nd 3 +-doped <b>lead</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> glass (NPS glass) is {{prepared}} by a two-step melting process. Based on the absorption spectrum a Judd-Ofelt theory analysis is made. The emission line width of NPS glass is 44. 2 nm. The fluorescence decay lifetime of the 4 F 3 / 2 level is 586 ± 20 μsec, and the stimulated emission cross-section is 0. 87 × 10 - 20 cm 2 at 1056 nm. A laser oscillation is occurred at 1062 nm when pumped by 808 nm Diode Laser. The slope efficiency is 23. 7 % with a 415 mJ threshold. It is supposed that NPS glass {{is a good}} candidate for using in ultra-short pulse generation and amplification by the broad emission bandwidth and long fluorescence lifetime.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, several {{silicate}} glass property databases were analyzed without using any a priori {{knowledge of the}} details of bonding and lumped as a single group, {{as a function of the}} chemical composition. The viscosity of over 300 compositions including soda-lime glasses, borosilicates, glasses with high alkaline earth content, NIST glass viscosity standards, <b>lead</b> silicates, <b>fluorosilicates,</b> and phospho-silicates have been examined. Using multiple regression modeling, linear and multiplicative relations between the chemical composition and several properties, e. g. viscosity, thermal expansion, density, refractive index, electrical conductivity were developed. In this paper the modeling of the viscosity versus composition is discussed. The described relations have been found to link data of different authors and compositions into one global equation which (a) allows validation of glass property datasets, (b) quantifies the influences of glass components and component interactions, and (c) allows some conclusions regarding the nature of glass. The analysis so far makes it possible to estimate the viscosity isokoms at log(/Pas) = 12. 0 with an error of ± 7 oC, at log(/Pas) = 6. 6 with an error of ± 9 oC, and at log(/Pas) = 1. 5 with an error of ± 17 oC.
