Many early electromechanical digital computers, such as the Harvard Mark I, were built from relay <b>logic</b> <b>gates,</b> using electro-mechanical relays. <b>Logic</b> <b>gates</b> can be made using pneumatic devices, such as the Sorteberg relay or mechanical <b>logic</b> <b>gates,</b> including on a molecular scale. <b>Logic</b> <b>gates</b> have been made out of DNA (see DNA nanotechnology) and {{used to create a}} computer called MAYA (see MAYA II). <b>Logic</b> <b>gates</b> can be made from quantum mechanical effects (though quantum computing usually diverges from boolean design).

25|$|From {{the point}} of view of digital electronics, {{functional}} completeness means that every possible <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> can be realized as a network of gates of the types prescribed by the set. In particular, all logic gates can be assembled from either only binary NAND gates, or only binary NOR gates.|$|E
25|$|The Fridge Gate {{method is}} a {{theoretical}} application {{of using a}} single <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> to drive a refrigerator in the most energy efficient way possible without violating the laws of thermodynamics. It operates {{on the fact that}} there are two energy states in which a particle can exist: the ground state and the excited state. The excited state carries a little more energy than the ground state, small enough so that the transition occurs with high probability. There are three components or particle types associated with the fridge gate. The first is on the interior of the fridge, the second on the outside and the third is connected to a power supply which heats up every so often that it can reach the E state and replenish the source. In the cooling step on the inside of the fridge, the g state particle absorbs energy from ambient particles, cooling them, and itself jumping to the e state. In the second step, on the outside of the fridge where the particles are also at an e state, the particle falls to the g state, releasing energy and heating the outside particles. In the third and final step, the power supply moves a particle at the e state, and when it falls to the g state it induces an energy-neutral swap where the interior e particle is replaced by a new g particle, restarting the cycle.|$|E
500|$|... {{proposed}} the billiard-ball computer {{as part of}} their investigations into reversible computing. A billiard-ball computer consists of a system of synchronized particles (the billiard balls) moving in tracks and guided by a fixed set of obstacles. When the particles collide with each other or with the obstacles, they undergo an elastic collision much as real billiard balls would do. The input to the computer is encoded using {{the presence or absence of}} particles on certain input tracks, and its output is similarly encoded using the presence or absence of particles on output tracks. The tracks themselves may be envisioned as wires, and the particles as being Boolean signals transported on those wires. When a particle hits an obstacle, it reflects from it. This reflection may be interpreted as a change in direction of the wire the particle is following. Two particles on different tracks may collide, forming a <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> at their collision point.|$|E

The autonomous <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> are arranged in a bidirectional ring topology and generate broadband chaos. The clocked <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> receive input from the autonomous <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> so that random numbers are generated physically that pass standard randomness tests without further post-processing. The large number of <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> on reconfigurable chips allows for parallel generation of random numbers, as demonstrated by our implementation of 128 physical random number generators that achieve a real-time bit rate of 12. 8 Gbit/s.

2500|$|SWNTs are an {{important}} variety of carbon nanotube because most of their properties change significantly with the (n,m) values, and this dependence is non-monotonic (see Kataura plot). In particular, their band gap can vary from zero to about 2 eV and their electrical conductivity can show metallic or semiconducting behavior. Single-walled nanotubes are likely candidates for miniaturizing electronics. The most basic building block of these systems is the electric wire, and SWNTs with diameters of an order of a nanometer can be excellent conductors. [...] One useful application of SWNTs is {{in the development of}} the first intermolecular field-effect transistors (FET). The first intermolecular <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> using SWCNT FETs was made in 2001. [...] A <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> requires both a p-FET and an n-FET. Because SWNTs are p-FETs when exposed to oxygen and n-FETs otherwise, it is possible to expose half of an SWNT to oxygen and protect the other half from it. The resulting SWNT acts as a not <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> with both p and n-type FETs in the same molecule.|$|E

40|$|A SPICE-based {{model of}} an {{n-channel}} ferroelectric {{field effect transistor}} has been developed based on both theoretical and empirical data. This model was used to generate the I-V characteristic of several <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> The use of ferroelectric field effect transistors in memory circuits is being developed by several organizations. The use of FFETs in other circuits, both analog and digital needs to be better understood. The ability of FFETs to have different characteristics depending on the initial polarization {{can be used to}} create <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> These gates can have properties not available to standard CMOS <b>logic</b> <b>gates,</b> such as memory, reconfigurability and memory. This paper investigates basic properties of FFET <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> It models FFET inverter, NAND gate and multi-input NAND gate. The I-V characteristics of the gates are presented as well as transfer characteristics and timing. The model used is a SPICE-based model developed from empirical data from actual Ferroelectric transistors. It simulates all major characteristics of the ferroelectric transistor, including polarization, hysteresis and decay. Contrasts are made of the differences between FFET <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> and CMOS <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> FFET parameters are varied to show the effect on the overall gate. A recodigurable gate is investigated which is not possible with CMOS circuits. The paper concludes that FFETs can be used in <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> and have several advantages over standard CMOS gates...|$|R
