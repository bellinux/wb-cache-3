25|$|Congestive heart failure* is {{the result}} of any severe, {{overwhelming}} heart disease that most commonly results in pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), and/or ascites (fluid in the abdomen). It can be caused by the above two diseases, congenital heart defects such as patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) disease, or pericardial effusion. Signs depend on which side of the heart is affected. <b>Left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> results in rapid and/or difficulty breathing and sometimes coughing from a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Right-sided heart failure results in a large liver (congestion) and build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), uncommonly fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), or, rarely, peripheral edema.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} other {{exceptions}} {{to a simple}} left-right division of heart failure symptoms. Additionally, {{the most common cause}} of right-sided heart failure is <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> The result is that patients commonly present with both sets of signs and symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is {{directed}} largely to removing the cause, or, {{where that is}} impossible, to modifying its effects. Thus, therapy aimed at improving right heart function will also improve congestive hepatopathy. True nutmeg liver is usually secondary to <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> causing congestive right heart failure, so treatment options are limited.|$|E

40|$|<b>Left-sided</b> {{congestive}} <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> in {{the horse}} is a common squelea to degenerative valvular disease and can potentially be life threatening. Abnormalities of the atrioventricular valve (AV) can lead to insufficiency and mitral regurgitation. In the horse, valvular degeneration {{is the most common}} etiology for AV valve pathology. Mean survival time is based on several factors including the degree of mitral regurgitation and the presence of a ruptured chordae tendinae. The end result leads to a decrease in cardiac output and pulmonary edema from increased pulmonary pressure. This case study will highlight a 14 -year-old Thoroughbred gelding with an acute onset of frothy nasal discharge. The history, physical examination findings, pathophysiology, etiologies, diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognoses for patients with acute pulmonary edema resulting from mitral insufficiency are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{surgical}} treatment of tricuspid regurgitation is not indicated {{when it has}} arisen {{as a result of}} right ventricular dilatation. In such instances of secondary tricuspid regurgitation, the mainstay of therapy is medical. When <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> is the cause, the individual is instructed to decrease intake of salt. Medications in this case may include diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{of heart failure}} are largely determined by {{which side of the}} heart fails. The left side pumps blood into the systemic circulation, whilst the right side pumps blood into the pulmonary circulation. Whilst <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> will reduce cardiac output to the systemic circulation, the initial {{symptoms of}}ten manifest due to effects on the pulmonary circulation. In systolic dysfunction, the ejection fraction is decreased, leaving an abnormally elevated volume of blood in the left ventricle. In diastolic dysfunction, the end-diastolic ventricular pressure will be high. This increase in volume or pressure backs up to the left atrium and then to the pulmonary veins. Increased volume or pressure in the pulmonary veins impairs the normal drainage of the alveoli and favors the flow of fluid from the capillaries to the lung parenchyma, causing pulmonary edema. This impairs gas exchange. Thus, <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> often presents with respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.|$|E
50|$|The {{resultant}} low blood oxygen {{caused by}} pulmonary edema causes vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation, {{which results in}} pulmonary hypertension. Since the right ventricle generates far lower pressures than the left ventricle (approximately 20 mmHg versus around 120 mmHg, respectively, in the healthy individual) but nonetheless generates cardiac output exactly equal to the left ventricle, this means that a small increase in pulmonary vascular resistance causes a large increase in amount of work the right ventricle must perform. However, the main mechanism by which <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> causes right-sided heart failure is actually not well understood. Some theories invoke mechanisms that are mediated by neurohormonal activation. Mechanical effects may also contribute. As the left ventricle distends, the intraventricular septum bows into the right ventricle, decreasing {{the capacity of the}} right ventricle.|$|E

Tracheal intubation was performed and 100 % oxygen delivered through a non-rebreathing (Bain) system and then a circle system in the operating theatre.

40|$|Background: Early {{recognition}} of <b>left-sided</b> congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> (CHF) in dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) {{is important because}} it influences medical therapy, timing of follow-up, and outcome. Hypothesis: Pulmonary vein diameter-to-pulmonary artery diameter ratio (PV/PA) measured by echocardiography can predict CHF. Animals: Ninety-eight client-owned dogs, 37 controls, and 61 dogs with DMVD. Methods: Prospective clinical cohort study. History, physical examination and Doppler-echocardiography were performed. Dogs were classified as International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council class I, II or III. Congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> was identified in a subset of 56 dogs based on radiographic findings. The PV/PA was measured in bidimensional (2 D) and M-mode by 2 investigators blinded to the radiologists' conclusions. Results: Interobserver coefficients of variation for PV/PA acquisition and measurement were < 10 %. The PV/PA in control dogs was approximately 1 and increased with class of <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> The presence of CHF could be best predicted by measuring PV/PA in 2 D echocardiography (cut-off, 1. 7; area under the curve, 0. 98; CI, 0. 97 - 0. 98; P <. 001) with a sensitivity of 96 % and a specificity of 91 %. Conclusion and clinical importance: The PV/PA is a simple and reproducible echocardiographic variable that increases with class of <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> and may help discriminate dogs in CHF from asymptomatic dogs with DMVD. Additional studies are required to determine whether PV/PA might provide additional information in the integrated interpretation of Doppler-echocardiographic indices of left ventricular filling pressures and could be used for rapid assessment of CHF in dogs in a critical care setting.

40|$|Abstract. Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} of Doberman Pinschers (DCDP) is {{a progressive}} disease often presenting {{with a history}} of episodic weakness and syncope, or with clinical signs of predominantly <b>left-sided</b> congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> A systematic dissection and histomorphologic evaluation of the heart from 32 Doberman Pinschers with a clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy revealed a highly specific location for the characteristic myocardial lesions. The lesions of DCDP were found only in the left ventricular free wall, and in 30 cases, the lesions were characterized by myofiber degeneration and atrophy, and replacement of myocardium by dense bundles of collagen and clusters of adipocytes. In the two remaining hearts, myofiber atrophy and degeneration were accompanied by collagen deposition, but not adipocytes. In stained longitudinal (base to apex) tissue sections of the left ventricle, the lesions of DCDP were usually apparent to the unaided eye; appearing as a central linear pale zone, aligned in the long axis of the ventricular free wall. The lesions did not contain inflammatory cell infiltrates and often involved 50 % of ventricular wall.

50|$|PND {{is caused}} {{in part by}} the {{depression}} of the respiratory center during sleep, which may reduce arterial oxygen tension, particularly in patients with interstitial lung disease and reduced pulmonary compliance.Also, in the horizontal position there is redistribution of blood volume from the lower extremities and splanchnic beds to the lungs (orthopnea). In normal individuals this has little effect, but in patients in whom the additional volume cannot be pumped out by the left ventricle because of disease, there is a significant reduction in vital capacity and pulmonary compliance with resultant shortness of breath. Additionally, in patients with congestive heart failure the pulmonary circulation may already be overloaded because the failing left ventricle is suddenly unable to match the output of a more normally functioning right ventricle; causing pulmonary congestion. It is also important to note that <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> can lead to right-sided heart failure. Pulmonary congestion decreases when the patient assumes a more erect position, and this is accompanied by an improvement in symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|Personal health depends {{partially}} on the active, passive, {{and assisted}} cues people observe and adopt {{about their own}} health. These include personal actions for preventing or minimizing {{the effects of a}} disease, usually a chronic condition, through integrative care. They also include personal hygiene practices to prevent infection and illness, such as bathing and washing hands with soap; brushing and flossing teeth; storing, preparing and handling food safely; and many others. The information gleaned from personal observations of daily living - such as about sleep patterns, exercise behavior, nutritional intake and environmental features - may be used to inform personal decisions and actions (e.g., [...] "I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping on a different pillow"), as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans (e.g., a patient who notices his or her shoes are tighter than usual may be having exacerbation of <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> and may require diuretic medication to reduce fluid overload).|$|E
50|$|The {{increased}} peripheral {{resistance and}} greater blood volume place further {{strain on the}} heart and accelerates the process of damage to the myocardium. Vasoconstriction and fluid retention produce an increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries. This shifts the balance of forces in favor of interstitial fluid formation as the increased pressure forces additional fluid out of the blood, into the tissue. This results in edema (fluid build-up) in the tissues. In right-sided heart failure, this commonly starts in the ankles where venous pressure is high due {{to the effects of}} gravity (although if the patient is bed-ridden, fluid accumulation may begin in the sacral region.) It may also occur in the abdominal cavity, where the fluid buildup is called ascites. In <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> edema can occur in the lungs - this is called cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This reduces spare capacity for ventilation, causes stiffening of the lungs and reduces the efficiency of gas exchange by increasing the distance between the air and the blood. The consequences of this are dyspnea (shortness of breath), orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDetection of patent foramen ovale by {{contrast}} echocardiography {{is based on}} transient inversion (right atrial pressure higher than left atrial pressure) of the interatrial pressure gradient. Therefore, the presence of <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> disease with potential elevation of left atrial pressure might obscure the diagnosis of patent foramen ovale. Accordingly, 150 patients (88 men, 62 women; mean age 51. 7 ± 15. 2 years) were evaluated for a patent foramen ovale by transesophageal contrast echocardiography. Additionally, atrial septal motion during normal respiration and during the Valsalva maneuver was analyzed. Patency of the foramen ovale was observed in 20 (27 %) of 74 patients without <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> disease and with previous arterial embolism, in none (0 %) of 25 patients with <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> disease and embolism, in 7 (39 %) of 18 patients without <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> disease and without embolism and in 3 (9 %) of 33 patients with <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> disease and without embolism. The detection rate of patent foramen ovale was lower in patients with than without <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> disease (5 % vs. 29 %, p = 0. 0007) but was similar in patients with and without embolism (20 % vs. 19. 5 %, p = NS). Abnormal atrial septal motion was more frequently observed in patients with <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> disease (p = 0. 0003) and was inversely correlated to detection of patent foramen ovale (p = 0. 0003). Multivariate analysis revealed an independent association between the absence of <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> disease and the detection of patent foramen ovale (p = 0. 0003). These data suggest that in patients with <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> disease, patency of the foramen ovale may be missed even by transesophageal contrast echocardiography...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Carcinoid {{heart disease}} is a rare but {{important}} cause of intrinsic right heart valve disorders leading to right <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Occasionally, <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> valves may also be involved. The characteristic cardiac pathological findings of carcinoid heart disease are endocardial thickening {{as a result of}} fibrous deposits on the endocardium. Echocardiographic examination and right heart catheterization are very useful for the diagnosis of the lesion. If more cardiac valves are affected, multiple valve replacement should be considered. The management of the pulmonary valve lesion depends on the extent of the diseased valve, either by valvulotomy, valvectomy, or valve replacement. Percutaneous valve implantations in the pulmonary and in the inferior vena cava positions have been advocated for high-risk patients...|$|R
40|$|Mitral valve {{degeneration}} (MVD) is {{the most}} common form of heart disease in dogs, frequently leading to <b>left-sided</b> congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> and cardiac mortality. Although breed-specific disease characteristics and overrepresentation point towards a genetic origin for MVD, a causative mutation and complete molecular pathogenesis are unknown. Whippet dogs are overrepresented in incidence of MVD, suggesting an inherited component in this breed. Expressivity of this condition is variable with some dogs showing evidence of more severe disease at earlier ages than other dogs. This phenomenon makes a traditional case versus control genetic study prone to phenotyping error. This study sought to avoid these common pitfalls by identifying genetic loci associated with severity of MVD in Whippets through a genome-wide association study (GWAS). 138 Whippet dogs were characterized for MVD by echocardiographic examination and a novel disease severity score was developed and adjusted for age in each subject. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data (170 k Illumina CanineHD SnpChip) was obtained for DNA isolated from blood of each study subject. Continuous variable genome wide association was performed after correction for population stratification by efficient mixed model association expedited (EMMAX) in 130 dogs. A genome wide significant association was identified on chromosome 15 (peak locus 57, 770, 326; Padj = 0. 049) and secondary loci of suggestive association were identified on chromosome 2 (peak locus 37, 628, 875; Padj = 0. 079). Positional candidate genes were identified within the primary and secondary loci including follistatin-related protein 5 precursor (FSTL 5) and Rho GTPase-activating protein 26 (ARHGAP 26). These results support the hypothesis that severity of MVD in whippets has a genetic basis and warrants further study by either candidate gene sequencing or next-generation techniques...|$|R

Though it is usually associated with congenital heart diseases, there is an increased incidence of isolated acquired aortopulmonary collaterals in premature infants with chronic lung disease. Interestingly, isolated congenital aortopulmonary collaterals can occur without any lung disease, which may cause congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> and require closure. We present a neonate with an echocardiogram that showed only <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> dilation.

We developed a bipolar, irrigated radiofrequency ablation device. We hypothesized that beating heart radiofrequency left atrial ablation would result in minimal acute changes in left atrial hemodynamics. MethodsSix healthy subjects were studied. Combination pressure-conductance catheters were inserted into the left atrium and ventricle. With the use of the device, atrial ablation was performed on the beating heart without cardiopulmonary bypass, including electrical isolation of the posterior left atrium and atrial appendage myocardium. Simultaneous <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> pressure–volume and intracardiac echocardiography data were acquired before ablation, after left atrial appendage ablation alone, and after all ablation (with and without appendage occlusion). The derived indices of <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> mechanical function were examined. ResultsRelative to baseline, no significant diminishment in pressure–volume or intracardiac echocardiography-derived indices of global <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> mechanical function were observed after ablation, with or without appendage occlusion. Mitral valve morphology and function were not significantly altered. A significant diminishment of atrial appendage systolic flow was noted after appendage ablation in association with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast in this region. ConclusionsIn this model, ablation does not seem to compromise global <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> mechanical function. However, these findings mask regional diminishment in atrial appendage systolic function. This observation demonstrates that electrical isolation of the appendage should be accompanied by its occlusion or excision.

40|$|Lung {{ultrasound}} {{is superior}} to lung auscultation and supine chest radiography for many respiratory conditions in human patients. Ultrasound diagnoses are based on easily learned patterns of sonographic findings and artifacts in standardized images. By applying the wet lung (ultrasound lung rockets or B-lines, representing interstitial edema) versus dry lung (A-lines with a glide sign) concept many respiratory conditions can be diagnosed or excluded. The ultrasound probe {{can be used as}} a visual stethoscope for the evaluation of human lungs because dry artifacts (A-lines with a glide sign) predominate over wet artifacts (ultrasound lung rockets or B-lines). However, the frequency and number of wet lung ultrasound artifacts in dogs with radiographically normal lungs is unknown. Thus, the primary objective was to determine the baseline frequency and number of ultrasound lung rockets in dogs without clinical signs of respiratory disease and with radiographically normal lung findings using an 8 -view novel regionally based lung ultrasound examination called Vet BLUE. Frequency of ultrasound lung rockets were statistically compared based on signalment, body condition score, investigator, and reasons for radiography.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information System inpatient database from pediatric hospitals across the country from 1996 to 2006.

An epidemiologic survey was performed through time–series analyses using Fisher's Kappa test and the Bartlett Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The existence and strength of seasonality for the <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> defects was quantified by the autoregression R 2. ResultsA seasonal occurrence was found in hypoplastic left heart syndrome but not other <b>left-sided</b> <b>heart</b> diseases.
