5|$|Musically, I'm Breathless {{consists}} predominantly of jazz, {{swing and}} pop songs. The tracks reflected Madonna's showgirl personality and {{were influenced by}} her relationship with Beatty.

5|$|The O Act {{achieved}} {{what the}} previous legislation {{had failed to}} do: provide a stable revenue to the counties. This revenue became {{a vital part of}} the budgets of the O counties, paying for county-provided services such as <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> corrections and health and social services. With this funding seemingly guaranteed, the counties kept other taxes much lower than other counties in the state, increasing their dependence on the timber payments. For example, the property tax in Curry County is 60 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, far below the state average of $2.81 per $1000.|$|E
5|$|Dissenting {{religious}} practitioners also widely {{resented the}} treatment {{they received from}} the Lutheran State Church through the Conventicle Act. Conflicts between local worshipers and the new churches were most explosive in the countryside, where dissenting pietist groups were more active, and were more directly under the eye of local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> the parish priest. Before non-Lutheran churches were granted toleration in 1809, clampdowns on illegal forms of worship and teaching often provoked whole groups of pietists to leave together, intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land. The largest contingent of such dissenters, 1,500 followers of Eric Jansson, left in the late 1840s and founded a community in Bishop Hill, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> better economic conditions.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{bilateral}} ties were characterised {{by trade}} and economic co-operation; {{other areas of}} bilateral co-operation were explored from 2000 onwards.

In 2004, three Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) {{in the areas of}} information technology, education and diplomatic ties, and co-operation-in-general were signed. Bilateral co-operation between both countries was also extended to defence matters in 2008 when another MoU was signed, which proposed for joint military trainings and collaboration in the defence industry between the Malaysian and Vietnamese militaries. The MoU also provided for the navies of both countries to prevent Vietnamese fishermen from encroaching into Malaysian waters for fishing activities as well as to control piracy.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States {{responded by}} {{launching}} the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda.

Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq as motives.
