50|$|In 1917 he acceded for {{the first}} time to the Deliberative Council in {{representation}} of the Socialist Party, being reelected for 1918/19. The electoral success of November 1919 allowed the revolutionary fact of consecrate Bronzini as Socialist Mayor in a city like Mar del Plata, a safe haven to the summer-visiting Argentine upper class and its local sympathizers. He is considered thus one of the first socialist Mayors of the Americas. That first period (1920-21) was briefly interrupted by an arbitrary intervention of the provincial government, who had to restore him in office by judicial ruling. For the period 1922-23, Socialist councilman Rufino Inda was elected Mayor. Bronzini returned to office for the period 1924-25, as councilman in 1926-27, and again as Mayor for 1928-29. This period was also interrupted by another illegal intervention in September 1929, just 60 days after his electoral success, in order to prevent a new socialist mandate. A strong evidence of the effective task made by the Socialist administrations during the 20s are the successive electoral victories the party won with a percentage surpassing the 50%, all that in coexistence with politically adverse provincial and national governments. Bronzini was also nominated provincial commissioner for the period 1921-22, 1925-28 and 1930 until the military coup of 6 September 1930.
