5|$|Nicholas Gleaves as Dr. James Whitaker. Whitaker {{serves as}} the main {{antagonist}} of the second series. He is a biochemist leading the research into a cure for the virus {{from the safety of}} a biologically secure research and development facility. As the research begins to require increasingly unethical practices, he lies and rationalises in the struggle to maintain the loyalty of his colleagues. Unbeknownst to the other workers (all of whom had lost <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>in</b> the pandemic), he had secreted his wife (portrayed by Alisa Arnah) and young son within the facility, violating protocol. His true motives are suspect, as he answers to someone called Mr. Landry, with whom he communicates over a satellite video link. Until his death he was using stolen anti-virus produced from Abby's blood for himself, keeping it from the others, who died when the virus got into the lab after Abby infected his wife. At {{the end of the second}} series, he is accidentally shot and killed by a sniper in Landry's employ.|$|E

5|$|The Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power of Indulgences are {{a list of}} propositions for an {{academic}} disputation written in 1517 by Martin Luther, professor of moral theology at the University of Wittenberg, Germany, that started the Reformation, a schism in the Catholic Church which profoundly changed Europe. They advance Luther's positions against {{what he saw as}} abusive in the practice of clergy selling plenary indulgences, which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers or their <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>in</b> purgatory. In the Theses, Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external sacramental confession. He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence. They also, according to Luther, discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the Pope, the Theses challenge a fourteenth-century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The Theses are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther's opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in the Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences.|$|E

25|$|The {{income of}} women with status living off-reserve was on average $13,870 a year, {{according}} to a 1996 Canadian census. This is about $5500 less than non-Indigenous women, such as Inuit and Métis women,which recorded slightly higher average annual incomes; regardless of the small discrepancy, {{all of which are}} substantially less than Statistics Canada’s estimated amount of which an individual living in a large Canadian city would require to meet their needs. It is not unlikely for Aboriginal women living in poverty to not only tend to their own needs, but often tend to the needs of their elderly parents, care for <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>in</b> ill-health, as well as raising children; all of which is often supported only on a single income. It is believed that homelessness and inadequate shelter are widespread problems facing Aboriginal families, in all settings.|$|E
25|$|The Resurrection Stone {{allows the}} holder {{to bring back}} {{deceased}} <b>loved</b> <b>ones,</b> <b>in</b> a semi-physical form, and communicate with them. The form of Sirius Black generated by the stone tells Harry {{that he and the}} other forms created by the stone are part of him and invisible to others. This seems to suggest that these apparitions are conjured from memories and are not really resurrected people. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, using the Resurrection Stone drove the owner to kill himself because he brought his late fiancée back from the dead, and she was very unhappy in the real world for she did not belong there. By the time the stone was seen in Marvolo Gaunt's possession, it had been set into a ring that bore the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell coat of arms; he used the ring to boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald desired the stone, but for different reasons. While Dumbledore wanted it to communicate with his dead family, Grindelwald allegedly intended to use it to create an army of zombie-like Inferi. Harry said this is the Hallow he would desire most, as like Dumbledore he could name people he would like to communicate with again. Voldemort became aware of the ring's antiquity and eventually used the stone as a Horcrux, a container for part of his soul, being unaware of its additional magical properties.|$|E

500|$|Anton Kaes, {{who called}} Caligari [...] "an {{aggressive}} statement about war psychiatry, murder and deception", wrote that Alan's question to Cesare, [...] "How long have I to live?"

Francis's despair after Alan's murder can likewise be compared to that of the many soldiers who survived the war but saw their friends die on the battlefield. Kaes noted other parallels between the film and war experiences, noting that Cesare attacked Alan at dawn, a common time for attacks during the war. Thomas Elsaesser called Caligari an [...] "outstanding example of how [...] "fantastic" [...] representations in German films from the early 1920s seem to bear the imprint of pressures from external events, to which they refer only through the violence with which they disguise and disfigure them." ...|$|E
500|$|Published by Marvel Comics since 2011, {{the series}} follows Spider-Man {{supporting}} character Flash Thompson (who debuted {{as the latest}} Venom, {{an agent of the}} United States military bonded with the symbiote, in the February 2011 The Amazing Spider-Man #654). Recurring enemies Crime Master and Jack O'Lantern are introduced in Venom #1 and learn Thompson's secret identity in Venom #2, enabling them to threaten his <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>in</b> exchange for his cooperation. After Jack is disfigured by a grenade placed in his mask by Thompson, he considers himself Thompson's nemesis. The series' tie-in with the 2011 [...] "Spider-Island" [...] covered the death of Thompson's abusive father, Thompson facing the symbiote's former host Eddie Brock (Anti-Venom), the symbiote choosing Thompson over Brock and Thompson helping Captain America and Spider-Man defeat The Queen.

500|$|Kudos {{began to}} develop the show after {{producing}} the Channel 4 medical drama series Psychos in 1999. Kudos wished to explore series ideas that saw beyond typical [...] "precinct-based dramas" [...] (crime and medical). Stephen Garrett decided on developing a spy drama after coming across John le Carré novels at a Waterstone's bookstore, and came to realise that MI5 or MI6 had not been featured as the setting for shows before. He felt {{the benefit of a}} spy show is that rather than in a crime drama where the protagonists take their work home with them, spies are given the added dimension that they cannot reveal their work even to their <b>loved</b> <b>ones.</b> <b>In</b> the meantime, Wolstencroft, who wrote Psychos, was also developing a spy drama, albeit as a film. When Kudos contacted him, they agreed they should work together to create a television series based on his idea, which was not to glamourise the world of spies, instead showing the audience that spies work in a [...] "shitty job". Kudos later pitched the show to all the major British television networks; however none of them were as enthusiastic as Kudos, as they did not see the potential of a post-Cold War spy series. After the commissioning teams from the networks were replaced, Kudos again pitched the show, albeit reinvented, and as a result Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, commissioned the show after planning to introduce [...] "braver", [...] "dynamic" [...] and [...] "pacier" [...] shows to attract a younger audience for the channel.|$|E
500|$|Storylines for a {{potential}} series had been drafted by writer Mike Bullen during production of the pilot. When production on the series began, producer Christine Langan worked with him to create detailed plots for all six episodes, also acting as a script editor to redraft Bullen's work. Many of the plots were drawn from his own life; Pete and Jenny bringing up their new baby paralleled Bullen and his wife, whose first child was born in late 1997. The scenes where Pete and Jenny attend the antenatal classes were written from Bullen's memory, {{when he and his}} wife were [...] "given callipers, forceps and a suction cup to play with". The conclusion of the fourth episode, in which Pete's father dies on the way to his grandson's christening, was suggested by Harries, whose own experience of the death of his father taught him that people rarely have the opportunity to say goodbye to <b>loved</b> <b>ones</b> <b>in</b> real life. Not all storylines were based on real life: For Karen and David's marriage guidance scenes in Episode 5, Bullen consulted the relationship support charity Relate. Actors and directors also had input into the scripts; Bullen's original script for the marriage therapy scenes ended with David shouting and apparently using a fire extinguisher as an offensive weapon. Bathurst was not convinced that was something that his character would do, as David is [...] "too much of a coward to do anything overtly" [...] and would not leave himself so [...] "exposed": ...|$|E
