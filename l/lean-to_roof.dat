5|$|The most {{prominent}} structure after the Holy Mother of God {{church is a}} rectangular chapel built against its western wall. The remaining section of the façade of the main church is situated immediately next to it with a ridge roof. Ivane Zakarian and his son Avak were buried inside in 1227. A small structure with a <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof</b> {{is attached to the}} north wall of the main church. It was used to store ceremonial items. On the north-western side of the monastery, a single nave and ridge-roofed church is located detached from the main church. Another building that hasn't survived used to be located next to it. Numerous dilapidated dwellings and auxiliary structures are scattered in the territory of the fortress such as a two-story building believed to be a residence for guards. There are traditional networks of tunnels, crypts, water reservoirs and wine cellars, found among most monasteries of medieval Armenia. Not far from the monastery one can find other medieval monuments such as the Holy Trinity monastery, Saint George church, a 13th-century spring monument, a 19th-century Russian chapel, a Greek church as well as various khachkars and chapels.|$|E
25|$|The {{facilities}} {{which have}} remained {{since the war}} and were still used {{at the end of}} the air station's operation were the hangars, the officer's mess hall and Mark. Three of the six main hangars have survived. These were standard German types. The one consisted of a <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof</b> supported by a truss. The other two had a semicircular arch roof. Both were built with wooden walls and roofs.|$|E
25|$|The nave is adjoined by an aisle on {{the south}} side and the chancel has a chapel on its south side and a vestry to its north. The west tower is 13th century and {{comprises}} three stages divided by ashlared stone bands. The outer facing corners have diagonal buttresses. Single lancet windows punctuate the north, south and west sides of the second and third stages. The spire is pyramidal with wood shingle covering, which also covers the <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof</b> of the stair turret {{on the south}}-east side of the tower.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} built in stone with a slate roof. Its plan {{consists}} of a nave with clerestory, north and south aisles under <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs,</b> a crossing tower with transepts, and a chancel with a north vestry and a south chapel.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear of the}} building, {{fronting}} {{the corner}} of the laneway, has timber, brick and some stone walls, and a series of <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs</b> creating some loading areas. From here a timber ramp runs back into the building, past the later partitions of staff toilets and store rooms.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} built from local red Triassic {{sandstone}} with a slate roof. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave with clerestory, north and south aisles under <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs,</b> a chancel with a semicircular apse, a south vestry and a northeast tower with a broach spire. It is built in Early English style.|$|R
500|$|The Smith–Harris House is a -story clapboarded Greek Revival {{house with}} a pedimented gable on the front facade. The house is {{composed}} of a -story, [...] block and a single-story, [...] kitchen wing. [...] It retains the original clapboarding with horizontal flush on the facade. The front facade has a typical three-bay design with the entrance supported by pilasters with squared, recessed panels for the main door frame and frieze. The entrance porch is not original, it was replaced {{as part of the}} restoration effort and its design originates from previous photographs. The foundation is made of locally sourced granite slabs and includes a full basement. The square gable windows feature small panes in wooden muntins. All windows retain their original double-hung sash with 6-over-6 windows, except for the rear windows on the second floor. The one-story kitchen wing has a pitched <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof.</b> Another part of the restoration was the open porch that replaced an ell. At the time of its National Historic Register of Places nomination, the gable roof was covered with cedar shingles as part of the restoration effort.|$|E
500|$|While the {{building}} has a rough appearance today, the architecture is of a Palladian design. The upper floor consists of a hall and two reception rooms. On the eastern side, there was a third, timber-floored, level where the sleeping quarters were located. On the ground floor is a kitchen, servants' quarters and stairs to the upper floors. The entrance, {{which is on the}} upper floor, was reached by a long flight of stairs which is now missing. At each side of {{the building}} is a room with a <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof</b> which may have been used to stable horses. A stone mounting block to assist people onto their horses can be seen on the eastern side. To the front there was a semi-circular courtyard, enclosed by a low stone wall and entered by a gate. The house faces to the north, looking over Dublin and the plains of Meath and Kildare, including Conolly's primary residence at Castletown House in Celbridge. The grounds around the lodge consisted of a [...] deer park. The identity of the architect is unknown: the author Michael Fewer has suggested it may have been Edward Lovett Pearce (1699–1733) who was employed by Conolly to carry out works at Castletown in 1724.|$|E
6000|$|Milt made tea, {{ignoring}} them, while Bill {{entertained the}} Gilsons and Saxtons with Rabelaisian stories of threshing-time when shirts prickly with chaff and gritty with dust stuck to sweat-dripping backs; of the [...] "funny thing" [...] of Milt and Bill being hired {{to move a}} garbage-pile and [...] "swiping" [...] their employer's [...] "mushmelons"; of knotting shirts at the swimming-hole so that the bawling youngsters had to [...] "chaw beef"; of drinking beer in the livery-stable at Melrose; of dropping the water-pitcher from a St. Klopstock hotel window upon {{the head of the}} [...] "constabule" [...] and escaping from him across the <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
50|$|The coach house complex {{including}} the boarding house, kitchen and walkway are all equally elevated above the ground. The boarding house {{consists of a}} simple rectilinear planned core with an enclosed verandah {{to the west and}} semi-enclosed verandah to the east. A gable roof form covers the main core of the building while simple <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs</b> cover the verandahs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{northern}} elevation where tall rectangular {{windows and}} a large arched leadlight window are located is simpler in detail. A <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofed</b> structure containing amenities {{is located on the}} lower level while a more substantial [...] timber-framed verandah is located on the upper level accessed by timber-framed service stairs. The land is retained at the building line to allow access and light into a basement level and service yard. A lean-to structure has been recently constructed to the eastern end of the elevation.|$|R
50|$|St Mary's is {{constructed}} of rockfaced stone with ashlar dressings and has deeply pitched roofs of slate. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave and chancel combined under one roof, low north and south aisles with <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs,</b> and a polygonal apse. There is no tower. The west wall has two large windows, each with three lancets; {{between the two is}} a niche containing a figure of Jesus Christ. The windows in the aisles have large two-light lancets and cinquefoils. The clerestory windows above are quatrefoil oculi.|$|R
60|$|The cottages along Carriford village street {{were not}} so close but that on one side or other of the road was always a hedge of {{hawthorn}} or privet, over or through which could be seen gardens or orchards rich with produce. It was about {{the middle of the}} early apple-harvest, and the laden trees were shaken at intervals by the gatherers; the soft pattering of the falling crop upon the grassy ground being diversified by the loud rattle of vagrant ones upon a rail, hencoop, basket, or <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof,</b> or upon the rounded and stooping backs of the collectors--mostly children, who would have cried bitterly at receiving such a smart blow from any other quarter, but smilingly assumed it to be but fun in apples.|$|E

5000|$|Linhay (linny, linney, linnies) — A shed, {{often with}} a <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof</b> but may be a {{circular}} linhay to store hay {{on the first floor}} with either cattle on the ground floor (cattle linhay), or farm machinery (cart linhay). Characterised by an open front with regularly spaced posts or pillars.|$|E
50|$|The church {{building}} {{is laid out}} in a typical cruciform plan with a central nave formed by a long, steeply gabled roof. This main roof is dissected by another gabled roof slightly lower in height which forms the north and south transepts. The northern transept contains a side-chapel and southern transept contains a vestry. Aisles are formed to the north and south of the nave by lower <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs</b> running along its length. A gabled entry porch with hipped returns provides a protective covered entrance to the church from the west.|$|R
50|$|The {{ambulance}} station, a timber-framed and clad building, is sheltered by a gabled <b>roof</b> with a <b>lean-to</b> the south. A large street awning shelters {{the wide}} entry doors facing the street. A concrete driveway slightly {{wider than the}} front of the building extends to the road crossover. The ambulance station is planned around a large garage space facing Crown Road with smaller scale rooms to the south and rear. A <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofed</b> annex runs along the southern side of the building. The roofs are clad in recent corrugated metal sheeting. Eaves are unlined and eaves gutters are quad-profile.|$|R
25|$|The {{timber frame}} {{features}} close studding with a middle rail. It {{rests on a}} stone plinth, the infill is rendered brick and the roof is of slate. At the west end is a shingled square tower with a shingled broach spire ending in a weather cock. This is surrounded by <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofed</b> aisles on the north, west and south sides. The tower has a western arched door with a 20th-century door which incorporates 17th-century iron strap hinges. The body of the church consists of a three-bay nave with north and south aisles, a two-bay chancel and north and south chapels {{at the ends of}} the aisles, and a south porch.|$|R
50|$|The {{northeast}} elevation has {{a central}} projecting gable, and an enclosed verandah {{to the ground}} floor. The gable has a central louvred window, surmounted by a sandstone relieving arch, with a stepped sandstone moulding below. The enclosed verandah has a corrugated iron <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof,</b> fibrous cement cladding, and louvred and casement windows.|$|E
50|$|The hall is a {{rectangular}} timber {{building on a}} near north-south axis, with verandahs along both sides. The gabled roof is painted corrugated iron, with a gabled ridge vent running most of its length, and a <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof</b> to each verandah. At {{each end of the}} ridge is a finial-like timber cross.|$|E
50|$|A {{mono-pitched roof}} is a single-sloping roof surface, often not {{attached}} to another roof surface. Mono-pitched roofs are {{also known as}} a pent roof, shed roof, <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof,</b> or skillion roof (in Australia). This is in contrast to a dual-pitched roof, {{also known as a}} gabled roof, which is pitched in two different directions.|$|E
5000|$|St Stephen's is {{constructed}} in sandstone, {{and is in}} Gothic Revival style. [...] The internal walls are in brick, and the roofs are tiled. Its plan consists of a nave with north and south aisles under <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs,</b> projecting chapels at {{the east of the}} aisles, a chancel, and vestries. The west window has five lights. Along the walls of the aisles are groups of stepped lancet windows, two in the west and east bays, and four in the intermediate bays, and doorways towards the western ends. At the east end are buttresses with pyramildal roofs, and the east window consists of five stepped lancets.|$|R
50|$|A {{concrete}} block toilet addition with a <b>lean-to</b> corrugated iron <b>roof</b> {{is attached to}} the rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{adjoining}} saddle shed {{is similarly}} built with bush timber uprights and top plates, though of lighter construction. Roof rafters and purlins are of milled timber. The shed {{is covered with}} a shallow bow- roof central core with <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs</b> on all four sides. The shed is open on all sides. The shed was at times used as stables for the manager's and owner's race horses during the 1950s and 1960s. Timber racks for the storage of harness and saddles are keyed into the uprights. Many of the racks have been removed. A timber 44 gallon drum rack for the storage of molasses and fuel drums is located {{at the rear of the}} saddle shed.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the main}} front {{elevation}} (on to Gdańska Street) stands a three-story avant-corps with a balcony, set beneath the gable and the pediment. The second avant-corps {{located on the}} northern side has an indoor loggia covered by a <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof.</b> Bricked railings are decorated with a stylized trefoil shapes.In facade decoration are also used volutes and obelisk-shaped pinnacles.|$|E

In the {{north side of the}} wall are visible the blocked up gothic-arched doorway and four lancet windows ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the rear}} are two sheds. The closest is a {{corrugated}} iron garage with two rooms. It has a gabled roof over two rooms with a <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof</b> over the garage. The rooms are clad in corrugated iron, with shutters {{opening to the}} outside and the inside. The doors to the rooms are boarded. There is also a recent metal-clad structure behind.|$|E
50|$|The 14th century nave is flanked on {{each side}} by aisles added in the early 15th century. The {{external}} walls of both aisles are buttressed and have a moulded stone plinth and a string course topped by a battlemented parapet. The aisles are divided from the nave with arcades of four pointed arches with octagonal columns and moulded capitals and bases. The capitals differ on the two arcades. Each aisle contains two three-lighted arched windows. The aisles have shallow <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs,</b> but evidence internally suggests that these were steeper before the 15th century. In {{the centre of the}} south aisle, the lower 15th-century porch contains single windows in the east and west sides and a battlemented parapet. The arched doorway contains quatrefoil decoration in the spandrels.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in red brick and terracotta with tiled roofs. Its plan {{consists of a}} five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles under <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs,</b> a chancel with a north organ loft and vestry, a south chapel, a northwest porch, and a west baptistry. The porch is timber-framed on a brick base. Along {{the sides of the}} aisles are alternating paired and triple lancet windows. The windows along the clerestory are octofoils. At the west end are gabled buttresses that rise above the level of the roof. In the baptistry are three square windows, four lancets, and an octofoil at the top. The east window consists of a central cross flanked by quatrefoils. The chapel has a caned end, lancet windows, and a bell in an iron frame.|$|R
50|$|St Michael's {{is built}} in buff rock-faced yellow {{sandstone}} with red ashlar dressings and slate roofs. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles under <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs,</b> a south porch, north and south transepts, a chancel with an apse and chapels, and a northwest tower. The tower has angle buttresses, and a north entrance with a crocketed hood, over which is a two-light window. Above this are clock faces on three sides, three bell openings, a frieze, a cornice, gargoyles, and an embattled parapet. At the west end is a three-light window containing Geometrical tracery, and {{along the sides of}} the aisles and clerestory are two-light windows. The windows in the transepts have four lights, and those in the chapels have three lights. The chapel and the porch are gabled.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the gable}} and <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof</b> ends {{of both the}} {{boarding}} house and kitchen timber framing is extended from wall top plates to the under side of the timber framed roof structures. These wall areas are externally clad with hardwood weatherboards. Remnant painted signage that reads [...] "King's Boarding House" [...] is just visible on the southern gable end of the boarding house building.|$|E
50|$|The {{facilities}} {{which have}} remained {{since the war}} and were still used {{at the end of}} the air station's operation were the hangars, the officer's mess hall and Mark. Three of the six main hangars have survived. These were standard German types. The one consisted of a <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof</b> supported by a truss. The other two had a semicircular arch roof. Both were built with wooden walls and roofs.|$|E
50|$|A {{mono-pitched roof}} {{can also be}} a smaller {{addition}} to an existing roof, where keeping to the same slope (roof pitch) puts the mono-pitched roof lower than the ceiling height of the main structure. In this case even though the main roof has a flat ceiling, the mono-pitched part will have a sloping, or raked, ceiling line to maximise the ceiling height. The name <b>lean-to</b> <b>roof</b> comes from this form of addition.|$|E
50|$|The present {{building}} was begun in sandstone {{in the early}} 13th century, in Early English style, probably {{on the site of}} an earlier church, perhaps a wooden Mercian structure. The aisles are wide, making the nave, which has five bays, very square in appearance. The present plan is probably very similar to the original 13th-century lay-out. The chancel is the part of the church that is structurally most similar to when it was first built. However, the remainder of the church has been altered so often and so substantially {{that it is impossible to}} be sure of its exact architectural history. Major changes took place in the 14th and 16th centuries, with the height of the nave being raised greatly, necessitating large alterations to the aisles. This greatly altered the cross-section of the building, with <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs</b> on the aisles replacing the original gabled design.|$|R
5000|$|St John's is {{constructed}} in rock-faced stone, with ashlar bands and dressings, under a slate roof. It {{consists of a}} nave and chancel with no structural division, north and south aisles under <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs,</b> a clerestory, north and south transepts, north and south chapels, a canted baptistry at the west end, and a southwest porch. [...] At the southeast corner is a turret with a belfry, and an octagonal pyramidal roof. [...] The west window of the nave has a five-light window with Geometrical tracery. Along {{the sides of the}} aisles are three-light windows, and along the clerestory are two-light windows, all of which are paired between buttresses. The south transept has a five-light window, and the north transept forms the organ loft. The east window has seven lights, and each chapel has a rose window. The porch has a pointed arch and a shaped gable.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} built {{in red and}} buff stone, which is irregularly banded. The main roof is tiled, while the roofs of the aisles are of slate. Its plan {{consists}} of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles under <b>lean-to</b> <b>roofs,</b> a west tower, a north porch, a chancel with a chapel to the north, the organ loft {{to the south and}} a detached vestry connected to the chancel by a short passage. The tower has angled buttresses and a west entrance above which is a three-light window. The top stage has two-light louvred bell-openings and a panelled parapet with pinnacles at the corners. The spire is recessed on an octagonal base containing gabled two-light openings and it is attached to the pinnacles by flying buttresses. At the south east corner of the tower is a lean-to stair turret. The porch has a flat roof with a parapet and a niche over the entrance containing a statue.|$|R
