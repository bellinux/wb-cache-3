5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The <b>legal</b> <b>uncertainty</b> that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E

25|$|The Scottish Parliament met in Edinburgh 1 August 1560. Fourteen earls, six bishops, {{nineteen}} lords, twenty-one abbots, twenty-two burgh commissioners, {{and over}} a hundred lairds, claimed the right to sit. Ignoring {{the provisions of the}} Treaty of Edinburgh, on 17 August, Parliament approved a Reformed Confession of Faith (the Scots Confession), and on 24 August it passed three Acts that abolished the old faith in Scotland. Under these, all previous acts not in conformity with the Reformed Confession were annulled; the sacraments were reduced to two (Baptism and Communion) to be performed by reformed preachers alone; the celebration of the Mass was made punishable by a series of penalties (ultimately death) and Papal jurisdiction in Scotland was repudiated. The Queen declined to endorse the acts that Parliament had passed and the new kirk existed in a state of <b>legal</b> <b>uncertainty.</b>|$|E

25|$|In December 2013 the US Fish and Wildlife Service {{announced}} that it would issue 30-year permits to wind energy projects to allow for eagle deaths; previously, permits had been available for only 5 years, but none were issued to wind projects. Under the 30-year permits, wind power developers would be required to report eagle deaths, and the permits would be reviewed every 5 years. The measure was intended to remove what was seen as <b>legal</b> <b>uncertainty</b> discouraging wind energy investments. The government said that an environmental review was not needed for the change, because it was only an administrative change. The new regulation was welcomed by the American Wind Energy Association, which said that wind power caused less than two percent of human-caused eagle fatalities, and pointed out that the rules would require extensive mitigation and monitoring of eagle deaths. The extension of eagle taking permits from 5 to 30 years was opposed by a number of conservation groups, including the American Bird Conservancy, the Nature Conservancy, the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society, and the Humane Society of the United States.|$|E
500|$|Hayes states that, {{although}} licensees' {{benefits are}} limited, the licenses reduce reliance on fair use regarding machinima. In turn, this recognition may reduce film festivals' concerns about copyright clearance; {{in an earlier}} analogous situation, festivals were concerned about documentary films until best practices for them were developed. According to Hayes, Microsoft and Blizzard helped themselves through their licenses because fan creations provide free publicity and are unlikely to harm sales. If the companies had instead sued for copyright infringement, defendants could have claimed estoppel or implied license because machinima had been unaddressed for a long time. Thus, these licenses secured their issuers' legal rights. Even though other companies, such as Electronic Arts, have encouraged machinima, they have avoided licensing it. Because of the involved legal complexity, they may prefer to under-enforce copyrights. Hayes believes that this <b>legal</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is a suboptimal solution and that, though limited and [...] "idiosyncratic", the Microsoft and Blizzard licenses move towards an ideal video gaming industry standard for handling derivative works.|$|E
500|$|As the {{legislature}} sat, the townships of Bergen County fractured. [...] The {{provision of the}} Borough Act allowing separation had been little used prior to 1893. A year-long legal battle in Palisades Township, along the Hudson River, led to a referendum that saw Tenafly break away in January 1894. Some communities seceded in early 1894 because of disputes about {{how to pay for}} macadamized roads, which were first paved through much of Bergen County {{in the first half of}} the 1890s. The Hackensack Republican reported on March 1, [...] "the chief reason why Delford , Westwood, Hillsdale and Park Ridge want to become boroughs is that they may avoid what is feared will be heavy macadam tax". [...] The proposed borough of Delford would take land from multiple townships, uniting communities on both sides of the Hackensack River that shared a school, but incorporation was put on hold because of <b>legal</b> <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether a borough could be formed from parts of more than one township.|$|E

They noted that the Ninth Circuit's decision in Adams v. Howerton (1982), which the same court cited in 2010, held the word spouse as used in immigration law can not be read to mean same-sex spouse. They advised that [...] "Congress ... should also take up the issue of immigration benefits for same-sex couples, to provide clarity given the <b>legal</b> <b>uncertainty</b> around this matter.

Following a ruling of the Supreme Court of Ireland in 1992now known in Ireland as the X caseterminations are allowed under certain circumstances, where [...] "a pregnant woman's life was at risk because of pregnancy, including the risk of suicide". However at the time of Halappanavar's death, there was <b>legal</b> <b>uncertainty</b> regarding the precise circumstances in which this exception to preserve {{the life of the mother}} would apply in practice, as the matter had not yet been enacted in legislation.

2500|$|Twenty-three {{members of}} the State Council arrived in due time but Nicholas delayed the {{announcement}} for hours, waiting for Michael.

He [...] "seated himself in the place of the President" [...] and read his accession manifest. This, according to Korff, was the first ever precedent when the State Council convened at night. Nicholas went at lengths in explaining how the <b>legal</b> <b>uncertainty</b> set by Alexander lured him into pledging allegiance to Constantine. He specifically required [...] "that the time of Our accession to the Throne be counted from the 19th day of November 1825", the day of Alexander's death, sealing the fact that Constantine had never reigned and that the oath to Constantine was merely a misunderstanding rectified by Nicholas. The State Council accepted the fact without further discussion and was dismissed at about 1 a.m.|$|E

Due to the <b>legal</b> <b>uncertainty</b> {{of the status of}} Jerusalem, for birth in Jerusalem within its 1948 municipal borders, [...] "Jerusalem" [...] is used regardless of date of birth. In 2002, Congress passed legislation that said that American citizens born in Jerusalem may list [...] "Israel" [...] as their country of birth, although Presidents George W.

Transference from the conventional practice to BIM will make the design liabilities change and create <b>legal</b> <b>uncertainties</b> among the professionals.

With this prime intention, this research was conducted adopting mixture of legal and scientific research methods. Initially preliminary literature synthesis was carried out which discussed the present legal environment with the expected change through BIM. The legal analysis was carried out following the flexible iterative style where the researchers’ opinion blends with the experiences from primary sources of law to build up the tentative hypothesis. Through semi structured interviews with a group of experts representing different proficiencies in the construction industry, this tentative hypothesis was tested; the collected data from construction industry experts were subjected to content analysis based on opinions and suggestions, these findings were then interpreted to identify the suitable legal framework. The legal framework which was identified includes the preventive mechanism of negligent acts, liabilities of the human factor, process and enforceability, actions, proposed provisions and suggestion. Hence, this framework is recommended to be implemented in the BIM environment. International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and			 Construction (CIB...|$|R
