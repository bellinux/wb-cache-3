500|$|The {{album cover}} {{received}} some criticism from journalists but Gruff Rhys has called it [...] "great" [...] and claims to <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "graphics {{and the words}} are placed in kind of, what seem to be random places... it's not a predictable record cover, it doesn't look like an album by the Editors or something".|$|E
500|$|The {{producer}} John Lloyd {{cited the}} episode's lack of another major character {{as the reason}} they had time to [...] "explore the relationships of the five principal people". Rowan Atkinson said that the scene involving Darling's [...] "ghastly realisation" [...] of his commission was [...] "very sad"; Lloyd commented [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Captain Darling does have some compassion; he's not just a bureaucrat". They noted that [...] "all the comedy just goes away" [...] upon Darling's arrival in the trench, and that [...] "there are still funny moments, but dramatically there's no comic content, it's just leading inexorably to the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith {{mentioned}} {{his admiration for}} Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: [...] "My father {{taught me how to}} play 'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right'. I love Dylan's words, but even more than that, I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he loves words." [...] Smith covered Dylan's [...] "When I Paint My Masterpiece" [...] several times in concert. Smith has also been compared to folk legend Nick Drake, due to his fingerpicking style and vocals. Darryl Cater of AllMusic called references to [...] "the definitive folk loner" [...] Drake [...] "inevitable", and Smith's lyrics have been compared to those in Drake's minimalist and haunting final album.|$|E

500|$|... "Friend or Foe" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk {{was positive}} towards the episode {{specifically on the}} live action scenes, writing [...] "Patchy and Potty are always funny, so it's great to see them slinging hamburgers in honor of their idol, SpongeBob. I particularly liked the gorilla at the end, whipping burgers at Patchy ('You got me right in the buns!')." [...] Mavis also praised the episode calling it [...] "brilliant" [...] because [...] " [...] Krabs and Plankton are strong enough characters, with their own mythology, that they can sustain their very own episode with only a cameo from SpongeBob." [...] He also said the episode is [...] "hilarious (I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it's a barely disguised version of Rashomon), with an especially funny look at Krabs, Plankton, and even SpongeBob, as babies." ...|$|E
500|$|Ayola {{began her}} career in the theatre, {{performing}} {{in a number of}} Shakespearean plays including Twelfth Night, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Tempest, The Merchant of Venice and Macbeth. She states of this: [...] "Shakespeare keeps coming my way. I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I get to play people who are much more articulate than I'll ever be". Ayola has performed in Twelfth Night in the lead roles of both Olivia and Viola. She explains: [...] "The role of Viola didn't sit that well with me for some reason but Olivia makes more sense." [...] She has also appeared in modern performances, assuming the title role of Dido, Queen of Carthage at the Globe Theatre in London in 2003, which she described as [...] "a dream of a part". She has deemed her dream role to be that of Isabella in Measure for Measure, as she once lost out on the part and would like to prove herself capable of playing it.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first time that the {{characters}} of Nina Sharp and David Robert Jones had common scenes within the show, but both Blair Brown and Jared Harris had previously acted together as mother and son in an off-Broadway production of the play Humble Boy. During the scene in which Nina was tortured to taunt Olivia into using her powers, Brown actually injured herself on the rusty bedsprings used as the prop for the show. Brown referred to the alternative version of her character as [...] "Meana" [...] due to her seemingly [...] "mean" [...] personality, and speculated that Nina may have become this way because without William Bell, [...] "she wasn’t at the party with all of the boys, the science boys" [...] and thus developed an [...] "outsider" [...] perspective. She said of the role, [...] "It’s a really interesting thing to play. I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they look exactly the same, at least for a while." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked what}} his {{childhood}} heroes were: [...] "My heroes growing up were Col. Hogan and Capt. Kirk. I <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they could always think {{themselves out of}} a situation.

50|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by the band itself in Copenhagen and sound engineer, Freddy Hansson went to Trident Studios in London to mix it with Roy Thomas Baker.

[...] An article on Metacritic noted that Marshall was removed due to changes in the show's budget.|$|E
500|$|Passions {{creator and}} head writer James E. Reilly had {{approached}} Amelia Marshall {{about the role}} of Liz Sanbourne after they worked together on Guiding Light.

500|$|Contrary to the lukewarm {{response}} to the pilot, [...] "Diversity Day" [...] earned positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode positive reviews, stating that: [...] "Think of the toss-off racism of the original, plopped into a PC-gone-wrong showcase that might be entitled The Accidental Bigot. As when the African-American diversity trainer introduces himself as Mr. Brown, and Scott assures him, 'I will not call you that.'" [...] Ricky Gervais, who was {{the lead in the}} British series, stated that, in comparison to the British version, [...] "It is as good. I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> apart from the first one, the scripts are all original. You've gone back to the blueprint of what the characters are and you've started from there, as opposed to copying anything." [...] Rolling Stone magazine named the scene wherein Michael shows the office his diversity video the third greatest Moment from The Office. The article particularly praised Michael's line: [...] "Abraham Lincoln once said, 'If you are a racist, I will attack you with the North.|$|E

500|$|The {{narrator of}} the song worries that the girl he is {{addressing}} will ignore him because {{he has nothing to}} give her; likewise, the song's audience in the 1980syoung students and workerswere also suffering from not having resources to marry, to be with their girlfriends and boyfriends, or to attract members of the opposite sex. [...] The lyrics also express Western concepts of individualism, and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self-expression and self-empowerment. This put the song in stark contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience. As the narrator, later on in the song, confidently proclaims to the girl that he will [...] "grab her hands" [...] ("") and then she will go with him (""), he suggests in the end that she can <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he has nothing (""). On one level, this suggests that the song is about [...] "love conquering all", but the line has also been interpreted as threatening, and suggestive of an unorthodox and [...] "Dionysian" [...] mix of love and aggression.|$|E
500|$|While playing junior hockey, Hextall's coaches {{advised him}} that he would not reach the NHL if he {{continued}} to move the puck. Not everyone agreed; NHL goaltender Darren Pang described feeling as if [...] "he had just witnessed Superman flying out of a phone booth" [...] when he saw Hextall's puckhandling ability in a minor league game. Former NHL goaltender Johnny Bower, when scouting for the Toronto Maple Leafs in Brandon, remarked that Hextall would at times let in soft goals, and doubted if he would reach the NHL; Hextall retained a tendency to let in occasional weak goals throughout his career. Hextall claims his adventurous style stemmed from his youth, when he played on outdoor ice rinks with a skater's stick, rather than the heftier goaltender's stick. Martin Brodeur modelled his own play on that of Hextall, saying [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he was playing the puck. He {{was one of the first}} goalies that came out and played the puck. He was a little rough for my liking, but it was entertaining. The playing of the puck was the big thing." [...] Hextall's mobility provided extra passing opportunities for his defencemen: when killing a penalty they would frequently pass the puck back to him, relieving some of the pressure on his team. He is described on the Hockey Hall of Fame's Legends of Hockey website as being [...] "perhaps the game's most mobile goalie of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|The New Directions set {{of three}} Jackson family numbers was favorably {{reviewed}} by most critics, though they didn't necessarily agree on which songs were most effective. Bell couldn't decide whether she enjoyed these three songs or the Troubletones mash-up more, and West felt the [...] "choreography on {{the whole thing was}} stellar", and graded it an [...] "A+". Votta singled out [...] "ABC", which demonstrated [...] "what a lovely singer Tina is", and Kubicek said he enjoyed it [...] "mostly because Tina deserves more singing time, and I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Mike is now an actual singer who gets his own solos". Chaney called it [...] "a solid performance" [...] and gave it a B+, while Futterman wrote that it [...] "felt like a flashback to the New Directions' group performances of yesteryear, when it was all about an over-the-top, feel-good attitude". The dancing in [...] "Control" [...] was highlighted in many reviews: Hyman and Slezak were complimentary, but Chaney wrote that the [...] "choreography seemed a little awkward and occasionally out of synch", that it was [...] "the least effective of the three Jackson numbers" [...] and added that for her [...] "this felt dated when it could have been retro-fresh"; she graded the song a [...] "C". However, Futterman made mention of the [...] "slick dance moves", and Votta noted that the [...] "jazz band guys" [...] were [...] "holding their own with the background dancing through the whole number". However, for Kubicek, the song [...] "definitely brought down the energy at the middle of their performance". Bell characterized the final song as [...] "an amazing 'Man in the Mirror' cover", and Chaney said it was [...] "the best of their three songs", and gave it an [...] "A−". However, Slezak wrote that it [...] "proved to be a tonally jarring ending to the performance".|$|E
5000|$|Discussing the song's history, Dixon has said: [...] "ShamRock aka Sak Pase - who's one of Akon's proteges - {{produced}} the track. And, {{as soon as}} I walked into the studio with him and Nate Walker (the track's co-writer) I instantly just felt something special!... You know, I'm always looking for something that's just full of life; that's different, quirky, and that can't {{be put in a}} box... Plus I <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> TOUGHNESS of it! I particularly <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it is female-empowering, but not in a feminist trying-to-wave-the-flag-and-be rude-about-men kind of way." ...|$|R
5000|$|On Phoenix's fifth studio album, Bankrupt!, {{the sixth}} track is titled 'Drakkar Noir'.

50|$|Armitage says Corman {{left him}} alone {{for most of}} the film.He wanted us to do {{whatever}} we felt, what we were thinking of poetically, socially, culturally at the time. So I tried to look at it from a woman’s point-of-view, adding my own feelings about what was going on. Corman and I got along very well. I didn’t like the way Hollywood treated him—he was kind of an underdog and I <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he would just say, “Here, go make the movie.” He never came to the set, he totally allowed us to do what we were doing...

"I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> on one side, with acting, {{you can be}} a child—acting is {{wonderful}} for its innocence and the fun[...] [...] On the other side, producing is fun for all the adult kinds of things you do. You deal in business, you deal with the creative forces. As an adult who continues to get older, you like the adult risks. It's flying without a net, taking chances and learning. I was never good in economics or business—had no business background, you know, and I like it.|$|E
2500|$|S. Louisa Wei's 2014 feature documentary, Golden Gate Girls, {{compares the}} media {{representation}} of Arzner {{with that of}} Esther Eng, Hong Kong's first woman director who was a Chinese American. Judith Mayne, the author of Directed by Dorothy Arzner, is interviewed in the documentary, saying, [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> history of woman filmmakers now would include Dorothy Arzner and Esther Eng {{as the two of}} the real exceptions, who proved it was entirely possible to build a successful film career without necessarily being a part of mainstream identity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Breakin' the Law" [...] {{was taken}} from Destroyer's first album We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge. The group vocals {{at the end of}} [...] "Breakin' the Law" [...] are {{credited}} to the Camp Northstar Kids' Chorus, a reference to the Canadian comedy film Meatballs. The chorus is actually every member of the band singing. Newman stated, [...] "I like the fact that people think that it's a kids' group... We made ourselves sound like a giant group, but we ended up sounding like little kids. I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> in the Rolling Stone review they mention the chorus of kids. I just think it's great that people actually believe that, because it's such a fucking ridiculous thing for a band to do." ...|$|E

5000|$|Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Pam Beesly {{had been}} {{featured}} {{more on the}} show. He remarked on the ending that [...] "Coming {{at the end of}} a mostly light episode, that was a heavy line. Nice payoff, Office." [...] Neil Turitz of TV Guide remarked [...] "One of the funnier episodes of late, especially the montage of Dwight continually causing himself great pain in the crotch area. Low humor, perhaps, but still funny." [...] Will Leitch of New York said [...] "All in all, this penultimate episode took care of Michael, Dwight, and every other lingering thread from a meandering season except for the big one, in a very funny last-scene reveal." ...|$|R
