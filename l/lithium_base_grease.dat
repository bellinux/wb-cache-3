MoS 2 nanosheets were prepared by mechano-chemical {{process in a}} planetary ball mill with selective organic molecules particularly lecithin (a source of phosphorus (exfoliating/stabilizing agent)) along with antiwear additives (ZDDP). Tribological evolutions show significant influence of MoS 2 nanosheets on the friction coefficient, WSD (wear scar diameter) and extreme pressure properties of <b>lithium</b> <b>based</b> <b>grease.</b> The elemental composition analysis of the wear track shows the presence of Mo, S, and P on the surface protective layer, revealing {{the formation of a}} tribofilm containing MoS 2 nanosheets along with phosphorus based moieties...|$|R

The experimental results show that the grease LGLT 2 performs well under above conditions,demonsrating lower traction coefficients with the increasing rolling speed.

40|$|Mineral oils used by grease {{manufacturers}} can {{be divided}} into two major groups, naphthenic oils and paraffinic oils. These categories of base oils have their own advantages and disadvantages depending on the applications and conditions. The most important advantages of the naphthenic oils over the paraffinic oils, with the same viscosity and similar aromatic content, are better low-temperature flowability and better solvency. The contribution of having base oils with good solvency towards the thickener is that less thickener is needed to obtain a certain consistency of the finished product. For instance, a typical NLGI grade 2 <b>lithium</b> <b>based</b> <b>grease,</b> <b>based</b> on a solvent neutral 500, group one (Gr I) oil, may contain 9 - 14 wt% thickener; while 6 - 8 % thickener is required for an equivalent viscosity oil of naphthenic nature. Using blends of naphthenic oil and paraffinic group one oil have successfully been used during the past decade in India. However, the author believes that the surplus of paraffinic Gr II and Gr III base oils is one among a number of market trends that brings some great opportunities to the grease formulators, if they look for blends where naphthenic oils are regarded as part of the solution for a sustainable formulation. A number of key parameters important for the performance of the finished product could be obtained within reasonable cost. The purpose of this work was to compare “side by side” three base oil blends where paraffinic Gr I, Gr II and Gr III, in combination with naphthenic, were used for preparation of lubricating greases. Since the target viscosity was 150 mm 2 /s at 40 ºC, a naphthenic oil was used in order to reach this viscosity. The overall results obtained, reveal some interesting aspects of the use of Gr II as a substitute to Gr I for preparation of greases. The outcome of this work emphasizes that blends should be regarded as a great opportunity for grease formulators who are looking for some further development of their current formulations and furthermore, the lubricating <b>grease</b> <b>based</b> on the blend of paraffinic Gr II and naphthenic oil performs better than others...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{recovery}} of base oils from waste <b>lithium</b> <b>based</b> lubricating <b>grease</b> was investigated using a novel combination of thermal degradation in an aqueous caustic solution and solvent extraction. Lubricating grease is an important resource that cannot be disposed of randomly due {{to the presence of}} pollutants. In response to economic challenges and environmental protection, there is a growing trend to regenerate and reuse waste lubricant. Waste grease was initially dissolved in a 20 w/w% KOH solution at 80 oC while being agitated for a period of 15 min. Two distinct layers were observed after 10 min of settling time. The top layer being of dark brown oil and the bottom layer was a heterogeneous mixture. The two layers were separated by decantation. The bottom layer was cooled to 45 oC followed by slow addition of n-hexane while agitating to prevent the settling of solids. Two distinct layers were also formed, the top homogeneous mixture of light brown oil–toluene mixture and the bottom sludge layer. This research has further optimized the process by studying the effect of KOH concentration to enhance flocculation and recovery of oil. Oil recovery increased from 5 % to 30 %. The recovery also increased with an increase of solvent-togrease ratio up to 1 : 6. A solvent recovery of 82. 6 % to 88 % by mass was obtained through fractional distillation. The overall oil recovery from waste grease using the combined extraction processes was 75 w/w%...|$|R

40|$|The {{friction}} and wear characteristics of two formulated perfluoropolyether <b>based</b> <b>greases</b> {{were compared to}} their non-additive <b>base</b> <b>greases.</b> One grease was developed for the electronics industry (designated as GXL- 296 A) while the other is for space applications (designated as GXL- 320 A). The formulated greases (GXL- 296 B and GXL- 320 B) contained a proprietary antiwear additive at an optimized concentration. Tests were conducted using a vacuum four-ball tribometer. AISI 52100 steel specimens were used for all GXL- 296 tests. Both AISI 52100 steel and 440 C stainless steel were tested with the GXL- 320 greases. Test conditions included: a pressure less than 6. 7 x 10 (exp) - 4 Pa, a 200 N load, a sliding velocity of 28. 8 mm/sec (100 rpm) and room temperature (approximately equal to 23 C). Wear rates for each grease were determined from {{the slope of the}} wear volume as a function of sliding distance. Both non-additive <b>base</b> <b>greases</b> yielded relatively high wear rates on the order of 10 (exp - 8) cu mm using AISI 52100 steel specimens. Formulated grease GXL- 296 B yielded a reduction in wear rate by a factor of approximately 21, while grease GXL- 320 B had a reduction of approximately 12 times. Lower wear rates (- 50 %) were observed with both GXL- 320 greases using 440 C stainless steel.

40|$|M. Tech. (Mechanical Engineering) This study {{investigated}} process development of recovering base oils from waste <b>lithium</b> <b>based</b> lubricating <b>grease</b> using a novel combination of thermal degradation {{in an aqueous}} caustic solution and solvent extraction. Lubricating greases consist of a thickening agent dispersed in mineral or synthetic oil, forming a colloidal suspension [1]. Large and increasing volumes of used lubricating oil and grease are produced each year and are considered hazardous wastes. During operation, grease suffers mechanical and thermal degradation [2]. Subsequently, it is regarded as waste {{and it must be}} disposed. The waste oil should be collected and recycled not only to prevent the environmental pollution but also to preserve natural resources. Solvent extraction is the preferred method to recycle waste lubricants as it is cost-effective and requires no further purification of the product [3]. The influence of extraction temperature, agitation strength, extraction time, degrading agent concentration, degrading agent-to-grease and solvent-to-sludge mixing ratios on base oil recovery from waste lubricating grease was investigated. This study further optimised the process by studying the influence of various degrading agents (LiOH, NaOH and KOH) and solvents (n-hexane, toluene, heptane, butane, hexanol and acetone) on oil recovery. Oil recovery was enhanced by increase in both extraction temperature, time and agitation speed. The optimum extraction time was found to be 12 minutes. KOH was found to be the optimum degrading agent compared to LiOH and NaOH. Oil recovery also increased from 8. 04 % to 36. 87 % with increase in KOH m/m from 5 % to 30 %. The recovery also increased with an increase of solvent-to-sludge ratio up to 1 : 6. n-Hexane gave the highest recovery of 74. 39 % while acetone gave the lowest of 7. 43 %. A solvent recovery of 82. 6 % to 88 % was obtained through fractional distillation. The study also investigated the differences between virgin and recycled oil using atomic absorption (AA), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and Fourier transform infrared radiation (FTIR). Rheological studies of waste grease derived oil (WGDO) were also performed. ICP results showed traces of some elements such as Fe, Cu, Si, Ni and Al at a concentration of less than 0. 9 mg/L. Oxidation was observed to occur at a band length of 1716 cm- 1 while additives were identified at 1670 - 1725 cm- 1. The oil viscosity slightly increased with increasing shear rate at temperatures between 60 °C and 120 °C. The shear rate was varied from 200 to 1000 1 /s, with a viscosity convergence at 100 °C. A financial economic model was applied to investigate the feasibility of the recycling technology. For 800 kg/day treatment plant, an investment of R 6, 031, 304. 27 is required with a potential return on investment of 40 %.
