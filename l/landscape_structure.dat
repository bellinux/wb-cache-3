40|$|International audienceTo {{investigate}} whether <b>landscape</b> <b>structures</b> act as insurmountable barriers for foraging bees, we conducted mark-recapture studies with two pollen-specialist solitary species. Foraging options of the bees {{were confined to}} host plant stands across different <b>landscape</b> <b>structures.</b> Differences in altitude of more than 130 m were overcome and forests covering a distance of up to 480 m were crossed by Chelostoma florisomne. A broad river and a motorway with intense traffic did not represent insurmountable barriers for Hoplitis adunca. For C. florisomne, total foraging distances of up to 650 m were measured, but foraging females were recorded predominantly on host plant patches available in relatively close vicinity to their nesting site.

Aim. To test the potential influence of <b>landscape</b> <b>structures</b> of a fragmented landscape {{on the distribution of}} terrestrial birds. Methods. The salinas were mapped using a Geographical Information System and landscape metrics were calculated to quantify <b>landscape</b> <b>structures.</b> Birds were surveyed with a point count method. Multivariate analyses and multiple linear regressions were used to test for potential links between landscape metrics and bird distribution. Results. The <b>landscape</b> <b>structures</b> of the salinas influenced bird assemblages significantly. The core of the salinas, with more-fragmented and less-diverse landscapes, contained the lowest abundance, richness and diversity of birds, but this assemblage tended to be homogeneous and distinct. Bird abundance, richness and diversity mainly increased with landscape richness and diversity, the terrestrial area available and the proximity to the continental domain. Conclusion. This study is the first to demonstrate and quantify the influence of salina <b>landscape</b> <b>structures</b> on terrestrial bird assemblages...|$|R

A field survey, it was found that significant historical <b>landscape</b> <b>structures</b> are primarily in the form of antierosion lanes and agricultural terraces. They used to determine the character of the landscape of the model territory since the Middle Ages. The 57 occurences of antierosion lanes and eight agricultural terraces were recorded in the modeling area. These antierosion lanes are 37 survived, 21 disappeared and six agricultural terraces are preserved and one of the parts. The result of this thesis is a summary of their importance.

The area has a generally tranquil character, although the presence of stables and fences associated with the increase in land use change to [...] "horsiculture". modern large farm buildings and storage compounds, can detract from this, visually eroding the rural character and resulting in removal or fragmentation of hedgerows.

50|$|Secondary {{succession}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of ecological succession of plant life. As opposed to the first, primary succession, secondary succession is a process started by an event (e.g. forest fire, harvesting, hurricane) that reduces an already established ecosystem (e.g. a forest or a wheat field) to a smaller population of species, and as such secondary succession occurs on preexisting soil whereas primary succession usually occurs in a place lacking soil. Many factors can affect secondary succession, such as trophic interaction, initial composition, and competition-colonization trade-offs. The factors that control the increase in abundance of a species during succession may be determined mainly by seed production and dispersal, micro climate; <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> (habitat patch size and distance to outside seed sources); Bulk density, pH, soil texture (sand and clay).|$|E
50|$|Had {{the rock}} strata been undisturbed, the typical <b>landscape</b> <b>structure</b> {{of the rock}} country would end shortly after Annweiler due to their inclination. Tectonic processes, however, led to the {{shifting}} and displacement of individual layers of rock so that, west of the Elmstein Fault roughly from Wilgartswiesen, Spirkelbach, Schwanheim Erlenbach, Niederschlettenbach up to Lembach in Alsace the rock forming Trifels beds were uplifted by about 80 to 100 metres and so these rocks continue to shape {{the surface of the}} landscape in the Dahner Felsenland and Schönau Felsenland. Only west of the (Wies-)Lauter and Sauer or Saarbach do they dive permanently beneath the younger strata of the Middle Bunter Sandstein, for example, the Karlstal beds, so that the landscape of the western Wasgau appears {{similar to that of the}} Middle Palatinate Forest. This also applies to the southern part of Wasgau because, in the area of the Col de Saverne or Pfalzburg Trough (Pfalzburger Mulde) the various rock formations are less strongly arched and therefore their surface layers were not as severely eroded. For this reason, younger rocks of the Middle and Upper Bunter form the surface of the hills, whilst Rehberg and Trifels beds only occur in deep V-shaped valleys. Also, south of a line from Ingweiler through Wingen-sur-Moder to Diemeringen, the main distribution zone of Bunter sandstone from the eastern edge of the trough to the rocks of the Lower Muschelkalk in the west narrows from a width of about 15 km to a minimum of 7 km in the area of the Col de Saverne (see map above).|$|E
