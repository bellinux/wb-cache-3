40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate mortality and performance, darkling beetle population (Alphitobius diaperinus), light intensity, electrical energy consumption and economic efficiency of broilers reared under two <b>lighting</b> <b>programs</b> (nearly continuous or intermittent) and two curtain colors (yellow or blue). The experiment was conducted between June, 2004 and May, 2005. Six flocks were sequentially housed in four 12 &# 215; 10 m broiler houses divided into 4 pens with 200 birds each. Litter was reused six times or until flock 6. Body weight and feed conversion were determined on days 21, 35, and 42 of each flock. Mortality was recorded daily. Electrical energy consumption was recorded at the end of the grow-out of each flock (every 42 days). A completely randomized design in a 6 &# 215; 2 &# 215; 2 factorial arrangement (flocks, <b>lighting</b> <b>programs,</b> curtains) with four replicates per treatment was applied. Broilers reared in houses with yellow curtains and under nearly continuous <b>lighting</b> <b>programs</b> presented the best feed conversion ratio and the highest body weight. Nearly continuous <b>lighting</b> <b>programs</b> resulted in 1. 48 times more sudden deaths and 1. 34 times higher general mortality when compared with intermittent <b>lighting</b> <b>programs.</b> Electrical energy consumption was 2. 12 times higher in nearly continuous <b>lighting</b> <b>programs</b> in relation to intermittent <b>lighting</b> <b>programs.</b> The presence of darkling beetles was higher in broiler houses with blue curtains and intermittent <b>lighting</b> <b>program.</b> The economic analysis showed the feasibility of using a mixed system, with intermittent <b>light</b> <b>program</b> in winter and spring and nearly continuous <b>lighting</b> <b>program</b> in the summer and autumn, both in broiler houses with yellow curtains...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effects of fluctuate lighting on performance of laying hens. Two programs were applied with 16 hours daily lighting: step-up (normal) <b>lighting</b> <b>program</b> as the control treatment and a fluctuate <b>lighting</b> <b>program</b> of 2 W/m 2 for 45 min and 6 W/m 2 for 15 min.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate carcass and parts' yield, abdominal fat deposition and breast and foot pad blisters of broilers reared under two <b>lighting</b> <b>programs</b> (nearly continuous or intermittent) in broilers houses with yellow and blue curtains.

A total of 60 one-day-old broiler chickens (Cobb 500) were distributed in three light-proof controlled rooms (20 chicks per room). All birds were reared in continuous light until 3 days of age. Then, chicks were treated as follows: 1) intermittent <b>lighting</b> <b>program</b> (1 L: 3 D cycles), 2) continuous <b>lighting</b> <b>program</b> (24 L), and 3) nonintermittent restricted <b>lighting</b> <b>program</b> (8 L: 16 D).

40|$|ABSTRACT Two trials Were {{conducted}} {{to determine if a}} high intensity (20 lx) step-up <b>lighting</b> <b>program</b> would decrease the incidence of leg abnormalities in turkeys. The step-up lighting regimen was compared to a low intensity (2. 5 lx) step-down <b>lighting</b> <b>program.</b> Toms were used in Trial 1 and both sexes were employed in Trial 2. Body weight, feed/gain ratio, and mortality of toms of Trial 1 did not differ significantly between lighting regimens. The incidence of leg deformities and the length of the tarsometatarsal bone were significantly decreased, whereas plasma androgen and testes weights were increased for toms of Trial 1 in the high intensity step-up lighting. The same trends were apparent for toms of Trial 2 with the exceptions that feed/gain ratios were adversely affected and testes weights were significantly lower for toms of the high intensity step-up <b>lighting</b> <b>program.</b> The performance of hens in the high intensity step-up <b>lighting</b> <b>program</b> of Trial 2 was affected adversely; however, incidence of leg abnormalities and length and width of the tarsometatarsus responded {{in the same manner as}} with toms. The results of this study indicate that a high intensity step-up <b>lighting</b> <b>program</b> can significantly reduce leg weakness problems in turkeys. Possible explanations for light stimulation reducing the incidence of leg abnormalities are through increased exercise and shortening of long bones.
