5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual <b>lunar</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.|$|E

50|$|While Chief Designer Sergei Korolev had {{originally}} envisioned a manned <b>lunar</b> <b>spacecraft</b> launched in pieces by R-7 boosters and assembled in Earth orbit, {{the advent of}} Vladimir Chelomei's large UR-500 booster theoretically {{made it possible to}} do the job in a single launch. However, Chelomei also proposed his own, competing <b>lunar</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> the LK-1, and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev gave his approval in August 1964. Two months later, Khrushchev was expelled from power and Chelomei lost his principal patron. At the end of the year, Korolev revived his proposal for the Soyuz spacecraft, but concealed his true intentions by billing it as merely an Earth orbital vehicle for testing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. In October 1965, a mere three months before his death, Korolev was granted official approval for developing a manned <b>lunar</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> which would be a modified Soyuz. This would be launched towards the Moon on a UR-500 topped with the Blok D stage under development by the OKB-1 Bureau.|$|E

50|$|Using {{on-board}} propellant and lunar gravity, the orbit's apogee {{was gradually}} increased with several manoeuvres at perigee until it flew by the Moon {{at a distance}} of 6,200 km from its surface in May 1998, becoming in a sense the first commercial <b>lunar</b> <b>spacecraft.</b> Another lunar fly-by was performed later that month {{at a distance of}} 34,300 km to further improve the orbital inclination.|$|E

50|$|During 1961 Saturn C-x {{configurations}} {{seemed to}} change month by month. In February 1961, the C-2 design finalized as a three-stage vehicle for Earth-escape missions, using an S-II second stage. It was calculated that 15 launches and rendezvous of the C-2 {{would have been}} required to assemble a <b>lunar</b> <b>spacecraft</b> in Low Earth orbit. By May 1961, a more powerful vehicle was desired for circumlunar missions, hence the C-2 was dropped {{in favor of the}} Saturn C-3. Further development of the C-2 vehicle was cancelled on 23 June 1961.|$|E

50|$|At this point, however, {{all three}} stages existed only on paper, {{and it was}} {{realized}} that it was very likely that the actual <b>lunar</b> <b>spacecraft</b> would be developed and ready for testing long before the booster. NASA therefore decided to also continue development of the C-1 (later Saturn I) as a test vehicle, since its lower stage was based on existing technology (Redstone and Jupiter tankage) and its upper stage was already in development. This would provide valuable testing for the S-IV as well as a launch platform for capsules and other components in low earth orbit.|$|E
5000|$|Study of the mascons' {{effect on}} <b>lunar</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{led to the}} {{discovery}} in 2001 of [...] "frozen orbits" [...] occurring at four orbital inclinations: 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86°, in which a spacecraft can stay in a low orbit indefinitely. The Apollo 15 subsatellite PFS-1 and the Apollo 16 subsatellite PFS-2, both small satellites released from the Apollo Service Module, contributed to this discovery. PFS-1 {{ended up in a}} long-lasting orbit, at 28 degrees inclination, and successfully completed its mission after one and a half years. PFS-2 was placed in a particularly unstable orbital inclination of 11 degrees, and lasted only 35 days in orbit before crashing into the lunar surface.|$|E
