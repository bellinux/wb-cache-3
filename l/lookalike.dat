5|$|Another <b>lookalike</b> {{species is}} Suillus subaureus, {{which can be}} {{distinguished}} microscopically by slightly smaller, hyaline (translucent) spores (typically 7.5–8.5 by 3µm), and an association with Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides).|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the Finnish {{scientist}} Risto Tuomikoski {{observed that}} the well-known Stropharia aeruginosa had a <b>lookalike</b> species that was characterized by a brown spore print, an indistinct, temporary ring on the stipe, and chrysocystidia lining the gill edges. Tuomikoski called this <b>lookalike</b> Stropharia cyanea, a name he based on James Bolton's 1820 taxon Agaricus cyaneus. Later researchers confirmed the existence and widespread European distribution of this taxon. Tuomikoski's use of the name S.cyanea, however, was incorrect as Bolton's type refers to the purple-brown spored species S.aeruginosa. Despite this, the misapplied name S.cyanea has persisted in some contemporary field guides.|$|E
5|$|Leccinellum albellum {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.holopus, but grows in association with oak and has a more southerly distribution. L.scabrum is a widely distributed <b>lookalike</b> that can be distinguished from L.holopus by its larger size and generally darker colors.|$|E

50|$|It is now rare to find {{farmers who}} grow Ambemohar regularly. Since the {{production}} cost is high, the retail cost in turn {{has to be}} high. So, retailers in Maharashtra, pass off <b>lookalikes</b> as original Ambemohar to gain higher profit margins. This has further discouraged the production of Ambemohar, since the farmers can earn more profit themselves by growing <b>lookalikes.</b> Jeera Sambhar rice from Andhra Pradesh and Jawaful from Madhya Pradesh {{are the most popular}} <b>lookalikes</b> sold by retailers.|$|R
5|$|Omphalotus nidiformis may be {{confused}} with the edible brown oyster mushroom (Pleurotus australis), which is brown and does not glow in the dark. Confusion with another edible <b>lookalike,</b> Pleurotus ostreatus, common in the Northern Hemisphere and cultivated commercially, has been the source for at least one case of poisoning reported in the literature.|$|E
5|$|The related Turbinellus kauffmanii, {{found in}} western North America, is similar-looking {{but has a}} pale brown cap. Younger {{specimens}} of the latter species also have a pungent smell. Turbinellus fujisanensis, found in Japan, is another <b>lookalike</b> that has smaller spores than T.floccosus.|$|E
5|$|Twentieth Century Fox {{profited from}} Monroe's {{popularity}} by cultivating several <b>lookalike</b> actresses that included Jayne Mansfield and Sheree North.

5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential <b>lookalike</b> species include the yellowish brown to chestnut-brown cap surface that becomes paler with age, yellow flesh {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to bright yellow or yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem reticulation, and a more limited range covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown cap with a texture like velvet.|$|E
5|$|Morchella snyderi can be {{distinguished}} from similar North American morels by differences in ecological and morphological features. M.frustrata resembles young specimens of M.snyderi, but the ridges of the caps of the former species do not darken in maturity, and it has smaller ascospores, measuring 20–29 by 14–19µm. Another potential <b>lookalike,</b> M.brunnea, has a browner fruit body color in young specimens, and a stipe that is not lacunose.|$|E

5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills. Another <b>lookalike,</b> R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a taste reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E
5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Rhytismataceae. A {{widespread}} species, particularly in temperate areas, it colonizes the dead fallen leaves of vascular plants, particularly oak and chestnut. The fungus apothecia, which form in the epidermal layer of the leaf host, resemble dark hexagonal spots scattered on a multi-colored mosaic pattern bounded by thin black lines. When mature, the apothecia open by triangular flaps to release spores. The anamorph form of C.dentatus is Tricladiopsis flagelliformis. <b>Lookalike</b> species can be distinguished by {{the shape of the}} apothecia, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or butterscotch when dried. Another <b>lookalike</b> is Lactarius thiersii, {{but it has a}} smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. The flesh and latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes of}} Kirk and Scott {{approaching}} the Enterprise in drydock spanned two pages of script but took forty-five different shots—averaging one shot a day—for the travel pod containing Kirk {{to make its}} flight from the space office complex to the docking ring. Double shifts around the clock were required to finish the effect on time. For close shots of the pod traveling to the Enterprise, close-ups of Shatner and Doohan were composited into the model, while in long shots <b>lookalike</b> puppets were used.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} <b>lookalike</b> species found in North American {{with which the}} Appalachian waxy cap might be confused. Hygrocybe cantharellus is a bright red {{mushroom}} that has smaller fruit bodies and a more slender stipe than H.appalachianensis. It also has smaller spores, measuring 7–12 by 4–8µm. Hygrocybe reidii, found in Europe and northeastern North America, has flesh with a sweet odor that reminiscent of honey. This smell is sometimes weak and only noticeable when the tissue is rubbed, or when it is drying. Its scarlet cap initially has a narrow yellow-orange margin.|$|E
5|$|Boletus roseolateritius, {{known from}} Mississippi, has a cap that changes color {{according}} to its age: it is initially dark reddish to orangish, later reddish brown at maturity, fading to brownish orange or brownish pink with dull yellow tints, and finally turning dull dingy yellow in age. Its pale yellow stipe lacks the reddish coloration and the hairs found {{on the base of}} B.subluridellus. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, measuring 8.5–12 by 3.5–4.5μm. Boletus rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its yellow stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to brownish dots. Boletus flammans, another blue-bruising <b>lookalike</b> found in the southeastern United States, grows under conifers. It has a reddish stipe with fine reticulations on its upper half.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius vinosus, {{formerly}} {{considered a}} variety of L.sanguifluus, is quite similar in appearance. In general, L.vinosus can be distinguished by the more vinaceous-red color (lacking orange tones) of its cap, stipe, and gills, the more distinctly downwards-tapered stipe, and the more intense staining of the latex on the cap tissue. The two species can also be distinguished microscopically by differences in the ornamentation of their spore surfaces. L.vinosus has an incomplete reticulum on the spore surface, with ridges that have a wider degree of variation in thickness. Another potential <b>lookalike,</b> L.semisanguifluus, has a characteristic orange latex that turns wine-red in 5–10 minutes after exposure to air. Compared to L.sanguifluus, the fruit bodies of L.semisanguifluus are smaller, have tinges of violet in the cap, and develop a greenish discolouration with age.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius xanthogalactus {{has nearly}} {{identical}} microscopic features to L.vinaceorufescens, but macroscopically, {{it does not}} have the reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem of L.vinaceorufescens, and it grows on the ground under oak. Another <b>lookalike</b> is L.colorascens, but it may be distinguished from L.vinaceorufescens by several features: a smaller fruit body; a whitish cap that becomes brownish red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown; bitter to faintly acrid latex; and slightly smaller spores. L.chrysorrheus is also similar, but it has a whitish to pale yellowish-cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used in the}} field to distinguish Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca from <b>lookalike</b> species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and forked gills that are saffron to orange coloured; and the lack of any distinctive taste or odour. The false chanterelle can be distinguished from the true chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, velvety cap surface, forked gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and lack of the characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula, found in Britain, has fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. H.rufa has velvety brown fur covering its cap, while H.macrospora has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than H.aurantiaca. H.tapinia, found in a range extending from southern Florida to Central America, is set apart from H.aurantiaca by its growth on or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3µm.|$|E
