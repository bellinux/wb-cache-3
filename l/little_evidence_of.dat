5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{sometimes}} prescribed to treat behavioral symptoms of dementia. However, like antidepressants, they have <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> effectiveness, although antipsychotics have shown some benefit. Cognitive impairing effects of benzodiazepines that occur {{frequently in the}} elderly can also worsen dementia.|$|E

5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, boats from {{mainland}} Scotland and the Netherlands dominated the local herring fishery. There is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> an Orcadian fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and later Stromness becoming leading centres of development. White fish never became as dominant as in other Scottish ports.|$|E
5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> Robert's {{activities}} survives {{from his}} time as bishop, although {{it is known that}} he acted as a papal judge-delegate in 1165. Five dosuments survive from his time at Hereford, as well as confirmations of gifts by previous bishops to Llanthony Priory, which he augmented with another grant of tithes. He also served as a royal judge.|$|E

5|$|Lochner {{seems to}} have {{prepared}} on paper before approaching his underdrawings; there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> reworking, even when positioning large groups of figures. Infrared reflectography of the underdrawings for the Last Judgment panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied, for example g for gelb (yellow) or w for weiss (white), and there are few deviations in the finished work. He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size of figures. The underdrawings reveal a draughtsman of skill, dynamism and confidence; the figures appear fully formed with <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> reworking. Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled, for example St Ursula's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints, which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in several microhabitats, but most often on rocks. Although {{predominantly}} ground-dwelling, {{it is a good}} climber. Nothing is known about its reproduction except that skinks studied in late October and early November, during the dry season, showed <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> reproductive activity. The Noronha skink is oviparous (egg-laying), like many Trachylepis, but unlike Mabuya, which are all viviparous (giving live birth).|$|E
5|$|There is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> any {{visits by}} eminent {{people to the}} castle, {{although}} there is a belief that in 1207 KingJohn visited and donated £5 towards the upkeep of its chapel.

5|$|There is very <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> prehistoric {{activity}} in the area, especially pre-Iron Age; however, Celtic names {{in the area around}} Wigan—such as Bryn, Makerfield and Ince—indicate that the Celtic people of Britain were active in the area in the Iron Age. The first people believed to have settled in the Wigan area were the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe who controlled most of northern Britain.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} {{excluded}} from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to interact with the gods. There is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues to interact with the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E

5|$|Berhtwald died on 13 January 731. An epitaph to him {{in verse}} survives, {{and may have been}} placed over his tomb, which was at Canterbury. Subsequently he was canonised with a feast day of 9 January. <b>Little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> {{extensive}} cult activity exists, however, and the main evidence for his sainthood is a late medieval entry in a St Augustine's calendar. Berhtwald is the first of the continuous series of native-born archbishops in England, although there had been two previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops at Canterbury—Deusdedit and Wighard.|$|E

5|$|Britain {{was largely}} forested in this period; {{widespread}} forest clearance {{did not occur}} in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from {{the vicinity of the}} White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the river, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Elizabeth Johnson {{discovered}} {{the remains of}} a Pawnee village in Republic County, Kansas. She thought that it might be the site of Pike's flag incident; but hearing of another village in Webster County, Nebraska, she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site. Because the surface had been altered by cultivation, they found <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> habitation, and Johnson was persuaded that the Republic County site was Pike's village. She prevented its being plowed on several occasions, and eventually purchased the land.|$|E
5|$|Less clearcut is the {{question}} of whether the regular auxilia recruited barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people living outside the empire's borders). Although there is <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> it before the 3rd century, the consensus is that auxilia recruited barbarians throughout their history. In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E
