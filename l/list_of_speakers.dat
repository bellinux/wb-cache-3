2500|$|Charles Kennedy, {{then the}} leader of the Liberal Democrats, was a late {{addition}} to the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>speakers.</b> There was some media speculation that he only decided to speak after a lead article in The Guardian was critical of his absence from the planned speaker list. There had been some controversy within the StWC over allowing Kennedy to speak since his party was committed to opposing the war only {{in the absence of a}} second UN resolution, but the coalition decided that failing to invite him [...] "would have been divisive for the movement and would have fragmented anti-war opposition to the war." ...|$|E
