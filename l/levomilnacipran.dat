50|$|Recently, Wang et al. {{reported}} a BM3 variant capable of performing styrenyl olefin cyclopropanation. As native BM3 displays poor cyclopropanation activity, an enzyme engineering effort was undertaken. At their core, P450s are heme-thiolate enzymes which utilize molecular oxygen (O2) and NAD(P)H to perform oxygenation reactions. As such, BM3 prefers to perform epoxidation opposed to cyclopropanation reactions {{in the presence}} of olefins. The reaction between ethyl diazoacetate (EDA) and 1 was chosen as a model reaction due to the known difficulty of epoxidizing electron-deficient olefins utilizing transitional metal catalysis (Figure 2). This reaction generates compound 2, which can easily be converted to <b>levomilnacipran</b> (Fetzima), a pharmaceutical used to treat clinical depression. To begin, mutants were generated where the axial coordinating cysteine residue in the catalytic center was replaced with amino acids serine, alanine, methionine, histidine and tyrosine. The mutant T268A-axH, which has an axial histidine ligand catalyzed the reaction between EDA and 1 in 81% yield with 6:94 diastereoselectivity and 42% enantioselectivity. Subsequent rounds of site-saturation mutagenesis were then performed, resulted in the variant named BM3-Hstar (containing T268A-axH, L437W, V78M and L181V mutations), which could catalyze the model reaction with greater than 92% yield, 92% enantioselectivity and 2:98 diastereoselectivity. As an added advantage, BM3-Hstar was also capable of performing the desired cyclopropanation reaction {{in the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen (O2) (the only known BM3 variant capable of this).|$|E

SF- 36 v 2 Health Survey outcomes from a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT 00969709) were evaluated. MethodsProspective and post hoc analyses of SF- 36 Mental and Physical Component Summaries (MCS, PCS), and individual domains compared pooled <b>levomilnacipran</b> ER doses (40, 80, 120 mg/day) with placebo. Patients (18 – 65 years) had MDD, depressive episode ≥ 8 weeks, and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score ≥ 30. SF- 36 score changes from baseline to Week 8 were analyzed using ANCOVA and the observed cases approach (Intent-to-Treat [ITT] Population). Minimally important differences (MID) evaluated clinical relevance. ResultsBaseline MCS scores reflected marked mental deficits in the ITT Population (<b>levomilnacipran</b> ER= 529; placebo= 175). MCS change at Week 8 was significantly greater for <b>levomilnacipran</b> ER than placebo (LSMD [SE]= 4. 8 [1. 5]; P= 0. 0011); MID exceeded the 3 -point threshold. Baseline PCS scores suggested minimal physical deficits; no between-group difference at Week 8 was noted.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMajor {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) can {{be challenging}} to manage due its variable and episodic nature. Post hoc analyses were conducted on five studies (NCT 00969709, NCT 01377194, NCT 00969150, NCT 01034462, EudraCT: 2006 - 002404 - 34) to evaluate the efficacy of <b>levomilnacipran</b> extended-release (ER) in patients with different MDD episode histories. MethodsAdults with MDD were randomized to double-blind treatment with <b>levomilnacipran</b> ER (40 – 120 mg/d) or placebo. Three subgroups were identified: first-episode (n= 494); highly recurrent (≥ 3 major depressive episodes; n= 1954); and chronic (current episode duration ≥ 2 years; n= 218). Mean changes from baseline to end of study (Week 8 [US studies], Week 10 [non-US study]) in Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), 17 -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD 17), and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) total scores were analyzed in each subgroup. MADRS response, defined as ≥ 50 % total score improvement from baseline to Week 8 / 10, was also analyzed. ResultsLeast squares mean differences (LSMDs) between treatment groups indicated significantly greater improvements with <b>levomilnacipran</b> ER versus placebo in MADRS (first-episode, − 2. 5; highly recurrent, − 3. 0; chronic, − 4. 9; all P<. 05) and HAMD 17 (first-episode, − 2. 1; highly recurrent, − 1. 6; chronic, − 2. 6; all P<. 05) total scores. LSMDs for SDS total score were statistically significant in the first-episode and highly recurrent MDD subgroups (both subgroups, − 2. 3; P<. 01). MADRS response rate was significantly higher with <b>levomilnacipran</b> ER versus placebo in all three subgroups (first-episode, 44. 5 % versus 35. 0 %; highly recurrent, 44. 3 % versus 33. 5 %; 36. 8 % versus 22. 0 %; all P<. 05).

40|$|Roger S McIntyre 1, 2 1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, 2 Mood Disorders Psychopharmacology Unit, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada Abstract: Although many branded and generic {{antidepressants}} {{are approved}} {{for the treatment}} of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Canada, efficacy and tolerability differ among patients, and new treatment options are needed. Symptom types (eg, fatigue, energy/motivation, cognition, and functioning), medication type, treatment duration, and the need for maintenance therapy are factors that may influence treatment effectiveness. Three antidepressants, vortioxetine, <b>levomilnacipran</b> extended-release (ER), and vilazodone have recently become available in Canada. The aim of this review is to contextualize differences in their mechanistic and clinical profiles, thereby providing practitioners with knowledge to support treatment decisions. In trials versus placebo, each drug improved depressive symptoms in adult patients with MDD. The antidepressant effect of vortioxetine may be related to enhanced serotonergic activity via reuptake inhibition and agonism and/or antagonism of various serotonin receptors. Vortioxetine may also improve cognitive functioning in MDD, and has proven efficacious in relapse prevention. Nausea was the most commonly reported adverse event (AE); rates of sexual dysfunction were low and abrupt discontinuation was well tolerated. <b>Levomilnacipran</b> ER, a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, demonstrated greater improvement versus placebo in functional impairment as well as depressive symptoms; in post hoc analyses, improvement in symptoms of motivation and energy were observed. Nausea was the most commonly reported AE; gradual discontinuation is recommended to avoid discontinuation syndrome. Vilazodone is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and partial serotonergic 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist. In addition to improvement in depressive symptoms, evidence suggests that vilazodone may be particularly well suited for depressed patients with high anxiety levels. Diarrhea, nausea, and headache were the most common AEs; low rates of sexual dysfunction were reported. The 2016 Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments guidelines for MDD includes vortioxetine as a first-line treatment; <b>levomilnacipran</b> ER and vilazodone are considered as second-line treatments due to lack of relapse prevention data at the time of approval.

It is a unique dual neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor. In contrast with other selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, including duloxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine, it has greater selectivity for inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake than serotonin reuptake. Our review focuses on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability data for five double-blind, placebo-controlled, short-term studies and two long-term studies. In the short-term studies, LVM was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing depression (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) scores as well as improving functional impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale) scores. Long-term studies found LVM to be similarly effective but in the only placebo-controlled long-term study, LVM was not significantly superior to placebo. LVM is fairly well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being nausea, headache, dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, and constipation. Discontinuation rates were mildly increased in those being treated with LVM (9 %) versus placebo (3 %). Adverse events were not dose-related except for urinary hesitancy and erectile dysfunction. LVM was weight neutral, was not toxic to the liver, and did not cause clinically significant QTc prolongation. Consistent with being a predominant potentiator of norepinephrine, pulse and blood pressure were significantly elevated by LVM but rarely induced tachycardia or hypertension. LVM is a relatively safe alternative antidepressant treatment with minimal drug–drug interactions. It is the only antidepressant that has in its labeling that it is not only effective in improving depression but also effective in improving impaired functioning. Whether this important effect on functioning is unique to LVM must be researched. In addition, whether LVM might be effective in norepinephrine-deficit depression, refractory depression, atypical depression, or seasonal depression is yet to be evaluated. Ultimately, head-to-head studies comparing LVM with other antidepressants will determine the place of LM in antidepressant treatment.

We are interested in comparing the following active agents: agomelatine, amitriptyline, bupropion, citalopram, clomipramine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, <b>levomilnacipran,</b> milnacipran, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, trazodone, venlafaxine, vilazodone and vortioxetine. The main outcomes will be the proportion of patients who responded to or dropped out of the allocated treatment. Published and unpublished studies will be sought through relevant database searches, trial registries and websites; all reference selection and data extraction will be conducted by at least two independent reviewers. We will conduct a random effects network meta-analysis to synthesise all evidence for each outcome and obtain a comprehensive ranking of all treatments. To rank the various treatments for each outcome, we will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve and the mean ranks. We will employ local as well as global methods to evaluate consistency. We will fit our model in a Bayesian framework using OpenBUGS, and produce results and various checks in Stata and R. We will also assess the quality of evidence contributing to network estimates of the main outcomes with the GRADE framewo...|$|E
