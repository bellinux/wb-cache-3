By 1940, the army numbered between 600,000 and 650,000 men (nearly 20 percent of the male population of Belgium) making it approximately four {{times larger than the}} British Expeditionary Force and twice as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Dutch army at the time.|$|E
5|$|Division forms two polyps {{that each}} become as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> original. Longitudinal {{division}} begins when a polyp broadens and then divides its coelenteron (body), effectively splitting along its length. The mouth divides and new tentacles form. The two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and exoskeleton. Transversal division occurs when polyps and the exoskeleton divide transversally into two parts. This means {{one has the}} basal disc (bottom) and the other has the oral disc (top); the new polyps must separately generate the missing pieces.|$|E

5|$|For a {{fortunate}} few though fortunes {{could be}} won 'with a rapidity only equalled by the princely gains {{of some of}} the adventurers who accompanied Pizarro to Peru', noted one observer. Among the most notable success stories were the six sons of Coatbridge farmer Alexander Baird. The Baird family had become involved in coal mining but opened an iron foundry in order to exploit the new hot blast process of iron smelting invented by James Beaumont Neilson. The Baird's subsequently constructed numerous iron foundries in Coatbridge including the famous Gartsherrie iron works. The waste heap or 'bing' from the Baird's Gartsherrie works was said to be as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> great pyramid in Egypt. One son, James Baird, was responsible for erecting sixteen blast-furnaces in Coatbridge between 1830 and 1842. Each of the six sons of Alexander Baird was reputed to have become a millionaire.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Spain's General Francisco Franco briefly {{considered}} a naval building program after seizing {{power in the}} Spanish Civil War. Franco concluded several agreements with the Italian government that {{would have seen the}} building of four Littorio-class battleships in Spain. The Italians promised to provide all necessary technical and material support for the construction of the ships. The Italian Navy pushed to modernize and enlarge the existing shipyards in Spain, so that they could handle a vessel as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Littorio class. The project was abandoned after Italy became involved in World War II, {{and as a result of}} limited Spanish industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the dire wolf, North America was invaded by the genus Xenocyon (ancestor of the Asian dhole and the African hunting dog) that was as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> dire wolf and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare, and it is assumed that they could not compete with the newly derived dire wolf. Stable isotope analysis provides evidence that the dire wolf, Smilodon, and the American lion competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores included the extinct North American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), the modern cougar (Puma concolor), the Pleistocene coyote (Canis latrans), and the Pleistocene gray wolf that was more massive and robust than today. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey.|$|E

General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later. Pratt & Whitney was also working on the same principle and, by late 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop a new engine, designated the JT9D to power the 747.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a North American {{cat that}} {{appeared}} during the Irvingtonian stage of around 1.8 million years ago (AEO). Containing 12 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico, including most of the contiguous United States. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to local extinction ("extirpation") by coyotes and domestic animals. With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized Lynx genus. It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about twice as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> domestic cat. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby tail, from which it derives its name.|$|E

5|$|The inner {{mitochondrial}} membrane is compartmentalized into numerous cristae, which expand {{the surface area}} of the inner {{mitochondrial membrane}}, enhancing its ability to produce ATP. For typical liver mitochondria, {{the area of the}} inner membrane is about five times as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> outer membrane. This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are studded with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations of the inner membrane, which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.|$|E

They feed on fish, squid and crustacea, with many also taking fisheries discards and carrion. All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long trans-equatorial migrations. They are colonial breeders, exhibiting long-term mate fidelity and site philopatry. In all species, each pair lays a single egg per breeding season. Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers may {{be close}} to solving this mystery. They noticed a large plume of gas {{extending}} at least six times its stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions. The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed in the infrared, is not preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT, these asymmetries have come into focus. The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss, were large-scale convection cells or polar mass loss, possibly due to rotation. Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere has been observed vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella.|$|E
