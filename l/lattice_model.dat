40|$|We propose two <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> in one dimension, with stochastically hopping {{particles}} which aggregate on contact.

Our <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> have both velocity and density fields and an appropriate real time evolution, such that they can be compared directly with event driven molecular dynamics (MD) results for the sticky gas. We demonstrate numerically that the long time and large distance behavior of the <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> are identical to that of the MD, and some exact results known for the sticky gas. In particular, the exactly predicted form of the non-Gaussian tail of the velocity distribution function is clearly exhibited. This correspondence of the <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> and the sticky gas in continuum is nontrivial, as the latter has a deterministic dynamics with local kinematic constraint, in contrast with the former; yet the spatial velocity profiles (with shocks) of the <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> and the MD have striking match.

2500|$|Since 1991-92, most market-makers in Europe have {{employed}} binomial models to evaluate convertibles. Models were available from INSEAD, Trend Data of Canada, Bloomberg LP and from home-developed models, amongst others. [...] These models needed an input of credit spread, volatility for pricing (historic volatility often used), and the risk-free rate of return. The binomial calculation assumes {{there is a}} bell-shaped probability distribution to future share prices, and the higher the volatility, the flatter is the bell-shape. Where there are issuer calls and investor puts, these will affect the expected residual period of optionality, at different share price levels. The binomial value is a weighted expected value, (1) taking readings from all the different nodes of a lattice expanding out from current prices and (2) taking account of varying periods of expected residual optionality at different share price levels. See <b>Lattice</b> <b>model</b> (finance)#Hybrid Securities. The three biggest areas of subjectivity are (1) the rate of volatility used, for volatility is not constant, and (2) {{whether or not to}} incorporate into the model a cost of stock borrow, for hedge funds and market-makers. The third important factor is (3) the dividend status of the equity delivered, if the bond is called, as the issuer may time the calling of the bond to minimise the dividend cost to the issuer.|$|E

In this letter, we observe that fluctuating pair density waves (PDW) consist of two complex order parameters which can be superpartners of the unavoidably-doubled Weyl fermions in three-dimensional <b>lattice</b> <b>models.</b> We construct explicit fermionic <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> featuring 3 D Weyl fermions and show that PDW is the leading instability via a continuous phase transition as short-range interactions exceed a critical value.

40|$|Background: Over {{the last}} few years novel folding {{mechanisms}} of globular proteins have been proposed using minimal <b>lattice</b> and off-lattice <b>models.</b> However, the factors determining the cooperativity of folding in these models and especially their explicit relation to experiments have not been fully established. Results: We consider equilibrium folding transitions in <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> with and without side chains. A dimensionless measure, Ωc, is introduced to quantitatively assess the degree of cooperativity in <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> and in real proteins. We show that larger values of Ωc resembling that seen in proteins are obtained in <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> with side chains (LMSC). The enhanced cooperativity in LMSC is due to the possibility of denser packing of side chains in the interior of the model polypeptide chain. We also establish that Ωc correlates extremely well with σ = (Tθ − Tf) /Tθ, where Tθ and Tf are collapse and folding transition temperatures, respectively. These theoretical ideas are used to analyze folding transitions in various two state folders (RNase A, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, fibronectin type III modules, and tendamistat) and three state folders (apomyoglobin and lysozyme). The values of Ωc extracted from experiments show a correlation with σ (suitably generalized when folding is induced by denaturants or acid). For <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> and for proteins Ωc ∼ exp[−(σ/σ 0) β], where β < ∼ 1. Conclusions: A quantitative description of cooperative transition of real proteins can be made by <b>lattice</b> <b>models</b> with side chains. The degree of cooperativity in minimal models and real proteins can be expressed in terms of the single parameter σ, which can be estimated from experimental data. Key words: <b>Lattice</b> <b>models</b> with side chains, cooperativity of folding, collapse and folding transition temperatures, chemical and thermal unfolding. I...|$|R
