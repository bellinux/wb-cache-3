40|$|A charged object {{moving in}} plasma can excite plasma waves that inevitably modify its Debye {{shielding}} characteristics. When the excited waves propagate sufficiently fast, the shielding can even break down. Here {{the properties of}} finite amplitude plasma waves excited by a moving <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> are investigated. It is found that when {{the speed of the}} latter is close to but less than the thermal speed of the background plasma electrons, only a localized disturbance {{in the form of a}} soliton that moves together with the <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> is excited. That is, the <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> is well shielded even though it is moving at a high speed and has generated a large local electrostatic field. However, for a pair of <b>line</b> <b>charges</b> moving together, such complete shielding behavior could not be found. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|High Energy Density Physics (HEDP) {{applications}} require high <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> density ion beams. An efficient {{method to}} obtain {{this type of}} beams is to extract a long pulse, high current beam from a gun at high energy, and let the beam pass through a decelerating field to compress it. The low energy beam-bunch is loaded into a solenoid and matched to a Brillouin flow. The Brillouin equilibrium is independent of the energy if {{the relationship between the}} beam size (a), solenoid magnetic field strength (B) and <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> density is such that (Ba) {sup 2 } is proportional to the <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> density. Thus it is possible to accelerate a matched beam at constant <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> density. An experiment, NDCX- 1 c is being designed to test the feasibility of this type of injectors, where we will extract a 1 microsecond, 100 mA, potassium beam at 160 keV, decelerate it to 55 keV (density {approx} 0. 2 {micro}C/m), and load it into a 2. 5 T solenoid where it will be accelerated to 100 - 150 keV (head to tail) at constant <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> density.

5000|$|The M58 Mine Clearing <b>Line</b> <b>Charge</b> (MICLIC) is a rocket-projected {{explosive}} <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> {{which provides}} a [...] "close-in" [...] demining capability for maneuver forces of the United States Army and Marine Corps. It is effective against conventionally fuzed land mines and, when detonated, it provides a lane 8 meters by 100 meters. The MICLIC system consists of an M353 3½ ton or M200A1 2½ ton trailer (or M200 tracked trailer) chassis, a launcher assembly, an M147 firing kit, an M58A3 <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> and a 5-inch MK22 Mod 4 rocket. The <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> is 350 feet long and contains 5 pounds per linear foot of C-4 explosive. In the event a MICLIC fails to detonate normally, it can be manually activated by time-delay fuses every few feet {{along the length of}} it. Due to the inherent dangers of entering a live minefield to manually arm the backup fuses on a charge that could still detonate at any moment, possibly while under enemy fire as well, the act is jokingly referred to as the [...] "Medal of Honor run".|$|R
