5000|$|As {{the siege}} continued, [...] Lévy became {{increasingly}} frustrated with Mitterand's refusal to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> embargo on Bosnia, and founded {{the party in}} protest. Initial opinion polls showed the party polling at 12%, drawing votes from the centre left Parti Socialiste.

5000|$|The {{decision}} of the Soviet Union to withdraw from Afghanistan and declare the invasion a mistake led to Wilson commending the Soviet leadership {{on the floor of}} the House of Representatives. He also supported United States involvement in the Bosnian War, touring the former Yugoslavia over five days in January 1993; on his return he urged the Clinton administration to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> embargo on Bosnia, remarking [...] "This is good versus evil and, if we do not want to Americanize this, then what do we want to Americanize?

50|$|McCloskey {{brokered}} a broad {{coalition of}} Democrats and Republicans who {{had listened to}} his daily calls {{from the floor of}} the U.S. House of representatives to stop the genocide. They backed legislation called the McCloskey-Gilman amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (HR 4301, 104th Congress), which was intended to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> embargo first against Bosnia and then Croatia. Despite tough opposition, the McCloskey-Gilman amendment passed the House of Representatives 244-178 on June 9, 1994. In the U.S. Senate, a similar bill was sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman. It was defeated by a 50-50 vote on July 1, 1994 (Senate Amendment 1851 to S. 2182, 104th Congress). In 1995, after McCloskey was out of Congress, both houses of the 105th Congress passed a bill to lift the U.S. arms embargo on Bosnia by veto-proof, two-thirds majorities. President Clinton did veto the legislation in August 1995 while Congress was out of session. By the time Congress had returned, Clinton had launched a diplomatic initiative that would result in the Dayton Peace Accords.|$|E
50|$|Towards the center, {{at the end}} of the groove, {{there is}} another wide-pitched section known as the lead-out. At the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a {{complete}} circle, called the lock groove; when the stylus reaches this point, it circles repeatedly until <b>lifted</b> from <b>the</b> record. On some recordings (for example Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles, Super Trouper by ABBA and Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd), the sound continues on the lock groove, which gives a strange repeating effect. Automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of <b>the</b> <b>arm,</b> as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove, to trigger a mechanism that <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> off <b>the</b> record.

50|$|Much of {{the focus}} of Clinton's foreign policy during his first term was the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a nation in southeastern Europe that had {{declared}} its independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. This declaration was the catalyst of a war between Bosnian Serbs, who wanted Bosnia {{to remain in the}} Yugoslav federation, and Bosnian Muslims and Croats. The Bosnian Serbs, who were supported by Serbia, were better equipped than the Muslims and the Croats; as a result, they populated and controlled much of the countryside in ways including besieging cities, such as the capital of Sarajevo. This caused widespread suffering, and in response Clinton proposed bombing Serb supply lines and lifting an embargo preventing the shipment of military arms to the former Yugoslavia (a policy known as lift and strike). European nations, however, were opposed to these moves. In 1994, Clinton opposed an effort by the Republicans in Congress to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> embargo, as it were, because American allies in Western Europe were still resistant to that policy.|$|E
5000|$|In a major {{statement}} on Bosnia in June 1994 Perry attempted to clarify U.S. policy there, {{declaring that the}} conflict did involve U.S. national interests, humanitarian and otherwise, but not [...] "supreme" [...] interests. To limit the spread of violence in Bosnia, the United States had committed air power under NATO to stop bombardment of Bosnian cities, provide air support for UN troops, and carry out humanitarian missions. Perry and the White House resisted congressional pressures to lift an arms embargo imposed earlier by the United Nations on all sides in the Bosnian conflict. During 1994-95 some senators, including Republican leader Robert Dole, wanted the embargo against the Bosnian Muslims lifted {{to enable them to}} resist the Serbs more effectively. Perry thought this might provoke Serb attacks and perhaps force the commitment of U.S. ground troops. In August 1995 Clinton vetoed legislation to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> embargo. (In fact, the Bosnian Muslims had been receiving arms from outside sources.) Meanwhile, although it had stated consistently that it would not send U.S. ground forces to Bosnia, in December 1994 the Clinton administration expressed willingness to commit troops to help rescue UN peacekeepers in Bosnia if they were withdrawn. In May 1995, after the Bosnian Serbs had taken about 3,000 peacekeepers hostage, the United States, France, Germany, and Russia resolved to provide a larger and better-equipped UN force.|$|E

40|$|The {{progression}} of Duchenne muscular dystrophy {{is expected to}} negatively influence the patients' health-related quality of life, but knowledge of the relationship with disease severity is limited. We investigated the relationship between health-related quality of life (KIDSCREEN- 52 questionnaire) and disease severity (clinical assessments of body functions and activities) in 40 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (19 ambulant, 21 wheelchair dependent) who were in different phases {{of the disease and}} underwent life-limiting events such as the loss of the ability to ambulate and the ability to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms.</b> In addition, we compared boys' health-related quality of life perceptions with that of their parents. The participants' health-related quality of life was similar to healthy peers' and not influenced by disease severity, except for the physical domain. Parents scored much lower than the boys on the KIDSCREEN- 52 domains Self Perception, Moods and Emotions, and Bullying. The latter finding needs attention in the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, a number of nations {{have argued that the}} {{mandatory}} arms embargoes imposed against them violated their right to self-defense. In some cases the Security Council has responded by adjusting the embargo to exclude its application to arms destined for the government, such as in Rwanda and Sierra Leone. But in other cases the Security Council has rejected the argument and refused to lift or adjust the embargo, such as in Bosnia and Liberia. In December of 2005, Somalia put forth a similar line of argument, asking the Security Council to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> embargo imposed against it to allow the government to defend itself against attacks. The Security Council has yet to respond. My article will clarify and assess the validity of the self-defense argument in the face of mandatory arms embargoes. In addressing this issue, I explore the sources, content, and legal status of the right of self-defense, analyze the substance and success of previous arguments, and reconcile the competing policy interests...|$|E
40|$|This Note {{argues that}} the Security Council has not met its {{responsibility}} to restore {{international peace and security}} in Bosnia, and that it therefore must rescind Resolution 713 as it pertains to Bosnia. Part I provides a background of the events surrounding the outbreak of conflict in Bosnia, and introduces the standard by which the United Nations may preempt a member state 2 ̆ 7 s right to self-defense. Part I also presents the international human rights documents that are relevant to the conflict. Part II examines U. N. attempts to restore international peace and security in Bosnia. Part III {{argues that the}} continuation of massive human rights violations necessitates that the United Nations either immediately and effectively implement its resolutions, or <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> embargo and permit Bosnia to exercise its Article 51 right to self-defense. This Note concludes that the Security Council 2 ̆ 7 s failure to restore international peace and security and to satisfy the Article 51 criteria for terminating a member state 2 ̆ 7 s right to self-defense undermines the ability of the United Nations to respond to future conflicts...|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1992, {{a number}} of US foreign policy experts and {{politicians}} began to warm to <b>the</b> idea of <b>lifting</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> embargo to even the playing field, and a number advocated air strikes against the Serbs, as they were {{perceived to be the}} principal aggressors.

While President Bush was seen as a foreign policy expert, the Clinton team identified Bosnia as one of his weaknesses. Clinton [...] "called on Mr. Bush to seek United Nations authorization of selective bombing of Serbian targets in Bosnia", and delivered strong rhetoric on the Bosnian crisis. In early August, in response to Congressional debate, Clinton declared himself in favor [...] "of <b>lifting</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> embargo on <b>the</b> former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia and Croatia." ...|$|R

40|$|Arms {{transfers}} {{are both}} an economic necessity for the European arms industry {{and a potential}} obstacle for the emerging normative power role of the European Union (EU) in world affairs. Indeed, the biggest markets for arms exports in the post-Cold War era are often in states engaged in conflict or high levels of internal repression – precisely where the EU’s normative policy agenda seeks to promote peace, stability, and respect for human rights. Despite these glaring contradictions, however, research on how well the EU’s arms transfer behavior mirrors its normative power rhetoric has been largely absent. This article attempts to fill this theoretical and empirical void. I use regression analysis {{to examine the relationship}} between EU arms exports and the human rights, conflict, and democracy records of recipient states from 1990 to 2004. A case study of the debate to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> embargo to China provides a more in-depth assessment of the politics behind EU arms transfers. Both analyses highlight the need to consider material interests and normative concerns in tandem in order to understand EU foreign policy. The findings also suggest that low levels of EU socialization and the predominance of domestic interests and values may hinder the creation of a singl...|$|E
