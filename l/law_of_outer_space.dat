The Space Settlement Initiative appears on the National Space Society website, although the NSS has not endorsed it. Both the Artemis Society and the Moon Society have endorsed the initiative. The issue of private property rights in outer space {{has been one of}} high visibility in the American citizen pro-space movement for more than a quarter-century, and the issue has profound policy ramifications in both the near term (because the proposal is a current subject of debate) and long term (because, if enacted, it would a have dramatic effect on international space law and would shape the future commercial development of outer space).

40|$|The {{exploration}} of space started {{a long time ago}} with the inception of civil aviation. This mode of transport very soon became a matter of great interest to the military. Today our strategists are concerned about the <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> and the limits of our universe. We do not have an airforce anymore; we have an aerospace force. The first part of this thesis is a study <b>of</b> the air <b>law</b> applicable to the military operations of our pilots. The study begins with an introduction {{in the world of the}} international public law and then moves on to the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> armed conflicts. The flight continues with a fly pass over the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> airwar and, lastly, the Canadian military law. In the second part of the thesis, we deal with the space law applicable to the military operations in space. We look at the international public law and several multilateral and bilateral agreements relating to the use <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> for military activities. We also study specific problems of interest for some military operations in <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> Thereafter we analyse some legal implications of the spying in space, space stations and self defence. The Soviets' doctrine on space laws is explained in chapter eight. After, we do one full orbit around the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> disarmament in <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> and land on the international order in space in the last chapter to complete our journey in deep space. Lastly, we finally conclude that the military personnel serving in different aerospace forces need a better "corpus aero-spatialis". We, the jurists, should work to fix the legal limits of military operations in the air and space environment. Ultimately, we need an international instrument determining the common rules <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> armed conflict for military personnel serving in their respective aerospace forces...|$|R
40|$|The core <b>of</b> space <b>law,</b> {{by nature}} and by necessity, forms part <b>of</b> {{international}} <b>law.</b> Article III <b>of</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty specifically obliges States {{to act in}} accordance with international law including the UN Charter. It is generally accepted by scholars that Article III does not imply an automatic extension <b>of</b> international <b>law</b> to <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> and celestial bodies, including the UN Charter in toto. However, even though space law claims to some extent priority over general international law, {{it does not mean}} that it is a self-contained regime. Despite the peculiarity of space environment Article III provides that space law is intrinsically and extensively linked with international law and its other branches, defining their interactions and synergies. This paper examines that international law clarifies and develops basic principles applicable to <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> in order to guarantee space sustainability. Nowadays, due to the rapid expansion of space activities and the lack of international binding instruments this process is coming into being throughout UN resolutions, guidelines, TCBMs and codes of conduct. These no legally binding instruments are important tools in the evolving process <b>of</b> international <b>law</b> for providing to the States a conduct in order to cover fundamental areas of concerns. Throughout the International Court of Justice decisions and international practice, the notion of sustainable development has softly grown as a concept firstly, and then qualified as an objective. Accordingly, the need for adopting measures most likely to achieve the objective with which specific States conduct must be consistent also in carrying on space activities. In consideration of the difficulties and complexity of the traditional law-making process in adapting the existent corpus iuris spatialis to the new needs, the flexibility of the wording of Article III ascertains that not only international norms specifically applicable to the protection of the space environment, but also rules <b>of</b> international <b>law</b> at large, whether its nature is customary, conventional or other. These principles and rules <b>of</b> international environmental <b>law,</b> especially those related to the concept/objective of sustainable development, can contribute to the protection of space environment strongly...|$|R
40|$|Since {{long-term}} sustainability <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> {{activities is}} an extension concept of sustainable development in the field <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> law,there are not only some connections but also a few differences between them. According to the juridical status {{of the principle of}} sustainable development,the principle of long-term sustainability <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities should be an important principle in the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> space,and contains the following aspects:inter-generation fair; within-generation fair; long-term sustainable use,integration between environment and activities in the <b>outer</b> <b>space.</b> In the case <b>of</b> the existing <b>outer</b> environment worsening,emphasizing and practicing principle of long-term sustainability <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities has important practical significance. Now the challenges related to the long-term sustainability <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities include the issues of space debris; the increasing decrease in geostationary orbit resources; space pollution. The international community is working on the guidelines of thelong-term sustainability <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activity guidelines which {{plays a key role in}} solving the above problems. More importantly,the principle of long-term sustainability <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities should be put into the <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> Treaty or developed to be a generally accepted rule <b>of</b> customary international <b>law</b> so that it can play the role of legal norms. 外空活動長期可持續性是可持續發展概念在外空領域的延伸,所以它與可持續發展概念既有聯系也有區別。對比可持續發展原則,外空活動長期可持續性原則應是外空法的一項重要原則,其內涵包括代際公平、代內公平、長期可持續利用和外空環境與外空活動一體化等四個方面。在現有外層環境日益惡化的情形下,強調并踐行外空活動長期可持續性原則具有重要的現實意義。目前,外空活動長期可持續性所面臨的問題包括空間碎片問題、地球靜止軌道問題和空間環境污染問題。國際社會正在制定《外空活動長期可持續性準則》,這對解決上述問題發揮很大的作用,但更為重要的是把這一原則規定到《外空條約》中來,或有意推動使其成為一項公認的國際習慣法規則,使其發揮法律規范的作用...|$|R

The 'Declaration on International Cooperation in the Exploration and Use <b>of</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Space</b> for the Benefit and in the Interest of All States, Taking into Particular Account the Needs of Developing Countries' puts forward eight guiding principles for the international space cooperation, which may provide not only the technological and financial assistance but also legal guidance for the long-term sustainability <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities and thus is very important. However, {{in the work of}} seeking the long-term sustainability <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> activities, the international cooperation of space-faring countries is very often affected by the international political situation and is carried out without not only the regulation of international treaties or customary laws but also the implementation and supervision of international organizations or organs.

The thesis outlines the relevant normative framework governing cyber activity as well as the law governing outer space.

The primary premise of the thesis is that the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>outer</b> <b>space</b> applies or should apply to cyber electromagnetic activities in space. However, as this is not evident due to lack of authoritative interpretation of the state of law as well as due to the novelty of the technology, different legal questions will be examined through a fictional scenario in which a State suffers damage as a result of non-kinetic interference applied to its satellite. Based on the premise indicated above, the main research question is “is satellite cyber electromagnetic interference legal and what legal norms govern such activity in space”? In answering the question, special attention shall be paid to the increasing involvement of private entities in space activities, including those activities made with the intention to interfere with other States’ satellite technology. That inquiry is more specifically done by looking into the question of attribution. Moreover, in the examination, emphasis will also be made with regards to the reach of space law to cyber and electromagnetic activities taking place partially on Earth.
