40|$|<b>Live</b> <b>testing</b> {{is used in}} {{the context}} of {{continuous}} delivery and deployment to test changes or new features in the production environment. This includes canary releases, dark launches, A/B tests, and gradual rollouts. Oftentimes, multiple of these <b>live</b> <b>testing</b> practices need to be combined (e. g., running an A/B test after a dark launch). Manually administering such multi-phase <b>live</b> <b>testing</b> strategies is a daunting task for developers or release engineers. In this paper, we introduce a formal model for multi-phase <b>live</b> <b>testing,</b> and present Bifrost as a prototypical Node. js based middleware that allows developers to define and automatically enact complex <b>live</b> <b>testing</b> strategies. We extensively evaluate the runtime behavior of Bifrost in three rollout scenarios of a microservice-based case study application, and conclude that the performance overhead of our prototype is at or below 8 ms for most scenarios. Further, we show that more than 100 parallel strategies can be enacted even on cheap public cloud instances...|$|R
40|$|The Spoken Dialog Challenge 2010 was an {{exercise}} to investigate how different spoken dialog systems perform {{on the same}} task. The existing Let’s Go Pittsburgh Bus Information System {{was used as a}} task and four teams provided systems that were first tested in controlled conditions with speech researchers as users. The three most stable systems were then deployed “live ” with real callers. This paper presents the results of the <b>live</b> <b>tests,</b> and compares them with the control test results. Results show considerable variation both between systems and between the control and <b>live</b> <b>tests.</b> Interestingly, relatively high task completion for controlled tests did not always predict relatively high task completion for <b>live</b> <b>tests.</b> Moreover, even though the systems were quite different in their designs, we saw very similar correlations between word error rate and task completion for all the systems.

40|$|Speaker {{identification}} is a powerful, non-invasive and in-expensive biometric technique. The recognition accuracy, however, deteriorates when noise levels affect a specific band of frequency. In this paper, {{we present a}} sub-band based speaker identification that intends to improve the <b>live</b> <b>testing</b> performance. Each frequency sub-band is processed and classified independently. We also compare the linear and non-linear merging techniques for the sub-bands recognizer. Support vector machines and Gaussian Mixture models are the non-linear merging techniques that are investigated. Results showed that the sub-band based method used with linear merging techniques enormously improved {{the performance of the}} speaker identification over the performance of wide-band recognizers when <b>tested</b> <b>live.</b> A <b>live</b> <b>testing</b> improvement of 9. 78 % was achievedComment: 6 page...|$|R

25|$|It {{is thought}} the toxins of Ixodes holocyclus cause {{a failure of}} {{secretion}} of neurotransmitter acetylcholine at neuro-muscular junctions. In experiments where nerve-muscle preparations were incubated in solution containing toxin the paralysis effect was delayed for six to seven hours after the addition of toxin. As in <b>live</b> <b>test</b> animals, this effect was temperature dependent, paralysis being more rapid at higher temperatures. Live mice injected with toxin did not develop signs of paralysis for some 8 to 12 hours after the injection. The cause of the delayed toxicity is unknown.|$|E

25|$|Benaud {{became a}} staunch {{advocate}} of cricket being available on free-to-view TV.

Thus, the 2005 Ashes series was the last that Benaud commentated on in Britain. His final commentary came {{near the end of}} the final day of the Fifth Test at the Oval. His last goodbye was interrupted by Glenn McGrath taking Kevin Pietersen's wicket; Benaud simply wove his description of the dismissal into what he was already saying.
