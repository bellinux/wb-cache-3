25|$|A force {{applied at}} {{a right angle}} to a lever multiplied by its {{distance}} from the <b>lever's</b> <b>fulcrum</b> (the length of the lever arm) is its torque. A force of three newtons applied two metres from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum. The direction of the torque can be determined by using the right hand grip rule: if the fingers of the right hand are curled {{from the direction of}} the lever arm to the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the torque.|$|R

50|$|Lever: The lever {{is another}} {{important}} and simple device for managing power. This is a body that pivots on a fulcrum. Because the velocity of a point farther from the pivot {{is greater than the}} velocity of a point near the pivot, forces applied far from the pivot are amplified near the pivot by the associated decrease in speed. If a is the distance from the pivot {{to the point where the}} input force is applied and b is the distance to the point where the output force is applied, then a/b is the mechanical advantage of the <b>lever.</b> The <b>fulcrum</b> of a <b>lever</b> is modeled as a hinged or revolute joint.|$|R

The steam pressure faucet is closed to cut off power, and after coming to a halt, the valve gear piston could safely be moved a short distance using the <b>lever</b> as a <b>fulcrum</b> linked to the piston inside. Although the linkage was designed to give leverage, the Johnson Bar would take a firm throw to move and lock in position. Some locomotives had a screw reversing gear instead.|$|R

The law of the lever states that two objects {{on opposite sides of}} the fulcrum will balance if each has the same torque, where an object's torque equals its mass times its distance to the fulcrum. For each value of x, the slice of the triangle at position x has a mass equal to its height x, and is at a distance x from the fulcrum; so it would balance the corresponding slice of the parabola, of height x2, if the latter were moved to x = &minus;1, at a distance of 1 on the other side of the fulcrum.|$|R
2500|$|In ancient China, {{the trip}} hammer evolved {{out of the}} use of the mortar and pestle, which in turn gave rise to the treadle-operated tilt-hammer (Chinese: 碓 Pinyin: dui; Wade-Giles: tui). The latter was a simple device {{employing}} a <b>lever</b> and <b>fulcrum</b> (operated by pressure applied by the weight of one's foot to one end), which featured a series of catches or lugs on the main revolving shaft as well. This device enabled the labor of pounding, often in the decorticating and polishing of grain, and avoided manual use of pounding with hand and arm. Although historians assert that its origins may span {{as far back as the}} Zhou Dynasty (1050 BC–221 BC), the earliest texts to describe the device are the Jijiupian dictionary of 40 BC, Yang Xiong's text known as the Fangyan of 15 BC, as well as the Xin Lun written by Huan Tan about 20 AD (during the usurpation of Wang Mang). The latter book states that the legendary mythological king known as Fu Xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar (which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device). Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi, a passage of his writing gives hint that the waterwheel and trip-hammer were in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China (for water-powered Chinese metallurgy, see Du Shi): ...|$|R

Inverse dynamics measurements during jogging indicate that the net muscle moment and power developed at the hip are substantially lower than for the ankle and knee (Winter, 1983). The low hip moments relative to those at the knee or the ankle are associated with the favorable leverage, or mechanical advantage, for force production at this joint. Limb muscles operate across a skeletal system <b>lever</b> with a <b>fulcrum</b> at the center of rotation of the joint.

40|$|Biomechanical {{experimental}} studies {{are often a}} subject of interest to many researchers. The results of such investigations give a full insight of complex structural behavior under loading, visualize potential material weaknesses and evaluate if mechanical factors play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of the lesions of the investigated biological structure. The use of FEM enables most of the researchers to abandon the experimental animal models and expand the investigation on computational models, analyzing stress and strain distribution {{as an indicator of}} structural biomechanical behavior. The aim of this paper was to present computational modeling of any (human or animal) intact tooth behavior under loading and evaluate the intact tooth stress and strain distribution pattern. For the investigation to be carried out a mathematical model of an intact tooth had to be created. The difference in stress concentration, when masticatory forces are acting lateraly comparing to the ones acting vertically, {{can be attributed to the}} basic mechanical principle of leverage which states that forces concentrate at or near the fulcrum. When subjected to lateral loading, tooth with its root acts as a simple <b>lever</b> that <b>fulcrums</b> near the cervical region. This paper offers the new approach in veterinary dental scientific research. Once when a mathematical model is made, it is possible by changing the parameters to investigate different clinical situations. With increasing popularity of veterinary dentistry, the FEM/computational analyses could became a useful tool in biomechanical veterinary dental research due to its noninvasiveness.

Snakes may use tongue {{flicking}} and snout touching {{to locate}} the head-end of immobilized prey, but tongue use is limited when snakes are holding prey after a strike. In this condition, how can they differentiate the anterior and posterior ends of the prey so that they still ingest their prey mainly from the anterior end? To answer the question, I analyzed the prey-handling behavior of Trimeresurus stejnegeri stejnegeri (Viperidae: Crotalinae) in the laboratory. Following the capture of a prey, T. s. stejnegeri lifted the prey from the ground. The prey thus hung in the air, with the body tilted, like a <b>lever</b> with the <b>fulcrum</b> {{at the site of}} the bite. In most cases, the snake gradually maneuvered its jaw to the higher end of the prey and began ingesting it. As an adaptation for arboreal feeding, the direction of prey ingestion in T. s. stejnegeri depended largely on the location of the initial bite site, under the proposed action of gravity. A significantly greater proportion of frogs (42. 1 %) were struck in the posterior region than mice (9. 6 %).

40|$|Many device designs include shaped lever {{mechanisms}} that must function reliably {{through a variety}} of load conditions. A lever shape is often optimized to carry out their function with optimal use of the material and processes involved in their fabrication. Levers are present in all types of devices, commonly in computer hard drives, car engines, airplane control mechanisms, medical instruments, et cetera. The design discussed in this paper is a hypothetical yet realistic one. The purpose of this work is to serve as a demonstration and training device for Engineers interested in learning how to create an adequate model and carry out complex calculations involving large displacements and contact between rigid surfaces and a three-dimensional representation of the deformable bodies of two levers and other parts of a mechanism. The model will be available to any interested party {{in the form of an}} MSC/PATRAN database (1) with the MSC/ADVANCED FEA preference [2] in the World Wide Web. The paper focuses on one aspect of the more general analysis required for a complete design, namely the calculation of stress and strain distributions, particularly in areas of contact and impact, nonelastic deformations, velocities, and driving and reaction forces under transient conditions. Problems of convergence often faced when doing a nonlinear analysis of this type are also discussed. The design –better understood by looking into figures in the paper- includes four distinctive pieces, designated as hammer, trigger, anvil, and band. Both the hammer and trigger are <b>levers</b> pivoting about <b>fulcrum</b> pins extruded from the anvil. Likewise the hammer and trigger have each an extruded pin to which the band is tightly attached pulling the two pieces together. The disposition is such that when the trigger is actuated, the hyperelastic band first accumulates strain energy and the hammer remains in place, and then the band suddenly transfers the stored strain energy to the hammer, which is accelerated and then impacts a protrusion of the anvil. The hammer carries a seal, which impacts a stamp lying on the anvil. The stamp undergoes plastic deformation as a result of the impact. ...|$|R
