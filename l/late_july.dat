50|$|Initiated by the {{tropical}} tropospheric trough (TUTT), {{an area of}} convection was first noted southeast of the upper trough in an area with favorable upper level divergence on July 2 near 18N 168E. The disturbance moved west-southwest and evolved into a tropical depression <b>late</b> on <b>July</b> 6 and a tropical storm soon after. The cyclone moved northwest towards {{a break in the}} subtropical ridge and reached typhoon status <b>late</b> on <b>July</b> 9 forming a large eye about 55 km in diameter. Rapid development continued for another 12 hours as it slowly moved through the ridge axis. The cyclone turned northeast <b>late</b> on <b>July</b> 10 as it began to be sheared significantly from the northwest. Shearing relented on July 11 allowing the eye to reform, this time 75 km wide. As the typhoon progressed more poleward, increased vertical wind shear and the entrainment of cooler and drier air began its extratropical transition. By <b>late</b> on <b>July</b> 14, Cary had become an extratropical cyclone. The nontropical system then moved westward, eventually dissipating south of Japan.|$|R

At this conference Truman informed Stalin that the United States possessed a powerful new weapon.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2008 a {{weakening}} surface trough extended across northern Florida, producing thunderstorms across the state. A weak {{low pressure area}} developed on July 15 near Tallahassee, which moved southeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. <b>Late</b> on <b>July</b> 16 it crossed onshore near Tampa, and development was not anticipated due to land interaction. <b>Late</b> on <b>July</b> 17, however, convection increased {{in association with the}} low, and the system quickly became better organized. <b>Late</b> on <b>July</b> 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that a tropical depression was developing, with its convection becoming more concentrated around a circulation; at 11 p.m. EST on July 18 (0300UTC July 19), it was classified as Tropical Depression Three, about 65miles (105km) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of July 14, {{satellite}} imagery revealed an area of convection about 205 km north-northwest of Yap. By <b>late</b> on <b>July</b> 16, a mid-level center has formed {{in association with the}} thunderstorm complex, which was moving northwest. Ship reports indicated the system had become a tropical storm by {{the morning of}} July 18. Southwesterly vertical wind shear impacted Maury, which led to its tilting to the northeast with height. By early on July 19 the wind shear lessened, and the cyclone's structure improved. While approaching China, a strong ridge to its northwest deflected the storm on a more westerly heading, sending the center toward Taiwan. This ridge also led to weak east-northeasterly vertical wind shear, which halted development. By <b>late</b> on <b>July</b> 19, the cyclone's center moved ashore northern Taiwan. Heavy rains led to significant flooding and the loss of 38 lives. [...] Moving through the Formosa Strait as a weak tropical storm, Maury made a second landfall near Fu-Chou, China on the morning of July 20. Its remains were dragged southwest by an upper cyclone to its southeast back into the Gulf of Tonkin. By <b>late</b> on <b>July</b> 23, the circulation center moved back to the north near Yin-Chou, China and dissipated inland <b>late</b> on <b>July</b> 24. Its former thunderstorm activity decoupled from the surface center while still offshore and moved inland near Nam Dinh, Vietnam before dissipating over Laos <b>late</b> on <b>July</b> 24.|$|R

5|$|In <b>late</b> <b>July</b> {{and early}} August, {{there were two}} more {{attempts}} at resurrecting the Z-4 Plan and the 1994 economic agreement. Talks proposed on 28 July were ignored by the RSK, and last-ditch talks were held in Geneva on 3 August. These quickly broke down as Croatia and the RSK rejected a compromise proposed by Thorvald Stoltenberg, a Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General, essentially calling for further negotiations at a later date. In addition, the RSK dismissed a set of Croatian demands, including to disarm, and failed to endorse the Z-4 Plan once again. The talks were used by Croatia to prepare diplomatic ground for the imminent Operation Storm, whose planning was completed during the Brijuni Islands meeting between Tuđman and military commanders on 31 July. The HV started large-scale mobilization in <b>late</b> <b>July,</b> soon after General Zvonimir Červenko became its new Chief of General Staff on 15 July.|$|E
