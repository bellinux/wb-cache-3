40|$|A flow {{injection}} manifold {{is proposed}} for the sequential determination of titratable (total) acidity based on a pseudotitration and of <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> based on {{the formation of a}} coloured vanadate complex. The method involves in-line dialysis prior to injection to avoid interference from the sample background absorption in the spectrophotometric detection. The changes in the colour of both reactions were monitored using two flow cells aligned in the optical path of a single spectrophotometer. Wine samples were analysed without any sample pre-treatment; table wines in the range 1 – 10 g l 21 (total acidity) and 0. 5 – 4 g <b>l</b> 21 (<b>tartaric</b> <b>acid)</b> and port wines in the range 1 – 8 g l 21 (total acidity) and 0. 5 – 5 g <b>l</b> 21 (<b>tartaric</b> <b>acid).</b> Sixteen samples can be measured per hour, and the results were comparable to those obtained by reference procedures for both determinations.

40|$|Grapevines contain many {{different}} organic acids {{and the two}} most abundant are <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> and malic acid. Malic <b>acid</b> and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> both increase in concentration up until veraison then after veraison malic acid is broken down as sugar increases. Malic acid has been studied {{in a variety of}} fruits for it is a very common <b>acid.</b> However <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> is an uncommon primary acid in fruits and very little is known about its synthesis in grapevine. However, <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> is important in providing a low pH which is important for the prevention of microbial spoilage during the winemaking process. A high pH of juice means that more <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> will need to be added in the winery increasing the cost to wine makers. By discovering more about the genes involved in the synthesis of malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> and the breakdown of malic acid this knowledge could be used to breed vines with higher acid concentrations. L-Idonate dehydrogenase (L-IDH) is one of only two genes known to participate in the <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis pathway. Since its initial characterisation two more isoforms have been annotated in the grapevine genome based on sequence similarity. The characterisation of these isoforms was undertaken using a variety of techniques including expression of the proteins in E. coli and in vitro protein activity assays and also in planta expression in the microvine with the creation of transgenic microvines. To try and discover regions of the genome that might be involved in acid metabolism in grapevine berries, malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations were measured from four progeny populations. The individuals of these populations were then sequenced using a genotyping by sequencing method to find SNPs markers for a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). This GWAS was then verified with genetic mapping and QTL analysis. During the process of measuring acid from these progeny populations the question of variability in acid concentration between berries from the same vine arose. A preliminary study into this variability was conducted to determine the variability of malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> in berries both within a bunch and between bunches from the same vine. This data was then used to predict the error in sampling subsets of berries of different sizes. <b>Tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration in tissues other than the berry was also explored. Acid concentration was measured in several tissues including root, shoots and leaves. It was found that <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> was present in these tissues with varying concentrations. <b>Tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration in leaves was then studied further try see if there was a link between the age of the leaf and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration and also between leaf <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration and berry <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration. There was found to be no link between the two in these preliminary studies. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, 2016...|$|R

40|$|Must {{acidification}} is {{a necessary}} operation in hot regions due to the low natural acid content of the grapes grown there. <b>Tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> is what is most usually used for this purpose. Using gypsum (CaSO 4 • 2 H 20) allows the amount of <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> needed to reach a given pH to be reduced. This paper is {{a study of the}} acidification of musts produced in Sherry area (Southern Spain) to a pH of 3. 25 with <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> alone and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> acting together with 2 g/L of gypsum. Using gypsum causes a reduction in must pH of approximately 0. 2 units and allows the <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> dosage to be cut down by 1. 5 to 2. 5 g/L. The concentration of sulfates in the fermented wine lies below 2. 5 g/L (the maximum authorized by the European Community), and the calcium concentration is 130 mg/L. Both levels are compatible with a correct winemaking. The acid buffering power of the wine and the alkalinity of the ash are reduced by the use of gypsum, which makes later acidification easier. Other wine component levels are not affected...|$|R
