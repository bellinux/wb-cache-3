2500|$|Most {{drum brake}} designs {{have at least}} one <b>leading</b> <b>shoe,</b> which gives a servo-effect. By contrast, a disc brake has no self-servo effect and its braking force is always {{proportional}} to the pressure placed on the brake pad by the braking system via any brake servo, braking pedal, or lever. This tends to give the driver better [...] "feel" [...] and helps to avoid impending lockup. Drums are also prone to [...] "bell mouthing" [...] and trap worn lining material within the assembly, both causes of various braking problems.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the dirt}} tracker, {{it came with}} brakes: a rear disc brake, and in front, a Fontana four <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> drum brake, which is two twin leading drum brakes paired {{side by side in}} two drums. The XRTT is the final example of a {{competition}} motorcycle with drum brakes, superseded by disc brakes on all other racing bikes due to the excessive unsprung weight added by the very large drum brake assembly. The official horsepower was never published, but estimates for the early 1972 engines were in the high [...] range, increasing to an estimated [...] or more by 2008.|$|E
50|$|Classic Mini's made by Austin and Morris were {{fitted with}} single <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> drum brakes from 1959-1964.|$|E
50|$|Steering was by a cam and lever {{system which}} {{provided}} a dual ratio to ease parking. Suspension was all elliptic (overslung in front, underslung at the rear) with rigid beam axles all controlled by Luvax-Girling double acting hydraulic shock absorbers—a transverse torsion bar linking both pairs. Brakes by Girling were mechanical using a wedge and roller system in 11 inch drums with twin <b>leading</b> <b>shoes</b> {{in the front}} drums.|$|R
50|$|Although {{based on}} the 3 Litre's engine, the 6½ engine {{incorporated}} many improvements. The 3 Litre's cone-type clutch {{was replaced by a}} dry-plate design that incorporated a clutch brake for fast gear changes, and the car had power-assisted four-wheel brakes with finned drums. The front brakes had 4 <b>leading</b> <b>shoes</b> per drum. By operating a patented compensating device, the driver could adjust all four brakes to correct for wear while the car was moving, which was particularly advantageous during races.|$|R
25|$|Weight. Greater dancer weight exerts {{proportionally}} greater stresses to the <b>shoes,</b> <b>leading</b> to faster wear.|$|R
50|$|The twin-leading-shoe brake (2LS) {{is a type}} of {{drum brake}} that has two leading shoes, rather than the single <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> and a single {{trailing}} shoe of a single-leading shoe (SLS) drum brake. A <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> has a self-servo effect, so an advantage of a 2LS is that it provides the maximum retardation in its intended direction of travel, i.e. forwards. 2LS brakes are fitted on the front axle of automobiles, or the front wheel of a motorcycle. A 2LS brake is more powerful than an SLS design.|$|E
50|$|Touted as 'The New Choo', in 2004 Ong {{was named}} by The Independent {{newspaper}} {{as one of}} the Top Ten <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> designers, joining the likes of Manolo Blahnik.|$|E
50|$|All engines were of {{the kick}} start,piston-ported, air-cooled, two-stroke, {{two-cylinder}} type. Lubrication was provided via premix or automatic oil injection depending on the year and model. All models through the 1965 model year {{were of the}} premix type while all models from 1966 onwards used automatic oil injection. Models 250 cc and above were fitted with large twin <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> drum brakes until 1975 when disc front brakes were introduced. Models under 250 cc had single <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> brakes. Most models had six-speed gearboxes, enabling the factory tuner to raise engine speed with the consequent narrowing of the power band.|$|E

In February, 2012 Gavet led OZON to acquire Sapato.ru, Russia's <b>leading</b> online <b>shoe</b> and {{accessory}} retailer. In May 2014, OZON acquired a substantial {{stake in the}} leading Russian eBook distribution platform, LitRes.ru.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1974, {{due to its}} {{discounting}} policy Famous Footwear {{was unable}} to purchase footwear from the two <b>leading</b> athletic <b>shoe</b> giants of the day, Adidas and Puma. Consumer demand for this emerging product category was enormous. In response, Famous Footwear opened up a number of little sporting goods shops called All Star Sports Centers, facilities which were directly promoted by regular Famous stores.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Parker was {{appointed}} CEO of Clarks <b>Shoes,</b> the <b>leading</b> non-athletic <b>shoe</b> brand in the world. During {{a period of}} six years the company was substantially reorganised, withdrawing from European manufacture, and reviving the Clarks brand with more up-to-date shoe styles. 20 factories were closed. [...] Over this period, the profitability of the footwear business increased 150% and the company posted record results in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The front brakes were double leading shoes, and {{the rear}} {{had a single}} <b>leading</b> <b>shoe.</b> By modern standards, they were not good brakes. Tires, front and rear, were {{interchangeable}} in 3.50 inch by 18 inch size.|$|E
5000|$|Also in June 1971, {{the first}} Ducati 750 GT models {{came out of}} the factory, {{distinguished}} by silver frames, metal-flake paint, fibreglass fuel tanks, 1 1/8" [...] (1.125") Amal carburettors, and twin <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> rear brakes.|$|E

5000|$|In 1952 MG Car Company updated the [...] "Y" [...] Type and an {{improved}} model was launched, {{known as the}} [...] "YB". The [...] "YB" [...] had a completely new Lockheed twin <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> braking system, 15 inch wheels and a much more modern hypoid type of back axle.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "leading/trailing" [...] {{means that}} only one shoe is [...] "leading", moving into the {{rotation}} of the drum and thus exhibiting a self-servo (or self-applying) effect. The <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> is [...] "dragged" [...] into the friction surface of the drum and thus achieving greater braking force. [...] The other shoe is [...] "trailing", moving against the direction of rotation, is thrown away from the friction surface of the drum and is far less effective. An advantage of an SLS brake is that is equally effective whether the vehicle is travelling forwards or in reverse. [...] When the vehicle is moving in reverse, the role of the leading and trailing shoes is switched. What would be the <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> when the vehicle is travelling forwards becomes the trailing shoe, and vice versa.|$|E
5000|$|Both the Elf and the Hornet {{went through}} three engine versions. Initially, {{they used the}} [...] engine (engine type 8WR) with a single HS2 carburettor, {{changing}} to a single HS2 carburettor [...] version of the Cooper's [...] power unit (engine type 9WR) in the Mark II in 1963. This increased the car's top speed from 71 to 77 mph. Therefore, Mark II cars also came with increased braking power {{in the form of}} front drum brakes with twin <b>leading</b> <b>shoes</b> to cope with the increased power output. Both Mark I and Mark II featured four-speed gearboxes (three synchromesh gears) with rod gear change, a.k.a. [...] "magic wand" [...] type. Automatic gearboxes became available on the Mark II in 1965 as an option. The Mark III facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents. Concealed door hinges were introduced two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. The gear selecting mechanism was updated to the rod type, as seen on all later Mini type cars. Automatic gearboxes were available to the Mark III in 1967 again. Full-four synchromesh gearing was eventually introduced during 1968. 30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built. Production of both models ceased in late 1969.|$|R
40|$|Maintaining a {{headquarters}} is {{the backbone of}} corporate operations. The enhancement of a headquarters’ performance may significantly contribute to the performance improvement and revenue growth of the entire corporation. It is especially important to develop a performance evaluation model for headquarters {{in this era of}} profit squeeze. As the saying goes, “You can’t manage it until you can measure it” [11]. a prototype of a performance evaluation model for {{headquarters is}} constructed using the Grounded Theory and questionnaires developed for experts. Subsequently, a case study is conducted to aid a <b>leading</b> <b>shoes</b> corporation in constructing a performance evaluation model for its headquarters. Measurement methods are figured out to measure and evaluate their organizational and operational efficiency. This will stimulate the continuous improvement of the organization, its operational process and personnel, as well as {{put an end to the}} role of the headquarters as being the biggest spender in the corporation. Finally, the evaluation model for headquarters proposed in this study is beneficial in meeting the industrial demands. Specifically, the model offers the following merits: (1) Substitution for the traditional subjective evaluation methods used for evaluating headquarters performances; (2) Serving as a reference for the business quarter in face of the Act for Promoting Operational headquarters by the Industrial Development, Bureau Ministry of Economic Affairs, and; (3) Offering an effective “performance evaluation model for operational headquarters” to aid in organizational operations and management...|$|R

Sneaker sales rose so high, they began to adversely impact on the sales of conventional leather <b>shoes,</b> <b>leading</b> to a fierce advertising war for market share in the late '50s. In the 1970s, jogging for exercise became increasingly popular, and trainers designed specifically for comfort while jogging sold well. Companies also started to market their products as a lifestyle choice. Soon, shoes were available for football, jogging, basketball, running, etc. Every sport had its own shoe, made possible by podiatrist development of athletic shoe technology.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the vehicle}} is moving in reverse, {{or if it is}} {{stationary}} but facing uphill, the role of the <b>leading</b> and trailing <b>shoes</b> is reversed. A twin-leading design thus becomes twin-trailing, with the rotation of the drum working against the brake shoes, trying to throw them off the drum. The exact opposite of the self-applying effect. [...] A 2LS brake is virtually useless when working in the opposite direction. For this reason, it is more usual to have a leading/trailing drum brake design on the rear of the vehicle, so that there is sufficient braking when travelling in reverse or when parked on a slope.|$|R
