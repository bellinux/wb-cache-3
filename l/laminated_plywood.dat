2500|$|William and Annie had a daughter, Marion duPont, {{and a son}} William duPont, Jr. Upon William duPont, Sr.'s {{death in}} 1928, William duPont, Jr. {{inherited}} the family's Bellevue estate in Delaware, whereupon he had the estate's mansion converted into a replica of Montpelier (now preserved as a state park), and Marion inherited the Montpelier estate. Marion preserved much of {{the core of the}} Madison home, gardens, and grounds as a legacy for all Americans. After her father's death, Marion made only one change to the house; she remodeled her parents' music room in the latest Art Deco style, using modern and innovative materials such as <b>laminated</b> <b>plywood,</b> chrome, glass block, and plate glass mirrors. [...] A weather vane was installed on the ceiling, which allowed wind direction to direct the hounds for fox hunting. [...] An exact replica of the Art Deco room {{can be seen in the}} DuPont Gallery, in the Visitors' Center at Montpelier. [...] Prior to her parents moving into the property, they enlarged the house considerably, adding wings that more than doubled the number of rooms to 55. Her parents also had the brick covered with a stucco exterior for a lighter look.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{exceptionally}} {{low quality}} of Chinese timber producers at the time, Ban had trouble finding a suitable {{material for the}} building. He eventually settled on a newly developed <b>plywood</b> called <b>Laminated</b> Bamboo <b>Plywood,</b> a form of LVL. All beams, floors, interior and exterior finishes were done in Bamboo to ensure consistency of material throughout the home.

50|$|When the Ministry of Works {{opened up}} the design competition, some 1,400 designs were submitted. Reviewed by the Building Research Station, many were {{rejected}} from the conceptual stage, such as the British Powerboat Company's proposal for the Jicwood all <b>laminated</b> <b>plywood</b> design; while others were only dismissed after the prototype stage, such as the steel framed Riley. However, a few were approved after testing for construction.|$|E
50|$|Metal Foil Deep Etching is a {{plastograph}} {{print in}} which aluminium foil {{is used to}} draw the engraved images. The thin foil is cut and placed on an engraved plate and then the embossed sheet is removed, turned over and filled with resin to stabilise the relief. The resin filled foil is then <b>laminated</b> on <b>plywood</b> or no any other surface. Onobrakpeya first started experimenting with foils and from the experiments transformed the foils into a print medium in the 1980s. He used already printed plates to try out the technique. Metal Foil Relief Print is a three-dimensional metal foil print drawn on a plastocast plate. A fairly thick foil is cut and placed over a plate and hand pressed to transfer {{the shape of the}} picture on the plate. The foil is then removed and filled from behind. It is then <b>laminated</b> onto a <b>plywood</b> and coloured {{in the same way as}} the metal foil deep etching print process already discussed above. Note that while the metal foil deep etching print is drawn from plastograph plates, the metal foil relief print is hand embossed on a plastograph plate.|$|R
5000|$|Materials: In {{addition}} to <b>plywood,</b> <b>laminates,</b> and solid woods, some builders are using experimental {{materials such as}} carbon fiber. Dulcimers are also made of cardboard. Often sold as low-cost kits, cardboard dulcimers offer surprisingly good sound and volume. Their low cost and resistance to damage make them particularly suited to institutional settings, such as elementary school classrooms.|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} a wood particle-plastic composite, {{which was made}} by flat-platen {{pressing}} and with a mixture ratio 70 : 30 (wood particle: plastic powder by weight) as the base panel of laminated composite wood flooring. The properties of this composite flooring. including bonding strength of overlay, thickness swelling after soaking in water, {{and the release of}} free formaldehyde, achieved industry requirements. The wood particle-plastic composites were installed as floors on test shelves to simulate the construction of commercial flooring. The test samples were conditioned under 20 T and 95 percent relative humidity (RH) for 10 days, then moved to the 40 degrees C, 95 percent RH for 5 days, after which their dimensional stability was measured. Results showed the width stability of the wood particle-plastic composite was better than a solid wood floor and a <b>plywood</b> <b>laminated</b> veneer floor. The thickness swelling of the wood particle-plastic composite was only 25 to 33 percent of that measured for the <b>plywood</b> <b>laminated</b> veneer floor...|$|R

Toward the end they sold bare molded hulls to be finished by buyers. They soon ceased operations.|$|E
50|$|Tego {{film was}} {{developed}} in Germany around 1930 as a glue for waterproof plywood. It comprised a paper sheet pre-impregnated with a resole phenolic resin. When heated, assembled between wood veneers and then compressed, a strong and waterproof <b>laminated</b> <b>plywood</b> was formed. Most plywood at this time used other adhesives, such as casein. These adhesives were generally applied as aqueous solutions, which caused warping of thin veneers and {{made it difficult to}} achieve a solid laminate without risk of voids. As Tego film was used dry, it gave a high integrity result, solid and without risk of hidden weaknesses. This became an important factor in time, when it was applied to use in aircraft construction.|$|E

40|$|Impact {{response}} of <b>plywood</b> <b>laminate</b> composites with imbedded glass and flax fibre fabrics utilising different adhesives were both experimentally produced and studied. Moreover the impact energy absorption of wood products as veneer, three and seven plies plywood and particle board were estimated. Therefore laminate composites {{were subjected to}} drop-weight tests with initial energy of 150 J and striker with diameter 20 mm {{in order to determine}} the impact force, energy absorption and deflection rate. Experimental results approved poor impact absorption properties for both single veneer ply and particle board, impact resistance was significantly higher in a plywood products. In combination with thermoplastic polymer and textile fabrics an absorbed energy of laminates was considerably enhanced. The highest specific absorbed energy values have been observed for <b>plywood</b> <b>laminate</b> produced by polyethylene adhesive and incorporating the glass fibre fabrics. During the drop-weight impact tests all samples were punctured, showing local damage in upper ply and much more extensive at the bottom ply. Damage extent was smaller in composite laminates reinforced with the fibre fabrics...|$|R

5000|$|The {{materials}} {{most often}} used in double bass construction for fully carved basses (the type used by professional orchestra bassists and soloists) are maple (back, neck, ribs), spruce (top), and ebony (fingerboard, tailpiece). The tailpiece may be made from other types of wood or non-wood materials. Exceptions to this include less-expensive basses that have <b>laminated</b> (<b>plywood)</b> tops, backs, and ribs, and some 2010-era lower- to mid-priced basses made of willow. Fully <b>laminated</b> <b>plywood</b> basses are resistant to changes in heat and humidity and accidental droppage or impacts, which can cause cracks in carved wood tops and bodies (a crack is most serious on the top).Laminated (plywood) basses, which are widely used in music schools, youth orchestras, and in popular and folk music settings (including rockabilly, psychobilly, blues, etc.), are very resistant to humidity and heat, as well to the physical abuse they are apt to encounter in a school environment (or, for blues and folk musicians, to the hazards of touring and performing in bars). Another option is the hybrid body bass, which has a laminated back and a carved or solid wood top. It is less costly and somewhat less fragile (at least regarding its back) than a fully carved bass. In 2015, the least expensive entry-level new, fully carved basses range from $2,750 to $4,950 USD, although a higher-end new carved instrument may cost from $9,000 to $24,000 USD. In 2015, bassists in top professional orchestras may have antique carved instruments valued at {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars. In 2015, new fully laminated basses are sold for about $1,350 to $4,500 [...] USD. New hybrid basses range from $3,000 to $6,400 [...] USD.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{there has been an}} {{increased}} usage of fibre-reinforced composite (FRC) materials in structural applications, including rehabilitation and retrofitting, mainly due to superior properties such as high strength, low weight and corrosion resistance of FRC materials. These superior properties of FRCs can be exploited in applications where simple light weight construction is a priority. Plywood {{is one of the most}} widely used materials in a number of light weight applications in the construction industry. This paper presents an experimental investigation of buckling behaviour of plywood plates reinforced with advanced fibre composite materials. <b>Plywood</b> <b>laminated</b> with FRC fabrics provide a superior composite which is light and has significantly improved buckling (stability) characteristics compared to its parent plywood material. The lateral deflections corresponding to increasing in-plane compressive loads on reinforced plates were closely monitored and compared with those plates with no reinforcement. 4. 5 mm thick <b>plywood</b> <b>laminated</b> with three different composite fibres (namely, carbon, aramid and glass) were considered in the investigation. The results of the study indicate that FRC-reinforced plywood plates exhibit a significant reduction in deflections and increase in the load carrying capacity in buckling applications...|$|R

50|$|The company built, or {{at least}} advertised, two models of motor yacht, one {{designated}} the 42 foot Bristol Offshore Trawler and the other advertised as a 38 foot model available in both an aft cabin and sedan configuration. Bristol trawlers were sold during the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Bristol Yacht Co. laid up the hull for the early 42 foot model which was a round-bilge design by the famed Eldridge-McGinnis naval architecture firm. The 42 foot model displaced somewhere between 26 and 30,000 pounds. The hulls were shipped off to another builder for epoxy <b>laminated</b> <b>plywood</b> decks and interiors. Production of the Bristol trawlers shifted to India during the 1970s, adding provenance to the Bristol-built trawlers. Numerous Bristol 42 trawlers remain in service as of November 2011.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{three-quarters of}} the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards Modernism. Art Deco, De Stijl, Bauhaus, Wiener Werkstätte, and Vienna Secession {{designers}} all worked to some degree within the Modernist idiom. Born from the Bauhaus and Art Deco/Streamline styles came the post WWII [...] "Mid-Century Modern" [...] style using materials developed during the war including <b>laminated</b> <b>plywood,</b> plastics and fiberglass. Prime examples include furniture designed by George Nelson Associates, Charles and Ray Eames, Paul McCobb, Florence Knoll, Harry Bertoia, Eero Saarinen, Harvey Probber, Vladamir Kagan and Danish modern designers including Finn Juhl and Arne Jacobsen. Postmodern design, intersecting the Pop art movement, gained steam in the 1960s and 70s, promoted in the 80s by groups such as the Italy-based Memphis movement. Transitional furniture is intended to fill a place between Traditional and Modern tastes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1953, Jalk {{opened her}} own design studio. Inspired by Alvar Aalto's {{laminated}} bent-plywood furniture and Charles Eames' moulded plywood designs, {{she began to}} develop her own boldly curved models.

In 1963, the English newspaper Daily Mirror launched a competition for a chair for {{a man and a}} chair for a woman. Despite the fact that Jalk won first prize with two different laminated armchairs, the He Chair and the She Chair, they never really came into production. Her associate, cabinetmaker and furniture manufacturer Poul Jeppesen, had made some prototypes but they were burnt in a fire, bringing the project to an end. In 2008, however, Lange Production began industrial production of the She Chair.

40|$|The shear {{strength}} of three-layer birch veneer/polyolefin/birch veneer lap joints has been investigated. It {{was found that}} the optimum technological parameters for producing three-layer <b>laminated</b> systems (<b>plywood)</b> at 180 °C were a pressure time of 1 - 3 min (plus 3 -min preheating) and pressure of 5 - 10 MPa. All the systems investigated exhibited relatively high values of {{shear strength}}, which were higher than those of the industrially produced plywood based on phenol-formaldehyde glues (3. 5 - 5 MPa). It is shown that the use of interfacial modifiers can increase the shear strength by 50 % compared with its initial values. The high shear resistance is explained by the high mechanical adhesion between the hot melts and the wood substrate. After a prolonged moisture influence (70 days at relative air humidity of 80 %), all the systems investigated showed a considerable (up to 25 %) increase in the shear strength. This can be explained by swelling of birch veneer, which gives rise to additional resistance forces between the hot melt and the substrate...|$|R
50|$|The {{skeletonized}} buttstock, {{pistol grip}} and folding carry handle/grip on the barrels were originally manufactured from birch <b>plywood</b> <b>laminates.</b> Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping {{better than the}} conventional one-piece patterns, do not require lengthy maturing, and are cheaper. The wooden furniture was finished with the Russian amber shellac finishing process. Small accessories and an oil-solvent container can be stored inside butt recesses.
