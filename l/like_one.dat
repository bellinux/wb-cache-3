5|$|Despite its poor {{box office}} returns, The Shawshank Redemption opened to {{generally}} positive reviews. Some reviewers compared {{the film to}} other well-received prison dramas, including: Birdman of Alcatraz, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Cool Hand Luke, and Riot in Cell Block 11. Gene Siskel said that <b>like</b> <b>One</b> Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game {{to pay homage to}} one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows many ideas from his film Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and bright colors atop a foggy setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock Tower to feel <b>like</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|Much of Clock Towers {{plot and}} artistic style are {{inspired}} by the works of Italian horror film director Dario Argento, most notably Phenomena (1985). Director Hifumi Kono loved horror films like this and wanted the game to feel <b>like</b> <b>one.</b> Many of the game's character graphics were digitized from photos of real people. Jennifer's movements were constructed from a woman in Human's planning division acting out the scenes. Her design was inspired by Jennifer Connelly's character in Phenomena.|$|E

However, they <b>like</b> <b>one</b> particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot {{over a period}} six weeks at the Huntington Hartford Estate, on a small budget. The film {{did not have a}} large crew, and {{according}} to Webber, the actors were paid around $1000 for their performances. During the production, Nicol promised the actors a cut of the film's ultimate box office earnings, but due to an issue with the film's distributor, this never occurred. During filming, Webber discovered she was pregnant with a son, and so several scenes had to be re-written, <b>like</b> <b>one</b> where she was meant to fall down a staircase.|$|E
5|$|Three {{companies}} of Pioneers {{were assigned to}} Barkas's command {{to carry out the}} physical work of making the thousands of dummies. They came respectively from East Africa, Mauritius and the Seychelles. One company worked the standard bed frame palm hurdles into the required shapes and fixed them together to make tank bodies, turrets and other dummy vehicle elements. The second company prepared hessian covers for the vehicle elements. The third company painted and prepared the dummies to the required degree of realism. Since the different Pioneer companies did not <b>like</b> <b>one</b> another, Barkas moved their camps as far apart as possible. To help maintain security, a NAAFI canteen was set up exclusively for the camouflage workers, to help keep everyone in camp.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to clear the way for a new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved <b>like</b> <b>one.</b> While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E

5|$|Both {{species may}} be {{affected}} by poor weather. Breeding colonies of Brazza's martins in river sandbars are liable to flooding, {{but this does not}} appear to be having a serious impact, and this species appears to be under no immediate threat. Its ability to use degraded habitats also aids its survival. Tropical cyclones present a threat to the Mascarene martin, particularly on the small islands inhabited by the nominate subspecies. The populations on Mauritius and Réunion were badly affected by a six-day cyclone in February 1861, taking many years to recover, but by about 1900 it was reported to be common but local, and in 1973–74 there were 200–400 pairs on Réunion and 70–75 pairs in Mauritius. More recent cyclones, <b>like</b> <b>one</b> in 1980, seem to have had less damaging effects than the 1861 storm. Several species have been lost from the Mascarene islands since human colonisation in the seventeenth century, but the martin and the Mascarene swiftlet occur on all the main islands, and are less vulnerable to the effects of human activities, especially since they can utilise houses for nest sites.|$|E

He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of}} the greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked <b>like</b> <b>one</b> could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were moved to another {{side of the river}} for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E

5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was <b>like</b> <b>one</b> single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E

Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Planetarian is a post-apocalyptic visual {{novel in}} which the player assumes {{the role of the}} junker. Unlike {{traditional}} visual novels, no choices are given to the player in Planetarian to advance the story, and there is only one possible ending; this is what Key referred to as a kinetic novel. The player can choose when to advance to the next dialogue screen or put the game on auto play. In this respect, the player does not play the game {{as if it were a}} video game, but plays it rather more <b>like</b> <b>one</b> would play a music track on a CD or play a DVD film. During gameplay, the player can choose to hide the text from view and go back to any previous lines. The game can be saved at any point in any of the five save slots available, and a load option is available where the player can load any of the automatically saved chapter markers, or choose to load any of the manually saved games.|$|E

5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head <b>like</b> <b>one</b> would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{present a}} natural threat, {{particularly on the}} small islands inhabited by the nominate subspecies. The populations on Mauritius and Réunion were badly affected by a cyclone in February 1861, and a British ornithologist, Edward Newton, claimed not to have seen a single specimen on Mauritius between the six-day storm and June of the following year. It took many years for this population to fully recover, but by about 1900 it {{was reported to be}} common but local, and in 1973–74 there were 200–400 pairs on Réunion and 70–75 pairs in Mauritius. More recent cyclones, <b>like</b> <b>one</b> in 1980, seem to have had less damaging effects than the 1861 storm. A number of species in the region are vulnerable partly because they are restricted to one island, or are badly affected by habitat degradation or introduced predators, and several species have been lost from the Mascarene islands since human colonisation in the seventeenth century. The martin and the Mascarene Swiftlet occur on all the main islands, and are less vulnerable to the effects of human activities, especially since they can utilise houses for nest sites.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her <b>like</b> <b>one</b> of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E
