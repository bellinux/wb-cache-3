25|$|Curtiss began thorough, active {{testing of}} Genie's {{language}} in October 1971, {{when she and}} Fromkin decided that her linguistic abilities were sufficient to yield usable results. Linguists designed their tests to measure both Genie's vocabulary and her acquisition of various aspects of grammar, including syntax, phonology, and morphology. They also continued to observe her in everyday conversations to gauge what pragmatics of language she acquired. The research team considered her language acquisition to be {{a substantial part of}} their larger goal of helping her to integrate herself into society, so although they wanted to observe what vocabulary and grammar Genie could <b>learn</b> <b>on</b> her own, {{out of a sense of}} obligation they sometimes stepped in to assist her.|$|E

Over two years, anthropologist Anne Russon saw several animals on these forested islands <b>learn</b> <b>on</b> their own to jab at catfish with sticks, so that the panicked prey would flop out of ponds and into the orangutan's waiting hands. Although orangutans usually fished alone, Russon observed pairs of apes catching catfish on a few occasions. On the island of Kaja in Borneo, a male orangutan was observed using a pole apparently trying to spear or bludgeon fish. This individual had seen humans fishing with spears. Although not successful, he was later able to improvise by using the pole to catch fish already trapped in the locals' fishing lines.|$|E

Bouchard opted for a career in hockey over banking when he was offered $75 a week to play senior hockey and the bank paid $7. In the minors Bouchard played with the Verdun Maple Leafs, Montreal Junior Canadiens and Providence Reds. It was Verdun team-mate Bob Fillion who gave Bouchard the nickname [...] "Butch". It originated due to the resemblance of his last name to the English word [...] "butcher". Bouchard was determined, strong and developed enough skills to impress coach Dick Irvin in the Canadiens’ 1940–41 training camp after which he was signed as a free agent. Bouchard had arrived at training camp in peak condition, which was unusual for National Hockey League (NHL) players of the time. To attend this first training camp he rode a bike , which also allowed him to pocket the travel expenses the Canadiens had allotted.|$|E

40|$|An {{inherent}} dilemma {{exists in}} the design of highfunctionality applications (such as repositories of reusable software components). In order to be useful, highfunctionality applications have to provide a large number of features, creating huge learning problems for users. We address this dilemma by developing intelligent interfaces that support <b>learning</b> <b>on</b> demand by enabling users to learn new features when they are needed during work. We support <b>learning</b> <b>on</b> demand with information delivery by identifying learning opportunities of which users might not be aware. The challenging issues in implementing information delivery are discussed and techniques to address them are illustrated with the CodeBroker system. CodeBroker supports Java programmers in learning reusable software components {{in the context of their}} normal development environments and practice by proactively delivering task-relevant and personalized information.
