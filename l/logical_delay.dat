In case of binary multiplication, combinational circuit can be designed using manual multiplication method which requires binary addition. Carry generated because of addition affects the speed of multiplication since the present addition depends {{on the value of}} previous carry. To overcome this problem, addition with the help of multiplexer is introduced and the result is an increased speed in multiplication.

40|$|The project studies {{features}} of today field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and uses {{them for a}} hi-speed processing of a video-signal of CCD camera. FPGA components have recently become very popular and offer important advantages for video-processing. One {{of them is the}} ability of partial functions to work independently. Thus there could be implemented really demanding real-time computation. For this task we could use also a digital signal processor (DSP). The disadvantage of the DSP solution is basically sequential computation, because every instruction cause a delay. Actualy the more complicated the slower computation. The speed of the FPGA solution is limited by the maximum frequency and time characteristics of FPGA (eg. setup time, hold time, <b>logical</b> <b>delay</b> etc), which basically limits every integrated circuit. FPGA devices are based on the SRAM technology, that gives the possibility to dynamically change the logic function and also implement some memory structures without loosing the capacity of logical elements. Modern tools for synthesis and simulation are inevitable for fast implementation and save a lot of designer’s time. Our first aim was to measure the position of the laser spot exactly and rapidly. We considered the principle of the measurement of the optical center of image. First it is necessary to compute moments of the image.

The dentists were exposed to an average personal air concentration time weighted average (TWA) of 0. 014 (range 0. 0007 - 0. 042) mg/m 3 for a mean period of 5. 5 (range 0. 7 - 24) years and had a mean blood mercury concentration of 9. 8 (range 0. 6 - 57) micrograms/l. In neurobehavioural tests measuring motor speed (finger tapping), visual scanning (trail making), visuomotor coordination and concentration (digit symbol), verbal memory (digit span, <b>logical</b> memory <b>delayed</b> recall), visual memory (visual reproduction, immediate and delayed recall), and visuomotor coordination speed (bender-gestalt time), {{the performance of the}} dentists was significantly worse than that of the controls.

40|$|The first {{genome-wide}} association {{study of}} human memory identified an association between a common T/C polymorphism of the KIBRA gene (rs 17070145) and episodic memory performance in normal individuals; subsequent studies have implicated the same polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease. Since impaired neurocognitive performance, including memory, may be both a core feature of schizophrenia and a candidate endophenotype, we attempted to replicate this association in a total sample of 544 subjects (including patients with psychosis, their unaffected relatives as well as normal individuals). In the combined sample {{there was a significant}} association between the KIBRA T allele and better performance in the single principle component of the memory measures, which included immediate and <b>delayed</b> <b>logical</b> and visual memory from the Wechsler Memory Scale (p= 0. 019).

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{solution to}} the problem is shown in Fig. 10. A few moments of study will indicate that it does in fact perform the required operation. The Flow Table Logic solution is shown in Fig. 11. Again the problem is easily checked for correct performance. The simplicity of the wiring and the regularity of the circuit are quite apparent. Such an approach should certainly prove valuable when batch-fabricated devices become a reaility. As was stated earlier, when applied to one such technology (EL-PC) the design anid fabri-cation of circuits is greatly simplified. An early model of an EL-PC combination lock is shown in Fig. 12. CONCLUSION The Flow Table Logic technique for circuit design presented here was intended for use with batch-fabri-cated (or perhaps micro-miniature) devices, hence the emphasis on simplicity and regularity. These are ob-tained in some cases at the expense of actual compo-nent count. The exchange was felt to be acceptable, however, since minimizing the number of active ele-ments is not guarantee of minimum cost. An interesting point that should be considered is the <b>logical</b> <b>delay</b> as-sociated with circuits designed by the Flow Table Logic technique. The circuit can go from one state to any other state in approximately two logical delays. Thus one has not sacrificed speed in the quest for regularity. The ease of circuit designi should also be an advanitage of this technique. As is true in most developments, there are some problem areas that still require investigation. The cod-ing of the input lines and, in fact, the coding of the states of the flow table are far from optimum. Only fur-ther work can reveal whether this can be improved without sacrificing the simplicity of the circuit. In addi-tion, the necessary delay required is not found in all technologies and thus Imlust be carefully considered in the solution of a problem.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} novel {{techniques for}} timing yield optimization and for yield estimation {{in the presence}} of large statistical process variations in integrated circuits. The techniques are based on our generalization of the <b>logical</b> effort <b>delay</b> model to circuits with stochastic parameter variations. In the spirit of the standard logical effort formalism, the stochastic gate delay model we propose separates the characterization of statistical variability from the gate topology, type, size and load-ing information. This separation of concerns is very powerful and facilitates the two novel approaches presented in this paper. In the first approach, we perform analyti-cal and/or qualitave reasoning about timing yield and “back of the envelope ” timing yield optimization {{in the same way that}} the logical effort formalism enables in the absence of timing variations. In the second approach, we improve the accuracy and efficiency of sign-off timing yield estimation based on transistor-level Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|We {{employed}} {{a simple and}} relatively undemanding task of monotone counting {{for the assessment of}} sustained attention in schizophrenic patients. The monotone counting task has been validated neuropsychologically and is particularly sensiti?e to right prefrontal lesions. We compared the performance of schizophrenic patients with age- and education-matched controls. We then explored {{the extent to which a}} range of commonly employed neuropsychological tasks in schizophrenia research are related to attentional impairment as measured in this way. Monotone counting performance was found to be correlated with digit span (WAIS-R-HK), information (WAIS-R-HK), comprehension (WAIS-R-HK), logical memory (immediate recall) (Weschler Memory Scale, WMS), and visual reproduction (WMS). Multiple regression analysis also identified visual reproduction, digit span and comprehension as significant predictors of attention performance. In contrast, <b>logical</b> memory (<b>delay</b> recall) (WMS), similarity (WAIS-R-HK), semantic fluency, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (perseverative errors) were not correlated with attention. In addition, no significant correlation between sustained attention and symptoms was found. These findings are discussed in the context of a weakly modular cognitive system where attentional impairment may contribute selectively to a range of other cognitive deficits. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — As we {{move into}} the nano era in {{integrated}} circuit fabrication tech-nologies, the performance variability due to statistical process variations and envi-ronmental fluctuations {{is becoming more and more}} significant. Considerable effort has been expended in the EDA community during the past several years in trying to cope with the so-called statistical timing problem. However, most of this effort has been aimed at generalizing the static timing analyzers to the statistical case in an EDA tool centric manner. In this paper, we take a pragmatic, design centric approach in pursuit of a simple yet powerful stochastic gate delay model that can be used to develop a very efficient timing yield estimation methodology, and that can enable tractable timing yield optimization and eventually lead to simple yet meaningful and useful design guidelines. In doing so, we first develop a generalization of the <b>logical</b> effort <b>delay</b> model for the stochastic case. In the spirit of the standard logical effort formalism, the stochastic gate delay model we propose separates the characterization of statistical variability from the gate topology, type, size and loading information.

Our {{aim was to}} combine MR imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF biomarkers in the diagnostic classification and 2 -year prognosis of MCI and AD, by examining the following: 1) which measures are most sensitive to diagnostic status, 2) {{to what extent the}} methods provide unique information in diagnostic classification, and 3) which measures are most predictive of clinical decline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ADNI baseline MR imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF data from 42 controls, 73 patients with MCI, and 38 patients with AD; and 2 -year clinical follow-up data for 36 controls, 51 patients with MCI, and 25 patients with AD were analyzed. The hippocampus and entorhinal, para-hippocampal, retrosplenial, precuneus, inferior parietal, supramarginal, middle temporal, lateral, and medial orbitofrontal cortices were used as regions of interest. CSF variables included A 42, t-tau, p-tau, and ratios of t-tau/A 42 and p-tau/A 42. Regression analyses were performed to determine the sensitivity of measures to diagnostic status as well as 2 -year change in CDR-SB, MMSE, and <b>delayed</b> <b>logical</b> memory in MCI. RESULTS: Hippocampal volume, retrosplenial thickness, and t-tau/A 42 uniquely predicted diagnostic group. Change in CDR-SB was best predicted by retrosplenial thickness; MMSE, by retrosplenial metabolism and thickness; and <b>delayed</b> <b>logical</b> memory, by hippocampal volume. CONCLUSIONS: All biomarkers were sensitive to the diagnostic group. Combining MR imaging mor-phometry and CSF biomarkers improved diagnostic classification (controls versus AD). MR imaging morphometry and PET were largely overlapping in value for discrimination. Baseline MR imaging and PET measures were more predictive of clinical change in MCI than were CSF measures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The Unified Logical Effort (ULE) {{model for}} delay {{evaluation}} and minimization in paths composed of CMOS logic gates and resistive wires is presented. The method provides conditions for timing optimization while overcoming {{the limitations of}} standard logical effort (LE) {{in the presence of}} interconnect. The condition for optimal gate sizing in a logic path with long wires is also presented. This condition is achieved when the delay component due to the gate input capacitance is equal to the delay component due to the effective output resistance of the gate. The ULE delay model unifies the problems of gate sizing and repeater insertion: In the case of negligible interconnect, the ULE method converges to standard LE optimization, yielding tapered gate sizes. In the case of long wires, the solution converges towards uniform sizing of gates and repeaters. The technique is applied to various types of logic paths to demonstrate the influence of wire length, gate type, and technology. that path delay is minimum when the efforts of each of the stages are equal breaks down, because interconnect has fixed capacitances which do not correlate with the characteristics of the gates (see Fig. 1 b). The same issue arises when arbitrary fanouts and fixed branch loads are present in the circuit structure. This behavior is described by the authors of the LE method as “one of the most dissatisfying limitations of logical effort ” [3].

40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used methods to assess memory functioning in studies of cognitive aging and dementia are story memory and list learning tests. We hypothesized that the most commonly used story memory test, Wechsler's Logical Memory, would generate more pronounced practice effects than a well validated but less common list learning test, the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) List Learning test. Two hundred eighty-seven older adults, ages 51 to 100 at baseline, completed both tests {{as part of a larger}} neuropsychological test battery on an annual basis. Up to five years of recall scores from participants who were diagnosed as cognitively normal (n = 96) or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 72) or Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 121) at their most recent visit were analyzed with linear mixed effects regression to examine the interaction between the type of test and the number of times exposed to the test. Other variables, including age at baseline, sex, education, race, time (years) since baseline, and clinical diagnosis were also entered as fixed effects predictor variables. The results indicated that both tests produced significant practice effects in controls and MCI participants; in contrast, participants with AD declined or remained stable. However, for the delayed-but not the immediate-recall condition, Logical Memory generated more pronounced practice effects than NAB List Learning (b = 0. 16, p <. 01 for controls). These differential practice effects were moderated by clinical diagnosis, such that controls and MCI participants-but not participants with AD-improved more on <b>Logical</b> Memory <b>delayed</b> recall than on delayed NAB List Learning delayed recall over five annual assessments. Because the Logical Memory test is ubiquitous in cognitive aging and neurodegenerative disease research, its tendency to produce marked practice effects-especially on the delayed recall condition-suggests a threat to its validity as a measure of new learning, an essential construct for dementia diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{incidence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) has risen to epidemic proportions, and this is associated with enormous cost. T 2 DM is preceded by 'prediabetes', and the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and/or impaired fasting glucose (IFG) {{provides an opportunity for}} targeted intervention. Prediabetic subjects manifest both core defects characteristic of T 2 DM, that is, insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. Interventions which improve insulin sensitivity and/or preserve β-cell function are <b>logical</b> strategies to <b>delay</b> the conversion of IGT/IFG to T 2 DM or revert glucose tolerance to normal. Areas covered: The authors examine pharmacologic agents that have proven to decrease the conversion of IGT to T 2 DM and represent potential treatment options in prediabetes. Expert opinion: Weight loss improves whole body insulin sensitivity, preserves β-cell function and decreases progression of prediabetes to T 2 DM. In real life long-term weight loss is the exception and, even if successful, 40 - 50 % of IGT individuals still progress to T 2 DM. Pharmacotherapy provides an alternative strategy to improve insulin sensitivity and preserve β-cell function. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are highly effective in T 2 DM prevention. Long-acting glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) analogs, because they augment β-cell function and promote weight loss, are effective in preventing IGT progression to T 2 DM.

If an FPGA design need be ported to an ASIC at a later stage {{it is also important to}} take this into account early in the design cycle so that the ASIC porting will be efficient. The structured and hierarchically design of VQ lead to the consideration of the dedicated parallel architectures in two ways, in the direction of Codebook size ‘N’ and the vector dimension ‘K’, that process with high efficiency.

Methods Design: Twelve months, randomized controlled trial; Setting: Community center in Japan; Participants: Fifty older adults (27 men) with aMCI ranging in age from 65 to 93 years (mean age, 75 years); Intervention: Subjects were randomized into either a multicomponent exercise (n = 25) or an education control group (n = 25). Subjects in the multicomponent exercise group exercised under the supervision of physiotherapists for 90 min/d, 2 d/wk, for a total of 80 times over 12 months. The exercises included aerobic exercises, muscle strength training, and postural balance retraining, and were conducted using multiple conditions to stimulate cognitive functions. Subjects in the control group attended three education classes regarding health during the 12 -month period. Measurements were administered before, after the 6 -month, and after the 12 -month intervention period; Measurements: The performance measures included the mini-mental state examination, logical memory subtest of the Wechsler memory scale-revised, digit symbol coding test, letter and categorical verbal fluency test, and the Stroop color word test. Results The mean adherence to the exercise program was 79. 2 %.

These were derived from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI- 1 study, of 301 Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment patients who were followed for 2 – 3 years. Methods: The model describes progression rate and baseline disease score as a function of covariates. The covariates that were tested fell into five groups: a) hippocampal volume; b) serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers; c) demographics and apolipoprotein Epsilon 4 (ApoE 4) allele status; d) baseline cognitive tests; and e) disease state and comedications. Results: Covariates associated with baseline disease severity were disease state, hippocampal volume, and comedication use. Disease progression rate was influenced by baseline CSF biomarkers, Trail-Making Test part A score, <b>delayed</b> <b>logical</b> memory test score, and current level of impairment as measured by CDR–SB. The rate of disease progression was dependent on disease severity, with intermediate scores around the inflection point score of 10 exhibiting high disease progression rate. The CDR–SB disease progression rate in a typical patient, with late mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer’s disease, was estimated to be approximately 0. 5 and 1. 4 points/year, respectively. Conclusions: In conclusion, this model describes disease progression in terms of CDR–SB changes in patients and its dependency on novel covariates. The CSF biomarkers included in the model discriminate mild cognitive impairment subjects as progressors and nonprogressors. Therefore, the model may be utilized for optimizing study designs, through patient population enrichment and clinical trial simulations.

Nineteen patients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia were recruited for a 3 -month trial of clozapine. Clozapine was titrated against clinical response to a maximum daily dosage of 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg in the first, second and third month respectively. Steady-state blood concentrations of clozapine, clozapine-Noxide and N-desmethylclozapine were determined at the end of each month. At baseline and the end of each month, patients were assessed by using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scales, High Royds Evaluation of Negativity, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression(severity & change) for their clinical symptoms and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Simpson-Angus Scale and Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale for the extra-pyramidal side effects. Neurocognitive function was assessed by applying Wisconsin card sorting, verbal fluency, digit spans, logical memory, visual memory, Stroop test, continuous performance test and Cambridge neurological inventory at baseline and at the end of the third month. Our results showed that 55. 6 % of the subjects responded at the end of the 3 -month trial.

Patients were randomized into parallel groups: CPAP with best supportive care (BSC), or BSC alone for one month, after which they were re-tested. One month of CPAP with BSC resulted in a hypertrophic trend in the right thalamus [mean difference (%) : 4. 04, 95 % CI: 1. 47 to 6. 61], which was absent in the BSC group [- 2. 29, 95 % CI: - 4. 34 to - 0. 24]. Significant improvement was also recorded in ESS, in the CPAP plus BSC group, following treatment [mean difference (%) : - 27. 97, 95 % CI: - 36. 75 to - 19. 19 vs 2. 46, 95 % CI: - 5. 23 to 10. 15; P= 0. 012], correlated to neuroplastic changes in brainstem (r=- 0. 37; P= 0. 05), and improvements in <b>delayed</b> <b>logical</b> memory scores [57. 20, 95 % CI: 42. 94 to 71. 46 vs 23. 41, 95 % CI: 17. 17 to 29. 65; P= 0. 037]. One month of CPAP treatment can lead to adaptive alterations in the neurocognitive architecture that underlies the reduced sleepiness, and improved verbal episodic memory in patients with OSA. We propose that partial neural recovery occurs during short periods of treatment with CPAP...|$|R
