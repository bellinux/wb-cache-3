He initiated the Pact of Olivos with Menem in order to negotiate the terms for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. Fernando de la Rúa led a faction of the UCR that opposed the pact, and eventually became president in 1999. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and Alfonsín's faction provided the support needed for the Peronist Eduardo Duhalde to be appointed president by the Congress. Alfonsín died of lung cancer on 31March 2009, at the age of 82, and was given a <b>large</b> <b>state</b> funeral.|$|E
50|$|This clause {{was part}} of the Great Compromise between small and <b>large</b> <b>states.</b> The <b>large</b> <b>states</b> were unhappy with the {{lopsided}} power of small states in the Senate, and so the Origination Clause theoretically offsets the unrepresentative nature of the Senate, compensating the <b>large</b> <b>states</b> for allowing equal voting rights to Senators from small states.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>larger</b> <b>states</b> {{traditionally}} {{carry more}} weight in negotiations, however smaller states {{can be effective}} impartial mediators and citizens of smaller states are often appointed to sensitive top posts to avoid competition between the <b>larger</b> <b>states.</b> This, together with the disproportionate representation of the smaller states in terms of votes and seats in parliament, gives the smaller EU states a greater clout than normally attributed {{to a state of}} their size. However most negotiations are still dominated by the <b>larger</b> <b>states.</b> This has traditionally been largely through the [...] "Franco-German motor" [...] but Franco-German influence has diminished slightly following the influx of new members in 2004 (see G6).|$|R

40|$|This article {{studies the}} impact of the Electoral College system on presidential campaigning during 1932 - 1976. Three {{variables}} are analyzed: size, competition, and region. It is hypothesized that candidates will concentrate on <b>larger,</b> more competitive <b>states.</b> And the data show that both parties allocate proportionately more campaign "stops " to <b>larger</b> <b>states</b> than to medium-size or small states. However, when controls are imposed for both size and competition, it is determined that size is the stronger variable. When the context is less competitive, campaigning is still targeted to <b>larger</b> <b>states,</b> with their wealth of electoral votes. A partisan difference in strategy does exist, moreover. Democrats give propor-tionately more attention than Republicans to the <b>larger</b> <b>states</b> whereas the GOP con-centrates more campaigning on small states. A regional shift in campaigning is noted. The election of our president is federal, rather than national, in orientation because candidates must win electoral votes within the states as separate political entities. Arguments in the political science literature suggest that candidates will direct their cam-paign efforts to <b>larger</b> <b>states,</b> with their wealth of electoral vote...|$|R

In 1857, the State of Mexico and all other states would keep their federal status permanently under the constitution adopted that year.|$|E
