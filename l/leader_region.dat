50|$|Pneumoviruses {{replicate}} in the cytoplasm of {{the host}} cell. First, the virus binds to HN glycoprotein receptors expressed {{on the surface of}} the cell. Then, through the action of the fusion protein, the virus fuses to the host plasma membrane and the nucleocapsid is released. Prior to undergoing replication, mRNA is transcribed and viral proteins are translated. Transcription is dependent on virally encoded RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, with binds the genome at the 3' <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> and then sequencially transcribes each gene. Translation of viral proteins is carried out by host cell ribosomes. Once sufficient P, N, L, and M2 proteins are available to create a capsid around the newly replicated genome, the virus undergoes replication. After replication, the P, L, and M proteins participate in forming the ribonucleocapsid. Once virion assembly is complete, the virion egresses by budding out of the cell.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the exact}} {{mechanism}} of T box leader {{is still unclear}} and currently being studied, it has recently been recognized {{as a member of}} an expanding group of RNAs that are phylogenetically conserved across many gram-positive bacteria. They are structurally complex and able to directly sense physiological signals which results in the control of downstream gene expression. This controlling of gene expression is accomplished by transcriptional attenuation—a general transcriptional regulation strategy that senses when an alteration in the rate of transcription is necessary and initiating alteration at a particular site (sometimes preceding one or more genes of an operon). The operons that encode aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, regulated by tRNA-mediated transcriptional attenuation, contain a <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> that specifies a transcript segment that can fold and eventually form a complex set of structures. Two of the most crucial segments to attenuation function as both the terminator and the antiterminator in different regulatory situations.|$|E
50|$|Lasso peptide {{biosynthesis}} requires {{at least}} three genes, {{referred to as the}} A, B, and C proteins. The A gene encodes the precursor peptide, which is modified by the B and C proteins into the mature natural product. The B protein is an adenosine triphosphate-dependent cysteine protease that cleaves the <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> from the precursor peptide. The C protein displays homology to asparagine synthetase and is thought to activate the carboxylic acid side chain of a glutamate or aspartate residue via adenylylation. The N-terminal amine formed by the B protein (protease) then reacts with this activated side chain to form the macrocycle-forming isopeptide bond. The exact steps and reaction intermediates in lasso peptide biosynthesis remain unknown due to experimental difficulties associated with the proteins. Commonly, the B protein {{is referred to as the}} lasso protease, and the C protein is referred to as the lasso cyclase.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTranscription is {{a complex}} process that relies on the {{cooperative}} interaction between sequence-specific factors and the basal transcription machinery. The strength of a promoter depends on upstream or downstream cis-acting DNA elements, which bind transcription factors. In this study, we investigated whether DNA elements located downstream of the JCV late promoter, encompassing the late <b>leader</b> peptide <b>region,</b> which encodes agnoprotein, play regulatory roles in the JCV lytic cycle. For this purpose, the entire coding <b>region</b> of the <b>leader</b> peptide was deleted and the functional consequences of this deletion were analyzed. We found that viral gene expression and replication were drastically reduced. Gene expression also decreased from a leader peptide point mutant but to a lesser extent. This suggested that the <b>leader</b> peptide <b>region</b> of JCV might contain critical cis-acting DNA elements to which transcription factors bind and regulate viral gene expression and replication. We analyzed the entire coding region of the late leader peptide by a footprinting assay and identified three major regions (region I, II and III) that were protected by nuclear proteins. Further investigation {{of the first two}} protected regions by band shift assays revealed a new band that appeared in new infection cycles, suggesting that viral infection induces new factors that interact with the late <b>leader</b> peptide <b>region</b> of JCV. Analysis of the effect of the <b>leader</b> peptide <b>region</b> on the promoter activity of JCV by transfection assays demonstrated that this region has a positive and negative effect on the large T antigen (LT-Ag) -mediated activation of the viral early and late promoters, respectively. Furthermore, a partial deletion analysis of the <b>leader</b> peptide <b>region</b> encompassing the protected regions I and II demonstrated a significant down-regulation of viral gene expression and replication. More importantly, these results were similar to that obtained from a complete deletion of the late <b>leader</b> peptide <b>region,</b> indicating the critical importance of these two protected regions in JCV regulation. Altogether, these findings suggest that the late <b>leader</b> peptide <b>region</b> contains important regulatory elements to which transcription factors bind and contribute to the JCV gene regulation and replication...|$|R

50|$|Before its discovery, the {{location}} of the encapsidation (packaging) signal within the bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) was suggested by Manksy et al. to either be “between the major splice donor site (in the r region of the viral RNA) and the gag start codon or between the primer binding site (located just downstream of the 5’ LTR) and the gag start codon.” In 1994, researchers from the University of Wisconsin Medical School made mutations in various locations of BLV through a process known as deletion analysis to determine if viral replication efficiency would be affected. They found mutants made with deletions in the 5’ end of the gag gene and in the 5’ untranslated <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> had a 7-fold and a 50-fold decrease in replication respectively. In contrast, they did not find a significant decrease in viral replication in mutants made with deletions in the 3’ end of the gag gene. These results suggest there are two regions within BLV necessary for successful RNA encapsidation.|$|E
5000|$|RNA: {{consists}} of a dimer RNA. It has a cap at the 5' end and a poly(A) tail at the 3' end. The RNA genome also has terminal noncoding regions, which are important in replication, and internal regions that encode virion proteins for gene expression. The 5' end includes four regions, which are R, U5, PBS, and L. The R region is a short repeated sequence {{at each end of}} the genome used during the reverse transcription to ensure correct end-to-end transfer in the growing chain. U5, on the other hand, is a short unique sequence between R and PBS. PBS (primer binding site) {{consists of}} 18 bases complementary to 3' end of tRNA primer. L region is an untranslated <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> that gives the signal for packaging of the genome RNA. The 3' end includes 3 regions, which are PPT (polypurine tract), U3, and R. The PPT is a primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis during reverse transcription. U3 is a sequence between PPT and R, which serves as a signal that the provirus can use in transcription. R is the terminal repeated sequence at 3' end.|$|E

40|$|Tryptophanase, encoded by {{the gene}} tnaA, is a catabolic enzyme {{distinct}} from the enzymes of tryptophan biosynthesis. Tryptophanase synthesis is induced by tryptophan and is subject to catabolite repression. We studied the mechanism of tna operon induction. Mutants with altered rho factor were partially constitutive for tna expression, implicating rho-dependent transcription termination in the control of tna expression. Measurements of mRNA synthesis from the transcribed <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> preceeding the tna operon suggested that the tna promoter was constitutive {{and that in the}} absence of inducer, transcription terminated in the <b>leader</b> <b>region.</b> Upon induction, this transcription termination was relieved.

40|$|Transcription of the trp operon of Bacillus subtilis is {{regulated}} {{in response to}} the availability of tryptophan. The first structural gene of the operon is preceded by a 204 -base-pair transcribed <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> that contains a segment with the features of a procaryotic termination site. Transcription of the <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> was analyzed in vivo and in vitro to determine whether this putative termination site was used to regulate operon expression. When RNA was isolated from wild-type cells grown in the presence of excess tryptophan, transcripts of the operon ended at the putative termination site. In contrast, RNA isolated from cells grown in the absence of tryptophan or from a mutant strain which is constitutive for trp operon expression contained trp transcripts that extended beyond the termination site into the structural genes. To assess termination quantitatively in vivo, a trpE-lacZ fusion was constructed in which the trp promoter and <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> controls hybrid beta-galactosidase formation. The effects on hybrid beta-galactosidase levels of point mutations and deletions introduced into this <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> were determined. The results obtained establish that transcription of the trp operon structural genes {{is regulated}} in the <b>leader</b> <b>region.</b> This regulation appears to be mediated by the formation of alternative secondary structures of the leader transcript. In vitro transcription studies with wild-type and mutant templates provided additional evidence that the identified alternative RNA secondary structures regulate transcription termination.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that RNA polymerase pausing in the <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> of the tryptophan (trp) operon of Escherichia coli {{is responsible for the}} synchronization of transcription and translation essential to attenuation control.

It was observed that pausing in the trp <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> was prolonged when translation of the leader transcript was reduced by mutations in the <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> or by addition of the translation inhibitor kasugamycin or chloramphenicol. Experiments with S- 30 extracts from a mutant strain that is inefficient in translating the tryptophan codons in the leader transcript indicated that ribosome movement to these codons also releases the paused transcription complex. These findings indicate that the paused trp leader transcription complex resumes transcription when released by ribosome movement over the leader peptide coding region. This release would facilitate the coupling of transcription and translation essential to attenuation control...|$|E

A large number of deletion and point mutations in the <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> were generated, and their effect on repression by S 4 in vivo was tested. These studies indicated that the required region was within positions + 30 to + 190 relative to the transcription start point. Replacement of the rpsD promoter with a lac promoter derivative which is expressed in B. subtilis had no effect, indicating that repression by S 4 occurs at a level subsequent to transcription initiation. The rpsD <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> was isolated from several Bacillus species. Members of the B. subtilis group, as defined by analysis of 16 S rRNA sequence, contained a <b>leader</b> <b>region</b> target site very closely related in structure to that of B. subtilis, despite considerable primary sequence variation; the B. brevis rpsD leader contained some but not all of the structural features found in the regulatory target sites of the other Bacillus species.

Transcription termination at the trp attenuator was analyzed in vitro with DNA restriction fragments containing the termination-relief mutations. Whereas the frequency of readthrough transcription beyond the termination site is 5 % with the wild-type DNA template, it is 46 - 76 % when mutant DNAs are used as templates.
