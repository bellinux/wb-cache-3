40|$|Abstract: Software {{architectural}} design, {{also known}} as top-level design, describes the software top-level structure and organization and identifies the various components. The concept of an automated air traffic flight control system which controls airplanes requires {{a high degree of}} operational integrity and availability. One possible solution to alleviate air travel congestion could be the automation of air traffic control and allowing it to have direct control over airplane flight paths. Such a system would, in theory, reduce the workload of the flight crew and the air traffic controllers, as well as increase traffic flow. This paper presents several analyses of such a conceptual system from a “net-centric ” perspective. First, the system‟s operation is described from the context of a flight, to provide a basis for the discussion of various system models and views. Spiral development model stages as well as related events which occur during system design give an idea of how the system would be developed incrementally. Formal methods can be used to improve software security but can be costly and also have <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> training, and applicability. To compensate for the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> formal methods can be applied to selected parts or properties of a software project, in contrast to applying them to the entire system. The concept of object-oriented development (OOD) has gradually matured from being presented. The OOD can still be model of a system, referred to as a UML model. We describe AATFCS system with UML modeling techniques. AADL is an extensible and allows us to introduce new properties; we can define a set of properties specific to the data state variable.

40|$|Periodontitis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} process which affects the tooth - supporting {{structures of the}} teeth. The disease is initiated by subgingival periopathogenic bacteria in susceptible periodontal sites. The host immune response towards periodontal pathogens helps to sustain periodontal disease and eventual alveolar bone loss.

Agricultural system management {{is a major}} component of natural resource management (NRM). Farming systems modelling has been successfully used to develop understanding of soil–plant–climate interactions and to assist on-farm decision-making processes. There is an increasing demand for applying farming systems models beyond point/field scales to support NRM planning and decision-making in spite <b>of</b> the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> such models. This paper presents two case studies in south-east Australia on modelling farming systems performance beyond point/field scales to support NRM planning. The first study focuses on the impact of spatially explicit crop/vegetation management on catchment hydrology to address dryland salinity. A one-dimensional farming systems model was directly coupled with a catchment hydrology framework that deals with lateral water flow between spatially distributed land units. The second study assesses the impact of climate change on the productivity and water balance of farming systems across the Lower Murray Region in southern Australia to provide inputs into regional NRM planning.

In particular, a number of experiments have been designed to study radiative shocks and jets with the aim of shedding new light on physical processes linked to the ejection and accretion of mass by newly born stars. Although general scaling laws are powerful tools to link laboratory experiments with astrophysical plasmas, the phenomena modeled are often too complicated for simple scaling to remain relevant. Nevertheless, the experiments can still give important insights into the physics of astrophysical systems and can be used to provide the basic experimental validation of numerical simulations in regimes of interest to astrophysics. We will illustrate the possible links between laboratory experiments, numerical simulations, and astrophysics in the context of stellar jets. First we will discuss the propagation of stellar jets in a cross-moving interstellar medium and the scaling to Z-pinch produced jets. Our second example focuses on slab-jets produced at the Prague Asterix Laser System laser installation and their practical applications to astrophysics.

In {{one of the largest}} studies of browsing behavior to date, we pair Web histories for 250, 000 anonymized individuals with user-level demographics—including age, sex, race, education, and income—to investigate three topics. First, we examine how behavior changes as individuals spend more time online, showing that the heaviest users devote nearly twice as much of their time to social media relative to typical individuals. Second, we revisit the digital divide, finding that the frequency with which individuals turn to the Web for research, news, and healthcare is strongly related to educational background, but not as closely tied to gender and ethnicity. Finally, we demonstrate that browsing histories are a strong signal for inferring user attributes, including ethnicity and household income, a result that may be leveraged to improve ad targeting. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel Gaussian process decentralized {{data fusion}} algorithms exploiting {{the notion of}} agent-centric support sets for distributed cooperative perception of large-scale environmental phenomena. To overcome the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> in existing works, our proposed algorithms allow every mobile sensing agent to choose a different support set and dynamically switch to another during execution for encapsulating its own data into a local summary that, perhaps surprisingly, can still be assimilated with the other agents' local summaries (i. e., based on their current choices of support sets) into a globally consistent summary {{to be used for}} predicting the phenomenon. To achieve this, we propose a novel transfer learning mechanism for a team of agents capable of sharing and transferring information encapsulated in a summary based on a support set to that utilizing a different support set with some loss that can be theoretically bounded and analyzed. To alleviate the issue of information loss accumulating over multiple instances of transfer learning, we propose a new information sharing mechanism to be incorporated into our algorithms in order to achieve memory-efficient lazy transfer learning.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Sweet-Parker type scaling {{arguments in}} the context of hyper-resistive Hall magnetohyrdodynamics (MHD). The predicted steady state scalings are consistent with those found by Chacón et al. [PRL 99, 235001 (2007) ], though as with that study, no prediction of electron dissipation region length is made. Numerical experiments confirm that both cusp-like and modestly more extended geometries are realizable. However, importantly, the length of the electron dissipation region, which is taken as a parameter by several recent studies, is found to depend explicitly on the level of hyper-resistivity. Furthermore, although hyper-resistivity can produce more extended electron dissipation regions, the length of the region remains smaller than one ion skin depth for the largest values of hyper-resistivity considered here. These electron dissipation regions are significantly shorter than those seen in many recent kinetic studies. The length of the electron dissipation region is found to depend on electron inertia as well, scaling like (m_e/m_i) ^ 3 / 8. However, the thickness of the region appears to scale similarly, so that the aspect ratio is at most very weakly dependent on (m_e/m_i). The <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>scaling</b> theories which do not predict the length of the electron dissipation region are emphasized.
