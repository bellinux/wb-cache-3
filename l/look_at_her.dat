5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|In the present, Ginko, {{to escape}} a blizzard, finds a village inn. After {{revealing}} himself as a Mushishi, he is asked to help several locals suffering from hearing loss. After he helps the locals, Ginko is asked by the innkeeper to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> granddaughter, Maho, who is deaf, has horns on her forehead, and hears strange noises. Maho's mother had the same symptoms and was cremated after her death. Maho, however, kept her mother's horns, {{which turned out to}} be a disguised Mushi and the cause of her illness. Ginko heals the girl and then continues on his journey.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after her}} {{conversation}} with Emma, Mary Margaret Blanchard volunteers at Storybrooke Hospital, placing flowers {{at the bedside}} of patients. She stops in the ICU where a John Doe (Dallas), Prince Charming, is sleeping in a coma. Mary Margaret is unaware of who he is. Meanwhile, at the Mayor's home, Regina takes the book from Henry's room and goes downstairs to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mirror, with an expression that seems to acknowledge she is aware of her fairy tale existence.|$|E

5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) {{are called}} to Lacey's (Mary Mouser) school when she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who died, after battling a {{terminal}} illness. When Megan looks at a photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> body, much to the horror of Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting sympathy from friends; however Lillian did not kill her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually working together with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will she was giving all her money to a fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money.|$|E
25|$|She {{was rather}} a hasty job, was the Monitor. -- You {{had better get}} a good <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> now as you won't see her after she strikes water. She's bound {{to go to the}} bottom of the East River and stick there, sure.|$|E
25|$|Poppy (Ward) is {{depicted}} as a small, innocent girl, who asks a stranger (most likely Pender) if {{they would like to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> picture book. The book contains pictures of often controversial issues such as the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse or the Ku Klux Klan, but Poppy's narration describes them more naively, suggesting they are, for example, performing acrobatics routines or playing dress-ups.|$|E

25|$|Evangelia was {{convinced}} that her third child would be a boy; her disappointment at the birth of another daughter {{was so great that}} she refused to even <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> new baby for four days. Maria was christened three years later at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in 1926. When Maria was 4, George Callas opened his own pharmacy, settling the family in Manhattan on 192nd Street in Washington Heights where Callas grew up.|$|E
25|$|Timekeeper {{announced}} that guests were {{just in time}} for a meeting between H.G. Wells and Jules Verne. Nine-Eye hid from the fair-goers but not so that Verne and Wells were hidden. After a brief conversation about their conflicting visions of the Future, Wells walked away, leaving Verne with a model of his Time Machine, which Verne had just criticized as impossible. After a sarcastic comment about time travel from Verne, Nine-Eye rebutted his claim and appeared to the author. Jules Verne decided to take a closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and tried to grab her. Timekeeper, seeing this, tried to bring her back to the present, but accidentally took Verne as well.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in the face. He turned to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|Madame Defarge {{received}} it as a compliment, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband. Defarge, {{who had been}} uneasily biting his thumb-nail and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> collected his face into a sterner expression.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> but {{he could}} not answer her; like all the others, when one <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> she seemed to shrivel beneath one's eyes and become worthless, malicious, and untrustworthy.|$|R
60|$|He sat <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She {{could feel}} his darkened steady eyes <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> all the time. It made her a little bit frightened. She pushed her hair off her {{forehead}} nervously.|$|R
500|$|In 2005, O'Brien {{started writing}} a book on Madonna, where she wanted to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> life and work, as the artist was {{approaching}} the age of fifty. She believed that the general public was eager to know the real-self of Madonna, and she concentrated on finding that out. According to her, [...] "the popular negative stereotype about the artist is that of a publicity-hungry, manipulative ball-breaker, while for many woman she is a beacon of feminism. I have always found her work clear and autobiographical, but her personality complex and disarmingly changeable." ...|$|E
500|$|Brooks's 1923 self-portrait has a grimmer tone. Brookswho also {{designed}} her own clothespainted {{herself in a}} tailored riding coat, gloves, and top hat. Behind her is a ruined building rendered in gray and black, underneath a slate-colored sky. The only spots of strong color are her lipstick and the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor that she wears on her lapel, recalling the Red Cross insignia in The Cross of France. [...] Her eyes are shaded by the brim of her hat, so that, according to one critic, [...] "she's watching you before you {{get close enough to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She's not passively inviting your approach; she's deciding whether you're worth bothering with." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{development}} {{was motivated by}} the phrase 'Check on It' which Beyoncé and her management jokingly used before they decided {{to turn it into}} a song. [...] "Check on It" [...] is an R and hip hop song, which is instrumentally complete with a heavy bassline, strings, and wind instrument. Lyrically, it takes place in a club, where Beyoncé is letting the male patrons know that they are welcome to come and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sexually attractive body when she is dancing. The song consists of two verse-raps by Slim Thug. [...] "Check on It" [...] was well received by contemporary music critics, who universally complimented Beyoncé's vocals, and the assertiveness with which she sings her lines.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> coldly. Worse, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{as if she}} {{had been}} an utter stranger. Bulging with her meat and drink, he cut her dead; and, having done so, turned and walked into the next flat.|$|R

500|$|Kavner has {{frequently}} appeared in Woody Allen films, having roles in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Radio Days (1987), New York Stories (1989), Alice (1990), Shadows and Fog (1991), the television movie Don't Drink the Water (1994) and Deconstructing Harry (1997). Allen described her as [...] "a naturally funny person. When {{she does a}} scene, you listen to her and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and the prism through which it's all filtered is funny." [...] Kavner believes he is [...] "a true filmmaker, one that has something to say, continually experimenting on different themes within his own film-making", adding that [...] "anything [...] ever does, I always want to do, [...] I don't even have to read it." ...|$|E
500|$|As was {{the common}} {{practice}} for Italian films at the time, shooting was done without sound; dialogue was added later along {{with music and}} sound effects. [...] As a consequence, cast members generally spoke in their native language during filming: Quinn and Basehart in English, Masina and the others in Italian. [...] Liliana Betti, Fellini's long-time assistant, has described the director's typical procedure regarding dialogue during filming, a technique he called the [...] "number system" [...] or [...] "numerological diction": [...] "Instead of lines, the actor has to count off numbers in their normal order. [...] For instance, a line of fifteen words equals an enumeration of up to thirty. [...] The actor merely counts til thirty: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. etc." [...] Biographer John Baxter has commented on the usefulness of such a system: [...] "It helps pinpoint an instant in the speech where he [...] wants a different reaction. 'Go back to [...] "27",' he'll tell an actor, 'but this time, smile.'" [...] Since he didn't {{need to worry about}} noise while shooting a scene, Fellini would keep up a running commentary during filming, a practice that scandalized more traditional filmmakers, like Elia Kazan: [...] "He talked through each take, in fact yelled at the actors. 'No, there, stop, turn, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> [...] See how sad she is, see her tears? [...] Oh, the poor wretch! [...] You want to comfort her? Don't turn away; go to her. [...] Ah, she doesn't want you, does she? What? Go to her anyway!'... That's how he's able... to use performers from many countries. [...] He does part of the acting for the actors." ...|$|E
500|$|Dickinson {{was troubled}} {{from a young}} age by the [...] "deepening menace" [...] of death, {{especially}} the deaths {{of those who were}} close to her. When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from typhus and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized. Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that [...] "it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or even <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face." [...] She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in Boston to recover. With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies. During this period, she first met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and Susan Huntington Gilbert (who later married Emily's brother Austin).|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{they all}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> for {{in her eyes}} was {{something}} that compelled theirs. Clement Maldon, who knew the world and how a she-wolf can fight for its cub, read in them a warning which caused him to change his tone.|$|R

500|$|In another article, Jocelyn Vena from MTV News {{thought that}} the video was [...] "the perfect homage" [...] to the singer's Sex book and her Erotica (1992) days, {{describing}} it as [...] "crunchy, sexy and edgy". Idolator's X. Alexander compared {{the concept of the}} video, along with its scenes of homoeroticism, to her 1990 music videos for [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Justify My Love". Sophie A. Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter noted references to the music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] (1989). E! contributor Nathalie Finn commented: [...] "Madonna doesn't need a song to tell us she's ready to dance all night—just one <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and you figure she could outlast the average partyer under any circumstances". She added that the references to her old work, as well as the half-nude men indicated that [...] "it isn't just the girls 'who wanna have some fun'." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producers}} J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pickner {{were both}} impressed with Torv's {{take on the}} role, with Wyman stating that it [...] "just transcended all our expectations", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was [...] "the most proud and most impressed" [...] with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance [...] "so creepy". He explained, [...] "In the episodes, you see I can barely <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> I think it ended up being {{a good way to}} play Peter’s reaction to Olivia, but it was born out of the fact that when that voice came out of her, I was like: ‘Oh, that’s just wrong!'" [...] Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for [...] "a couple" [...] episodes, and also warned that [...] "cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body. The possessed state of Olivia has led viewers to refer to her as [...] "Bellivia".|$|E
500|$|According to Taraborrelli, [...] "Many female artists {{behave like}} a diva for a period when they reach superstar status, and the 'Who's That Girl?' tour marked the {{beginning}} of Madonna's." [...] For instance, she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her; they had to talk to her representatives, lest they distract her from the business at hand. She also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to even <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> unless they were onstage with her. Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of [...] "those who couldn't help but stare". DeMann commented: [...] "She has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was. [...] "You don't {{behave like a}} bitch until you are that successful. The tour sure helped cement her star status", he commented.|$|E
