40|$|Abstract Males {{of several}} fiddler crab species {{sometimes}} construct sand structures (referred to as "hoods" in Uca lactea) {{at the entrance}} to their burrow, to which they attract females. Like the bowers of bowerbirds, sand structures of fiddler crabs are external ornaments that exist physically apart from the animals. Despite the mating benefit gained by possessing a structure, many males do not construct structures and some males even destroy their own structures. Structure destruction cannot be explained by the time and energy costs associated with structure construction or maintenance. This implies that the possession of a structure alone can be costly. In the present study on U. lactea, I experimentally planted hoods at the burrows of males that did not have hoods, and compared their frequency of hood destruction with that of control males (builders whose hoods were replaced with those of other males). Non-builders destroyed planted hoods more frequently than control males. Females, which do not construct hoods, also destroyed experimentally planted hoods more frequently than control males. Hoods are able to attract females, but the possession of hoods may incur some costs for crabs, probably because hoods also attract males and non-receptive females. Hence, only males that can afford the costs are <b>likely</b> to construct <b>hoods...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{assess whether}} houses can meet {{performance}} expectations, the new practice of residential commissioning will <b>likely</b> use flow <b>hoods</b> to measure supply and return grille airflows in HVAC systems. Depending on hood accuracy, these measurements {{can be used}} to determine if individual rooms receive adequate airflow for heating and cooling, to determine flow imbalances between different building spaces, to estimate total air handler flow and supply/return imbalances, and to assess duct air leakage. This paper discusses these flow hood applications and the accuracy requirements in each case. Laboratory tests of several residential flow hoods showed that these hoods can be inadequate to measure flows in residential systems. Potential errors are about 20 % to 30 % of measured flow, due to poor calibrations, sensitivity to grille flow non-uniformities, and flow changes from added flow resistance. Active flow hoods equipped with measurement devices that are insensitive to grille airflow patterns have an order of magnitude less error, and are more reliable and consistent in most cases. Our tests also show that current calibration procedures for flow hoods do not account for field application problems. As a result, a new standard for flow hood calibration needs to be developed, along with a new measurement standard to address field use of flow hoods. Lastly, field evaluation of a selection of flow hoods showed {{that it is possible to}} obtain reasonable results using some flow hoods if the field tests are carefully done, the grilles are appropriate, and grille location does not restrict flow hood placement...|$|R

40|$|Tracking {{maneuvering}} targets introduce {{two major}} directions {{to improve the}} Multiple Model (MM) approach: Develop a better MM algorithm and design a better model set. The Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) estimator is a suboptimal hybrid filter that {{has been shown to}} be one of the most cost-effective hybrid state estimation schemes. The main feature of this algorithm is the ability to estimate the state of a dynamic system with several behavior modes which can "switch" from one to another. In particular, the use of too many models is performance-wise as bad as that of too few models. In this paper we show that the use of too many models is performance-wise as bad as that of too few models. To overcome this we divide the models into a small number of sets, tuning these sets during operation at the right operating set. We proposed Hierarchal Switching sets of IMM (HSIMM). The state space of the nonlinear variable is divided into sets each set has its own IMM. The connection between them is the switching algorithm which manages the activation and termination of sets. Also the re-initialization process overcomes the error accumulation due to the targets changes from one model to another. This switching can introduce a number of different models while no restriction on their number. The activation of sets depends on the threshold value of set <b>likely</b> <b>hood.</b> As the <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> of the set is higher than threshold it is active otherwise it is minimized. The result is the weighted sum of the output of active sets. The computational time is minimum than introduced by IMM and VIMM.

40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the industrialized world and in the future is expected to be the number one killer worldwide. The main cause underlying CVD is atherosclerosis. A key event in atherosclerosis initiation and progression is oxidative stress through the production of reactive oxygen species as well as endothelial dysfunction. Several pro- inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and proteins are involved in this process, complemented by activation of adhesion molecules that promote leukocyte rolling, tethering and infiltration into the sub-endothelial space. Statins represent the agent of choice since numerous clinical trials have verified that their pharmacological action extends beyond lipid lowering. Statins demonstrate direct anti-oxidant effects by scavenging free radicals and stimulating anti-oxidant enzymes while acting as regulators for cytokine, protein and adhesion molecule expression, all of which are involved in the atherosclerotic process. Statin use is considered one of the most efficient currently used interventions in managing CVD with the <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> of remaining so in the near future...|$|E

KFC succeeded in becoming the first position due to its ability to make customers more loyal forever. Some of the factors that make KFC selected by the subscribers, among others, is that KFC managed to be complied with the customers expectation. This is the factor to make its customers satisfied. It has been noted in the research that customer loyalty is the product ultimate purpose or service provider. The purpose of this research was to find out the influence of the customer expectation, customer satisfaction towards the customer complaints, and customer loyalty. The design of this study is by means of convenience sampling. The data were collected using questionnaire. The method analysis used in this research is Maximum <b>Likely</b> <b>hood</b> test using the program AMOS version 18. 0. The results showed that the two hypotheses were accepted. Firstly, the customer expectation has {{a significant impact on the}} customer satisfaction and the second is that the customer satisfaction has a significant influence on customer loyalty...|$|E
40|$|Mobility {{serves as}} an {{indicator}} of the relationship between short and long run inequality. Understanding mobility is crucial for deriving policies that affect household’s incomes. Since long run income is more equally distributed than short run income {{it is important to understand}} the mechanics of income mobility. In this paper we have used a unique household dataset spanning more than 3 decades from rural India to derive what may be broadly classified as the triggers of income mobility. We believe and wish to show that location and outcome of location place a crucial role in determining the magnitude of income mobility. Given that in low income countries migration is a significant cause for income mobility, we show that its magnitude is influenced by the relationship between income premium (benefits accruing to the household due to location) and migration. There is thus a three way relationship between income premium, migration and income mobility. We find that increases in household income premium will reduce the <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> of a given household (members of that household migrating). Consequently we are more likely to observe a reduction in overall income mobility. A policy implication of this finding is that if development is not uniform across the economic space. Income mobility will decline in the long run...|$|E
40|$|Class of 2005 AbstractObjectives: To {{compare the}} {{interest}} in and the utility of a clinical intervention documentation tool for Pharm. D. students and preceptors {{on the basis of}} gender, age, and years and type of practice. Methods: A web-based survey (pre and post) was administered to all willing subjects. The survey web page was accessed through email. Results: Pre-surveys were completed by 14 students and 4 preceptors. Post-surveys were completed by 3 students (only one of which used the tool) and one preceptor. Due to the poor response rate results on the post-survey and the preceptors pre-survey were not analyzed. For the students pre-survey there were no statistical differences between {{the men and women in}} regards to their age. No statistically significant differences were found for students thoughts on utility and usefulness of the documentation tool on the basis of gender. Also there was no statistical difference between the men and women about the <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> of them using a documentation tool if it was available to them. Implications: This study found that students regardless of gender thought that a documentation tool may prove useful for preceptors and themselves. If a documentation tool was implemented it could provide important information of student activity to the preceptors as well as the College of Pharmacy...|$|E
40|$|An Empirical Investigation of Discrimination in the Hispanic Mortgage Market This Master's Thesis empirically investigates whether Hispanics are {{discriminated}} against in the mortgage market. The {{use of the}} 1989 Metropolitan file of the American Housing Survey allows me to test the effects of borrower race and default risk in mortgage lending. The empirical analysis {{is based on a}} probit model of whether Hispanics, blacks and non-Hispanic whites households obtain FHA or conventional mortgages. FHA mortgages are fully insured and generally require a lower down payment, but are typically more expensive. Given a choice between FHA and conventional mortgages, borrowers will prefer the relatively cheaper conventional mortgages. Therefore, households obtaining FHA mortgages will tend to be rationed in the conventional market. After controlling for various socioeconomic characteristics any remaining race effect in the probit model may be reflective of events unrelated to default risk. Results from this investigation indicate that the <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> of Hispanics obtaining FHA mortgages is not significantly different from that of white households. However, blacks are more likely to obtain FHA loans than Hispanic and white borrowers. These results suggest that Hispanics are not rationed as are blacks in the conventional mortgage market.

40|$|Despite {{claims that}} we exist in an “Age of Acquiescence” (Fraser, 2015) to {{historically}} {{high levels of}} inequality, Americans across wage, gender, and political leaning all desire a more equal distribution of wealth (Norton 2 ̆ 6 Ariely, 2011). However, this apparent consensus doesn’t necessarily translate into support for redistribution, {{at least in terms}} of greater taxation. Rather, according to recent findings by Northwestern University Professor Leslie McCall, Americans prefer instead to address wealth inequality through the expansion of opportunity (McCall, 2011). It may be that as individual perceptions of autonomy and the availability of opportunity increases, support for traditional redistribution decreases, since life outcomes are attributed to individual effort and responsibility as opposed to an un-level playing field (Naito, 2007). In addition, differences in individual moral priorities place certain morals intuitions above others, with liberals placing a greater emphasis on fairness and reciprocity than conservatives, potentially explaining their greater <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> to support traditional redistribution in addition to opportunity expansion (Graham et al, 2011). This survey attempts to bring these variables into consideration and determine whether and to what degree self-selected measures of autonomy and moral intuition correlate with support for redistribution, whether traditionally conceived or through opportunity expansion...|$|E
40|$|In 1986 {{president}} Ronald Reagan {{passed the}} largest immigration bill in American history. He granted amnesty to nearly three million undocumented immigrants, but many still considered this immigration bill to be a failure. The 1986 Amnesty Act, more properly {{known as the}} Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), was supposed to secure the border, crack down on businesses that continued to hire undocumented immigrants {{and put an end}} to illegal immigration here in the United States. It failed to deliver on its promises. Many undocumented immigrants became legal citizen, however the border was never secured, business continued to hire undocumented immigrants and it did not put an end to illegal immigration here in the United States.   Consequently, now, 27 years later the American undocumented immigrant population has more than tripled with an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country. And once again, the growing Latino voice has forced immigration reform back to the political forefront.   But with many still remembering vividly how the last immigration bill played out, it sparks the question, what’s going to be different this time? This peace seeks to investigate the differences between the 1986 Amnesty Act and the proposed immigration bill of today and its <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> of success. ...|$|E
40|$|A ‘Snowbird ’ {{is a term}} to {{describe}} the thousands of retirees when who temporarily reside in a warm southern states during the winter months. They arrive in Florida by the thousands and stay anywhere from one to six months. Pinellas has an estimated 45, 575 seasonal ‘Snowbirds ’ a year. They bring with them a positive impact to the county through spending locally and paying taxes, but do they impact government funded countywide programs? This study specifically examines seasonal ‘Snowbirds ’ impact to the Pinellas County Emergency Medical Service (EMS) System. It {{was found that the}} pattern of transports by EMS is symmetrical to the expected seasonal ‘Snowbird ’ population increase during the months of October through April and was consistent over a four-year period (1998 - 2001). There was also a change in pattern of paid and unpaid transports during the seasonal ‘Snowbird ’ period different from the other months which increases the <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> that these are different individuals from the permanent residents in Pinellas County. During this period the paid transports increased while the unpaid transports stayed the same over the 12 -month period. Even though seasonal ‘Snowbirds ’ do impact the Pinellas County EMS system, since {{they are more likely to}} have insurance and a higher income, the impact is one of a capacity impact and not an impact due to increase unpaid EMS services...|$|E
