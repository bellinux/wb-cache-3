500|$|In Alexandria, Owumi {{received}} a satisfactory offer from El-Olympi, a local team coached {{by one of}} Azmy's former players. Going against the will of his family, Owumi chose to follow his coach {{because he did not}} want his relatives to see him in his poor physical and mental state, and he felt that he could recover by playing basketball. He said, [...] "The real reason why I didn't come home was I was just too raw. You know, I would <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> <b>and</b> I couldn't recognize myself." [...] He also believed that a return to basketball would help him slowly reduce the trauma from Libya. However, during his stint, his father fell into a diabetic coma, giving Owumi additional stress. The Nigerian finished the final two weeks of the season with El-Olympi. He led his new team to 13 straight wins, won the championship, and was named postseason MVP.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the singer using sexually {{explicit}} language to describe an evening {{at her home}} where she is cooking a meal for her love interest while being naked and alone, [...] "I'm in my penthouse half-naked / I cook this meal for you naked". Idolator's Mike Wass interpreted these lines as showing the singer [...] "emotional shortcomings". The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer's recurring themes present on her other albums — [...] "the empowerment that comes with being a strong, independent woman, and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage". Finney wrote that during {{the beginning of the}} song, Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen, but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone, the same role feels oppressive.The singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come: [...] "I wish you were me/ So you could feel this feeling/ I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest." [...] After the chorus, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes, do the type of things I never ever do. I take one <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> <b>and</b> I say to myself, 'Baby girl, you can't survive like this.'" [...] The protagonist can not tolerate the fact she has been underappreciated and goes on to put on a [...] "freakum dress out my closet" [...] (a reference to her own song [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] (2006)) and stay the night outside further singing about her own attractiveness. As she continues to describe her love–hate relationship detailing her emotions, Beyoncé sings the song's bridge: ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert A. Yelle {{is highly}} {{critical}} of Malhotra's approach. According to Yelle, [...] "there is little, if any, original scholarship in the book. It {{is the work of}} a polemicist," [...] who uses western scholarship when criticizing the West, but ignores this scholarship when he presents his own nativist vision of [...] "dharmic traditions." [...] According to Yelle, Malhotra's vision is a mirror image of Orientalism, namely Occidentalism. Robert A. Yelle also criticises Malhotra for his use of the term [...] "dharmic traditions". According to Yelle, Malhotra ignores the differences that exist among and within the various traditions of India. According to Yelle, Malhotra presents a thoroughly homogenized ideal of Hinduism, based on a limited choice of aspects from Vedanta philosophy and Yoga. Yelle ends his review with the remark {{that there has been a}} gradual improvement in Western scholars' knowledge of Indian traditions. To come to a real dialogue, Indians must also be willing to <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> <b>and</b> be open to self-criticism.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2013, Beyoncé {{explained}} {{the idea behind}} [...] "Bow Down" [...] on iTunes Radio: [...] "The reason I put out 'Bow Down' is because I woke up, I went into the studio, I had a chant in my head, it was aggressive, it was angry, it wasn't the Beyoncé that wakes up every morning. It was the Beyoncé that was angry. It was the Beyoncé that {{felt the need to}} defend herself. And if the song never comes out…OK! I said it! And I listened to it after I finished, and I said, This is hot! I'mma put it out. I'm not going to sell it. I'm just going to put it out. People like it, great; they don't, they don't. And I won't do it every day because that's not who I am. But I feel strong. And anyone that says, 'Oh that is disrespectful,' just imagine the person that hates you. Imagine a person that doesn't believe in you. And <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Bow down, bitch' and I guarantee you feel gangsta! So listen to the song from that point of view again if you didn't like it before." ...|$|E

It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
