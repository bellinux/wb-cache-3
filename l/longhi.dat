5|$|Built {{during the}} 13th and 14th centuries, the Palazzo Senatorio ("Senatorial Palace") stands atop the Tabularium, {{which had once}} housed the {{archives}} of ancient Rome. Peperino blocks from the Tabularium were re-used in {{the left side of}} the palace and a corner of the bell tower. It now houses the Roman city hall. Its double ramp of stairs was designed by Michelangelo. This double stairway to the palazzo replaced the old flight of steps and two-storied loggia, which had stood on the right side of the palace. The staircase cannot be seen solely in terms of the building to which it belongs but must be set in the context of the piazza as a whole. The steps, beginning at the center of each wing, move gently upward until they reach the inner corner, level off and recede to the main surface of the façade. They then continue an unbroken stateliness toward each other, converging on the central doorway of the second story. This interruption of the diagonal line and the brief inward change of direction both absorbs the central axis and links the two sides. The fountain in front of the staircase features the river gods of the Tiber and the Nile as well as Dea Roma (Minerva). The upper part of the facade was designed by Michelangelo with colossal corinthian pilasters harmonizing with the two other buildings. Its bell-tower was designed by Martino <b>Longhi</b> the Elder and built between 1578 and 1582. Its current facade was built by Giacomo della Porta and Girolamo Rainaldi.|$|E

He also painted the canvases on the walls, Defeat of the rebel angels on right, and Angels liberate souls from Purgatory on the left. Other frescoes represent Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory. The angles in the niches of the pilasters were completed by both Silla <b>Longhi</b> and Flaminio Vacca.|$|E

50|$|Among <b>Longhi's</b> {{paintings}} {{which do}} not depict the Madonna is Judith with the Head of Holofernes (ca. 1570-75). This subject was also painted by other female artists including Fede Galizia, Elisabetta Sirani and Artemisia Gentileschi. <b>Longhi's</b> version differs greatly from two versions painted by Gentileschi in {{that it does not}} depict the violent act; instead, her Judith appears to seek forgiveness as she looks heavenward. This is consistent with Counter-Reformation ideas about willingness to admit guilt, and believing in absolution for the penitent.|$|R

25|$|The Re.2000 was {{developed}} by a team headed by aircraft designers Roberto <b>Longhi</b> and Antonio Alessio to be a lightly-built and highly maneuverable interceptor/fighter aircraft. The emergent design, which had been designated as the Re.2000 Falco I, was equipped with a Curtiss-Wright-style retractable undercarriage, bore substantial similarities to the American-built Seversky P-35. On 24 May 1939, the prototype performed its maiden flight. Flight testing of the prototype revealed it {{to be able to}} outfight several significant combat aircraft of the time, including even the more modern Macchi C.200 and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters. During the run up to and following the outbreak of the Second World War, the aircraft was ordered by several nations, including the Hungarian, Swedish, British and Italian governments.|$|E

50|$|Other {{paintings}} chronicle {{the daily}} {{activities such as}} the gambling parlors (Ridotti) that proliferated in the 18th century. Nearly half of the figures in his genre paintings are faceless, hidden behind Venetian Carnival masks. In some, the insecure or naive posture and circumstance, the puppet-like delicacy of the persons, seem to suggest a satirical perspective of the artists toward his subjects. That this puppet-like quality was an intentional conceit on <b>Longhi's</b> part is attested by the skillful rendering of figures in his earlier history paintings and in his drawings. <b>Longhi's</b> many drawings, typically in black chalk or pencil heightened with white chalk on colored paper, were often done for their own sake, rather than as studies for paintings.|$|R

The journalist Gustave Geffroy, in the prologue of Pietro <b>Longhi</b> (1924) by Uzanne, also listed this work among other works of Uzanne. On this pamphlet, he criticized the British government, including figures as Benjamin Disraeli and Nathan Mayer Rothschild.

Del Carpio himself had met all these artists through prince Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna, grand constable of Naples, while del Carpio was Spanish ambassador to the Holy See. In 1690 Cristoforo Schor made minor modifications to Martino <b>Longhi's</b> facade of Sant'Antonio dei Portoghesi.|$|R
50|$|Among {{his early}} {{paintings}} are some altarpieces and religious themes. His first major documented work was an altarpiece {{for the church}} of San Pellegrino in 1732. In 1734, he completed frescoes in {{the walls and ceiling}} of the hall in Ca' Sagredo, representing the Death of the giants. In the late 1730s, he began to specialize in the small-scale genre works that would lead him to be viewed in the future as the Venetian William Hogarth, painting subjects and events of everyday life in Venice. <b>Longhi's</b> gallant interior scenes reflect the 18th century's turn towards the private and the bourgeois, and were extremely popular.|$|R
2500|$|The {{research}} paper [...] "Gentileschi, padre e figlia" [...] (1916) by Roberto <b>Longhi,</b> an important Italian critic, described Artemisia as [...] "the {{only woman in}} Italy who ever knew about painting, coloring, doughing, and other fundamentals". <b>Longhi</b> also wrote of Judith Slaying Holofernes: [...] "There are about fifty-seven works by Artemisia Gentileschi and 94% (forty-nine works) feature women as protagonists or equal to men". These include her works of Jael and Sisera, Judith and her Maidservant, and Esther. These characters intentionally lacked the stereotypical 'feminine' traits—sensitivity, timidness, and weakness—and were courageous, rebellious, and powerful personalities. A nineteenth-century personality commented on Artemisia's Magdalene stating, [...] "no one would have imagined {{that it was the}} work of a woman. The brush work was bold and certain, and {{there was no sign of}} timidness". In Ward Bissell's view, she was well aware of how women and female artists were viewed by men, therefore explaining why her works in the beginning of her career were so bold and defiant.|$|E
2500|$|Anguissola is {{significant}} to feminist art historians. Although {{there has never}} been a period in Western history in which women were completely absent in the visual arts, Anguissola's great success opened the way for larger numbers of women to pursue serious careers as artists; Lavinia Fontana expressed in a letter written in 1579 that she and another woman, Irene di Spilimbergo, had “set [...] heart on learning how to paint” after seeing one of Anguissola’s portraits. Some of her more well-known successors include Lavinia Fontana, Barbara <b>Longhi,</b> Fede Galizia and Artemisia Gentileschi.|$|E

50|$|The {{work was}} of {{uncertain}} attribution until recent times. In the 1760 {{inventory of the}} Gallery, {{the subject of the}} painting was identified as Saint Catherine of Alexandria and attributed to Perugino. A restoration of the painting in 1934-36 confirmed art historian Roberto <b>Longhi's</b> attribution of the work to Raphael, and the removal of heavy repainting revealed the unicorn, traditionally a symbol of chastity in medieval romance, in place of a Saint Catherine wheel. Later restoration work on the painting in 1959 revealed through radiography the image of a small dog, a symbol of conjugal fidelity, under the unicorn. This alteration {{is believed to have been}} made by Raphael; it is not known why the alteration was made.|$|R
40|$|Initial-switching {{refers to}} the way in which the decay of an {{initially}} confined state begins, as the barrier isolating it from the exterior is relaxed. We study these effects in the context of <b>Longhi's</b> version of the Fano-Anderson model. Most authors assume the sudden approximation where the coupling is turned on instantaneously. We consider a finite rise time T, both numerically and analytically. When the coupling is ramped up linearly over a switching time T, we show that the asymptotic survival amplitude acquires a phase T and is modulated by a factor (sin T) /T. Several other results relating to the solution of the model are obtained. All site amplitudes have the same decay constant during the exponential decay regime. In the asymptotic regime, the amplitude and phase of decay oscillations depend on the initial-switching profile, but the period does not. Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures, accepted by Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
2500|$|The first {{writer who}} {{produced}} a novel around {{the figure of}} Artemisia might be George Eliot in Romola (1862–63), where some aspects of Gentileschi's story, while set in Florence in Gentileschi's time, are recognizable, but much embroidered. A later and clearer use of Gentileschi's story is by Anna Banti, wife of Roberto <b>Longhi.</b> Her first draft of the manuscript, dated 1944, was lost during the war. Three years later she started again with the book, to be entitled Artemisia, writing in a much different form. Banti's book is written in an [...] "open diary" [...] form, in which she maintains a dialogue with Artemisia, trying to understand why she finds her so fascinating.|$|E
2500|$|Merchant Marine: [...] Guthrie lobbied the United States Army {{to accept}} {{him as a}} USO {{performer}} instead of conscripting him as {{a soldier in the}} draft. When Guthrie's attempts failed, his friends Cisco Houston and Jim <b>Longhi</b> persuaded Guthrie to join the U.S. Merchant Marine in June 1943. He made several voyages aboard the merchant ships SS William B. Travis, SS William Floyd, and SS Sea Porpoise while they travelled in convoys during the Battle of the Atlantic. He served as a mess man and dishwasher and frequently sang for the crew and troops to buoy their spirits on transatlantic voyages. His first ship, William B. Travis, hit a mine in the Mediterranean Sea, killing one person aboard, but made it to Bizerte, Tunisia under her own power. His last ship, Sea Porpoise, took troops from the United States for the D-Day invasion. Guthrie was aboard when the ship was torpedoed off Utah Beach by the German submarine U-390 on July 5, 1944, injuring 12 of the crew. Guthrie was unhurt and the ship stayed afloat to be repaired at Newcastle in England before returning to the United States in July 1944. He was an active supporter of the National Maritime Union, the main union for wartime American sailors. Guthrie wrote songs about his experience in the Merchant Marine but was never satisfied with the results. <b>Longhi</b> later wrote about these experiences in his book Woody, Cisco and Me. The book offers a rare first-hand account of Guthrie during his Merchant Marine service. In 1945, Guthrie's association with Communism made him ineligible for further service in the Merchant Marine, and he was drafted into the U.S. Army.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was born}} in Bologna to a family of {{painters}} (including Giovanni Antonio Aspertini, his father, and Guido Aspertini, his brother), and studied under masters such as Lorenzo Costa and Francesco Francia. He traveled to Rome with his father in 1496, and is briefly documented there again between 1500–1503, returning to Bologna thereafter and painting in a style influenced by Pinturicchio and Filippino Lippi (whose work the critic Roberto <b>Longhi</b> suggested [...] he may have seen in Florence before 1500). [...] To his Roman years belong at least two collections of drawings, the [...] "Parma Notebook" [...] (Taccuino di Parma) and the Wolfegg Codex. [...] In Bologna in 1504, he joined Francia and Costa in painting frescoes for the Oratory of Santa Cecilia next to San Giacomo Maggiore, a work commissioned by Giovanni II Bentivoglio.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Longhi</b> wrote: [...] "Who {{could think}} {{in fact that}} over a sheet so candid, a so brutal and terrible {{massacre}} could happen [...] but—it's natural to say—this is a terrible woman! A woman painted all this?... there's nothing sadistic here, instead what strikes the most is the impassibility of the painter, who was even able to notice how the blood, spurting with violence, can decorate with two drops the central spurt! Incredible I tell you! And also please give Mrs. Schiattesi—the conjugal name of Artemisia—the chance to choose the hilt of the sword! At last don't {{you think that the}} only aim of Giuditta is to move away to avoid the blood which could stain her dress? We think anyway that that is a dress of Casa Gentileschi, the finest wardrobe in the Europe during 1600, after Van Dyck." ...|$|E
2500|$|During 1938, work {{commenced}} at Reggiane {{on a new}} fighter design; the company's design team, {{which was}} headed by Roberto <b>Longhi</b> and Antonio Alessio, set about designing an aircraft that would be offered to the Air Ministry that would not only meet but exceed the requirements of Programme R. Having very little time, the company considered various options, including the potential for manufacturing an American-developed fighter aircraft under license, however, {{under the influence of}} aeronautical engineer Giovanni Battista Caproni, a completely new design was rapidly prepared. The design team took inspiration from the contemporary American fighter Seversky P-35, which Re.2000 would superficially resemble; according to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, the design [...] "displayed evidence of fairly strong American influence...certain structural characteristics were strongly reminiscent of the American school, particularly of the Sevensky P-35". Refinement of the Re.2000's aerodynamic characteristics greatly benefitted from a series of wind tunnel tests held at Caproni's facility in Taliedo, Milan.|$|E
2500|$|Feminist {{interest}} in Artemisia Gentileschi was sparked in the 1970s when feminist art historian Linda Nochlin {{published an article}} titled [...] "Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?" [...] in which that question was dissected and analyzed. The article explored the definition of [...] "great artists" [...] and how oppressive institutions, not lack of talent, have prevented women from achieving {{the same level of}} recognition that men received in art and other fields. Nochlin said that studies on Artemisia and other female artists were [...] "worth the effort" [...] in [...] "adding to our knowledge of women's achievement and of art history generally." [...] According to the foreword by Douglas Druick in Eve Straussman-Pflanzer's Violence & Virtue: Artemisia’s Judith Slaying Holofernes, Nochlin’s article prompted scholars to make more of an attempt to [...] "integrate women artists into the history of art and culture." [...] Artemisia and her oeuvre became a focus again, having had little attention in art history scholarship save Roberto Longhi’s article [...] "Gentileschi padre e figlia (Gentileschi, father and daughter)" [...] in 1916 and R. Ward Bissell’s article [...] "Artemisia Gentileschi- A New Documented Chronology" [...] in 1968. As Artemisia and her work began to garner new attention among feminists and art historians, more literature about her, fictional and biographical, was published. A fictional account of her life by Anna Banti, wife of critic Roberto <b>Longhi,</b> was published in 1947. This account was received well by literary critics but was criticized by feminists, notably Laura Benedetti, for being lenient in historical accuracy in order to draw parallels between author and artist. The first full, factual account of Artemisia’s life, The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art, was published in 1989 by Mary Garrard, a feminist art historian. She then published a second, smaller book titled Artemisia Gentileschi around 1622: The Shaping and Reshaping of an Artistic Identity in 2001 which explored the artist’s work and identity. Garrard noted that analysis of Artemisia’s oeuvre lacks focus and stable categorization outside of [...] "woman," [...] though Garrard questions whether femaleness is a legitimate category by which to judge her art at all.|$|E
