25|$|As depicted, {{copies of}} X(f) are shifted by {{multiples}} of fs and combined by addition. For a band-limited function nbsp&(X(f) = 0 for all |f| ≥ B),nbsp& and sufficiently large fs, {{it is possible}} for the copies to remain distinct from each other. But if the Nyquist criterion is not satisfied, adjacent copies overlap, and it is not possible in general to discern an unambiguous X(f). Any frequency component above fs/2 is indistinguishable from a lower-frequency component, called an alias, associated with one of the copies. In such cases, the customary interpolation techniques produce the alias, rather than the original component. When the sample-rate is pre-determined by other considerations (such as an industry standard), x(t) is usually filtered to reduce its high frequencies to acceptable levels before it is sampled. The type of filter required is a <b>lowpass</b> <b>filter,</b> and in this application it is called an anti-aliasing filter.|$|E
500|$|Especially useful is {{the ability}} to {{transform}} from one bandform to another. In this case, the transform is more than a simple scale factor. [...] Bandform here is meant to indicate the category of passband that the filter possesses. The usual bandforms are lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop, but others are possible. [...] In particular, it is possible for a filter to have multiple passbands. In fact, in some treatments, the bandstop filter {{is considered to be a}} type of multiple passband filter having two passbands. Most commonly, the prototype filter is expressed as a <b>lowpass</b> <b>filter,</b> but other techniques are possible.|$|E

40|$|In this work, we have {{discussed}} design methodologies for generation of polynomial Butterworth, Papoulis and Filanovsky <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters</b> of different orders with arbitrary flatness, and also Thomson-Bessel <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters,</b> with monotonic amplitude-frequency response. We have shown how other monotonic responses can be obtained either by choosing lower order responses and/or by suitable combinations of these monotonic responses. We have proposed extraction of all possible lower order 1 -D <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters</b> from the designed higher order <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters,</b> and segregate the filters with monotonic amplitude-frequency response. Furthermore, we cascaded the proposed extracted monotonic 1 -D <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters</b> to realize higher order 1 -D <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters</b> with monotonic characteristics, and studied combinations of the same. We have proposed 2 -D fourth and fifth order Papoulis, Butterworth and Thomson-Bessel filters, and fifth order Filanovsky analog and digital <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters,</b> with monotonic amplitude-frequency response. Furthermore, by appropriately cascading lower order extracted 1 -D <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters</b> from the above mentioned types, 2 -D monotonic filters of different orders are realized.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to generate 2 -D filters having variable magnitude characteristics has been proposed. In this work, 2 -D digital filters starting from a singly terminated network is generated. A new type of Continued Fraction Expansion obtained from a singly terminated network is considered, its stability defined and stable 2 -D analog <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters</b> have been generated. The 2 -D analog <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters</b> have been transformed to digital domain by applying generalized bilinear transformation. The 2 -D digital <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters</b> give rise to 2 -D digital highpass, bandpass and bandstop filters. The 2 -D highpass and bandstop filters have been generated from 2 -D <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters</b> using appropriate transformations. The 2 -D bandpass filter has been obtained {{by a combination of}} <b>lowpass</b> and highpass <b>filters.</b> The 2 -D digital filters are classified into four sets. The classification of four sets is based on the coefficients of the Continued Fraction Expansion. Each set is further classified into four cases. The classification of four cases in each set is based on the coefficients of the generalized bilinear transformation. The effects of the coefficients of the generalized bilinear transformation in each case and the effects of the coefficients of the Continued Fraction Expansion (CFE) in each set are studied. In the end, some basic examples of implementation of 2 -D digital <b>lowpass</b> <b>filters</b> in image processing are illustrated.

2500|$|Most sampled {{signals are}} not simply stored and reconstructed. [...] But the {{fidelity}} of a theoretical reconstruction is a customary measure {{of the effectiveness of}} sampling. [...] That fidelity is reduced when s(t) contains frequency components whose periodicity is smaller than two samples; or equivalently the ratio of cycles to samples exceeds ½ (see Aliasing). [...] The quantity ½cycles/sample×fssamples/sec = fs/2 cycles/sec (hertz) is known as the Nyquist frequency of the sampler. [...] Therefore, s(t) is usually the output of a <b>lowpass</b> <b>filter,</b> functionally known as an anti-aliasing filter. [...] Without an anti-aliasing filter, frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency will influence the samples {{in a way that is}} misinterpreted by the interpolation process.|$|E
