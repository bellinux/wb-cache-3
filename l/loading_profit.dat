50|$|CityFlyer and its {{predecessor}} Connectair had a {{proven track record}} of operating a network of regional domestic and European scheduled services from Gatwick profitably. This was {{in stark contrast to}} BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, which had racked up huge losses ever since BA had established a major presence at Gatwick {{as a result of the}} British Caledonian and Dan-Air takeovers. The losses BA's mainline short haul services generated at Gatwick were at the heart of the unsatisfactory financial performance of the entire Gatwick operation. After the failed attempt to use the acquisition of Dan-Air, which was on the verge of bankruptcy at the end of October 1992, to form a new low-cost, short haul unit within BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, franchising seemed to offer the best solution for providing the level of feeder services BA needed to protect its long-haul <b>loads</b> and <b>profits</b> at Gatwick, without re-creating the complex organisation and fleet mix, and without duplicating the costly overheads of the BA mainline short haul operation at Heathrow, which did not suit the revenue environment at Gatwick. Apart from the additional transfer traffic this generated for BA's long haul services at Gatwick, the main benefit of this arrangement for BA was that CityFlyer was to remain completely independent of the BA mainline operation. The feeder services CityFlyer provided for BA at Gatwick under the franchise agreement did not impact the direct operating costs of BA's mainline operation. CityFlyer also had very low costs as a result of a flat organisational structure and a simple fleet. This suited Gatwick's revenue environment and was the main reason BA decided to make the franchise agreement with CityFlyer Express a central plank of its strategy to achieve sustained, overall profitability at Gatwick.|$|R

In this paper, a midterm power portfolio optimization problem with risk management is presented. Key instruments are considered, risk terms based on semi-variances of spot market transactions are introduced, and penalties on load obligation violations are added to the objective function to improve algorithm convergence and constraint satisfaction. To overcome the inseparability of the resulting problem, a surrogate optimization framework is developed, enabling a decomposition and coordination approach. Numerical testing results show that our method effectively provides decisions for various instruments to maximize profit and manage risks, and it is computationally efficient.

40|$|The thesis {{collects}} four {{essays in}} the fields of competition and innovation economics. In chapter 1, we review the recent growth literature that analyses the effects of product market competition on growth. Contrary to the negative effect predicted by the early endogenous growth models, this literature emphasises that product market competition may foster innovation and growth. We argue that a common characteristic of this literature is a decrease in the intensity of technological competition relative to the early models, which seems to support the positive link between product market competition and growth. In chapter 2, we study the effect of product market competition on growth in an endogenous growth model that maintains the intensity of R&D competition of the early models. We extend the early models by accounting for the possibility that many asymmetric firms (i. e. successive innovators) are simultaneously active in each industry. We show that an increase in competitive pressure exerts two positive effects on the incentive to innovate, which contrast the negative effect due to lower prices: the productive efficiency effect and the front <b>loading</b> of <b>profits.</b> We demonstrate circumstances in which the productive efficiency effect dominates the price effect, leading to a positive link between competition and growth. In chapter 3, we reconsider the comparison between Bertrand and Cournot competition in a differentiated duopoly with asymmetric costs. Our main finding is that, with high degrees of cost asymmetry and/or low degrees of product differentiation, the efficient firm’s and the industry profits are higher under Bertrand competition. This contrasts with Singh and Vives (1984) seminal result that, with substitute goods, equilibrium profits are always higher with Cournot competition. In chapter 4, we study vertical integration and product innovation as interdependent strategic choices of vertically related firms. Our main finding is that, although product differentiation allows to soften product market competition and to avoid market foreclosure, the downstream market may prefer less product differentiation to prevent vertical integration. Therefore, less product innovation can be a possible social cost of a lenient antitrust policy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Heavy {{network load}} in the {{signaling}} system number 7 {{is an important}} source of customer dissatisfaction as congested networks result in deteriorated quality of service. With the introduction of a Congestion Control Mechanism (CCM), that rejects service sessions with a predicted completion time greater than a maximum al- lowed completion time for the session, network perfor- mance improves dramatically, and thus customer satis- faction. Rejection of already delayed sessions let other sessions benefit and increase the useful overall network throughput. The decision of rejection is based upon Bayesian decision theory that takes into account the cost or revenue attached to each action, i. e. whether to reject the session or not. More valuable sessions are then given priority through the network, at the ex- pense of less valuable sessions.

40|$|The {{uncertainties}} of the renewable generation units and {{the proliferation of}} price-responsive loads make it a challenge for independent system operators (ISOs) to manage the energy trading market in the future power systems. A centralized energy market is not practical for the ISOs due to the high computational burden and violating the privacy of different entities, i. e., load aggregators and generators. In this paper, we propose a day-ahead decentralized energy trading algorithm for a grid with generation uncertainty. To address the privacy issues, the ISO determines some control signals using the Lagrange relaxation technique to motivate the entities towards an operating point that jointly optimize the cost of <b>load</b> aggregators and <b>profit</b> of the generators, as well as the risk of the generation shortage of the renewable resources. More, specifically, we deploy the concept of conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) to minimize the risk of renewable generation shortage. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on an IEEE 30 -bus test system. Results show that the proposed decentralized algorithm converges to the solution of the ISO's centralized problem in 45 iterations.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesIn today's {{electricity}} supply industry, demand side participation {{is considered an}} important factor that can influence the market performance and output effectively. Demand elasticity shows the sensitivity of demand side to the market price, and thus can provide potential adjustment of demand in the market. The purpose {{of this research is}} to study the impact of demand elasticity on power producers 'market competition output. An analytical model, called "Extended Cournot model" is developed in this thesis based on the classical Cournot model. Through the integration with conjectural variation model, in which power producers consider both the generation and price level, the extended Cournot model can analyze electricity market results under the conditions of different constraints. In the classical Nash Cournot model, capacity withdrawal exists in most cases especially when transmission constraint occurs. In contrast, the newly developed analytical model ensures that demand is always satisfied at all time. Demand elasticity is incorporated directly into the market results calculation instead of using the market clearing price. This approach enables the load demand to directly obtain the market results by tuning its demand elasticity. The intention is to show that demand side should be more encouraged to participate in the market competition. In the classical economic dispatch, the load demand is highly inelastic. From the load curve, there is only a change of physical volume of demand. The demand responsiveness, which is represented by demand elasticity, has been understated. In this thesis, the hypothesis is that demand elasticity and system constraint have critical influence on the power producers' competition results in terms of market clearing price, individual output and <b>profit.</b> <b>Load</b> demand can make use of demand elasticity to affect its final payment to the market. Such ability is expected to be limited in the case where system constraints, i. e. generation limits and transmission limits, exist. For simplicity, a small network and number of power producers are used in this thesis to investigate the effectiveness of the Extended Cournot model. However, this model can be applied to more complex networks with different market environments...|$|R

Effective energy {{management}} for facilities {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{in view of the}} rising energy costs, the government mandate on the reduction of energy consumption, and the human comfort requirements. This part of dissertation presents a daily {{energy management}} formulation and the corresponding solution methodology for HVAC systems. The problem is to minimize the energy and demand costs through the control of HVAC units while satisfying human comfort, system dynamics, load limit constraints, and other requirements. The problem is difficult {{in view of the fact}} that the system is nonlinear, time-varying, building-dependent, and uncertain; and that the direct control of a large number of HVAC components is difficult. In this work, HVAC setpoints are the control variables developed on top of a Direct Digital Control (DDC) system. A method that combines Lagrangian relaxation, neural networks, stochastic dynamic programming, and heuristics is developed to predict the system dynamics and uncontrollable load, and to optimize the setpoints. Numerical testing and prototype implementation results show that our method can effectively reduce total costs, manage uncertainties, and shed the load, is computationally efficient. Furthermore, it is significantly better than existing methods. ^ Topic 2. Power Portfolio Optimization in Deregulated Electricity Markets with Risk Management.

40|$|This master thesis {{describes}} a quadratic programming model {{used to calculate}} the spot prices in an efficient multi-area power market. The model has been adapted to Northern Europe, with focus on Denmark West and the integration of large quantities of wind power. In the model, demand and supply of electricity are equated, at an hourly time resolution, to find the spot price in each area. Historical load values are used to represent demand which is assumed to be completely inelastic. Supply is modeled according to the type of generation: Thermal generators are represented by piecewise linear, upward sloping, marginal cost curves. Historical wind generation data is used to model the fluctuating wind power output, and wind power is considered to have zero marginal cost. Hydro power is modeled by one aggregate reservoir for Norway and one for Sweden; the marginal cost of hydro power is set {{as a function of the}} difference between the reservoir level and the historical median reservoir level. Additionally, decentral combined heat and power plants in Denmark are considered to operate irrespective of the market. Six separate price areas constitute the model: Denmark West, Denmark East, Norway, Sweden/Finland, Germany, and Central Europe. The areas are modeled as having no internal bottlenecks and are connected by tie-lines constrained by active power limits. This report quantifies the impact the installed wind power capacity has on the power price in Denmark West by scaling up the wind power output in the model. Because wind power has a marginal cost close to zero, it will force prices down. The effect will be most prominent during high wind speed hours in a power system with substantial amounts of wind power. Results show that the impact is modest; average power prices fall by only 10 % if the installed wind power capacity is doubled, and thermal generation will set the power price in all hours until wind energy exceeds 50 % of domestic demand in Denmark. Since prices fall the most during hours with high wind power output, income to wind turbine owners will decline quickly as the installed capacity becomes large. The effect is most pronounced at wind energy shares above 40 %, thereafter the income [...] per MWh sold [...] falls rapidly. In absence of government subventions, this effect will limit the economically viable level of installed wind power capacity. Expansion of the cross-border transmission capacity and higher thermal generation costs can both help offset the income reduction to wind turbine owners from higher wind power penetration. Alone, a 30 % increase in thermal generation costs can allow 50 % of wind energy and still retain todays income to wind turbine owners. Use of the Norwegian hydro reservoirs to balance out fluctuations in wind power output is found to stabilize and reduce the price. This benefits both consumers and wind turbine owners in Denmark. Expansion of transmission capacity to Norway will further stabilize the price; a new 1000 MW cable lets the Danish market easily accomodate 50 % wind energy. With lower and more volatile prices as a result of high wind power penetration, a <b>load</b> can <b>profit</b> by being flexible. Water electrolysis is one such load; it uses electricity to produce hydrogen, and production can quickly be ramped up and down in accordance with the power price. Presently, steam methane reforming is the least expensive method of producing hydrogen, but with higher wind power penetration, electrolysis might become competitive. Using a previously developed model to assess the cost of electrolysis, in combination with the power market model developed here, this report finds that wind energy must exceed 85 % of domestic demand in Denmark, combined with higher natural gas prices, for electrolysis to break even with steam methane reforming. </p...|$|R
