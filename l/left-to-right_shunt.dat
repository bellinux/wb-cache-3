40|$|Total {{anomalous}} pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is {{an anomaly}} {{in which the}} pulmonary veins are directly connected {{to one of the}} systemic veins or drain into the right atrium. Management of pulmonary hypertension after the total correction of this congenital cardiac anomaly is very important. Unligation of the vertical vein in the supracardiac type of this anomaly can be a draining pathway for the prevention of postoperative pulmonary hypertension crisis. Late onset transcatheter closure of the unligated vertical vein after a decrease in pulmonary pressure with the Amplatzer vascular plug type 1 can prevent residual <b>left-to-right</b> <b>shunting.</b> Here we describe two patients who previously underwent surgical correction of supracardiac TAPVC and their vertical veinwas partially ligated due to severe pulmonary hypertension. Consequently, because of increased <b>left-to-right</b> <b>shunting</b> in the follow-up period, transcatheter occlusion of the vertical vein was done for them and this procedure seemed safe and less invasive compared to the surgical approach.

This switch in blood flow direction is precipitated by pulmonary hypertension due to increased pulmonary blood flow in a <b>left-to-right</b> <b>shunt.</b> The right ventricle hypertrophies to compensate for this pulmonary hypertension, so the right ventricular pressure becomes higher than the pressure in the left ventricle. Because of this switch in the pressure gradient, blood starts flowing right to left, forming a right-to-left shunt.

This method has been successfully applied to more than 300 patients and is being used clinically in our institution. One question that we have regards the quality of the in-jection. The authors inject all their patients into an arm vein with a 19 gauge needle. In our experience it has been very difficult and sometimes impossible to inject through a 19 gauge needle in the antecubital vein of infants. In general, we found that about 10 - 15 % of the peripheral injections resulted in a fragmented bolus and that in cases of Valsalva maneuver the bolus was also fragmented.

Data were collected at one second intervals but when one inspects the curves they appear to have more than one inflection per second. Are these analog tracings? We would also like to ask for more details on the method used to calculate the shunt. How is the peak estimated? In the example given (fig. iB, fig. 3) it seems that several points could have represented the peak and that the shunt ratio would have been different for each. Also, how is the ex-ponential decay estimated? The number of points from the original curve used is critical for the determination of the ex-ponential decay, the area under the curve and thus the shunt ratio.
