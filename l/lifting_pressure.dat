Methods: Barefoot quasi-static stance pressure measurements were taken during double limb stance (n= 22). Four forefoot lift (i. e. metatarsal head (MTH) and corresponding phalanges) conditions at three heights (4, 8, 12 mm) elevated the forefoot. A barefoot condition with no forefoot lift served as the control. Maximum mean pressure was measured for each test condition. All findings are compared to the no forefoot lift condition. Findings: The 1 st MTH forefoot <b>lift</b> increased <b>pressure</b> at the 1 st MTH while the 3 rd- 5 th MTH forefoot <b>lift</b> decreased <b>pressure</b> at the 1 st MTH. The 1 st- 2 nd MTH forefoot lift resulted in no change in pressure at the 1 st MTH, but the 2 nd MTH forefoot <b>lift</b> increased <b>pressure</b> at the 2 nd MTH. The 1 st MTH forefoot <b>lift</b> decreased <b>pressure</b> at 3 rd- 5 th MTHs and the 3 rd- 5 th MTH forefoot <b>lift</b> increased <b>pressure</b> at the 3 rd- 5 th MTHs. Interpretation: Orthotic forefoot lifts can be used to redistribute plantar pressures in the foot during double limb stance. The results of this study will be helpful in predicting lift height and position necessary to offload particular areas. Clinical Relevance: This research provides evidence-based practices in orthotic forefoot lifts. Clinicians can use the included table to predict plantar pressure reductions to certain areas of the foot.

40|$|Two {{separate}} and distinct theories are incorporated in this computer program to estimate the lift-induced pressures existent on a wing-body combination. These are (1) the second-order shock-expansion theory, {{which is used to}} obtain the lifting pressures on the body alone at small angles of attack, and (2) the linear-theory integral equations, which is used to evaluate the lifting pressures induced by the wing. These equations relate the local surface slope at a point on the lifting surface to the pressure differential at the point and the influence of the pressures upstream of the point. The numerical solution of these equations is effected by treating the wing-planform as a composite of elemental rectangles and applying summation techniques to satisfy the necessary integral relations. Most of the input required by this program is involved with the description of the missile planform geometry. The output consists of the computed value of the <b>lifting</b> <b>pressure</b> slope (the differential pressure coefficient per degree angle of attack) for each of the elements in the planform array.

The geometric perturbation is defined in terms of a single variable, and the user need only provide simple expressions or similar means for defining the continuous or discontinuous global or local perturbation of interest. Example expressions are given for perturbations of the sweep, taper, and aspect ratio of a wing with trapezoidal semispan planform. In addition to direct computational use, the analytical method presented here should provide benchmark criteria for assessing the accuracy of aerodynamic sensitivities obtained by approximate methods such as finite geometry perturbation and differencing.

40|$|The {{performance}} and energy efficiency of mechanical components is {{strongly influenced by}} the tribological behaviour of their surfaces. This paper investigates the design and manufacturing of microstructured surfaces for improved wear resistance of forming tools and reduced friction in powertrain components. The potential of microstructures in the improvement of adhesion strength and resistance to delamination of hard coatings under the severe thermomechanical service conditions of hot forging tool surfaces is discussed. In the case of powertrain components, the ability of surface structures to reduce friction between lubricated bearing surfaces was investigated numerically and experimentally. The COMSOL Multiphysics Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package was used to estimate the effect of geometric parameters of patterned spherical-segment cavities on hydrodynamic pressure. Electrochemical Machining by closed-electrolytic-free Jet (Jet-ECM) was used to manufacture the microstructures. Tribological ring-on-disc tests with structured surfaces were performed.

40|$|The {{development}} of a nonplanar lifting surface method having a continuous distribution of singularities and satisfying the tangent flow boundary condition on the mean camber surface is given. The method predicts some incompressible longitudinal aerodynamic coefficients of rectangular wings which have circular-arc camber. The solution method is of the integral-equation type and the resulting surface integrals are evaluated by either using numerical or analytical techniques, as are appropriate. Applications are made and the results compared with those from an exact two-dimensional circular-arc camber solution, a three-dimensional flat-wing solution which represents the camber by a projected slope onto the flat surface, and a flat-wing experiment. From these comparisons, the present method is found to predict well the flat-wing experiment and limiting values, {{in addition to the}} center of pressure variation at an angle of attack of zero for any camber.

The wings had the same planform (aspect ratio of 2. 5 and a leading-edge-sweep angle of 44 deg) but differed in amounts of camber and twist (wing design lift coefficient of 0. 35 and 0. 70). The effects of wing strake on the wing pressure distributions were also studied. The {{results indicate that the}} experimental chordwise pressure distribution agrees reasonably well with the design distribution over the forward 60 percent of nearly all the airfoil sections for the lower cambered wing. The measured lifting pressures are slightly less than the design pressures over the aft part of the airfoil. For the highly cambered wing, there is {{a significant difference between the}} experimental and the design pressure level. The experimental distribution, however, is still very similar to the prescribed distribution.

40|$|Slender wings on {{supersonic}} cruise configurations {{are expected}} to be thin and highly swept. As a result, edge-separated vortex flow is inevitable and must be accounted for in aerodynamic analysis and design. The present method is based on the method of suction analogy to calculate the total aerodynamic characteristics. The method requires the solution of the attached flow problem, the latter being solved by a low-order panel method in subsonic and supersonic flow. In essence, the <b>lifting</b> <b>pressure</b> is calculated by using a pressure-doublet distribution satisfying the Prandtl-Glauert equation. From the pressure distribution, the leading-edge suction is calculated. The latter is assumed to be the vortex lift through the method of suction analogy. For a cambered wing, the location of vortex-lift action point is important in predicting the aerodynamic characteristics. It is also seen that the effect of camber shape appears nonlinearly in all aerodynamic expressions. To design the camber shape, the camber slope is represented by a cosine Fourier series at each of several spanwise stations. The Fourier coefficients are the design variables. To design a leading-edge flap in the vortex flow (i. e., a vortex flap), the coordinates of corner points and the deflection angle are the design variables. The process of wing design is to determine the camber shape and twist distribution such that an objective function, typically the drag, is minimized, subject to various constraints...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{spanwise}} blowing {{on the surface}} pressures of a 44 deg swept trapezoidal wing-strake configuration were measured.

Results showed that spanwise blowing delayed the leading edge vortex breakdown to larger span distances and increased the <b>lifting</b> <b>pressures.</b> Vortex <b>lift</b> was achieved at span stations immediately outboard of the strake-wing junction with no blowing, but spanwise blowing was necessary to achieve vortex lift at increased span distances. Blowing on the wing {{in the presence of the}} strake was not as effective as blowing on the wing alone. Spanwise blowing increased lift throughout the angle-of-attack range, improved the drag polars, and extended the linear pitching moment to higher values of lift.
