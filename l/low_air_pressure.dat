25|$|Because of {{differences}} in the specific heat capacity of land and water, continents heat up faster than seas. Consequently, the air above coastal lands heats up faster than the air above seas. This creates areas of <b>low</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas, causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as sea breeze.|$|E

25|$|The {{stall warning}} and stall {{recovery}} systems {{were at the}} centre of the inquiry, which examined in some detail their operation and why the flight crew might have over-ridden them. A three-way air pressure valve (part of the stall recovery system) was found to have been one-sixth of a turn out of position, and the locking wire which secured it was missing. Calculations carried out by Hawker Siddeley determined that if the valve was in this position during the flight then the reduction in engine power for the noise abatement procedure could have activated the warning light that indicated <b>low</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> in the system. The failure indications might have appeared just prior to take-off and could have accounted for the two-minute delay {{at the end of the}} runway. A captain who had flown Papa India on the morning of the accident flight noted no technical problems, and the public inquiry found that the position of the valve had no significant effect on the system.|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} Hurricane Mitch {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave [...] an elongated area of <b>low</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> moving from east to west [...] that moved through western Africa on October8, as evidenced by radiosonde data. On October10, the wave exited the coast, and it continued generally westward without development due to strong wind shear. The wave reached the eastern Caribbean Sea on October18, and over the subsequent few days developed an organizing area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system organized enough to prompt a Hurricane Hunters investigation, which observed a small circulation center and flight-level tropical storm force winds. As a result, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated the system had developed into a tropical cyclone by 0000UTC on October22, located 415mi (665km) south of Kingston, Jamaica.|$|E

Upon forming, the depression had good outflow, although the convection was not as organized. With an anticyclone over the system, the depression was expected to gradually intensify while moving slowly to the west-northwest, a motion caused by weak steering winds.

A primary path for gas leakage is from the gob into the {{retained}} roadway. If the roadway is well sealed against the gob, the gas can accumulate in the gob end and gas concentrations there can be high. The Y-type ventilation system can easily lower gas concentrations in the gob and can contribute to gob gas drainage using buried pipes. A Y-type system can also reduce gas accumulation at the face return corner better than U-type ventilation, which can allow gas concentrations at the upper corner to exceed statutory limits (Yuan et al. 2011).|$|R

2500|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Durian {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} disturbance that developed near Chuuk State in the Federated States of Micronesia on November23. Initially, the system featured a broad low- to mid-level circulation and good outflow. Situated within an area of moderate wind shear, development was initially inhibited; however, following a decrease in shear on November25, organization improved. On November25, a tropical wave [...] an elongated area of <b>low</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> moving from east to west [...] interacted with the system and triggered tropical cyclogenesis. Post-storm modeling determined that this wave was an essential factor in the storm's formation and had it not formed, Durian would not have become a tropical cyclone. With convection wrapping into the storm's circulation, the JTWC classified it as a tropical depression around 1200UTC. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit three hours later. Situated south of a mid-level ridge, the system tracked generally west-northwest toward the Philippines. The depression gradually organized and gained strength, reaching tropical storm status late on November26. At that time, the JMA assigned it the name Durian.|$|E
