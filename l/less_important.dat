5|$|All cacti {{have some}} adaptations to promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. they are xerophytes), {{but the first}} ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, where water conservation is <b>less</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the war {{had ended}} with the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the United States, {{operating}} under the Articles of Confederation, resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont, Allen's historic role as an agitator became <b>less</b> <b>important,</b> and his public role in Vermont's affairs declined. Vermont's government had also become more than a clique dominated by the Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory's rapid population growth.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other <b>less</b> <b>important</b> mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E
5|$|In chess a minor {{material}} advantage is important as when material gets exchanged, the relative advantage becomes larger.

50|$|To {{meet the}} {{challenge}} posed by a shortage of strategic materials like the light alloys used in aircraft construction, several prototype emergency fighters were designed to use more readily available materials.

5|$|The {{abundance}} of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is barite (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral. with deposits {{in many parts}} of the world. Another commercial source, far <b>less</b> <b>important</b> than barite, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.|$|E
5|$|Although cavalry {{was used}} {{extensively}} {{throughout the world}} during the 19th century, horses became <b>less</b> <b>important</b> to warfare after {{the beginning of the}} 20th century.

5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was <b>less</b> <b>important</b> than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become <b>less</b> <b>important.</b> Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E
5|$|As Ironside was a {{marginal}} operation, {{and they were}} worried about exposing agents as false, the Twenty Committee for the most part utilised <b>less</b> <b>important</b> agents and added words of caution to the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E

50|$|Following a trend {{from around}} the time of Henry I, the chronicler has {{compiled}} a register of historical events from previous sources, and has edited, removed or added events that he perceived to be <b>less</b> or more <b>important,</b> or of which he himself had personal knowledge.|$|R
50|$|Aspects of Chopin's style also prefigure the {{intensely}} lyrical {{and experimental}} style of novelists such as Virginia Woolf and the unsentimental focus on female intellectual and emotional {{growth in the}} novels of Sigrid Undset and Doris <b>Lessing.</b> Chopin's most <b>important</b> stylistic legacy is the detachment of the narrator.|$|R
5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} {{among the five}} AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore <b>less</b> <b>important</b> than {{the risk of having}} an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E
5|$|BioWare's Baldur's Gate {{series was}} no <b>less</b> <b>important,</b> the most {{significant}} D series to be released since the Gold Box era. The games created the most accurate and in-depth D simulation yet, and featured support for up to six-players in cooperative mode. Baldur's Gate (1998) provided an epic story with NPC followers and written dialogue that continued through both titles and two expansion packs. Black Isle produced a more combat-oriented series, Icewind Dale, soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment {{is essentially the same}} on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes <b>less</b> <b>important</b> in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E

40|$|The Renormalization Group is {{the name}} given to a {{technique}} for analyzing the qualitative behaviour of a class of physical systems by iterating a map on the vector space of interactions for the class. In a typical non-rigorous application of this technique one assumes, based on one's physical intuition, that only a certain finite dimensional subspace (usually of dimension three or <b>less)</b> is <b>important.</b> These notes concern a technique for justifying this approximation in a broad class of Fermionic models used in condensed matter and high energy physics...|$|R
50|$|<b>Lessing</b> is <b>important</b> as a {{literary}} critic for his work Laocoon: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry. In this work, he argues against the tendency to take Horace's ut pictura poesis (as painting, so poetry) as prescriptive for literature. In other words, he objected to trying to write poetry using the same devices as one would in painting. Instead, poetry and painting each has its character (the former is extended in time; the latter is extended in space). This is related to Lessing's turn from French classicism to Aristotelian mimesis, discussed above.|$|R
