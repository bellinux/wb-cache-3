40|$|How much <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> do the Chinese consume at present? How much <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> {{will the}} Chinese consume {{in the near}} future? Plausible {{estimates}} that can answer these questions seem to be extremely scarce. On the other hand, there has been strong demand for such estimates by many in trade and government departments {{who are concerned about}} China’s livestock industry development and <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> market potential but are puzzled by the fact that China’s consumption of <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> only accounts for about 40 % of their availability. We believe that the present level of <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption in China is underestimated, which subsequently causes enormous difficulty in projecting China’s future <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption. This paper contributes to the literature by estimating a set of <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption levels for China at present and in the near future. It first derives the present level of <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption in China by establishing a production-consumption balance sheet. Based on this adjusted consumption level, the paper then projects likely scenarios of China’s <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption in 2010 by considering the key factors that may affect China’s future <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in the consumption of <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> is likely to put further pressure on the world’s freshwater resources. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the water footprint of <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> considering different production systems and feed composition per animal type and country. Nearly one-third of the total water footprint of agriculture {{in the world is}} related to the production of <b>animal</b> <b>products.</b> The water footprint of any <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> is larger than the water footprint of crop products with equivalent nutritional value. The average water footprint per calorie for beef is 20 times larger than for cereals and starchy roots. The water footprint per gram of protein for milk, eggs and chicken meat is 1. 5 times larger than for pulses. The unfavorable feed conversion efficiency for <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> is largely responsible for the relatively large water footprint of <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> compared to the crop <b>products.</b> <b>Animal</b> <b>products</b> from industrial systems generally consume and pollute more ground- and surface-water resources than <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> from grazing or mixed systems. The rising global meat consumption and the intensification of animal production systems will put further pressure on the global freshwater resources in the coming decades. The study shows that from a freshwater perspective, <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> from grazing systems have a smaller blue and grey water footprint than products from industrial systems, and that it is more water-efficient to obtain calories, protein and fat through crop <b>products</b> than <b>animal</b> <b>product...</b>|$|R

40|$|Extract] Chapters 4 and 5 {{confirm that}} in both {{rural and urban}} China {{consumption}} of foodgrain has been declining while that of other foods, especially <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> has been increasing. Increased consumption of <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> requires more feedgrains to produce extra animals. Indeed, it has been increasingly recognised that feedgrain demand in China will become the major component of China's total grain demand. Many believe that any future increase in total grain demand in China will be mainly caused by an increasing demand for feedgrains (for example, Garnaut and Ma 1992; Findlay 1998, p. 32; Zhou and Tian 2003). As a derived demand, the demand for feedgrains {{is closely related to}} the demand for <b>animal</b> <b>products.</b> As such, an understanding of <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption trends in China is invaluable. It is imperative to gain reliable infonnation about the current level of <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption, as this is fundamental to predicting the likely consumption of <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> and hence to shed light on likely demand for feedgrains...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that the consumption of farmed <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> must be curtailed to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This paper argues that a careful assessment of the different emissions produced by different actual and potential diets is needed to evaluate whether or not restricting the consumption of farmed <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and if so, by how much. It is also argued {{that the question of}} whether or not the consumption of farmed <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> should be restricted must be addressed in the light of information derived from various sustainability indicators, rather than on the basis of a narrow focus on greenhouse gas emissions. A case study from the UK is used to develop a broader understanding of how dietary modifications might reduce a range of problems associated with the consumption of farmed <b>animal</b> <b>products.</b> It is argued that even more comprehensive studies of the different Global Health Impacts (GHIs) are needed to assess the merits and demerits associated with the consumption of farmed <b>animal</b> <b>products.</b> <b>Animal</b> <b>products</b> Climate change Diet Ecological footprint Ethics...|$|R

40|$|Chinese <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> {{consumption}} behaviour was {{analysed for}} both {{urban and rural}} households using a complete regional consumption dataset that was augmented to include away‐from‐home consumption. Seven <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> expenditure share equations were estimated with an extended Almost Ideal Demand System model. The results suggest that Chinese consumers {{will continue to increase}} their consumption of <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> but that consumption patterns have changed in the 1990 s. A large percentage of household <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> expenditure is still on pork. However, the shares for aquatic and poultry products consumption will increase substantially. As a consequence, the pork expenditure share will be gradually reduced as incomes grow and diet preferences change in both urban and rural households. There are significant differences in <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption preferences across regions of China. As a result, studies that omit regional dummy variables in their demand systems can produce different expenditure and price parameters. The present paper also found that many of the estimates of elasticities and marginal expenditure shares would be rather different if the data ignored consumption away from home.

30|$|Protection against {{biological}} material entering {{a country or region}} through airports is important because, through them, infectious agents can quickly reach exotic destinations and be disseminated. Illegal <b>products</b> of <b>animal</b> origin may contain hazardous infectious agents that can compromise animal and public health. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify associations between possession of illegal <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> in baggage and demographic characteristics of the passengers, as well as characteristics of their travel plans in the two main Brazilian international airports. A total of 457 passengers were divided into two groups: passengers identified as carrying illegal <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> and control. Passengers identified as carrying illegal <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> not stated on the accompanied baggage declaration completed a questionnaire, to aid in profiling. Nationality, origin, age and residency of passengers were analyzed using chi square, logistic regression and odds ratios. Passengers from Eastern Europe were the most likely to enter with <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> as were those aged between 35 and 55  years. When evaluating the departure point, the highest frequency was seen in those coming from Portugal. Passenger group, reasons for travel, amount and type of baggage were available only for passengers identified as carrying illegal <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> noting that they prefer traveling alone, for leisure, bringing few bags. Such information can contribute to the early identification of passengers that have illegal <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> in baggage at Brazilian airports.|$|R
