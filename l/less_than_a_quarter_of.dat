5|$|Ideas {{about the}} nature of law in general were {{beginning}} to change. In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the Triennial Act (1694) (enacted <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.|$|E

5|$|Operation Gisela did {{not achieve}} its {{intended}} outcome. It did not deliver the mass casualties that Schmid hoped for {{and it did}} not disrupt British bombing operations.

5|$|The GRC scheme {{came into}} effect on 1 June 1988. Prior to that date, all {{constituencies}} were Single Member Constituencies (SMCs). Now, the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap. 218, 2008 Rev.

("PEA") states {{that there must}} be at least eight SMCs, and the number of MPs to be returned by all GRCs cannot be <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the total number of MPs. Within those parameters the total number of SMCs and GRCs in Singapore and their boundaries are not fixed but are decided by the Cabinet, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, {{likely due to}} the {{popularity}} of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin. which weighed <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the same value in bronze coins. The immediate aftermath of the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, {{and by the end of}} the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.|$|E
