This study {{examined}} the feasibility of utilizing <b>lignite</b> bottom <b>ash</b> as a partial substitute for ball clay in an insulating brick composition. <b>Lignite</b> bottom <b>ash</b> is a waste byproduct that is high in alumina and silicates and is therefore a candidate material for replacing aluminosilicate minerals such as clay. The <b>lignite</b> bottom <b>ash</b> powder {{was obtained from the}} Mae Moh power plant, Thailand. Small brick specimens were produced by die pressing a mixture of <b>lignite</b> bottom <b>ash,</b> ball clay and aluminum hydroxide. The composition of the mixture contained a fixed amount of aluminum hydroxide, while the <b>lignite</b> bottom <b>ash</b> replaced from 30 to 70 % of the ball clay. The pressed samples were sintered at 1300 ºC for 1 hour in air. The density, porosity, strength and thermal properties of the samples were measured. A microstructural analysis of the sintered brick was also performed. It was found that the porosity of the samples increased from 35 to 45 % with increased <b>lignite</b> bottom <b>ash</b> content. The modulus of rupture and the thermal conductivity of the bricks were reduced with increased <b>lignite</b> bottom <b>ash</b> content, likely due to the increased amount of porosity.

40|$|The {{chemical}} and mineralogical composition of <b>lignite</b> fly <b>ash</b> (FA) varies {{as a function}} of the prevalent conditions in both the processes of power production and lignite mining. The differentiation of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the Greek calcareous <b>lignite</b> fly <b>ash,</b> {{as a function of}} its particle size distribution, is verified in this paper. According to the results of the conducted research, a fine-grained fraction of considerable amount presents properties that obstruct the sustainable exploitation of <b>lignite</b> fly <b>ash</b> in cement industry applications. On the other hand, the same grain fraction (because of its hydraulic properties) can be utilized in other sort of applications, based on different criteria. The coarse-grained fraction (which reflects a low proportion to the total fly ash output) presents the same undesired characteristics as well. However, the intermediate grain fraction [75 - 150 μm] presents the highly desired properties in the field of the utilization of fly ash as pozzolanic additive in the production process of cement. In addition, the mechanism of the formation of the intermediate grain fraction strongly prevents the factors that cause the variation of its quality. It is therefore the optimum part of the whole amount of <b>lignite</b> fly <b>ash,</b> to be utilized as additive in cement manufacturing. The outcomes of this paper will hopefully contribute to the crucial goal of the expansion of the utilization of <b>lignite</b> fly <b>ash</b> in Greek cement industry by proposing a more effective way of using this material, basically by taking advantage of its fundamental {{chemical and}} mineralogical properties...|$|R

30|$|The ash particles, {{when exposed}} to higher {{temperature}} during ashing, undergoes some amount of sintering and to that extent, the shrinkage pattern either gets reduced during shrinkage measurement and/or shifts to higher temperature. The results (Figure  4) indicate that with higher ashing temperature, the <b>lignite</b> <b>ash</b> loses part of its sintering tendency. The initial temperature for sample shrinkage changes from approximately 900 °C (for ashes prepared at 800 °C and 850 °C) to approximately 970 °C (for ash sample prepared at 950 °C). Also, the shrinkage percentage of the 950 °C ash is smaller - less than 15 % up to approximately 1, 050 °C. This would indicate a hypothesis that once the <b>lignite</b> <b>ash</b> undergoes transformations resulting in sintering, its sintering tendency is lowered.

30|$|Lignite {{has emerged}} as an {{additional}} important fuel source for thermal power generation in India. Circulating fluid bed combustion technology is applied considering the impurities, moisture, ash and sulfur content, and wide variations for large units. Lignite mineralogy greatly influences combustion behavior. Agglomeration and clogging/blockage are experienced due to sintering of lignite at lower temperature regime in which circulating fluid bed boilers operate (800 °C to 900 °C). At this low temperature range, the extensive knowledge built for pulverized coal combustion with respect to slagging, fouling, and high-temperature corrosion is not useful. Sintering studies using the heating microscope’s potential are applied for understanding this phenomenon. The gray clay, which occurs as intrusions/thin bands in the lignite mine, is sampled at the mine site and taken up for analysis. Morphology of sintered deposits in the bottom ash is matched with the properties of clay which {{is very close to}} halloysite mineral (kaolinite group). Sintering is avoided by selecting the operating temperature range of combustion on either side of peak sintering temperature in the sample case. With higher ashing temperature, the <b>lignite</b> <b>ash</b> loses part of its sintering tendency. This indicates to a new hypothesis that once the <b>lignite</b> <b>ash</b> undergoes transformations resulting in sintering, its sintering tendency is lowered.

40|$|Large part {{of energy}} demand in Greece {{is covered by}} lignite {{combustion}} in West Macedonia and Peloponnesus. Lignite combustion results in production of, approximately, 14 Mt/year of solid byproducts, such as fly ash (FA) and bottom ash (BA). The quantity of these byproducts {{is going to be}} increased in future because of the low quality of available lignite (lower calorific value). Part of FA (10 - 12 %) produced in Greece is utilized as raw material in cement production while there is no application of BA, mainly because of its high carbon content. This study investigates a new method for utilization of BA, primarily, and FA, afterwards, as raw materials in the production of lightweight aggregates and further utilization of produced aggregates in lightweight aggregate concrete. A two stage process, pelletization and sintering, is applied in BA and FA mixtures. Physical and chemical analyses of Megalopolis <b>lignite</b> <b>ashes</b> are performed (Chapter 2) in purpose of characterization of process raw materials. Furthermore, fundamental theory of pelletization and grate sintering is presented (Chapter 3) in purpose of better understanding of process details. Mixtures of different BA/FA ratio are prepared for sintering tests (Chapter 4). Carbon contained in BA is utilized as the fuel of the process, while high water content of BA is utilized as the primary binding material during pelletization in purpose of pellets formation. Different BA/FA ratios represent different solid fuel percentages in sintering mixtures. This is an important parameter, which strongly affects the completion of the process and the quality of product. Successful completion of sintering process is achieved with minimum solid fuel content (BA carbon) 6. 5 wt% in mixture (Chapter 5). Physical and chemical characterization is performed for products of all different sintering mixtures. The results show that BA carbon content is an important parameter for the production of lightweight aggregates. Porous structure formation inside the sintered pellets, which is responsible for aggregates low weight, is caused by simultaneous development of two different processes: a) production of gases in high temperatures and, b) liquid (glassy) phase formation in the outer part of pellets in the same time period (Chapter 6). ix Formation of either solid state bonds, through diffusion, and/or glassy phase bonds at the points of particles mutual contact are responsible for pellet strength. Lightweight aggregates produced are used in the production of insulating and structural lightweight aggregate concrete specimens and thermal and mechanical tests are performed, respectively. According to tests results artificial lightweight aggregates can be used for insulating and structural purposes. The successful experimental results from the utilization of lignite solid byproducts in the production of LWA offered new opportunities for collaboration of these byproducts with other industrial solid residues, such as red mud (RM) which is produced during bauxite treatment for aluminum production (Chapter 8). In purpose of investigation of collaboration of these different byproducts sintering mixtures are prepared with low RM addition, up to 30 wt%, in <b>lignite</b> <b>ashes</b> mixtures. Physical and chemical characterization is performed for products of all sintering mixtures and they are used for production of concrete specimens. Results show that increase of RM addition brings increase in aggregates weight, while aggregates formed by RM addition up to 20 wt% can be considered as lightweight ones. The results of mechanical strength tests in concrete specimens show that RM addition up to 15 wt% brings increase in aggregates strength. This is the first proposed method for utilization of lignite BA in Greece in the production of lightweight aggregates. Sintering of mixtures of <b>lignite</b> <b>ashes</b> results to the production of lightweight aggregates and the produced aggregates can be used for insulating and structural lightweight aggregate concrete. BA carbon content, which is utilized as the fuel of the process, is an important parameter for lightweight aggregate production and porous structure formation. Furthermore, Megalopolis <b>lignite</b> <b>ashes</b> can be treated in collaboration with other industrial solid byproducts, such as RM for the production of lightweight aggregates of different quality. Finally, the proposed method targets to massive utilization of BA produced in Megalopolis power station. ...|$|R

The samples were leached by NH 4 OAc, HCl, HF and HNO 3 and concentrations of these elements in leachates were determined by ICP-AES and FL AAS methods. Direct element analysis of solid samples was performed by an XRF method. By application of XRD analysis quartz and kaolinite were determined for lignite, while quartz, anhydrite, calcite, mullite, portlandite, lime and anatase were determined for ash samples. Vast majority of Se, Co and Ni was associated with clay minerals both in lignite and in ash samples (the only exception was high percentage of insoluble Ni in a bottom ash sample). Predominant associations for Cr were aluminosilicate minerals and those of organic affinity in both lignite and ash samples. Lead was associated in lignite sample above all with clay minerals, while in {{combustion products}} it was distributed quite evenly among the five leaching procedure stages. Leaching behaviour showed a prevalent HCl solubility for lignite and <b>lignite</b> <b>ash</b> samples indicating probably abundance of Asbearing sulphides, oxides or arsenates. Most of Cu was extracted by HCl and HF from all the samples teste...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{influence}} of storage conditions on the quality of conventional fly ashes which are produced by combustion of <b>lignite.</b> These <b>ashes</b> were stockpiled for long time. A borehole for sampling was made in the fly ash stock-pile. Total depth of the borehole was 20 m. Samples of fly ashes taken from every single meter were analyzed and next mechanical properties and the volume stability of materials containing these fly ashes were tested. The quality of fly ashes especially with respect to the possibility to use them as components of pastes, mortars and concretes as pozzolanic admixture or fine filler was evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{formation of}} low-permeability hardpan layers by mixing limestone or <b>lignite</b> fly <b>ash</b> with oxidized sulphidic tailings was investigated under actual field conditions. Field tests covering {{an area of}} 900 m 2 were implemented in Lavrion, Greece. The field testing area was divided into four equal testpads, which were filled with: (a) Lavrion sulphidic tailings without any amendment (control test); (b) sulphidic tailings covered by a 60 -cm-thick layer of tailings homogeneously mixed with 75 kg/t limestone; (c) sulphidic tailings - 75 kg/t limestone mixture having a thickness of 150 cm; and (d) sulphidic tailings covered by a 30 -cm-thick layer of tailings homogeneously mixed with 180 kg/t <b>lignite</b> fly <b>ash.</b> After four years of field test operations, cemented layers or hardpan, exhibiting increased resistance to penetration, were formed in the testpads. The hardpan layer in the control test was observed {{at a depth of}} 65 cm and had a thickness of 30 cm. Limestone and fly ash addition to the oxidized tailings resulted in the formation of hardpan layers at depths of 35 cm and 15 cm respectively. The samples collected from the hardpan layers had paste pH higher than 4. 5, as compared to pH 2. 0 of the oxidized tailings. Limestone was proved to be more effective than fly ash in neutralizing the acidity and maintaining near-neutral pH conditions within the hardpan. On the other hand, the hardpan samples collected from limestone and fly-ash-amended testpads exhibited similar hydraulic conductivity values in the order of 10 - 6 m/sec. © 2007 EPP Publications Ltd...|$|R
