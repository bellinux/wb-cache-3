5|$|In both paintings, Saint Francis of Assisi kneels by a rock as he {{receives}} the stigmata {{that were to}} stay on his body until his death. The composition is tonally similar to Giotto's 1295–1300 Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, but more grounded in earthly reality. The design is a mostly faithful representation of the original Franciscan texts, but differs in that Francis does not <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> towards Christ.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E
25|$|In a cheek kiss, both persons <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> {{and either}} lightly touch cheek with cheek or lip with cheek. Generally the gesture is {{repeated}} {{with the other}} cheek, or more, alternating cheeks. Depending on country and situation, the number of kisses is usually one, two, three or four. Hand-shaking or hugging may also take place.|$|E
60|$|Thomas Rooper now <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{with his}} elbows on his knees without smoking, and Asaph Scantle <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> with {{his elbows on}} his knees without smoking. And thus they remained, saying nothing to each other, for the space of some ten minutes.|$|R

25|$|Some also study patient {{satisfaction}} data associated with pain. Retaining the {{posterior cruciate ligament}} (PCL) {{has been shown to}} be beneficial for patients. Removal of the PCL has been shown to reduce the maximal force that the individual can place on that knee. Typically individuals who have the PCL removed will <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> while climbing in order to maximize the force of the quadriceps.|$|E
25|$|The Mk.4 {{seat was}} {{designed}} as an improved, lightweight version of earlier Martin-Baker seats for installation {{in a range of}} lighter, smaller aircraft types. Improvements included a single combined seat and parachute quick release fastener (QRF) and a snubber mechanism to allow crews to <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> without loosening the harness. The first successful ejection using a Mk.4 seat took place in March 1957, the aircraft involved being a Fiat G.91.|$|E
25|$|When the {{shooting}} began, the terrorists told their hostages to <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> {{in the theater}} seats and cover their heads behind the seats. Hostages reported that {{some people in the}} audience fell asleep, and some of the gunmen put on respirators. As the terrorists and hostages alike began to fall unconscious, several of the female terrorists made a dash for the balcony but passed out before they reached the stairs. They were later found shot dead. Two of the Alpha Group were also overcome by the gas.|$|E

25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} {{toward the front}} of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> to gain more speed, and lean on back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.|$|E
25|$|Curvature of the back, called roaching, {{might be}} caused by patella {{problems}} with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> onto the forelegs. This might also just be a structural fault with little consequence to the dog. Many Bostons cannot tolerate excessive heat and also extremely cold weather, due to the shortened muzzle, so hot or cold weather combined with demanding exercise can bring harm to a Boston Terrier. A sensitive digestive system is also typical of Boston Terriers. In the absence of good quality, proper diet, flatulence {{is associated with the}} breed. Their large and prominent eyes make Boston Terriers prone to corneal ulcers.|$|E
25|$|The exaggerated walk, {{with one}} hand on {{the small of his back}} and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, {{allowing}} the left hand to swing free with the gait. (Edmund Morris, in his biography The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.) Groucho exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedy effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} the informality {{suggested}} by the cigarette, University of Tennessee photography professor Baldwin Lee {{points out that the}} photo was carefully planned and posed. According to Lee, Westcott instructed Oppenheimer to sit [...] "slightly askance" [...] and to <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> slightly, and then he took the photograph from a low vantage point that [...] "makes the viewer physically look up at the man," [...] thus enhancing the subject's perceived importance. Lee's critique also notes that Oppenheimer's gaze {{does not appear to be}} directed anywhere in the room, but instead is aimed at [...] "something very distant and something only he can see." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson dislikes {{saying his}} character's catchphrase ("I don't believe it!") and only {{performs}} {{the line for}} charity events for a small fee. This became a joke in the actor's guest appearance as himself in the Father Ted episode [...] "The Mainland", where Ted annoys him by constantly repeating his catchphrase. The situation was conceived when Father Ted writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews sat behind Wilson at a performance of Le Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall. They considered how [...] "tasteless and wrong" [...] {{it would be to}} <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> to him every time that an acrobat did a stunt and yell the catchphrase, and then they realised that that's exactly what their fictional priests would do. This was also played upon when Wilson made a guest appearance on the comedy TV quiz show Shooting Stars, in which Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer purposefully misquoted his catchphrase by referring to him as [...] "Richard 'I don't believe you' Wilson".|$|E
500|$|Elephants {{are known}} to {{communicate}} with seismics, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear. When detecting seismic signals, the animals <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> and put more weight on their larger front feet; {{this is known as}} the [...] "freezing behaviour". Elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in marine mammals like toothed whales and sirenians. A unique sphincter-like muscle around the ear canal constricts the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals. Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. An individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances. When detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger from predators, elephants enter a defensive posture and family groups will pack together. Seismic waveforms produced by locomotion appear to travel distances of up to [...] while those from vocalisations travel [...]|$|E

500|$|In the 19-minute {{music video}} for [...] "Bad"—directed by Martin Scorsese—Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not {{previously}} {{seen in his}} work. He occasionally grabbed or touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Oprah in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he replied, [...] "I think it happens subliminally" [...] and he described it as something that was not planned, but rather, as something that was compelled by the music. [...] "Bad" [...] garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics; Time magazine described it as [...] "infamous". The video also featured Wesley Snipes; in the future Jackson's videos would often feature famous cameo roles. For the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] video, Jackson experimented with an anti-gravity lean where the performer leans forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this move live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe that locks the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to <b>lean</b> <b>forward.</b> They were granted [...] for the device. Although the music video for [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was not officially released in the US, in 1989 it was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards; the same year it won a Golden Lion Award {{for the quality of}} the special effects used in its production. In 1990, [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.|$|E
2500|$|Humans {{use one of}} {{two types}} of {{defecation}} postures to defecate: squatting, or sitting. People use the squatting postures when using squat toilets or when defecating in the open {{in the absence of}} toilets. The sitting posture on the other hand is used in toilets that have a pedestal or [...] "throne", where users generally <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> or sit at 90-degrees to a toilet seat.|$|E
2500|$|The large canvas {{is almost}} square in format and unusually monumental for a beach view. The life-size women {{depicted}} are Sorolla's wife Clotilde and his eldest daughter Maria. Sorolla painted the scenery at the Playa de El Cabanyal beach {{in his hometown}} of Valencia. Both women <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> slightly, so that they appear to move toward the right edge. While the wife stands straight, aligned to the edge, the daughter Maria has slightly turned her head to her right shoulder and is looking towards the viewer.|$|E

2500|$|To {{lengthen}} the canter, {{the rider}} uses {{his or her}} legs against the horse's sides in rhythm with the gait. The leg aids should be applied as the hind legs are engaging. This {{is the time when}} the rider's seat moves forward in the canter stride. Additionally, the rider should engage the seat {{at the same time as}} the leg aids are used, [...] "rolling" [...] is forward with the canter motion. Contact may be lightened, but should not be dropped. The rider should not <b>lean</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During a game, the Yell Leaders {{signal the}} crowd to start a yell by {{flashing}} pass backs. [...] Once the signal is passed throughout the crowd, the Yell Leaders give the signal for {{the crowd to}} [...] "hump it," [...] or <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> with hands just above their knees, and the yell begins. [...] The theory behind [...] "humpin' it" [...] is that it aligns the back, neck and throat in the proper position to maximize the noise. [...] They also use pass backs to signal when to sing the various school songs, {{in much the same}} way as cheerleaders lead songs at other schools.|$|E
2500|$|Diamond's dances were {{characterized}} by little upper-body movement and rapid footwork. He left his upper body relaxed so as to bring attention to his feet. One characteristic step was to <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> and dangle his hands loosely, look to the side, and slide across the stage with a heel–toe alternation. Noah M. Ludlow, a theatre manager, wrote that [...] "He could twist his feet and legs, while dancing, into more fantastic forms than I ever witnessed before or since in any human being." [...] His playbills proclaimed Diamond a performer of [...] "the greatest display of heel and toe genus [...] ever witnessed" [...] and that [...] "Now de heels, if dares any music in you, its [...] got to come out". Diamond's rapid footwork rapped out percussive patterns on the floor. He advertised that he could create music with his heels.|$|E
