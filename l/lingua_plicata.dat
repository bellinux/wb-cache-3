40|$|Abstract Ectopic liver {{is a very}} {{uncommon}} developmental anomaly that predisposes to {{the development}} of hepatocellular carcinoma. We describe the second documented case of a hepatocellular carcinoma developing in the primary liver of a patient with a rare and uncharacterized genetic symptom complex. Also present was the largest ectopic liver ever reported, measuring 12 cm in diameter which contained a solitary focus of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary hepatocellular carcinoma is believed to have arisen in the native liver from a hepatic adenoma that was diagnosed 15 years earlier. The patient's uncharacterised condition featured prominent thick, yellow skin over the dorsum of the fingers, and was associated with follicular hyperkeratosis, abnormal plantar creases, digital clubbing, misshaped ears, a <b>lingua</b> <b>plicata</b> and an angioleiomyolipoma of the right kidney. This unique case of hepatocellular carcinoma arising from liver cell adenoma in a patient with an uncharacterised condition featuring a large ectopic liver invites discussion of the role of local factors in carcinogenesis in the parent liver but not the ectopic liver. It also underlines the imperative ongoing need for clinical autopsies. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background. Granulomatous {{cheilitis}} {{is a rare}} chronic {{swelling of}} the lip due to granulomatous inflammation. Miescher cheilitis is the term used when the granulomatous changes are confined to the lip. Miescher cheilitis is generally regarded as a monosymptomatic form of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (SMR). SMR {{is characterized by a}} triad, including orofacial swelling, facial palsy and <b>lingua</b> <b>plicata.</b> Aetiology of disease is unknown. Virus infection, several other infectious conditions, allergic reactions and Crohn’s disease may be involved in the aetiology of SMR. Patients and methods. This paper describes a case of 59 -yearold male patient with granulomatous cheilitis. Because of swelling of the lip and the cheek allergic patch and prick tests were performed. All tests were negative. Skin biopsy of the affected tissue showed granulomas inflammatory cell infiltration in the dermis. Other systemic granulomatous diseases such a sarcoidosis and tuberculosis were excluded. Results. A systemic therapy with sulphonyldianilyne 50  mg daily was started. After one year a swelling is less visible. Conclusions. SMR needs to be recognized by the clinician with persistent swelling of the lip, chin and cheeks. Their duration is short at first, subsiding completely in a few hours or days, and thus simulating angio-oedema. After recurrent attacks at irregular intervals, the oedema becomes persistent. Full confirmation of the diagnosis of SMR requires a histological examination. </p...|$|E

40|$|Melkersson–Rosenthal {{syndrome}} as an early manifestation of mixed {{connective tissue}} disease Dorota Jasinska * and Jerzy Boczon Purpose of review: We aim {{to illustrate the}} potential viability of MCTD as an underlying aetiology of Melkersson– Rosenthal syndrome. The case is probably the first description available {{in the literature of}} the Melkersson–Rosenthal as an early manifestation of mixed connective tissue disease. Recent findings: The Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome consists of a triad of recurrent lip and/or face swelling, fis-sured tongue, and intermittent facial palsy. Mixed connective tissue disease is a multisystemic disorder with overlap-ping features of systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis, and is differentiated from them by a high titer of antibodies to ribonucleoprotein. The paper presents a case report of Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome with an onset in childhood that derived from vasculitis {{that turned out to be}} an early manifestation of mixed connec-tive tissue disease. We used MRI to evaluate patient’s brain structure and Immunoblot Ena Profil 1 test to test serum autoantibodies level. The patient has a typical for Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome triad of symptoms: bilateral facial nerve palsy, <b>lingua</b> <b>plicata</b> and facial oedema. Both TC and MRI of the head show no changes as well as laboratory tests except Anti-SS-A (Anti-Ro) and Anti-RNP autoantibody serum level that was highly positive. Summary: Neurological involvement of the MCTD usually includes, according to the frequency of the occurrence, trigeminal neuralgia, headaches, sensorineural hearing, cerebral haemorrhage, transverse myelitis, cauda equina syn-drome, retinal vasculitis, progressive multifocal encephalopathy, and demyelinating neuropathy. For clinical practice it is important to remember that Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome can also be the neurological manifestation of MCTD, especially when accompanied by other systemic symptoms...|$|E
40|$|El Síndrome de Melkersson-Rosenthal es una entidad rara caracterizada por edema granulomatoso orofacial, episodios de parálisis facial y lengua plegada. La presentación monosintomática de labios se denomina queilitis granulomatosa de Miescher. Clásicamente se ha tratado con múltiples medicamentos con respuesta parcial o insatisfactoria, por lo que el tratamiento ideal es el quirúrgico, que obtiene resultados permanentes y permite al paciente relaciones interpersonales satisfactorias. Sin embargo la corrección propuesta por los diferentes autores disminuye el grosor del labio a expensas de dejar un estigma de deformidad de labio "ondulado" ya que no se acorta el labio en sentido transverso y únicamente se adelgaza. El presente artículo {{describe}} el tratamiento propuesto para corregir esta deformidad mediante la resección en bloque del tercio medio del labio superior. Además hace referencia a la afectación del cuello en el caso que presentamos, no descrita en la bibliografía actual al respecto, que daba al paciente un aspecto de cuello de "iguana", y que fue corregida mediante resección en huso y liposucción.

The surgical posterior reduction cheiloplastry removing mucosa and submucosa all along the lip proposed by several authors, gives the lips an stigma of the " ruffle" aspect; this is {{because there is no}} shortening of the total length of the previously enlarged lip because of the granulomatous swelling. We report the correction of this deformity by total thickness resection of the middle third of the lip which resolve this deformity. In this patient, we also report the involve of the neck which gave him the deformity of "iguana neck", resolved by direct resection and liposuction.
