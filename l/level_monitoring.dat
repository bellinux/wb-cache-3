25|$|Prior to the accident, {{the maximum}} {{permissible}} dose for Japanese nuclear workers was 100mSv in any one year, but on 15 March 2011, the Japanese Health and Labor Ministry enforced the permitted 250mSv limit, {{in light of the}} situation at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. However, the workers at Fukushima plant declined the elevated 250mSv limit and kept adopting the previous 100mSv. Tokyo Enesys, a TEPCO's subsidiary, adopts 80mSv to manage the radiation <b>level</b> <b>monitoring</b> with some buffer. Kandenko, Kajima and Taisei Corporation adopted 100mSv. Hitachi rewrote internal rule as 200mSv. TEPCO decided to move workers around 200mSv to low-radiated site while its subsidiaries, Tokyo Enesys and Kandenko, adopted limits around 100mSv. Over 30 workers were radiated beyond 100 mSv by 23 April 2011.|$|E
500|$|Devon County Council {{agreed to}} pay for repairs to the canal, in time for its 200th anniversary and on 7 July 2013, a 3 million pound project to repair the breach, began with an {{official}} turf cutting. The repairs included rebuilding the failed embankment and raising the level {{to reduce the risk}} of overtopping in the future, and further improvements to water management.The canal was lined with an impermeable material along the length of the embankment. In addition a water <b>level</b> <b>monitoring</b> and alarm system has been installed. This system has sensors in Tiverton and Burlescombe and alerts the canal rangers and Devon County Council if the levels become exceptionally high. Refilling of the breached section began on 4 March 2014 using a [...] sluice gate at Rock Bridge which gradually filled the empty section and the canal was officially re-opened on 19 March 2014 by chairman of Devon County Council Councillor Bernard Hughes. [...] Six narrow boats, led by Chairmen of Halberton Parish Council, Councillor Ken Browse, were the first to travel on the new section.|$|E

500|$|The most {{laborious}} effects sequences {{took place}} inside Spacedock; months were spent completing the station's interior shots. The effects crew tested different looks {{to make sure}} the dock interior seemed appropriately vast. [...] "We found the interior demanded some degree of atmospheric haze, even though there probably wouldn't be any in space," [...] Farrar said. To create a slightly degraded look, the crew used blue color gels for lights and shot through smoke for fill shots. They switched to diffusion filters for light passes, as using smoke for longer shots would have required time-consuming smoke <b>level</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Due to difference in the scales of the dock and ship models, it was impossible to film the Excelsior and Enterprise inside the set. Opening the dock's space doors was problematic because the lights illuminating the inside of the dock from the exterior had to be hidden from the camera to prevent lens flares. Massive fans were used to keep equipment cool and prevent the lights from melting or warping the dock's interior artwork. The realism of the dock scenes was heightened by live action footage of a cafeteria, with windows overlooking the dock interior. The cafeteria was a set built at ILM and filled with 40extras in front of a bluescreen so that the dock and Enterprise could be composited in later; matte paintings extended the ceiling of the set.|$|E
2500|$|Tank <b>level</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{is another}} key {{functionality}} often provided in modern cargo control rooms. [...] One aspect of tank <b>level</b> <b>monitoring</b> is overfill alarms, which sound throughout the ship when cargo levels exceed the ship's design specifications. [...] Many systems allow {{the person in}} charge to monitor tank levels at all tank levels. [...] Tank <b>level</b> <b>monitoring</b> allows the person in charge to take early action to avoid oil spills, especially when loading the ship. [...] Tank level information is often sent to computers that calculate hull stresses such as shear forces and bending moments.|$|E

2500|$|Cargo control rooms {{began to}} appear on U.S.-flag tankers in the mid-1960s. [...] Prior to this time, valves were {{operated}} manually on deck by reach rods and liquid levels were monitored by a roving watch consisting of the mate and seamen on watch. [...] The use of computers in the cargo control room began in the 1980s. [...] As technology developed, computerized systems began to centralize tasks such as cargo control per se, tank <b>level</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and real-time computation of hull stress information in the cargo control room.|$|E
2500|$|Plasma <b>level</b> <b>monitoring</b> of {{vancomycin}} {{is necessary}} {{due to the}} drug's biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection. Vancomycin activity {{is considered to be}} time-dependent; that is, antimicrobial activity depends on the duration that the serum drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [...] of the target organism. Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity; indeed, concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which therapeutic drug monitoring [...] is warranted include: patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered pharmacokinetic parameters, patients on haemodialysis, patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function. In such cases, trough concentrations are measured.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 March at 14:46 JST, Unit 1 scrammed (shut off power-producing {{nuclear fission}} chain reactions) {{successfully}} {{in response to}} the earthquake though evacuated workers reported violent shaking and burst pipes within the reactor building. At 15:37, all generated electrical power was lost following the tsunami leaving only emergency batteries, able to run some of the monitoring and control systems. It was later learned that Unit 1's batteries were damaged and unavailable following the tsunami. At 15:42, TEPCO declared a [...] "Nuclear Emergency Situation" [...] for Units 1 and 2 because [...] "reactor water coolant injection could not be confirmed for the emergency core cooling systems."
