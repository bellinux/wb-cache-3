40|$|Context. Filament <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillations</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} in Hα observations of the solar disk. Aims. We intend to find {{an example of the}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillations</b> of a prominence, where the magnetic dip can be seen directly, and examine the restoring force of this type of oscillations. Methods. We carry out a multiwavelength data analysis of the active region prominence oscillations above the western limb on 2007 February 8. In addition, we perform a one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Results. Our analysis of high-resolution observations performed by Hinode/SOT indicate that the prominence, seen as a concave-inward shape in lower-resolution extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images, consists of many concave-outward threads, which is indicative of magnetic dips. After being injected into the dip region, a bulk of prominence material started to oscillate for more than 3. 5 h, with the period of 52 min. The oscillation decayed with time, on the decay timescale 133 min. Our hydrodynamic simulation can reproduce the oscillation period, but the damping timescale in the simulation is 1. 5 times as long as the observations. Conclusions. The results clearly show the prominence <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillations</b> around the dip of the prominence and our study suggests that the restoring force of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillations</b> might be the gravity. Radiation and heat conduction are insufficient to explain the decay of the oscillations. Other mechanisms, such as wave leakage and mass accretion, have to be considered. The possible relation between the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillations</b> and the later eruption of a prominence thread, as well as a coronal mass ejection (CME), is also discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

For small and intermediate curvature radii and moderate to large density contrast between the prominence and the corona, the main restoring force is the solar gravity. In this full wave description of the oscillation a simple expression for the oscillation frequencies is derived in which the pressure-driven term introduces a small correction. We have also found that the normal modes are almost independent of the geometry of the hot regions of the tube.

5000|$|In plasma physics, an ion {{acoustic}} wave is one type of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the ions and electrons in a plasma, much like {{acoustic wave}}s traveling in neutral gas. However, because the waves propagate through positively charged ions, {{ion acoustic wave}}s can interact with their electromagnetic fields, as well as simple collisions. In plasmas, ion acoustic waves are frequently referred to as acoustic waves or even just sound waves. They commonly govern the evolution of mass density, for instance due to pressure gradients, on time scales longer than the frequency corresponding to the relevant length scale. Ion acoustic waves can occur in an unmagnetized plasma or in a magnetized plasma parallel to the magnetic field. For a single ion species plasma {{and in the long}} wavelength limit, the waves are dispersionless (...) with a speed given by (see derivation below)where [...] is Boltzmann's constant, [...] is the mass of the ion, [...] is its charge, [...] is the temperature of the electrons and [...] is the temperature of the ions. Normally γe is taken to be unity, {{on the grounds that the}} thermal conductivity of electrons is large enough to keep them isothermal on the time scale of ion acoustic waves, and γi is taken to be 3, corresponding to one-dimensional motion. In collisionless plasmas, the electrons are often much hotter than the ions, in which case the second term in the numerator can be ignored.|$|E

40|$|Solar {{prominences}} {{are subject}} to both field-aligned (longitudinal) and transverse oscillatory motions, as evidenced by {{an increasing number of}} observations. Large-amplitude longitudinal motions provide valuable information on the geometry of the filament channel magnetic structure that supports the cool prominence plasma against gravity. Our pendulum model, in which the restoring force is the gravity projected along the dipped field lines of the magnetic structure, best explains these oscillations. However, several factors can influence the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillations,</b> potentially invalidating the pendulum model. Aims. The aim of this work is to study the influence of large-scale variations in the magnetic field strength along the field lines, i. e., variations of the cross-sectional area along the flux tubes supporting prominence threads. Methods. We studied the normal modes of several flux tube configurations, using linear perturbation analysis, to assess the influence of different geometrical parameters on the oscillation properties. Results. We found that the influence of the symmetric and asymmetric expansion factors on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillations</b> is small. Conclusions.

It was only when attempting the tests from the same height as de Havilland, 4,000 ft, that he discovered that in a Mach 0.88 dive from that altitude the aircraft suffered from a high-g pitch oscillation at several hertz (Hz). [...] "The ride was smooth, then suddenly it all went to pieces ... as the plane porpoised wildly my chin hit my chest, jerked hard back, slammed forward again, repeated it over and over, flogged by the awful whipping of the plane ...". Remembering the drill he had often practised, Brown managed to pull back gently on both stick and throttle and the motion; [...] "... ceased {{as quickly as it}} had started". He believed that he survived the test flight partly because he was a shorter man, de Havilland having suffered a broken neck possibly due to the violent oscillation. Test instrumentation on Brown's flight recorded during the oscillations accelerations of +4 and −3g's at 3 Hz. Brown described the DH 108 as; [...] "A killer. Nasty stall.

5000|$|When AuNP {{are exposed}} to NIR light, the {{oscillating}} electromagnetic field of the light causes the free electrons of the AuNP to collectively coherently oscillate. Changing {{the size and shape}} of AuNP, changes the wavelength that gets absorbed. A desired wavelength would be between 700-1000 nm because biological tissue is optically transparent at these wavelengths. While all AuNP properties are sensitive to change in their shape and size, Au nanorods properties are extremely sensitive to any change in any of their dimensions regarding their length and wide or their aspect ratio. When light is shown on a metal NP, the NP forms a dipole oscillation along the direction of the electric field. When the oscillation reaches its maximum, this frequency is called the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). AuNR have two SPR spectrum bands: one in the NIR region caused by its <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillation</b> which tends to be stronger with a longer wavelength and one in the visible region caused by the transverse electronic oscillation which tends to be weaker with a shorter wavelength. The SPR characteristics account for the increase in light absorption for the particle. As the AuNR aspect ratio increases, the absorption wavelength is redshifted and light scattering efficiency is increased. [...] The electrons excited by the NIR lose energy quickly after absorption via electron-electron collisions, and as these electrons relax back down, the energy is released as a phonon that then heats the environment of the AuNP which in cancer treatments would be the cancerous cells. This process is observed when a laser has a continuous wave onto the AuNP. Pulsed laser light beams generally results in the AuNP melting or ablation of the particle. Continues wave lasers take minutes rather than a single pulse time for a pulsed laser, continues wave lasers are able to heat larger areas at once.|$|E

Previous studies are mainly based on the one-dimensional rigid flux tube model with a single magnetic dip.

Following the previous work, we intend to investigate the kinematics of the filament <b>longitudinal</b> <b>oscillations</b> when two threads are magnetically connected, which is done by solving one-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic equations with the numerical code MPI-AMRVAC. Two different types of perturbations are considered, and the difference from previous works resulting from the filament thread-thread interaction is investigated. We find that even with the inclusion of the thread-thread interaction, the oscillation period is modified weakly, by at most 20 % compared to the traditional pendulum model with one thread. However, the damping timescale is significantly affected by the thread-thread interaction. Hence, we should take it into account when applying the consistent seismology to the filaments where two threads are magnetically connected.
