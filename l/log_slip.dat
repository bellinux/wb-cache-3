50|$|After a {{short time}} in the air, McCamley {{eventually}} located Bjelke-Petersen slumped over a <b>log,</b> <b>slipping</b> {{in and out of}} consciousness and again alerted the police to his location. Bjelke-Petersen had somehow walked to some cattle yards, despite being seriousy injured. In the accident, he sustained a punctured lung, broken elbow, and broken ribs. He spent several weeks in the intensive care unit at the Rockhampton Base Hospital.|$|R
60|$|It flashed upon me that I {{had passed}} the slide or declivity on the hillside, where <b>logs</b> were <b>slipped</b> down into the valley, and I {{inferred}} that Johnson's business was cutting timber for the mill.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2015, {{three people}} were injured when the White Water <b>Log</b> Flume <b>slipped</b> on its track, and later the same month a 58-year-old woman and three {{teenagers}} [...] were forced to walk {{down from the top}} of the ride after it stuck at the highest point.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Steam Generator of the PFBR is a {{vertical}} heat exchanger with sodium flowing {{in the shell}} side, and water in tube side. The tubes have an expansion bend to accommodate the thermal expansions and periodic in-service inspection is {{to be carried out}} to check the reduction in tube wall thickness and crack using Eddy Current Probes. Cable Pusher Module is used to insert and retract the probe in to the tube having 23 meter length. This paper presents the detailed design and development of CPM which includes the control system, software and mechanical aspects. CPM transmits the parameters like odometer reading, slip, velocity and time of inspection through serial interface. Graphical User Interface is developed using VB 6. 0 Compiler for data <b>logging.</b> <b>Slip</b> of the motor is plotted for the tube length and this suggests an optimum design for the mechanical pulley arrangement of CPM...|$|R
60|$|Now this is {{just what}} Grandfather Frog was trying to do. At least, {{he was trying to}} pull the fish out. He hadn't the least desire in the world to try {{swallowing}} it again. In fact, he felt just then as if he never, never wanted to see another fish so long as he lived. But Grandfather Frog's hands are not made for grasping slippery things, and the tail of a fish is very slippery indeed. He tried first with one hand, then with the other, and at last with both. It was of no use at all. He just couldn't budge that fish. He couldn't cough it up, because it had gone too far down for that. The more he clawed at that waving tail with his hands, the funnier he looked, and the harder Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink and Jerry Muskrat laughed. They made such a noise that Spotty the Turtle, who had been taking a sun-bath on the end of an old <b>log,</b> <b>slipped</b> into the water and started {{to see what it was}} all about.|$|R
6000|$|The trail (it {{was not a}} road) {{ran like}} a graceful furrow over the hills, around little lakes covered deep with snow, through {{tamarack}} swamps where the tracks of wild things thickened, over ridges of tall pine clear of brush, and curving everywhere amid stumps, where dismantled old shanties marked {{the site of the}} older logging camps. Sometimes they met teams going to the store. Sometimes they crossed logging roads--wide, smooth tracks artificially iced, down which mountainous loads of <b>logs</b> were <b>slipping,</b> creaking and groaning. Sometimes they heard the dry click-clock of the woodsmen's axes, or the crash of falling trees deep in the wood. When they reached the first camp, Ridgeley pulled up the steaming horses at the door and shouted, [...] "Hello, the camp!" ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the cars}} passed {{he saw the}} ballast creep about {{the ends of the}} ties, which reached {{to the edge of the}} descent, and in places small streams of gravel had run down, leaving hollows round the timber. The harsh jolting {{indicated}} the consequences, but he knew that in the West railroads are built as fast as possible and made safe afterwards. For that matter, he had often run risks that would have daunted engineers used to conservative English methods. In the meantime, the speed was slackening, and by and by the harsh tolling of the locomotive bell echoed among the pines. Tents, iron huts, and rude <b>log</b> shacks <b>slipped</b> past; men in muddy slickers drew back against the bank, and then the train stopped.|$|R
60|$|Then {{it dawned}} on {{him that he was}} {{on the wrong side of}} the channel and could not get across. When he fell into the mud he was not far from the bank, but he had gone deep and it was unthinkable that he should venture farther out. The half-liquid mire would suck him down. Still the tide was rising and he could not stop on the flat. After a few moments, another thing struck him; when he crossed, the bridge, {{although}} narrow and slippery, was firm, but now it had given way as soon as it bore his weight. The <b>log</b> had <b>slipped</b> down, or broken, suddenly. He wondered whether it had been meant to break. A few strokes with the cutlass the half-breeds carried would be enough, and he could not have struggled out had he dropped where the mud was deep.|$|R
60|$|He {{said the}} marks {{had been made}} by a trunk with {{branches}} broken short; one could see where it had rolled into the stream. The ravine was steep, but the other <b>logs</b> had not <b>slipped</b> down; the missing trunk had been helped on its way. In one place, the top had been lifted; in another, a pole had been pushed under the butt. Some of the gravel was scratched, {{as if it had been}} trodden by nailed boots. A man using a lever would push it back like that.|$|R
50|$|Crowhurst {{left from}} Teignmouth, Devon, {{on the last}} day {{permitted}} by the rules: 31 October 1968. He encountered immediate problems with his boat, his equipment, and his lack of open-ocean sailing skills and experience. In the first few weeks he was making less than half of his planned speed. He did not have the skill to sail the complex tri-hulled boat at anything near its optimum speed while navigating a good course. According to his logs, he gave himself only 50/50 odds of surviving the trip, assuming {{that he was able to}} complete some of the boat's safety features before reaching the dangerous Southern Ocean. Crowhurst was thus faced with the choice of either quitting the race and facing financial ruin and humiliation or continuing to an almost certain death in his unseaworthy, disappointing boat. Over the course of November and December 1968, the hopelessness of his situation pushed him into an elaborate deception. He shut down his radio with a plan to loiter in the South Atlantic for several months while the other boats sailed the Southern Ocean, falsify his navigation <b>logs,</b> then <b>slip</b> back in for the return leg to England. As last-place finisher, he assumed his false logs would not receive the same scrutiny as those of the winner.|$|R

40|$|By {{integrating}} {{effects of}} microscopic interactions between statisticaly selfsimilar fault surfaces, we succeeded in deriving a slip- and time-dependent fault constitutive law that rationally unifies the slip-dependent {{law and the}} rate- and state-dependent law (Aochi and Matsu'ura, 1998 [1]). In this constitutive law the slip-weakening results from the abrasion of surface asperities that proceeds irreversibly with fault slip. On the other hand, the restoration of shear strength after the arrest of fault slip results from the adhesion of surface asperities that proceeds with contact time. The slip- and timedependent law can explain three basic experimental results; slip-weakening in high-speed <b>slip,</b> <b>log</b> t-healing in stationary contact, and velocity-weakening in steady state slip. Another interesting property expected from the unified constitutive law is the gradual increase of the critical weakening displacement D c with stationary contact time.

40|$|Surface {{deformation}} {{associated with}} the 27 August 1931 earthquake near Mach in Baluchistan is quantified from spirit-leveling data and from detailed structural sections of the region interpreted from seismic reflection data constrained by numerous well <b>logs.</b> Mean <b>slip</b> on the west dipping Dezghat/Bannh fault system amounted to 1. 2 m on a 42 km x 72 km thrust plane with slip locally attaining 3. 2 m up dip of an inferred locking line at approximately 9 km depth. Slip also occurred at depths below the interseismic locking line. In contrast, negligible slip occurred in the 4 km near the interseismic locking line. The absence of slip here in the 4 years following the earthquake suggests that elastic energy there must either dissipate slowly in the interseismic cycle, or that a slip deficit remains, pending its release in a large future earthquake. Elastic models of the earthquake cycle in this fold and thrust belt suggest that slip on the frontal thrust fault is reduced {{by a factor of}} 2 to 8 compared to that anticipated from convergence of the hinterland, a partitioning process that is presumably responsible for thickening of the fold and thrust belt at the expense of slip on the frontal thrust. Near the latitude of Quetta, GPS measurements indicate that convergence is approximately 5 mm/yr. Hence the minimum renewal time between earthquakes with 1. 2 -m mean displacement should be as little as 240 years. However, when the partitioning of fold belt convergence to frontal thrust slip is taken into account the minimum renewal time may exceed 2000 years...|$|R
