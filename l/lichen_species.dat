5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 <b>lichen</b> <b>species.</b> The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E

The comparative historical background studies concerned with epiphytic lichens {{in relation to}} environmental conditions were related. Five variables close related with the distance was analysed within this study, as follow: (1) in close correlation with the distance, the taxonomic analysis reveals a major significance regarding the dominant roll of the genera with a low epiphytic lichens diversity, within the Andronache Forest, unlike Cernica and Pustnicul Forest where, the number of genera is do not significantly owing increasing species number; (2) regarding the substrate, epiphytic <b>lichens</b> <b>species</b> from all investigated forests prefer trees with a roughly rhytidoma. Trees sampled in a great deal belong to the Quercus genus with a roughly rhytidoma facilitating a good growing of epiphytic <b>lichens</b> <b>species</b> because keeps for a {{long periods of time}} a high degree of humidity; (3) the analysis of toxi-tolerance degree has shown how the sensitive epiphytic <b>lichens</b> <b>species</b> to pollution is increasing depending on the distance; (4) autsozological categories are marked in a great deal by a great distance from an urban Bucharest area. Thus, the number of rare and disappearing <b>lichens</b> <b>species</b> is increasing direct proportional depending on the distance from the Bucharest Municipality area to investigated forests due to improvement of the environmental quality; (5) from geographical distribution of <b>lichens</b> <b>species</b> point of view, take a place an increasing number of epiphytic <b>lichens</b> <b>species</b> which is close correlated with the distance from Bucharest Municipalityarea to investigated forests. In addition, a great importance was conferred the presence of rare and disappearing epiphytic lichensspecies nearest perturbation area of Bucharest Municipality (Andronache Forest).

40|$|Abstract. Chemical {{synthetic}} {{method in}} synthesizing silver nanoparticle was quite expensive, toxic and flammable. In order to enhance green technology, we develop a simple biological method {{for the green}} synthesis of silver nanoparticles using two <b>lichens</b> <b>species,</b> Parmotrema praesorediosum and Ramalina dumeticola. Silver nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and TEM. Within 72 hours reaction time, absorption spectra of silver nanoparticles formed in R. dumeticola and P. praesorediosum has absorbance peak at 407 nm and 423 nm, respectively. TEM analysis showed the average size of 20 nm of silver nanoparticles obtained in R. dumeticola and the average size of 42 nm of silver nanoparticles obtained in P. praesorediosum.

500|$|The thallus is the {{vegetative}} {{body of a}} lichen {{that contains}} the lichen mycobiont (fungus) and the photobiont (algae and/or cyanobacteria). In P.acicularis, the primary thallus (thallus horizontalis) is spread out like a granular crust {{on the surface of}} its substrate. It is light green when young, but becomes gray in age or when dry. The pseudopodetia (upright stalk-like extensions of the thallus made of vegetative tissue) range from [...] high, and are about 1mm thick; they grow in dense clusters. Most pseudopodetia are either unbranched or forked into two branches, with the stalks curved so as to appear as if combed; less frequently, they are erect like pins, and up to [...] tall. Some specimens are highly branched in {{the upper part of the}} pseudopodetia, causing them to bear some resemblance to P.robustus, although this morphology is uncommon. Internally, the pseudopodetia are solid when young, becoming hollow with age, and are composed of long, thin, highly gelatinized hyphae with narrow cavities about 0.5μm wide. The lower part of older pseudopodetia becomes blackened internally. The algal layer is not continuous—contrasting with <b>lichen</b> <b>species</b> that have thalli that stratify into discrete tissue types, including a photobiont layer—and occurs with the mycobiont in the form of granules. These granules may be absent from some parts of the thallus surface. Pycnidia (flask-like structures, resembling perithecia, in which conidia are produced) occur in the tips of small sterile pseudopodetia or in the tips of small lateral branches of older pseudopodetia.|$|E

Lumut kerak merupakan gabungan antara alga dan cendawan, sehingga secara morfologi dan fisiologi merupakan satu kesatuan. Lumut kerak termasuk tumbuhan epifit yang dapat hidup pada suhu rendah maupun tinggi. Di Kecamatan Meukek, Kabupaten Aceh Selatan banyak dijumpai tanaman pala yang tumbuh di perkebunan rakyat. Namun, hingga saat ini belum ada informasi mengenai data keberadaan dan kekayaan jenis lumut kerak pada tanaman pala rakyat yang terdapat di Kecamatan Meukek, Kabupaten Aceh Selatan. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mendapatkan data mengenai tipe morfologi talus dan kekayaan jenis lumut kerak pada perkebunan pala rakyat di Kecamatan Meukek, Kabupaten Aceh Selatan. Metode yang digunakan adalah survei eksploratif dan pemilihan lokasi pengambilan sampel (desa) dilakukan secara purposive sampling. Tipe morfologi talus lumut kerak yang didapat ada tiga tipe, yaitu: crustose, foliose dan frusticose. Lokasi penelitian terbagi dua yaitu: sembilan plot pada kawasan dekat hutan dan sembilan plot di kawasan pesisir. Delapan dari sepuluh jenis lumut kerak yang ada terdapat di kawasan pesisir, yaitu: Platythecium dimorphodes, Verrucaria mucosa, Megalospora tuberculosa, Phyllospora furfuracea, Megalospora sulphurata, Coccocarpia erythroxyli, Heterodermia japonica, dan Lecanora tropica.
