50|$|The {{nature of}} {{particle}} counting {{is based upon}} either light scattering, <b>light</b> <b>obscuration,</b> or direct imaging. A high intensity light source is used to illuminate the particle as it passes through the detection chamber. The particle passes through the light source (typically a laser or halogen light) and if light scattering is used, then the redirected light is detected by a photo detector. If direct imaging is used, a halogen light illuminates particles from the back within a cell while a high definition, high magnification camera records passing particles. Recorded video is then analyzed by computer software to measure particle attributes. If light blocking (obscuration) is used the loss of light is detected. The amplitude of the light scattered or light blocked is measured and the particle is counted and tabulated into standardized counting bins. The image to the right shows a light scattering particle counter diagram. More information about types of particle counters and types of particle detection follow in this article.|$|E

40|$|Summary 1. Continuous {{catches of}} {{drifting}} larvae during two consecutive development cycles of Isoperla goertzi have been analysed. a) Each year {{there have been}} caught 1000 - 2000 larvae drifting in a distance of 600 mtrs. from the spring.

Influence of light on the diurnal periodicity has been tested under permanent <b>light</b> and <b>obscuration</b> conditions. a) Permanent light delays the drift.

40|$|A {{large number}} of protein-based {{medicines}} have successfully improved the treatment and quality life of patients in diverse therapeutic areas. From a pharmaceutical technology perspective, the main associated implications are high viscosity and increased protein aggregation tendency that typically characterize protein formulations.

Thus, there is an increasing interest to research and characterize protein particles beyond the limits of current USP applications of Chapter had appeared in the recent years.

40|$|Background: There is no {{standardized}} procedure or consensus {{to which}} tests {{should be performed}} to judge compatibility/ incompatibility of intravenous drugs. The {{purpose of this study}} was to establish and evaluate a test program of methods suitable for detection of physical incompatibility in Y-site administration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and drugs. Methods: Eight frequently used methods (dynamic light scattering, laser diffraction, <b>light</b> <b>obscuration,</b> turbidimetry, zeta potential, light microscopy, pH-measurements and visual examination using Tyndall beams), were scrutinized to elucidate strengths and weaknesses for compatibility testing. The responses of the methods were tested with samples containing precipitation of calcium phosphate and with heat destabilized TPN emulsions. A selection of drugs (acyclovir, ampicillin, ondansetron and paracetamol) was mixed with 3 -in- 1 TPN admixtures (Olimel® N 5 E, Kabiven® and SmofKabiven®) to assess compatibility (i. e. potential precipitates and emulsion stability). The obtained compatibility data was interpreted according to theory and compared to existing compatibility literature to further check the validity of the methods. Results: <b>Light</b> <b>obscuration</b> together with turbidimetry, visual inspection and pH-measurements were able to capture signs of precipitations. For the analysis of emulsion stability, <b>light</b> <b>obscuration</b> and estimation of percent droplets above 5 μm (PFAT 5) seemed to be the most sensitive method; however laser diffraction and monitoring changes in pH might be a useful support. Samples should always be compared to unmixed controls to reveal changes induced by the mixing. General acceptance criteria are difficult to define, although some limits are suggested based on current experience. The experimental compatibility data was supported by scattered reports in literature, further confirming the suitability of the test program. However, conflicting data are common, which complicates the comparison to existing literature. Conclusions: Testing of these complex blends should be based on a combination of several methods and accompanied by theoretical considerations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a whole-field {{measurement technique}} that {{is capable of}} simultaneously sizing and positioning multiple transparent droplets on a plane from scattered light features that are independent of laser beam intensity and <b>obscuration.</b> <b>Light</b> scattered by reflection and refraction from droplets immersed in a laser sheet is recorded holographically to yield the smallest possible probe volume and the correspondingly largest number density. The holographic images of the droplets may be reconstructed at their image or focused plane, in which case the droplets appear as two spots, sometimes referred to as glare points whose separation is proportional to the droplet diameter. The holographic images may also be reconstructed at an out-of-focus plane, in which case the droplet images appear as fringe patterns whose frequency is related to droplet size. The choice of reconstruction plane is predicated on the resolution of the medium and by convenience. The technique would yield the distribution of droplet size versus position on the measurement plane. The two imaging planes (without reference beam) are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the effect of}} AGN light on host galaxy optical and UV-optical colours, as determined from X-ray-selected AGN host galaxies at z~ 1, and compare the AGN host galaxy colours to those of a control sample matched to the AGN sample in both redshift and stellar mass. We identify as X-ray-selected AGNs 8. 7 + 4 /- 3 per cent of the red-sequence control galaxies, 9. 8 +/- 3 per cent of the blue-cloud control galaxies, and 14. 7 + 4 /- 3 per cent of the green-valley control galaxies. The nuclear colours of AGN hosts are generally bluer than their outer colours, while the control galaxies exhibit redder nuclei. AGNs in blue-cloud host galaxies experience less X-ray obscuration, while AGNs in red-sequence hosts have more, which is the reverse of what is expected from general considerations of the interstellar medium. Outer and integrated colours of AGN hosts generally agree with the control galaxies, regardless of X-ray obscuration, but the nuclear colours of unobscured AGNs are typically much bluer, especially for X-ray luminous objects. Visible point sources are seen in many of these, indicating that the nuclear colours have been contaminated by AGN <b>light</b> and that <b>obscuration</b> of the X-ray radiation and visible light are therefore highly correlated. Red AGN hosts are typically slightly bluer than red-sequence control galaxies, which suggests that their stellar populations are slightly younger. We compare these colour data to current models of AGN formation. The unexpected trend of less X-ray obscuration in blue-cloud galaxies and more in red-sequence galaxies is problematic for all AGN feedback models, in which gas and dust {{is thought to be}} removed as star formation shuts down.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to quantitatively assess the {{relevance}} of transparency and refractive index (RI) on protein particle analysis by the light-based techniques <b>light</b> <b>obscuration</b> (LO) and Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI). A novel method for determining the RI of protein particles was developed and provided an RI of 1. 41 for protein particles from two different proteins.

An RI match even caused particles to become "invisible" for the system, that is, not detectable anymore by LO and MFI. To determine the influence of formulation RI on particle measurements, we suggest the use of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles to test a specific formulation for RI effects.

The work is aimed at optimizing a unique form of pharmaceutical delivery. The pharmaceutical is formulated into particle form and accelerated toward the target of skin or mucosa by using a gas jet. In this study, research devices designed using analytical, computational (computational fluid dynamics) and experimental methodologies were used to deliver particles at uniform and predetermined velocities. These velocities were confirmed using <b>light</b> <b>obscuration,</b> pressure measurement and particle image velocimetry methods. Polystyrene, glass, stainless steel and gold micro-particles at a range of size distributions were used for the payloads for injection using these devices. Injection occurred {{with a wide range of}} impact conditions into fresh canine (dog) and porcine (pig) buccal mucosa. Final positions of the particles were determined from histological sections and the results analyzed in relation to the known particle impact parameters of size, density and velocity. The experimental results are collated using an empirical term, based on particle impact parameters. Comparison is then made to a semi-empirical penetration model. This is done by analysing the penetration results in terms of each particle impact parameter. Analysis shows that this model fits the experimental data well when reasonable estimates of the tissue mechanical properties are chosen. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{device for}} {{measuring}} the flow, duration and volume characteristics of human puffing behaviour when smoking cigarettes is described. Cigarettes are smoked through a holder comprising a measured pressure drop across a critical orifice. The holder also contains a Light Emitting Diode (LED) and photodetector that measures <b>light</b> <b>obscuration</b> in order to estimate nicotine-free dry particulate matter (NFDPM, “tar”) delivery. All data are recorded on a puff-by-puff basis and displayed in real time. These NFDPM estimates are known as optical “tar” (OT), and are derived from the calibration of the OT measurement versus gravimetric NFDPM yields of cigarettes under a range of smoking regimes. In a test study, puff volumes from 20 - 80 mL were recorded to ± 6. 0 % of a pre-set volume, with an absolute error of 4. 7 mL for an 80 mL volume drawn on a lit cigarette, and an average error of less than 2. 0 mL across the range 20 - 80 mL. The relationship between NFDPM and OT was linear (R 2 = 0. 99) and accurate to ± 1. 3 mg per cigarette over the range 1 - 23 mg per cigarette.

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{generate}} further characterisation {{data for the}} lyophilised product Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase, reconstituted drug product (DP; marketed as Erwinase or Erwinaze) was analysed for subvisible (2 – 10 μm) particulate content using both the <b>light</b> <b>obscuration</b> (LO) method and the newer flow-imaging microscopy (FIM) technique. No correlation of subvisible particulate counts exists between FIM and LO nor do the counts correlate with activity at both release and on stability. The subvisible particulate content of lyophilised Erwinia L-asparaginase appears to be consistent and stable over time and in line with other parenteral biopharmaceutical products. The majority (ca. 75 %) of subvisible particulates in L-asparaginase DP were {{at the low end}} of the measurement range by FIM (2 – 4 μm). In this size range, FIM was unable to definitively classify the particulates as either protein or non-protein. More sensitive measurement techniques would be needed to classify the particulates in lyophilised L-asparaginase into type (protein and non-protein), so the LO technique has been chosen for on-going DP analyses. E. chrysanthemi L-asparaginase has a lower rate of hypersensitivity compared with native Escherichia coli preparations, but a subset of patients develop hypersensitivity to the Erwinia enzyme. A DP lot that had subvisible particulate counts on the upper end of the measurement range by both LO and FIM had the same incidence of allergic hypersensitivity in clinical experience as lots at all levels of observed subvisible particulate content, suggesting that the presence of L-asparaginase subvisible particulates is not important with respect to allergic response.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{compatibility}} of calcium chloride (CaCl 2) and phosphates have not included particle counts {{in the range}} specified by the United States Pharmacopeia. Micro-flow imaging techniques {{have been shown to}} be comparable to <b>light</b> <b>obscuration</b> when determining particle count and size in pharmaceutical solutions. The purpose of this study was to do compatibility testing for parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions containing CaCl 2 using dynamic light scattering and micro-flow imaging techniques. Solutions containing TrophAmine (Braun Medical Inc, Irvine, CA), CaCl 2, and sodium phosphate (NaPhos) were compounded with and without cysteine. All solutions contained standard additives to neonatal PN solutions including dextrose, trace metals, and electrolytes. Control solutions contained no calcium or phosphate. Solutions were analyzed for particle size and particle count. Means of Z-average particle size and particle counts of controls were determined. Study solutions were compared to controls and United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter 788 guidelines. The maximum amount of Phos that was compatible in solutions that contained at least 10 mmol/L of Ca in 2. 5 % amino acids (AA) was determined. Compatibility of these solutions was verified by performing analyses of 5 repeats of these solutions. Microscopic analyses of the repeats were also performed. Amounts of CaCl 2 and NaPhos that were compatible in solutions containing 1. 5 %, 2 %, 2. 5 %, and 3 % AA were determined. The maximum amount of NaPhos that could be added to TrophAmine solutions of > = 2. 5 % AA containing at least 10 mmol/L of CaCl 2 was 7. 5 mmol/L. Adding 50 mg/dL of cysteine increased the amount of NaPhos that could be added to solutions containing 10 mmol/L of CaCl 2 to 10 mmol/L. Calcium chloride can be added to neonatal PN solutions containing NaPhos in concentrations that can potentially provide an intravenous intake of adequate amounts of calcium and phosphorus...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} an above-ground gallery to simulate typical fires that develop along conveyor belt transport systems within underground coal mines. In the experiments, electrical strip heaters, imbedded ~ 5 cm {{below the top surface}} of a large mass of coal rubble, were used to ignite the coal, producing an open flame. The flaming coal mass subsequently ignited 1. 83 -meter-wide conveyor belts located approximately 0. 30 m above the coal surface. Gas samples were drawn through an averaging probe located approximately 20 m downstream of the coal for continuous measurement of CO, CO 2, and O 2 as the fire progressed through the stages of smoldering coal, flaming coal, and flaming conveyor belt. Also located approximately 20 m from the fire origin and approximately 0. 5 m below the roof of the gallery were two commercially available smoke detectors, a <b>light</b> <b>obscuration</b> meter, and a sampling probe for measurement of total mass concentration of smoke particles. Located upstream of the fire origin and also along the wall of the gallery at approximately 14 m and 5 m upstream were two video cameras capable of both smoke and flame detection. During the experiments, alarm times of the smoke detectors and video cameras were measured while the smoke obscuration and total smoke mass were continually measured. Twelve large-scale {{experiments were}} conducted using three different types of fire-resistant conveyor belts and four air velocities for each belt. The air velocities spanned the range from 1. 0 m/s to 6. 9 m/s. The results of these experiments are compared to previous large-scale results obtained using a smaller fire gallery and much narrower (1. 07 -m) conveyor belts to determine if the fire detection criteria previously developed (1) remained valid for the wider conveyor belts. Although some differences between these and the previous experiments did occur, the results, in general, compare very favorably. Differences are duly noted and their impact on fire detection discussed. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 11 - 10 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 26566298 PMC 464104...|$|E
40|$|Particle count {{technology}} {{that has been}} used {{for more than two decades}} in potable water testing is finding increasing application in stormwater as well. Particle count is a two-dimensional measurement of particle number by size, therefore it can potentially produce accurate and precise information on water quality, system performance and stormwater treatment efficiencies compared to conventional TSS, SSC and turbidity measurement methods. In this study, a protocol for using PAMAS S 4031, a particle counter based on <b>light</b> <b>obscuration</b> has been developed. Most of the modern particle counter instruments currently being adapted for liquid analysis are designed with the narrow spectrum analytical requirement in mind (for example,counting blood cells and fuel spray droplets size), so it should be noted that these instruments have limitations. In this paper, the limits and capabilities of available instrument technology will be presented in detail to make the best use for analysing suspended particles in stormwater. A silica powder LANG LANG SILICA 60 G, obtained from highly pure sand with known particle size distribution (PSD) in term of percentage of mass and uniform density of 2. 66 gm/cm 3 was used for the verification of the particle counter. Initially two different methods, namely sieve analysis and settling column, were used to confirm the given PSD of silica. Wet and dry sieving were performed to fraction particles in the range between 45 μm to 250 μm. Settling column analysis was used to fraction particles larger than 2 μm whereas the pipette method was used for smaller particles between 2 μm to 62. 5 μm. The PSD obtained from these methods were compared with the given PSD. Based on particle density information, particle counts were calculated mathematically for given PSD and were compared with particle count obtained from PAMAS particle counter. It was found that although the measurement range was between 1 to 100 μm, the instrument was most effective in measuring particles smaller than 10 μm only. The protocol will thus mainly focus on fine particles < 10 μm. This study comprises of series of monitoring trials, conducted at different concentrations, flow rates, instrumental set ups etc. The protocol is expected to be fast and easy to use and can be used to evaluate stormwater quality and treatment performance. It can also assist in the selection of treatment systems on a more consistent basis...|$|E
