5|$|From the outset, {{the game}} was {{designed}} with an overseas release in mind. Among the early ideas created for the title was {{for it to be}} set in New York City, inspired by John Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York. This was vetoed as it would not offer much variety in its cast. To enable an international cast, it was decided to set the game in Antarctica. This choice of setting was also made to depict the danger posed by the Schwarzwelt on a worldwide scale. This setting differed greatly from previous Shin Megami Tensei games, which had taken place in Tokyo. It was also chosen as the North Pole had no widespread landmass, making it an impractical setting. When developing the character drama, the team took inspiration from another film by Carpenter, 1982's The Thing. The moral alignment system, a staple in earlier Shin Megami Tensei entries, was reintroduced for Strange Journey to help players experience the game's themes. The central cast acted as both a microcosm of humanity and representation of the game's alignments. Due to the setting, the characters had to be members of a Special Forces group, as opposed to previous protagonists who had been average people. The game includes a larger presence of science fiction elements than in previous Shin Megami Tensei games. Various elements within the game were inspired by science fiction movies: the Red Sprite was inspired by the main vehicle from the 1977 film Damnation Alley, and some equipment was inspired by James Cameron's 1986 film Aliens. The characters' firearms were all modeled after real-life guns. Elaborating on how the science fiction elements complemented rather than clashed with the mystical elements of Shin Megami Tensei, Kaneko stated that he felt that the series had always had elements of those two genres merging, commenting that some people saw a web URL as something like a magical incantation and referencing a quote from Arthur C. Clark about technology becoming so advanced that it looked <b>like</b> <b>magic.</b>|$|E

Sara implanted a copy of her consciousness into the house, and it lived with her voice and mind and memories for over a century.

Many feared it, but some would explore it and Sara would make them comfortable and grant their wishes.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{domestication}} of wild plants cannot be described with any precision. However, Bruce D.

In the aftermath of a flood, in which most of the old vegetation is killed by the high waters and bare patches of new, often very fertile, soil were created, these pioneer plants sprang up <b>like</b> <b>magic,</b> often growing in almost pure stands, but usually disappearing after a single season, as other vegetation pushed them out until the next flood.|$|E

A few (such as swordsmen and archers) are generic, while others (such as troll shamans) feature racial bonuses (such as {{regeneration}} or flight) that make them more valuable or more powerful than generic units. Most city-recruited units are unique to the city's region or terrain,and have special abilities <b>like</b> <b>magic</b> use, ranged attacks, or an ability to always strike first in combat. Mercenaries can seek employment with famous wizards, allowing them to recruit units which their cities are unable to produce. The player can even summon fantastic creatures, such as demon lords, enormous monsters like dragons or griffins. The variety of units with unique special abilities offer many options when building an army.|$|E

According to him, a tutorial is a burden because of the additional need of updating it and interface improvement is not a major priority till then—citing numerous existing fan-made applications for improving the game's interface. He said of version 1.0, [...] "sitting down with a fresh DF world would be like sitting down to read a middling fantasy author you haven't read before, but with all the extras that being a video game provides, including the ability to write your own sequels."

500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Madonna has been {{involved}} in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, who worked on Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), said that [...] "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it." [...] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: [...] "I don't know where [...] came from. It was <b>like</b> <b>magic.</b> I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'." [...] Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including [...] "Lucky Star" [...] which she composed on synthesizer. Rolling Stone has named her [...] "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." [...] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing [...] "incredible" [...] hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and its line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine." [...] Though Madonna has worked with producers across many genres, her songs have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Some of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which led to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the [...] "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time".|$|E

500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players <b>like</b> <b>Magic</b> Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, and no one ever wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You had {{to see some of the}} things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E
