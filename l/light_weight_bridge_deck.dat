In the last three decades, severe problems were reported in relation to asphaltic surfacing materials on orthotropic steel <b>deck</b> <b>bridges.</b> Earlier investigations {{have shown that the}} bonding strength of membrane layers to the surrounding materials has a strong influence on the structural response of orthotropic steel <b>bridge</b> <b>decks.</b> The most important requirement for the application of membrane materials on orthotropic steel <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> is that the membrane adhesive layer shall be able to provide sufficient bond to the surrounding materials. The research aims on developing a FE tool to simulate and understand the performance of asphaltic surfacing structures, so as to improve the design of surfacings and increase their service life. In this paper, Finite Element (FE) simulations of Merwedebrug bridge with two membrane layers system are presented. The finite element system CAPA- 3 D developed at the Section of Structural Mechanics of TU Delft has been utilized as the numerical platform for this study. Due to the multilayer of the surfacing materials and geometrical complexity of the steel bridge, the FE model shows the in time development of strains and stresses inside the surfacing materials depends highly on the wheel loading frequency, wheel position, membrane bonding strength as well as thicknesses and characteristics of the surfacing layers. Emphasis is placed on the distribution of strains and the evolution of damage in surfacing layers of different cases.

40|$|The robust {{performance}} of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> {{is critical to}} ensure smooth daily traffic operations and adequate structural {{performance of}} the bridge during extreme events. Prefabricated <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> have become more popular because of their <b>light</b> <b>weight,</b> which is advantageous for long spans and rehabilitation, and rapid construction. Currently, there are no uniform national specifications for the design, performance, or installation of <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> systems. This often results {{in the use of}} less durable products because manufacturers design, fabricate, and install components to achieve the lowest initial cost. This has sometimes resulted in poor performance and unreasonably short service lives. Thus, the objectives of this research were to develop standard testing methods to evaluate the performance of critical details for <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> systems. ^ Three subassembly deck panels were tested to determine their respective stiffness properties in the strong and weak directions, as well as in torsion. The stiffness properties were used to compute the minimum load applied for strength verification tests of subassembly <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> critical details. The critical details tested included longitudinal and transverse splices, and a deck-to-superstructure connection. These details were also tested in cyclic loading and evaluated. Standard testing methods were developed to determine the stiffness in the strong and weak directions, torsional stiffness, verify the strength and evaluate the cyclic loading resistance of longitudinal and transverse splices, and deck-to-superstructure connections. The test methods developed can be used to evaluate the performance of different types of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> in the field. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the edge beam is to support the railing and the pavement, {{function}} {{as part of the}} drainage system and in the case it is integrated into the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> it can serve to distribute concentrated loads. It is located in road environment and therefore exposed to water and salt with chlorides as well as subject to impacts during accidents. It deteriorates in a greater pace {{than the rest of the}} bridge and therefore has a shorter lifespan than the bridge in full. A deteriorated edge beam put the safety of the bridge users in jeopardize and increases the need of maintenance, repair and replacement work. These activities affect the surrounding traffic flow due to reduced speed limits as well as closure of traffic lanes. A literature study has been performed to get an understanding of how edge beams are designed and constructed. A great part of this was done by examining codes and regulations. By meeting engineers from different building companies it has been possible to obtain a picture of how it is done in real life and how the path to the final design looks like. Building site visits were carried out to see the process from design to construction i. e. how it is applied in real life. A design study was performed, including a check of crack width in an integrated edge beam over a support, height of <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> when a pre-fabricated (brokappa) is used and a comparison in the magnitude of the clamping moment in a steel-concrete bridge with and without an edge beam. All proposals are presented by the Edge Beam Group (EBG, in Swedish, Kantbalksgruppen), which is composed of experienced engineers that works within the frame of the project social optimal edge beam systems governed by the Swedish Transport Administration. The literature research showed that even if the edge bean is prone to deteriorate its lifespan does not have to be governed by its condition. Planned expansion of bridge width and maintenance strategies including the replacement of waterproofing layer could also be a reason for replacement in some cases. A significant increase of reinforcement in the edge beam and top part of the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> over support is needed to obtain an acceptable crack width of 0. 15 mm. This would however aggravate the casting phase. The use of a pre-fabricated edge beam result in an increase of the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> height. A solution could be to strengthen the anchoring capacity but this could in turn give an over reinforced structure. When it comes to the clamping moment in a steelconcrete composite bridge the integrated edge beam leads to a better distribution of the traffic load. On the other hand, due to the higher dead <b>weight,</b> a <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> without an edge beam would result in a lower total moment in the cantilever...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays most of {{the bridges}} are {{designed}} with movable joints and bearings. They are used to allow for <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> displacements produced by: expansion and contraction of the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> due to temperature changes, breaking or accelerating forces of vehicles and by long term changes of concrete such as creeping and shrinking. Joints and bearings are susceptible to durability problems and require maintenance and replacements. In {{order to reduce the}} maintenance costs and to lower the initial costs of construction, integral bridges - bridges without expansion joints and bearings - are used. In the case of integral bridges, bridge abutments and piers must be designed to be flexible enough to allow necessary deck displacements without reaching their ultimate bearing capacity and instability. The aim of this master thesis is to conduct a research on structural response of circular CFT (concrete filled tube) composite columns used as intermediate piers in integral bridges subjected to axial forces and bending moments caused by <b>bridge</b> <b>weight</b> and <b>deck</b> displacements respectively. The analysis is performed by finite element method using the software package Abaqus. A three dimensional model is defined using solid elements for both materials and paying special attention to the steel to concrete contact. Nonlinear behaviour of steel and concrete is taken into account. The confining effect of the concrete is also considered. Variations are done in ratio of steel and concrete used in the piers and also in N/Nu ratio for the equivalent bending moments. The finite element model is verified by comparing the results of numerical analysis with the results obtained by EN 1994 - 1 - 1 and by other research studies on this subject.

Test results showed that, compared to the normal foam-core sandwich decks, an average approximately 657. 1 % increase in the ultimate bending strength can be achieved.

30|$|A {{number of}} factors related to bridge design can {{contribute}} to <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking (ElSafty and Abdel Mohti 2013). Restraint is typically caused by end conditions and the composite action between the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> and the supporting members of the superstructure. The fixity conditions at abutments can influence cracking in the end spans of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> (Darwin et al. 2004). Restraint can also be provided by stay-in-place forms (Saadeghvaziri and Hadidi 2005). Thicker <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> tend to have less cracking (TRB 2006; ElSafty and Abdel-Mohti 2013), although the relative stiffnesses of the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> and the girders {{is an important factor}} in the propensity for a deck to experience cracking (Hadidi and Saadeghvaziri 2005). The type of girder used in a bridge superstructure has been shown to influence cracking, with <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> of steel girder bridges often exhibiting more cracking than <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> supported by other types of girders due to stiffness (Perfetti et al. 1985; Krauss and Rogalla 1996). The type of phased construction and continuity between spans in bridges built with precast girders can have important consequences in <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking (Sousa et al. 2012). ElSafty and Abdel-Mohti (2013) found that deflection is an important parameter affecting cracking. Reinforcing steel characteristics (including bar size, spacing, cover, and other details) can affect the extent of <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking (Hadidi and Saadeghvaziri 2005) as well as crack widths and patterns (Soltani et al. 2013).|$|R

The image stitching algorithm allowed to generate a very high resolution image of the whole <b>bridge</b> <b>deck,</b> and the <b>bridge</b> viewer software allows to calibrate the stitched image to the bridge coordinate. The corrosion, delamination and elastic modulus maps were built based on ER, IE and USW data collected by the robot to provide easy evaluation and condition monitoring of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks.</b> Extensive testings and deployments of the proposed system on a number of bridges proved the efficiency of the new approach for <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> inspection and evaluation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the field}} of timber bridges {{progressive}} static structural solution is if the timber bearing members of the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> are combined with concrete layer applying a shear connection to receive their composite action. The composite timber-concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> comparing to the standard timber <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> has a higher rigidity, is more resistant to dynamic effects and has protected wooden part from external mechanical actions. The behavior of timber–concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> is significantly influenced by the conditions of surrounding environment. In the presented paper, results of theoretical and experimental investigation {{of the effect of}} temperature and humidity changes of environment on the timber-concrete composite <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> will be presented. The applied analytical calculation model developed for analysis of long term behavior of timber-concrete elements influenced by the environment temperature and humidity will be introduced. In the experimental program, timber–concrete members with different timber structural parts and various composite connections under short and long term loading were investigated. The environmental conditions, temperature and humidity, during the 5 year long test were continually registered. Comparison of theoretical and experimental results and some practical conclusions for design of timber–concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> will be finally presented...|$|R
40|$|The <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> {{sections}} {{used for}} long-span suspension bridges have evolved through the years, from the compact box deck girders geometrical configurations to twin-box and three-box <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> sections. The latest generation of split and multiple-box <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> proved {{to have better}} aerodynamic behavior; thus further optimization methods are sought for such geometrical configurations. A new type of multibox <b>bridge</b> <b>deck,</b> consisting of four aerodynamically shaped deck boxes, two side decks for the traffic lanes and two middle decks for the railway traffic, connected between them by stabilizing beams, was tested in the wind tunnel for identifying the flutter derivatives and to verify the aerodynamic performance of the proposed multibox deck. Aerodynamic static force coefficients were measured for the multibox <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> model, scaled 1 [*]:[*] 80, for Reynolds numbers up to 5. 1 × 105, under angles of attack between − 8 ° and 8 °. Iterative Least Squares (ILS) method was employed for identifying the flutter derivatives of the multibox <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> model, {{based on the results}} obtained from the free vibration tests and based on the frequency analysis the critical flutter wind speed for the corresponding prototype of the multibox bridge was estimated at 188 m/s...|$|R
