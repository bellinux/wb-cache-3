5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, <b>light-weight</b> material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
5|$|The {{limbs of}} the horse are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, <b>light-weight,</b> one-toed form seen today.|$|E
5|$|Nier {{originated}} when Yoko and Shiba {{teamed up}} to create a third Drakengard game. As the project continued, it became more detached from the main continuity and eventually developed into a spin-off. Despite what it became, Yoko has stated that he considers Nier to be the true Drakengard 3. After the release of Nier, Cavia closed down and was absorbed by AQ Interactive, then Yoko Taro left the company to pursue {{a wider range of}} projects. A stalled attempt to begin production of further games in the series at AQ Interactive was blamed by Shiba on a prevalent trend at the time for <b>light-weight</b> games for the general gaming community. Later, Yoko and Shiba came together again to create a proper second sequel to Drakengard, with the intention of creating a hard core RPG for the fanbase. Unlike the previous games in the series, Drakengard 3 was developed by Access Games, a developer whose noted games included Deadly Premonition, and brought in team members used to creating action games. During the run-up to Drakengard 3s release, both Yoko and Shiba expressed their willingness to continue the series on the PlayStation 4 if the latest game was enough of a success. Speaking in 2014 after the game's release, Yoko stated that the series was on hold due to lack of funds. A new Nier game was revealed to be in development at Square Enix and PlatinumGames.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} <b>light-weighting</b> orbital launch vehicles (rockets) improves lifetime environmental impacts of the vehicle. <b>Light-weighting</b> is performed by a material substitution where metal structures in the rocket are replaced with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP’s). It is uncertain whether <b>light-weighting</b> the rocket {{in the same way}} as traditional vehicles are light-weighted would provide similar environmental benefits. Furthermore, the rocket system is significantly different from traditional vehicles and undergoes an atypical lifecycle, making analysis non-trivial. Seventy rocket configurations were sized using a Parametric Rocket Sizing Model (PRSM) which was developed for this research. Four different propellant options, three staging options, and eighteen different lift capacities were considered. Each of these seventy rockets did not include CFRP’s, thus establishing a baseline. The seventy rockets were then light-weighted with CFRP’s, making a total of seventy pairs of rockets. An environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed on each of the rockets to determine lifetime environmental impacts. During the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), a Carbon Fiber Production Model was developed to determine the environmental burdens of carbon fiber production and to address issues identified with carbon fiber’s embodied burdens. The results of the LCA were compared across all rockets to determine what effects <b>light-weighting</b> had on environmental impact. The final conclusion is that <b>light-weighting</b> reduces lifetime environmental impacts of Liquid Oxygen-Rocket Propellant 1 and Nitrogen Tetroxide-Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine rockets, while it likely benefits Liquid Oxygen-Liquid Hydrogen rockets. <b>Light-weighting</b> increases lifetime environmental impacts of Solid Propellant rockets.

40|$|<b>Light-weighting</b> of {{passenger}} cars using high-strength steel or aluminum {{is a common}} emissions mitigation strategy. We provide a first estimate of the global impact of <b>light-weighting</b> by material substitution on GHG emissions from {{passenger cars}} and the steel and aluminum industries until 2050. We develop a dynamic stock model of the global car fleet and combine it with a dynamic MFA of the associated steel, aluminum, and energy supply industries. We propose four scenarios for substitution of conventional steel with high-strength steel and aluminum at different rates over the period 2010 − 2050. We show that <b>light-weighting</b> of passenger cars can become a “gigaton solution”: Between 2010 and 2050, persistent <b>light-weighting</b> of passenger cars can, under optimal conditions, lead to cumulative GHG emissions savings of 9 − 18 gigatons CO 2 -eq compared to development business-as-usual. Annual savings can be up to 1 gigaton per year. After 2030, enhanced material recycling can lead to further reductions: closed-loop metal recycling in the automotive sector may reduce cumulative emissions by another 4 − 6 gigatons CO 2 -eq. The effectiveness of emissions mitigation by material substitution significantly depends on how the recycling system evolves. At present, policies focusing on tailpipe emissions and life cycle assessments of individual cars do not consider this important effect. Copyright © 2014 American Chemical Society.

40|$|On {{a global}} level, however, road {{vehicles}} and especially passen-ger cars {{could make the}} highest contribution to reduce energy consumption by <b>light-weighting.</b> This {{is due to the}} high share of these vehicles on the global energy consumption (because of the huge number of these vehicles) and also a considerable poten-tial to realise a further weight reduction. Conclusion and Perspectives. <b>Light-weighting</b> is one way of re-ducing transport energy consumption in the use phase. The dif-ferences in use phase energy savings for a 100 kg weight reduc-tion between the vehicle groups are considerable and allow for the identification of priorities for future <b>light-weighting</b> efforts. The contribution to a reduction of the global transport energy consumption, in turn, depends on the further potential for a weight reduction and on the number of vehicles which can be weight reduced. The OECD market of private passenger cars and trucks, for instance, offers a good perspective due to a high contribution to the global transport energy consumption, a con-siderable potential for weight reduction and a high turnover rate of the vehicle fleet. The benefits will be realised after a substantial replacement of the existing fleet with new, weight-reduced vehicles...|$|R
