40|$|Chip-scale {{microscopy}} imaging platforms are pivotal {{for improving}} the efficiency of modern biomedical and bioscience experiments. Their integration with other lab-on-a-chip techniques would allow rapid, reliable and high-throughput sample analysis for applications in diverse disciplines. In typical chip-scale microscopy imaging platforms, the light path can be generalized to the following steps: photons leave the light source, interact with the sample and finally are detected by the sensor. Based on the <b>light</b> path <b>of</b> these <b>platforms,</b> the current review aims to provide some insights on design strategies for chip-scale microscopy. Specifically, we analyze current chip-scale microscopy approaches from three aspects: illumination design, sample manipulation and substrate/imager modification. We also discuss some opportunities for future developments of chip-scale microscopy, such as time multiplexed structured illumination and hydrodynamic focusing for high throughput sample manipulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach {{to the design of}} embedded software based on Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) is encouraged by the fact that such software has a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>platforms.</b> In this way, the creation of methods for the development <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> models that meet such diversity <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> is necessary. This study proposes a method called PM-MDA for the development <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> models that design embedded software based on RTOS in the context of MDA. In addition, this study defines the swxRTOS metamodel, a UML 2. 0 profile for RTOS based on embedded software design. Such profile defines a set of stereotypes to describe Platform Models (PMs) and is intended to generically describe the services provided by a given embedded system <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> the RTOS. This profile promotes the creation <b>of</b> <b>Platform</b> Models, which will be used as input parameters in the model transformation.

40|$|Utilization <b>of</b> tension leg <b>platforms</b> {{for deep}} water oil {{recovery}} {{has increased the}} importance of accurately predicting the effects of wind on these structures. The gust loading factor approach incorporates the effect of deviations from mean wind speed, gustiness, on structures based on extreme value statistics. Single-point representation f the wind field may be employed for structures smaller than typical gust size, but partial wind velocity correlation over large structures necessitates the use of multi-point wind field statistics to determine dynamic load effects. The characteristics of the wind field over the ocean are reviewed, and a previously reported description of an ocean-based wind spectrum is further examined in the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> additional full-scale offshore measurements. A modified coherence function for offshore applications i presented based on theoretical considerations and experimental data.

40|$|A {{key issue}} in the MDA {{approach}} is the transformation <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> independent models to platform specific models. Before transforming to a platform specific model, however, {{it is necessary to}} select the appropriate platform. Various platforms exist with different properties and the selection <b>of</b> the appropriate <b>platform</b> for the given application requirements is not trivial. An inappropriate selection <b>of</b> a <b>platform,</b> though, may easily lead to unnecessary loss of resources and lower the efficiency of the application development. Unfortunately, the selection <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> in MDA is currently implicit and lacks systematic support. We propose to integrate so-called platform selection rules in the MDA approach for systematic selection <b>of</b> <b>platforms.</b> The platform selection rules are based on platform domain models that are derived through domain analysis techniques. We show that the selection <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> is important throughout the whole MDA process and discuss the integration <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> selection rules in the MDA approach. The platform selection rules have been implemented in the prototypical tool MDA Selector that provides automated support for the selection <b>of</b> a <b>platform.</b> The presented ideas are illustrated for a stock trading system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005...|$|R

40|$|Assuming the {{existence}} of a preferred aether frame and the anisotropy of the one-way speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in <b>platforms</b> different from the aether frame, we derive the space and time transformations relative to bodies moving in any direction of space and not only {{in the direction of the}} common x-axis of the co-ordinate systems under consideration. Taking for granted length contraction and clock retardation, we show that the experimental space-time transformations result from measurement distortions due to the fact that the length of the rods and the frequency of the clocks, used for the measure, do not have a constant value as a result of their motion through the aether, and because the standard synchronization procedures are affected by a synchronism discrepancy effect. When the motion of bodies is aligned along the common x-axis, the transformations assume the same mathematical form as the conventional transformations. However, their meaning is quite different because they have been derived on the basis of very different assumptions, and they arise from the measurement distortions mentioned above. Therefore they conceal hidden variables which are the true transformations. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figures. Further information is added and some difficult points are detaile...|$|R
