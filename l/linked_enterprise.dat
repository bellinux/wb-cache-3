As empresas necessitam estar atentas as mudanças no cenário mundial, para que possam {{responder}} rapidamente as mudanças de mercado. Para isso, a Web contribuiu possibilitando dinamismo, impactando com isso em um aumento significativo no volume de dados, que podem ser explorados, com o intuito de se obter benefícios. O <b>Linked</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Data é apresentado como um formato de dados que pode auxiliar os gestores na tomada de decisão, oportunizando explorar dados internos e externos a empresa, porém este conceito não é muito explorado no âmbito empresarial. Por este motivo o presente estudo objetiva-se em discutir os fatores que impedem a difusão de Linked Data neste contexto. Deste modo, observa-se que a cultura organizacional e alinhamento estratégico, entre outros, são alguns dos fatores encontrado para que não ocorra a difusão do <b>Linked</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Data. O que permite concluir que <b>Linked</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Data está começando a chamar atenção das empresas, mas se faz necessário mais trabalhos que abordem as reais contribuições ao meio empresarial, para difundir o Linked Data neste contexto. Companies need to {{be aware}} of changes in the global landscape, so they can respond quickly to market changes. For this purpose, the Web has contributed to the dynamism, thus impacting on a significant increase in the volume of data that can be exploited in order to obtain benefits. <b>Linked</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Data is presented as a concept that can help managers in decision making, allowing the exploration of internal and external data to the enterprise, but this concept is not much explored in the business scope. For this reason, the present study aims at discussing the factors that prevent the diffusion of Linked Data in this context. In this way, it is observed that the organizational culture and strategic alignment, among others, are some of the factors found so that the dissemination of <b>Linked</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Data does not occur. This allows us to conclude that <b>Linked</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Data is beginning to attract attention from companies, but more work is needed to address the real contributions to the business environment, to disseminate Linked Data in this context...|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : Short PapersInternational audienceEnterprises {{are part}} of value chains {{consisting}} of cross-enterprise business processes forming large business networks of customers, vendors, partners and competitors. These business process networks run on (technical) integration networks, which are semantically interlinked with the processes, while both are correlated to organizational (social) networks, consisting of technical and business domain experts. The insight into these networks promise a competitive advantage through the visibility into the <b>linked</b> <b>enterprise</b> data. However, this information is hidden in complex, dynamic and heterogeneous enterprise domains. In this position paper, we introduce the new domain of Business Network Management (BNM), which strives to make business networks visible within network views and sets them into context with each other. For that, we extend the Network Mining (NM) domain by a virtualized network approach towards a BNM. That means automatic discovery, mining and inference capabilities are combined with expert knowledge from different domains to compute the networks and a semantic correlation between entities of different perspectives. We comprehensively define the domain and discuss a system implementation, which we evaluated in a real-world customer case...|$|E

For this purpose this paper introduces Recognyze, a named entity linking component that uses background knowledge obtained from linked data repositories, and outlines the process of transforming heterogeneous data silos within an organization into a <b>linked</b> <b>enterprise</b> data repository which draws upon popular linked open data vocabularies to foster interoperability with public data sets. The presented examples use comprehensive real-world data sets from Orell Füssli Business Information, Switzerland’s largest business information provider. The linked data repository created from these data sets comprises more than nine million triples on companies, the companies ’ contact information, key people, products and brands. We identify the major challenges of tapping into such sources for named entity linking, and describe required data pre-processing techniques to use and integrate such data sets, with a special focus on disambiguation and ranking algorithms. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation based on business news from the New Journal of Zurich and AWP Financial News to illustrate how these techniques improve {{the performance of the}} Recognyze named entity linking component...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} be successful, {{enterprises}} have to adapt quickly to new opportunities and threats. They have to take smart decisions and execute fast. Innovation and agility become main success factors. The Management of Process Excellence (MPE) is a key enabler. It leads to a functioning “real-time enterprise”. MPE <b>links</b> <b>enterprise</b> strategy with people and technology for the highest opera-tional performance. Technologies such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) or the Web 2. 0 support this approach. Knowledge assets such as reference models increase productivity again. The resulting next generation enterprise is ready for long-term success. This chapter discusses MPE, an approach to achieve agility and innovation through Business Process Management. It describes the relation between process management and innovation and how next generation process automation can support that effort. Finally, an appropriate process governance approach for MPE is presented. 1 Management of Process Excellence (MPE) Requirement...|$|R

Organizations aim {{to achieve}} {{business}} and information systems alignment, but actually “feel ” and “suffer”, {{on a daily}} basis, the difficulties that inhibits the alignment achievement, in other words, the misalignments. This paper proposes a model, the Business and Information Systems MisAlignment Model (BISMAM), to understand, to classify and to manage misalignments. This proposal addresses the alignment problem combining misalignment approach with medical sciences approach based on a metaphor between misalignment and disease. The authors believe that the misalignment approach is closer to organizations real life and that medical sciences approach provides the relevant concepts and techniques for misalignment classification and management. Based on both academic research and years of professional consultancy, the authors propose an initial and possible instantiation to the BISMAM model, establishing a misalignment classification scheme that <b>links</b> <b>enterprise</b> architecture views, misalignment symptoms and causes, and defining techniques to detect, correct and prevent misalignments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInformation systems {{urbanization}} {{is among}} the most well-known approaches defined in the recent years to build agile information systems. This approach <b>links</b> <b>enterprise</b> architecture and information systems governance. It is based on the “Information City” framework and two architecture principles: strong consistency and loose coupling. Nevertheless, the implementation of the loose coupling principle in urbanized information systems still faces numerous difficulties related notably to services exchanges governance. In this paper, we propose a framework – called the four spaces model – for the governance of services in the case of application of the SOA architecture style to urbanized information systems. In particular, we focus on the operational aspects of services exchanges governance either within the same information system or between different information systems. This framework has many important contributions. First, it standardizes the exchanges between the organizational actors involved in the services governance process. Second, it facilitates services exchanges traceability. Third, it promotes loose coupling both within the same information system and between different information systems...|$|R

Despite their {{economic}} weight in European economy and their significance within a more flexible network economy, these very small businesses are {{to a large extent}} underexposed in research and policy. Especially with regard to ICT adoption and use, there is only limited understanding of the bottlenecks for business owners of micro-enterprises. This often leads to inaccurate presuppositions and interpretations in research and also in policy.

For a more substantiated view on this issue the article first identifies the main enabling and constraining factors for their ICT take-up based on socio-economic research in Flanders (Belgium).
