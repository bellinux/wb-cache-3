5|$|Although {{all of the}} {{original}} Class A1 locomotives were eventually rebuilt to Class A3 specifications, it was a drawn-out process that lasted until 1949; 60068 Sir Visto was the last locomotive to be converted. The changeover to <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> took longer, and continued into the Fifties.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed exclusively by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8—have been largely carried over from the VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever, facilitate the conversion to <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive.</b> Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{locomotives}} of {{the first}} production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> to improve the visibility of signals from the driver's side of the footplate. They also had higher running plates {{along the sides of}} the boiler than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels. Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.|$|E
50|$|Most Amphicars {{were sold}} in the United States. Cars {{were sold in}} the United Kingdom from 1964. Total {{production}} was 3,878 vehicles before the company folded. 99 right-hand drives were converted from <b>left-hand</b> <b>drives.</b> Some {{were used in the}} Berlin police department and others were fitted for rescue operations. The Boathouse at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida currently offers Amphicar rides to visiting patrons.|$|R
5000|$|By October 1950 {{the further}} {{improved}} 4AB Roadster appeared. While superficially similar, this has an {{independent front suspension}} by coil springs and a hybrid, [...] "hydro-mechanical" [...] brake system by Girling. Externally, there is a shortened bonnet and disc wheels, as well as fixed sides to the bonnet. The fenders were also redesigned, becoming curvier and deeper. The steering box also received alterations, mainly aimed at centering it in the chassis so as to simplify manufacturing alternately right-hand or <b>left-hand</b> <b>driven</b> examples. The 4AB continued in production alongside the larger 4AD until January 1953.|$|R

5|$|The car was {{initially}} slated to feature {{as part of}} the film Bean (1997), under the registration C607 EUW, in which as part of a sequence, it was driven through Harrods Department Store by Mr. Bean. Although the sequence was filmed, it {{was not included in the}} final cut. The car eventually had its debut on the big-screen when it featured in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday, with the registration YGL 572T. The film featured a second version of the same car, with exactly the same colour scheme, but with <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive,</b> driven by a character befriended by Bean.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{began to}} export {{vehicles}} in 1954, sending the FJ to New Zealand. Exports to New Zealand have continued ever since, but to broaden their export potential, Holden began to cater their Commodore, Monaro and Statesman/Caprice models for both right- and <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> markets. The Middle East is now Holden's largest export market, with the Commodore sold as the Chevrolet Lumina since 1998, and the Statesman since 1999 as the Chevrolet Caprice. Commodores are also sold as the Chevrolet Lumina in Brunei, Fiji and South Africa, {{and as the}} Chevrolet Omega in Brazil. Pontiac in North America also imported Commodore sedans from 2008 through to 2009 as the G8. The G8's cessation was a consequence of GM's Chapter 11 bankruptcy resulting in {{the demise of the}} Pontiac brand.|$|E
5|$|Holden's {{most popular}} car to date, the Commodore, was {{introduced}} in 1978 as the VB. The new family car was loosely based on the Opel Rekord E body shell, but with the front from the Opel Senator grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia. However, some of the compromises resulting from {{the adoption of a}} design intended for another market hampered the car's acceptance. In particular, it was narrower than its predecessor and its Falcon rival, making it less comfortable for three rear-seat passengers. With the abandonment of <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> markets, Holden exported almost 100,000 Commodores to markets such as New Zealand, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Malta and Singapore.|$|E

50|$|Both crew {{compartments}} {{are equipped}} {{in exactly the}} same way. It includes switch board, hand-brake and electric cooker on the <b>left-hand</b> side, <b>drive</b> controller, direction controller and brakes valves on the right-hand side. Air manometers and Hasler type train event recorder are mounted in front of the engineer's place. SHP (automatic train brake) button is located next to drive controller. Windscreens are equipped with 150W heater used during winter. Additional, 300W heater is located under the dashboard in order to heat crew's legs, but this was installed only in modernised 3E/1 version. Crew compartment A has washbasin and clothes locker installed. Sound horn and sander buttons are located on the floor.|$|R
5000|$|The Devaux Coupe is an Australian {{automobile}} {{released by}} Devaux Cars Pty Ltd in 2001. The Devaux Coupe {{was designed by}} David J Clash in Australia. It was named after his mother's maiden name (French ancestors) as the car {{was inspired by the}} great French coach builders of the 1930s. It is powered by a 3.4 liter Jaguar XR6 straight 6, or a GM LS1 5.7 V8 producing [...] and 470 Nm of torque. There is also a spyder variant, and the cars are available in both <b>left-hand</b> or right-hand <b>drive,</b> the gray coupe shown here being the former.|$|R
5|$|Production of the <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> European-spec i-MiEV {{began in}} October 2010. By {{the end of}} November 2010 {{cumulative}} production had reached 5,000 units at Mitsubitshi's Mizushima Plant. In May 2011 Mitsubishi announced a new production target of 25,000 i-MiEVs worldwide in fiscal year 2011. The carmaker also plans to export about 15,000 units overseas, mainly to Europe, where the company will promote sales to the European public sector, such as police departments and local governments. Production of the American-spec i electric car began in late October 2011. Since July 2009 Mitsubishi had manufactured more than 33,000 i-MiEVs and rebadge versions by March 2013, including more than 11,000 units rebadged in France as Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero, and sold in the European market.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{performance}} was disappointing. Jaguar {{had intended to}} produce up to 350 cars, but production ceased in 1994 with 275 production cars produced, not all {{of which had been}} sold; some <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> examples were still available in 1997. The recession left many of those who placed a deposit unable to complete the purchase. The index linking of contracts exacerbated the issue, and added almost £200,000 to the purchase price between early 1990 and mid-1992. The McLaren F1 suffered from similarly poor sales performance, with just 71 cars sold against McLaren's target of 300. McLaren's F1 program eventually turned a small profit thanks to the sale and servicing of the 28 GTR racing variants produced.|$|E
5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U class engines to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> cab layout to improve the driver’s forward vision from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox snifting valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|E
40|$|We present four {{examples}} of attenuation of the transformed phenotype {{caused by the}} root-inducing, left-hand, transferred DNA from Agrobacterium rhizogenes in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The first {{was associated with a}} genetic variable (homozygosity for the T-DNA), and the second was induced at the physiological level by putrescine and tyramine, suggesting that the transformed phenotype depends on defective polyamine metabolism. Physiological attenuation is further illustrated in the third example, in which the inhibition of flowering caused by P 35 S-rolA, a gene from the root-inducing, <b>left-hand,</b> transferred DNA <b>driven</b> by a strong viral promoter, was attenuated by grafting the transformed shoot onto non-transformed rootstock that had been induced to flower. Infertility in the resulting flowers was corrected by a mixture of putrescine and tyramine, indicating that P 35 S-rolA inhibited flowering through interference with polyamine conjugation and that tyramine was essential to fertility. A fourth example of attenuation of the transformed phenotype occurred in lateral branches of plants expressing rolA under the control of its native promoter. In these branches, reduction in the accumulation of rolA transcripts was correlated with the methylation of a site 3 [prime] to the rolA coding sequence; thus, the transformed plant seems capable of recognizing and repressing a gene that interferes with flowering...|$|R
5|$|From the onset, {{parent company}} General Motors was {{interested}} in incorporating a <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> Commodore in its Buick lineup, as manifested by the unveiling of the Buick XP2000 concept car in 1996. Although this idea was ultimately abandoned (due to pressures by the North American automotive trade unions to retain local production), the GM-funded project allowed Holden {{to enter into a}} range of left-hand export markets. Thus began the Commodore's rapid expansion into parts of Indochina, the Middle East and South Africa badged as the Chevrolet Lumina and Brazil as the Chevrolet Omega 3.8 V6. In its home market, the VT series was awarded the 1997 Wheels Car of the Year award, the fourth such award in Commodore's history. It found ready acceptance in the market as many buyers steered away from the slow selling Ford AU Falcon, becoming the best selling Commodore to date and cementing its place as number one in Australian sales.|$|E
25|$|U.S.-built <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> Matadors were {{exported}} to several European countries.|$|E
25|$|In August 1993, {{exports to}} Thailand commenced. In February 1996, Toyota Australia began {{exporting}} <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> Camrys to the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|While as a {{lecturer}} in the University of Lagos, Awojobi successfully converted his own family car, an Opel Olympia Rekord, from right-hand drive to a <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
25|$|The GTO {{model was}} revived from 2004 to 2006 model {{years as a}} captive import for Pontiac, a <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> version of the Holden Monaro, itself a coupé variant of the Holden Commodore.|$|E
25|$|The Proton Prevé had {{a planned}} 2014 launch in the United Kingdom. A <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> Prevé {{prototype}} was also caught in action in May 2012, hinting at a future launch in China and the Middle East as well.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{retaining}} {{the dimensions of}} the Titan TD7 and Tiger TS11, the 1945 Titan PD1 and Tiger PS1 were entirely new designs featuring a new E181 7.4-litre engine with pushrod valve operation and a brand new four-speed constant mesh gearbox. The export versions with an O prefix for overseas markets, the OPS1, not only had longer wheelbases (where legally applicable) but were equipped with the pre-war design overhead-camshaft E87 engine, which had the same nominal 100bhp output but was larger at 8.6 litres. No UK operator took the OPS1 but Potteries Motor Traction took a batch of long-wheelbase OPD1 Titans as single-deckers, later rebodying them as double decks once overall length rules had been relaxed to allow this. When fitted with <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive,</b> the Tiger became the LOPS1, this prefix attaching to all <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> Leyland buses (and Leyland-designed British United Traction trolleybuses) until the mid-1960s when later designs adopted a suffix letter for driving control position.|$|E
25|$|By 2006, the Hummer {{began to}} be {{exported}} and sold through importers and distributors in 33 countries. On October 10, 2006, GM began producing the Hummer H3 at its Port Elizabeth plant in South Africa for international markets. The Hummers built there at first were only <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive,</b> but right-hand drive versions were added and exported to Australia and other markets.|$|E
25|$|DMC-12s were {{primarily}} {{intended for the}} American market. All production models were therefore <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive.</b> Evidence survives from as early as April 1981, however, which indicates that the DeLorean Motor Company {{was aware of the}} need to produce a right-hand drive version to supply to world markets such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Z1 was {{produced}} from March 1989 to June 1991, and 8,000 cars were produced. All {{the cars were}} <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive,</b> and the majority (6,443) were sold in BMW's native German market. The country to receive the second-greatest number of Z1s, Italy, received less than 7% of the total sold domestically. BMW Z1 vehicles officially imported to France for sale there have yellow headlights instead of the clear ones found elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|General Motors {{revived the}} Chevrolet Caprice {{nameplate}} in the Middle East markets on imported Holden Statesman/Caprice built by its Australian subsidiary Holden. The WH series Statesman/Caprice {{was the first}} series to be engineered to support both left- and right-hand drive (Middle Eastern market being LHD while Australia right-hand drive) {{in order to allow}} for manufacturing of export versions. Same was true for the related short-wheelbase Holden VT Commodore, whose <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> version became the Chevrolet Lumina in the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|In July 2015, Proton {{signed a}} {{distributor}} agreement with Chile-based Andes Motor, {{and the first}} <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> Prevé and Exora evaluation units were shipped to Chile in November. On 1 March 2016, Proton commenced the first official shipment of 50 Prevé units, the first of an anticipated 1,000 Chilean bound Protons this year. The Chilean launch of the Proton Prevé commenced in May 2016 as planned. Three variants are available, namely Standard, Executive and Premium, ranging from $10,490 to $14,490. Both Standard and Executive variants are fitted with the 107hp CamPro IAFM+ engine and a five-speed manual transmission. The range topping Premium is equipped with the 138hp CamPro CFE/Turbo, paired to the updated ProTronic VT3+ CVT from the Suprima S. The Standard and Executive lines are only fitted with dual front airbags, while the Premium model offers additional twin side and twin curtain airbags. Nonetheless, Electronic Stability Control is standard on all Chilean market Prevés, along with a 5-year/150,000km warranty. The launch of the Prevé in Chile marks Proton's return to the market after an 18-year hiatus. Chile is currently Proton's only South American export market, and the first and thus far only country to receive the <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> Prevé.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1930s with Lioness frames {{exhausted}} {{the later}} full-size Normal-control Leyland-built single decks were called Tigresses, an L prefix was added for <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> versions, {{such as the}} large batch of LLTB3 ordered by Riga City Council. 71 of the ordered 90 of which were delivered to Latvia before {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. The only UK customers for Tigresses were exclusive up-market coach-tour firms like Southdown Motor Services who took the LTB3 (equivalent to the TS6) or the LTB5 (equivalent to the TS8).|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the floor}} shift lever also has another plane of operation, for manual mode, with {{spring-loaded}} + and − positions. This plane is selected {{by moving the}} stick away from the driver (in vehicles with the driver's seat on the right, the lever is pushed to the left, and in <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> cars, the stick is pushed to the right) when in D mode only. When this plane is selected, the DSG can now be controlled like a manual gearbox, albeit only under a sequential shift pattern.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Scania {{teamed up}} with MCW to make the Metro-Scania single-decker for the UK market based on the BR110MH, and since 1971 the BR111MH chassis. In 1973, it was {{replaced}} by the Metropolitan double-decker, built on the BR111DH chassis. Production ended in 1978, when the BR111 {{was replaced by the}} BR112. East Lancashire Coachbuilders (ELC) launched their low-entry MaxCi in 1993, one year after Scania's own <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> version. It was followed by the L113-based European in 1995 until 1996. In 2003, ELC was back with both the OmniDekka double-decker and the OmniTown midibus to complement Scania's own OmniCity.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the GT {{received}} a restyling. Outside there were new one-piece tail lights, grey plastic bumpers, C-pillar vents and side skirts; all bright stainless steel {{save for the}} Alfa Romeo triangular grille was changed to matte-black trim. The 1.6-litre version was discontinued and the Alfetta GTV became known simply as Alfa Romeo GTV2.0; the Alfetta name was dropped, but the two-litre coupé retained its type designation of 11636 for <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> and 11637 for right-hand drive. 15-inch disc-shaped alloy wheels were now standard, {{as opposed to the}} earlier cars' 14-inch pressed steel or optional 14-inch alloy.|$|E
25|$|Proton {{cars were}} also {{exported}} to several countries in Latin America, most notably Chile. Exports to Chile commenced in 1994, and almost 3,000 Protons were sold here {{prior to the}} company's departure in 1998. However, Proton later expressed intentions of returning to Chile following the ratification of the Malaysia-Chile Free Trade Agreement in 2012. In July 2015, Proton signed a distributor agreement with Andes Motor, and the first official shipment of 50 <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> Prevé units commenced on 1 March 2016. The Chilean launch of the Proton Prevé took place in May 2016, and formally marked Proton's return to Chile after an 18-year absence.|$|E
25|$|Ford had {{intended}} on developing {{the car with}} left-hand-drive export potential, and received federal and state government grants to assist, but in October 2007 it was announced by Ford Australia president Tom Gorman that the left-hand-drive Falcon project was to be abandoned and the export-incentive grant money would be directed to construction of the Ford Focus small-car in Australia. In the end, the Focus project did not proceed, and Asia-Pacific production of that model was instead started at a new plant in Thailand in June 2012. As the FG Falcon utilizes much of the previous model's architecture, converting it to <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> {{would have been a}} costly and time-consuming process.|$|E
25|$|After the {{development}} of the HQ series and the delays to the facelifted HJ which saw the revised HQ released in 1973, Holden intended to replace the second generations cars with a heavily revised WA series. Several design sketches in various forms have surfaced since the early-1990s, including a liftback body style. The 1973 fuel crisis along with a worsening financial situation, partly cause by the decision to build the HQ in right-hand drive only, thus limiting the previously highly profitable <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> exports, meant that the project was eventually abandoned. GM instead utilised the then forthcoming 1977 Opel Rekord, which was significantly re-engineered and released as the Commodore in 1978 with Holden's own powertrains.|$|E
25|$|The FJ cruiser was {{primarily}} {{developed for the}} North American market but has been sold in small numbers globally since its launch. On 25 November 2010, Toyota announced sales would begin in right-hand drive form for the Japanese market. Sales began on December 4, replacing the outgoing Hilux Surf and selling alongside the Land Cruiser. Japanese-produced right-hand drive models have a different rear bumper to North American models with the license plate located on the bumper as opposed to under the tailgate door handle. In addition, right-hand drive versions have the side indicator markers located on the fender panels, rather than located on the side-view mirrors used for <b>left-hand</b> <b>drive</b> production FJ Cruisers. Sales of right-hand drive model began in Australia and New Zealand in 2011 available in four-wheel drive automatics only.|$|E
