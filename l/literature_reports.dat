25|$|In North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity {{is often}} packed, perhaps with cloth, {{in an attempt}} to protect the healing wound. However, {{evidence}} from emergency medicine <b>literature</b> <b>reports</b> that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, bring more rapid healing, or lead to fewer physician visits.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "detoxification" [...] {{program was}} created by L. Ron Hubbard, who set out the {{procedure}} in Clear Body, Clear Mind, one of the canonical texts of Scientology. Known as the [...] "Purification rundown" [...] or [...] "Purif," [...] it is promoted through various groups affiliated with the Church of Scientology, including Narconon drug rehabilitation and the Second Chance Program. It claims to flush poisons from the body's fat stores using exercise, saunas, and high doses of vitamins, particularly niacin. Medical professionals have judged it to be unproven, ineffective and/or potentially dangerous. A report for the Department of Health in California described the mega-doses of vitamins as [...] "hazardous" [...] and [...] "in some cases lethal." [...] Scientology's own <b>literature</b> <b>reports</b> dehydration, electrolyte disturbances including hyponatremia (low sodium level) and hypokalemia (low potassium level), and heat-related illnesses as being frequent side-effects of the program. Testimonials from some participants credit it with improvements in physical and mental health, but several families blame the Rundown {{for the death of}} a relative.|$|E

30|$|As {{presented}} in Table  4 the Cd concentration of {{present study is}} {{within the range of}} minimum concentration determined in Japan’s cigarette (Zhang et al. 2005) and maximum concentration obtained in the France cigarette (Zhang et al. 2005) (Table  4). The concentration of Pb obtained by this method is less than all the <b>literature</b> <b>report.</b> Similarly Ni in processed Shewa Robit and Billate is less than all other <b>literature</b> <b>report.</b> However, the Ni concentration determined in Nyala is within the range minimum report (2.32  μg/g) (Stojanovic et al. 2004) and maximum content of Germany’s (9.11  μg/g dry mass) cigarette (Saldivar et al. 1991).|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} serve as a <b>literature</b> <b>report</b> for the SHC IEA Task 34/ECBCS Annex 43 [...] an {{extensive}} description of modeling approaches and methods for DSF was added in the existing <b>literature</b> review <b>report</b> (in 2006), covering modeling issues including airflow and thermal simulations. In his PhD thesis, an analysis of different Double Skin Facade types is carried out and conclusions are drawn for integration in Nordic climatic conditions.|$|R

50|$|The bantam sunfish has {{no known}} predators. Many predatory fish coexist in the habitat of bantam sunfish; however, {{predation}} {{has not been}} documented in <b>literature</b> <b>reports.</b> One extensive study at Wolf Lake, Illinois {{found no evidence of}} predation on the bantam sunfish. Gut analysis of potential predators, including largemouth bass, black crappie, white crappie, warmouth, bluegill, and yellow bullhead revealed a lack of predation on bantam sunfish.|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} the rationale, methods and outcomes of a rapid evidence review conducted {{to identify the}} available evidence to inform two research questions asked by the World Health Organization (WHO) Scientific Technical Advisory Committee; 1. What does the <b>literature</b> <b>report</b> {{on the effects of}} marketing of commercially available complementary food (including drink) products for infants and young children, on the feeding attitudes and behaviours of their caregivers? 2. What do recent systematic reviews of the <b>literature</b> <b>report</b> regarding the effects of marketing of: child-oriented food products, pharmaceutical products, BMS, alcohol, tobacco and tobacco related products to women especially parents, on outcomes which will usefully inform the primary research question...|$|R
30|$|We {{contribute}} to the <b>literature</b> <b>reported</b> above by explicitly investigating {{the existence of a}} mismatch between regional premium to wages and productivity in Belgium. We do so by jointly estimating a productivity and a wage equation, similar to Van Biesebroeck (2008).|$|R

50|$|Transjugular {{intrahepatic}} portosystemic shunt procedures, or TIPS involve decompressing {{the portal}} vein by shunting a portal venule {{to a lower}} pressure systemic venule, under guidance with fluoroscopy. Since it treats {{the root cause of}} portal hypertension gastropathy, it has been putatively used for the condition. The <b>literature</b> <b>reports</b> suggest both regression of portal hypertensive gastropathy on endoscopic images and improvement in bleeding after TIPS.|$|E
5000|$|Patients {{historically}} {{referred for}} apicoaortic conduit surgery {{have been considered}} high risk or ineligible for conventional aortic valve replacement. The <b>literature</b> <b>reports</b> generally favorable outcomes for apicoaortic surgery given the age, frailty, and comorbidities of the patient population. Patients typically improve from New York Heart Association Functional Classification III or IV to Class I or II. AVB effectively relieves the LVOTO caused by aortic stenosis.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>literature</b> <b>reports</b> {{it to be}} {{approximately}} 30 kDa, or approximately 27 kDa. The predicted size is 33.9 KDa. For the bovine enzyme a range of sizes between approximately 33 kDa and about 36 KDa is reported (Nandi, 1979, Vessey, 1992, van der Westhuizen, 2000). The predicted size of bovine GLYAT based on its sequence (accession number nm: 177486), is 33.9 kDa. This compares well to the experimentally determined sizes ...|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae {{vertebral}} infections {{have rarely}} been reported. Herein, we report {{a case of}} pneumococcal vertebral osteomyelitis with paraspinal and epidural abscesses as well as concomitant bacteremia following epidural injection. This will be the second case in the <b>literature</b> <b>reporting</b> pneumococcal vertebral osteomyelitis related to epidural manipulation...|$|R
30|$|The {{entrapment}} efficiency (EE) of γ-PGA-coated Dox lipoplexes {{was evaluated}} by the ultrafiltration (UF) method according to the <b>literature</b> <b>reported</b> [24]. The in vitro release experiment was investigated by dialysis bag method at 37  °C with constant shaking at 100  rpm. All the experiments were measured in triplicate.|$|R
50|$|The medical {{community}} was initially skeptical of MSbP's existence, but it gradually gained acceptance as a recognized condition. There {{are now more}} than 2,000 case reports of MSbP in the professional <b>literature.</b> <b>Reports</b> come from developing countries, as well as the U.S., with one case from 2012 - 2013, in Orlando, Florida, and the most recent in Westchester, New York, in early 2015. Other reports come from Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and Oman.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, Oury {{and others}} {{established}} CEPI, the Collective of Teams of Institutional Pedagogy (French Le Collectif des Équipes de Pédagogie Institutionnelle), and the MPI, Association for the Support of Institutional Pedogagy (Association Maintenant la Pédagogie Institutionnelle), both still in existence. Their primary tasks are the publication {{and dissemination of}} institutional pedagogic <b>literature,</b> <b>reports,</b> analyses and case-studies, the promotion and activism in favour of progressive pedagogic practices, and the education of teachers, social workers and others in Institutional Pedagogic practices.|$|E
50|$|While no {{scientific}} <b>literature</b> <b>reports</b> a crystal {{image of a}} kynurenine 3-monooxygenase complex with L-kynurenine, structural studies of the enzyme in yeast co-crystallized with UPF 648 reveal how the FAD cofactor and substrate are bound in the active site. Chemical similarities between UPF 648 and L-kynurenine suggest that the substrate binds adjacent to the re-face of the flavoprotein. A loop containing the residues Pro 321 - Gln 325 {{is believed to be}} the oxygen-binding site above the re-side of the FAD prosthetic group.|$|E
30|$|Critical points F 2, F 4 and F 5 {{correspond}} {{at which}} the selectivity margins (CTI 2 and CTI 3) between distance relays and over current relays are at minimum. The <b>literature</b> <b>reported</b> research work done for combine distance and over current relay coordination is discussed as under.|$|R
50|$|A 2006 {{review of}} the medical <b>literature</b> <b>reported</b> a number of {{beneficial}} effects for chamomile in in vitro and animal tests, but added more human clinical trials are needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn. Research with animals suggests antispasmodic, anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory and some antimutagenic and cholesterol-lowering effects for chamomile.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a growing}} body of {{epidemiologic}} <b>literature</b> <b>reporting</b> associations between atmospheric pollutants and reproductive outcomes, particularly birth weight and gestational duration.

50|$|P. shigelloides {{has been}} {{isolated}} {{from a wide}} variety of human clinical specimens including both intestinal and extra-intestinal. It has been isolated from the feces of humans, both with and without diarrhea, and/or vomiting (gastroenteritis). Many <b>literature</b> <b>reports</b> state or imply that P. shigelloides can cause diarrhea/gastroenteritis in humans. However, isolation from the feces of a case with diarrhea should not lead to the conclusion that the strain of P. shigelloides is actually causing the diarrhea in the case; i.e. association does not prove causation.|$|E
5000|$|Explanatory {{models for}} the {{phenomenology}} and {{the elements of the}} NDE can, according to sources, be divided into a few broad categories: psychological, physiological, and transcendental. Agrillo, adopting a more parsimonious overview, notes that <b>literature</b> <b>reports</b> two main theoretical frameworks: (1) “biological/psychological” interpretation (in-brain theories), or (2) “survivalist” interpretation (out-of-brain theories). The research on NDEs often include variables from all three models. [...] In a study published in 1990, Owens, Cook and Stevenson presented results that lent support to all of these three interpretations.|$|E
50|$|Developmentally, {{people with}} {{tetrasomy}} X frequently show mild {{delays in the}} areas of speech development and articulation, language expression and understanding, and reading skills. Delays in motor development are also present, with walking ages ranging from 16 months to 4.5 years. About 50% of patients undergo puberty normally, whereas the other 50% experiences no puberty, partial puberty without secondary sexual characteristics, or complete puberty with menstrual irregularities and/or early menopause (possibly as early as the teens). Medical <b>literature</b> <b>reports</b> four tetra-X pregnancies, two healthy, one with trisomy 21, one stillborn with omphalocele.|$|E
50|$|The Institute has {{undertaken}} extensive research {{in a number}} of areas.

25|$|A {{review of}} the <b>literature</b> <b>reported</b> that cocaine use causes {{congenital}} defects between 15 and 20% of the time; however another large-scale study found no difference in rates of birth anomalies in PCE and non-PCE infants. It {{has been suggested that}} some birth defects could be due to cocaine's disruption of blood vessel growth.|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{studies in}} <b>literature</b> <b>report</b> a {{concrete}} {{relationship between the}} low-level visual features of multimedia contents such as ‘lighting key’, ‘shot length’, ‘color’, ‘motion’, and emotional states induced to people while watching these contents. Thus, these four visual features were extracted from the music video clips and explained in detail in the following sections.|$|R
