50|$|During the Academy Course, pilots learn {{maneuvers}} like Stall, Spin, <b>Lazy</b> <b>Eight,</b> Barrel Roll, Looping, Split-S, Chandelle, Immelmann and Cuban Eight. AFA {{pilots are}} able to sustain two and four aircraft formations as wingmen, and are also able to perform nearly 2000 mi navigation with full understanding of both visual and instrumental flight rules and night flights.|$|E
5000|$|The LH-10 Ellipse {{is ideal}} for {{training}} and pilot training; It has a tandem configuration and a glass cockpit adjustable front and rear. Thus, the drivers quickly become operational and versatile, that can provide a variety of missions. The LH-10 Ellipse enhances the educational work (low failure rate, evaluation of {{the potential of the}} student, using the aircraft extended range ...), it allows to master the training costs and direct training (low cost of flight hour ...) and indirect (simple logistic monitoring, simple maintenance ...). It is also ideal for learning the combat of basic figures (barrel roll, upset, <b>lazy</b> <b>eight</b> ...) ...|$|E
2500|$|The CT-134 was {{approved}} for limited aerobatics, including loops, rolls, chandelles and <b>lazy</b> <b>eights</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The term {{can also}} refer to an {{aircraft}} certified under American, Canadian, European or Australian regulations as a Utility Category Aircraft, {{which indicates that}} it is permitted to conduct limited aerobatics. The approved maneuvers include chandelles, <b>lazy</b> <b>eights,</b> spins and steep turns over 60Â° of bank.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the Volksplane is {{relatively}} straightforward, and, {{according to some}} home builders, almost like building a [...] "giant model aircraft". Flying characteristics are relatively benign, as the intent {{was to create a}} simple, and easy-to-fly aircraft. Although not intended to be an aerobatic design, gentle [...] "aileron rolls, <b>lazy</b> <b>eights,</b> wingovers, chandelles and steep stalls" [...] have been conducted. A total of approximately 6,000 plans have been sold to date.|$|R
2500|$|The Club Libelle was type {{certified}} in Germany {{as well as}} in the United States. The US certification was granted on 8 September 1975 and includes aerobatic approval for spins, loops, hammerhead turns and <b>lazy</b> <b>eights.</b> Due to its fibreglass construction, the aircraft's certification contains the restriction: [...] "All external portions of the glider exposed to sunlight must be painted white. Registration and competition numbers must be painted blue-gray or in any other light color." ...|$|R
50|$|A152 Aerobat: Two-seat aerobatic-capable aircraft, 315 built. Certified for +6/-3 Gs and had {{standard}} four-point harnesses, skylights and jettisonable doors, {{along with}} a checkerboard paint scheme and removable seat cushions to allow parachutes to be worn by the crew. Type approved in 1977 and produced as 1978 to 1985 model years. The following aerobatic maneuvers are approved: chandelles, steep turns, barrel rolls, snap rolls, loops, vertical reversements, <b>lazy</b> <b>eights,</b> spins, aileron rolls, Immelmann turns, Cuban Eights and stalls (except whip stalls).|$|R
50|$|In 2003 Service Bulletin 315-64/2 {{reduced the}} maximum {{admissible}} airspeeds and prohibited aerobatic flight. This {{was due to}} reports that {{the design of the}} fuselage may not have been sufficient to sustain limit loads during certain maneuvers and during flight at certain speeds. Grob completed further investigations into the effects of certain flight conditions on the fuselage structure and the development of corrective procedures. Further static strength tests were conducted to verify the safety margin of the fuselage. The results of these tests restored the original flight speed limitations and maneuver operations for the Twin II and allowed the Twin II Acro only basic aerobatic maneuvers (spins, <b>lazy</b> <b>eights,</b> chandelles, stall turns, steep turns, and positive loops). An approved modification, when incorporated, restores full acrobatic status to these sailplanes.|$|R
