50|$|To create rewritable {{paper the}} {{researchers}} used four oxazolidines. Some of the isomers of these oxazolidines are colourless {{in the absence}} of water. But when the paper is wetted the water changes the dyes’ absorption of visible light. The exact wavelengths absorbed vary with the compound used, which allows printing in a variety of colours. The rewriteable paper was made by first coating ordinary paper with a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>polyethylene</b> glycol (PEG) to prevent it reacting with the dye, before a second layer of PEG containing the chosen dye was laid on top. Finally, another layer of PEG was added to prevent the dye absorbing water from the air or, conversely, losing water too quickly. The team used a commercial inkjet printer and a cartridge filled with water to print trial documents. The printed page is dry to the touch and the print can be rapidly ‘erased’ by heating it to 70 °C. The print remained legible for around 22 hours before evaporation wiped the page clean. Paper prepared in this way can be printed on and then erased more than 50 times.|$|E

We use x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature induced conductivity measurements to study the morphological and chemical changes responsible for the large current-induced conductivity changes. It is found that by applying a large current to the organic-inorganic semiconductor rectifying heterojunction structure Au/PEDT:PSS/SiAu∕PEDT:PSS∕Si, the ratio of PEDT+PEDT+ to PSS−PSS− near the interface changes due to phase segregation in the presence of both high electric field (> 105  V/cm) (> 105 V∕cm) and temperature.

All silages were made following three durations of wilting (0, 24 or 48 h). Wilting restricted silage fermentation, with silage pH being highest (P< 0. 001) and the concentration of fermentation products lowest (P< 0. 001) for the 48 h wilt treatment. Wrapping bales in only 2 <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>polyethylene</b> stretch film resulted in extensive visible mould growth, but mould growth was practically eliminated by the application of 4 or more <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> film. Silage fermentation characteristics were generally improved by wilting, and by 4 compared to 2 <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> stretch film. Extending the storage duration of baled silage from 7 to 18 months reduced (P< 0. 001) the concentration of fermentation products and increased in-silo fresh weight losses (P< 0. 001) and visible mould growth. Whereas 4 <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> conventional stretch film are normally sufficient, 6 layers may be necessary to prevent mould growth when bales of unwilted silage are stored for a second season.
