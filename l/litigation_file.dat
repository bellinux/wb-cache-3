The insurance crisis is not connected to an upheaval of disasters but {{to an increase in}} the cost of <b>litigation</b> <b>files.</b> From the perspective of the care providers the most important problems are the high settlements costs of the process and their stigmatizing effect. In order to adress theese problems a no-faultcompensation system (NFCS) has been introduced in New Zealand, Northern Europe countries and France.
