Forty MALT strains (19 cagPAI (-) and 21 cagPAI (+)) and 39 cagPAI frequency-matched gastritis strains (17 cagPAI (-) and 22 cagPAI (+)) were included in this study. The lipopolyssacharide for each strain was extracted using a hot phenol method and the expression of Le(x) and Le(y) were investigated using Western Blot. The data were analyzed according to the strains' cagPAI status and vacA genotype. Le(x) was identified in 21 (52. 5 %) MALT strains and 29 (74. 3 %) gastritis strains. Le(y) was identified in 30 (75 %) MALT strains and 31 (79. 5 %) gastritis strains. There was an association between cagPAI positivity and Le(x) expression among MALT strains (p< 0. 0001), but not in gastritis strains (p = 0. 64). Among cagPAI (-) strains, isolates expressing solely Le(y) were associated with MALT with an odds ratio of 64. 2 (95 % CI 4. 9 - 841. 0) when compared to strains expressing both Le(x) and Le(y). vacA genotypes did not modify the association between <b>Lewis</b> <b>antigen</b> expression and disease status.

METHODS: The structural relationship between HE 4 and <b>Lewis</b> y <b>antigen</b> was examined using immunoprecipitation and confocal laser scanning microscopy. HE 4 and Lewis y were detected in tissues from malignant (53 cases), borderline (27 cases), benign (15 cases) and normal ovarian tissues (15 cases) using immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: HE 4 was present in ovarian cancer, benign tumor tissues, ovarian carcinoma cells, and culture medium, and contained <b>Lewis</b> y <b>antigen.</b> Moreover, expression of <b>Lewis</b> y <b>antigen</b> in HE 4 from ovarian cancer was higher than that from benign tumor (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{dendritic}} cell-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN {{functions as}} a pathogen receptor that recognizes Schistosoma mansoni egg antigens through its major glycan epitope Galbeta 1, 4 (Fucalpha 1, 3) GlcNAc (Lex). Here we report that L-SIGN, a highly related homologue of DC-SIGN found on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, binds to S. mansoni egg antigens {{but not to the}} Lex epitope. L-SIGN does bind the <b>Lewis</b> <b>antigens</b> Lea, Leb, and Ley, similar as DC-SIGN. A specific mutation in the carbohydrate recognition domain of DC-SIGN (V 351 G) abrogates binding to all <b>Lewis</b> <b>antigens.</b> In L-SIGN Ser 363 is present at the corresponding position of Val 351 in DC-SIGN. Replacement of this Ser into Val resulted in a "gain of function" L-SIGN mutant that binds to Lex, and shows increased binding to the other <b>Lewis</b> <b>antigens.</b> These data indicate that Val 351 is important for the fucose specificity of DC-SIGN. Molecular modeling and docking of the different <b>Lewis</b> <b>antigens</b> in the carbohydrate recognition domains of L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, and their mutant forms, demonstrate that Val 351 in DC-SIGN creates a hydrophobic pocket that strongly interacts with the Fucalpha 1, 3 / 4 -GlcNAc moiety of the <b>Lewis</b> <b>antigens.</b> The equivalent amino acid residue Ser 363 in L-SIGN creates a hydrophilic pocket that prevents interaction with Fucalpha 1, 3 -GlcNAc in Lex but supports interactions with the Fucalpha 1, 4 -GlcNAc moiety in Lea and Leb antigens.

Lewis antigens are expressed by H. pylori in a growth phase–dependent manner, with the greatest expression occurring in the logarithmic phase of growth. As growth proceeds, an increasing amount of Lewis antigens are shed into the culture supernatant. <b>Lewis</b> <b>antigen</b> expression among H. pylori isolates from asymptomatic individuals is characterized by an absence of type I Lewis antigens, a decrease in Lex expression, and an increase in nontypeable H. pylori, as compared with that among H. pylori isolates from symptomatic patients.

The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori infects ∼ 50 % of the world’s population [1]. All those infected experience a super-ficial gastritis, although many do not seek medical treatment. In a substantial number of individuals, the infection is not diagnosed and therefore is considered to be asymptomatic [2]. It has been reported that ∼ 10 % of people infected with H. pylori progress to the more serious pathologies, such as gastric or duodenal ulcer, and an even smaller proportion of infected in-dividuals progress to lymphoma or gastric cancer [2].

Sixty-eight strains of H. pylori were isolated from patients with chronic gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and gastric cancer in Japan. The cells were treated with proteinase K, and the resulting fractions were used {{as a source of}} LPS for the immunoassays. In the immunoblot analysis, 28 isolates (41 %) and 29 isolates (42 %) reacted with anti-Le(x) and anti-Le(y) MAbs, respectively, while 4 isolates (6 %) and 7 isolates (10 %) reacted with anti-Le(a) and anti-Le(b) MAbs.

40|$|BACKGROUND—In normal gastric epithelium, MUC 5 AC is {{detected}} in superficial epithelium associated with Lewis type 1  antigens and MUC 6 {{is detected}} in antral glands with Lewis type 2.  Therefore, the stomach constitutes an excellent model {{to examine the}} role of glycosyltransferases in determining the specificity of apomucin glycosylation.  AIMS—To determine the molecular basis of this association and to examine changes in expression of gastric and intestinal apomucins and their association with Lewis antigens during the gastric carcinogenesis process.  METHODS—Fucosyltransferase (FUT 1, FUT 2, FUT 3) and mucin (MUC 5 AC, MUC 6) transcripts were detected using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Apomucin (MUC 2, MUC 4, MUC 5 AC, MUC 6) and <b>Lewis</b> <b>antigen</b> (types 1  and 2) expression were analysed using single and double immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation.  RESULTS—In the normal stomach, FUT 1 is exclusively detected associated with MUC 6; FUT 2 is only detected when MUC 5 AC is present. This co-regulation is lost in gastric tumours, as is differential expression of MUC 5 AC and MUC 6 in normal gastric epithelial cells. In gastric tumours, especially those with the intestinal phenotype, MUC 2 and MUC 4 genes are upregulated, and gastric-type and intestinal-type mucins are coexpressed. These changes are early events in the gastric carcinogenesis process, as they are detected in intestinal metaplasia.  CONCLUSIONS—The glycosylation pattern found in normal gastric epithelium is dictated by the specific set of fucosyltranferases expressed by the cells {{rather than by the}} apomucin sequence. The development of intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer is associated with the appearance of cellular phenotypes that are absent from normal epithelium.    Keywords: fucosyltransferases; gastric carcinogenesis; gastric mucins; <b>Lewis</b> <b>antigen...</b>|$|E

The structural relationship between <b>Lewis</b> y <b>antigen</b> and CD 44 was determined by immunoprecipitation and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The adhesion and spreading of RMG-I and RMG-I-H cells on hyaluronic acid (HA) were observed. The expression of CD 44 mRNA in RMG-I and RMG-I-H cells was detected by real-time RT-PCR. Results Immunocytochemistry revealed that the expression of CD 44 was significantly higher in RMG-I-H cells than in RMG-I cells (P P P P P > 0. 05). Conclusion <b>Lewis</b> y <b>antigen</b> strengthens CD 44 -mediated adhesion and spreading of ovarian cancer cells. </p...|$|R

Our previous studies have shown that <b>Lewis</b> (y) <b>antigen</b> plays a positive role in the process of invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which <b>Lewis</b> (y) <b>antigen</b> enhances the invasion and tumor metastasis are still unknown. In this study, we established a stable cell line constitutively expressing <b>Lewis</b> (y) <b>antigen</b> (RMG- 1 -hFUT) by transfecting the cDNA encoding part of the human α 1, 2 -fucosyltransferase (α 1, 2 -FUT) gene into the ovarian cancer cell line RMG- 1, and investigated whether <b>Lewis</b> (y) <b>antigen</b> regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) and MMP- 9, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP- 1) and TIMP- 2. We found that RMG- 1 -hFUT cells exhibited higher invasive capacities than their control cells. In addition, expression of TIMP- 1 andInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2010, 11 4442 TIMP- 2 was down-regulated and expression of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 was up-regulated...|$|R
