25|$|Early {{announcements}} send signals {{not only}} to customers and the media, but also to providers of support products, regulatory agencies, financial analysts, investors, and other parties. For example, an early announcement can relay information to vendors, <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> to prepare marketing and shelf space. It can signal third-party developers to begin work on their own products, {{and it can be}} used to persuade a company's investors that they are actively developing new, profitable ideas. When IBM announced its Professional Workstation computer in 1986, they noted the lack of third-party programs written for it at the time, signaling those developers to start preparing. Microsoft usually announces information about its operating systems early because third-party developers are dependent on that information to develop their own products.|$|E
25|$|After his {{childhood}} in Troy, New York, and Rutland, Vermont, Jackson enlisted in October 1862 as a 19-year-old private in Company K of the 12th Vermont Infantry of the Union Army Jackson {{spent much of his}} free time sketching drawings of his friends and various scenes of Army camp life that he sent home to his family as his way of <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> he was safe. He served in the American Civil War for nine months including one major battle, the Battle of Gettysburg. Jackson spent most of his tour on garrison duty and helped guard a supply train during the engagement. His regiment mustered out on July 14, 1863. Jackson then returned to Rutland, where he worked as an artistic painter in post-Civil War American society. Having broken his engagement to Miss Carolina Eastman, he left Vermont for the American West.|$|E
500|$|The team {{breaks into}} TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, {{planning}} {{to replace the}} new novel with their old version before the mass printing begins. However, when they reach the printing room, the book publishing executive shows up {{with a group of}} armed men. He reveals that someone tipped him off about their plan, just as Lisa appears <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> it was her because she wants her name on a book that will actually be popular. The executive types in the password in the printing machine and gives Lisa the honor of inserting the USB flash drive with the novel on it. Later, when the saddened members of the group-writing team are walking away from the headquarters, they pass a book store and discover that The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy is being put on the stands. Lisa shows up again, <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> that she only pretended to betray them so that the publisher would type in the password. When Lisa gave Bart a hug, she replaced the executive's flash drive with Bart's flash drive that contained the troll novel. As a result, she was able to put the original version into print. Lisa is happy to know that her name is finally on a book; however, when she opens a copy, she discovers that Gaiman is listed as the author, not her. It turns out that there were three flash drives and that Gaiman heisted his way to the best-seller list [...] "once again" [...] despite being illiterate. During the credits, it is revealed that Moe was aware of Gaiman's scheme, and was in fact allied with him from the start. The two celebrate with a toast at Shelbyville Beach, but Gaiman double-crosses Moe and poisons his drink.|$|E

After spying the male costumes she took as her only memory of her time with Kitty, Nan begins to walk the streets of London as a man and easily passes. She is solicited by a man for sex and begins renting, but dressed only as a man for male clients, never <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> she is a woman. She meets a socialist activist named Florence who lives near the boarding house, but before she can get to know her, Nan is hired by a wealthy widow with licentious tastes named Diana. Although realising—and initially enjoying—that she is an object to Diana and her friends, Nan stays with her for over a year as [...] "Neville", dressed in the finest men's clothes Diana can afford. The relationship erodes, however, and Diana throws Nan into the streets.|$|E
500|$|... "La Llamada" [...] was {{the first}} song {{recorded}} for Live! (1993). It was written by Selena y Los Dinos backup singer Pete Astudillo and Selena's brother, principal record producer and songwriter A. B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Quintanilla III and Argentine music producer Bebu Silvetti. The song {{was intended to be}} one of three studio tracks for Selena's Live! album. Astudillo and Quintanilla III had spent an hour writing a song together. They wanted to write a song on a topic that many women face with their boyfriends. Quintanilla III had wanted to empower women, <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> that they should hold their heads up and remember that life goes on. Selena favored the lyrical content and central theme, a common one in her songs. [...] "La Llamada" [...] was recorded in Corpus Christi, Texas, at Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.'s recording studio Q-Productions. Before Live! was released, the song was mixed by Brian [...] "Red" [...] Moore, a family friend. Because Selena favored the song, the band released a music video. It was filmed in a beach house in Malibu, California. The video features Selena dancing with guys on one side and woman on the other. In other scenes, Selena is belting the lyrics behind blue curtains.|$|E
500|$|Rumors of Anastasia's {{survival}} were {{embellished with}} various contemporary reports of trains and houses being searched for [...] "Anastasia Romanov" [...] by Bolshevik soldiers and secret police. When she was briefly imprisoned at Perm in 1918, Princess Helena Petrovna, {{the wife of}} Anastasia's distant cousin, Prince John Constantinovich of Russia, reported that a guard brought a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked if the girl {{was the daughter of}} the Tsar. Helena Petrovna said she did not recognize the girl and the guard took her away. Although other witnesses in Perm later reported that they saw Anastasia, her mother and sisters in Perm after the murders, this story is now widely discredited. Rumors that they were alive were fueled by deliberate misinformation designed {{to hide the fact that}} the family was dead. A few days after they had been murdered, the German government sent several telegrams to Russia demanding [...] "the safety of the princesses of German blood". Russia had recently signed a peace treaty with the Germans, and did not want to upset them by <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> the women were dead, so they told them they had been moved to a safer location.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{stories that}} were {{centered}} on scientific inventions and set in the future, in the tradition of Jules Verne, were appearing regularly in popular fiction magazines. [...] The first science fiction (sf) magazine, Amazing Stories, was launched in 1926 by Hugo Gernsback {{at the height of the}} pulp magazine era. [...] It was successful, and helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre, but in February 1929 Gernsback lost control of the publisher when it went bankrupt. [...] By April he had formed a new company, Gernsback Publications Incorporated, and created two subsidiaries: Techni-Craft Publishing Corporation and Stellar Publishing Corporation. In the middle of the year he launched three new magazines: a non-sf magazine titled Radio Craft, and two sf pulps titled Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories. [...] These were followed in September 1929 by the first issue of Science Wonder Quarterly, and in October Gernsback sent a letter to some of the writers he had already bought material from, <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> that he was seeing more demand for [...] "detective or criminal mystery stories with a good scientific background". [...] He named Arthur B. Reeve's [...] "Craig Kennedy" [...] stories as an example, and also mentioned S.S. Van Dine's [...] "Philo Vance" [...] stories, which were very popular at the time. [...] In the January 1930 issue of both the sf magazines, Gernsback advertised the new magazine that he hoped to populate with these stories: Scientific Detective Monthly.|$|E

The normal procedure, as Inayat Khan knew, was that when an agent went to the field, Vera would send out a periodic [...] "good news" [...] letters to the family, <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> the person concerned was well. If the agent went missing, the family would be told so. What Inayat Khan was suggesting was that bad news should be broken to her mother only if it was beyond any doubt that she was dead. Vera said she would agree to this arrangement if it was what she wanted. With this assurance Inayat Khan seemed content and confident once more. Any doubts in Vera's mind were also now settled.|$|E
2500|$|As Secretary, Cisneros {{attacked}} head on fair housing policies. [...] “Fair housing,” he told Guy Gugliotta of the Washington Post, “is so {{vital that}} we cannot accomplish {{any of the}} other goals without it.” [...] He unveiled a plan for HUD to provide $70 million in housing vouchers enabling low-income Americans to rent living space in the communities of their choice, an idea that brought Cisneros criticism in affluent circles in his native Texas and elsewhere. [...] When it came to justice in home loans, Cisneros, through his agency, stood firm to lenders by <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> that HUD would no longer tolerate unfairly denying minorities access to home loans, and aggressively penalized lenders who broke fair lending laws. [...] The department also made it easier for alleged victims of fair housing to file complaints. During Cisneros's four-year term, the agency's decisions in favor of victims of housing discrimination resulted in the awarding of a total of $80 million in damages, compared with $13 million in the previous four years. Cisneros greatly eased the bureaucracy to deal with fair housing issues much swifter. [...] "The train started to run on time," [...] with complaints being heard much faster, said John Relman of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. [...] "It's hard to find somebody in that position who could be more supportive of fair housing than Henry Cisneros." ...|$|E
2500|$|The group {{eventually}} {{reaches the}} Red Emperor's court, where Harap Alb makes known his intention of leaving with the girl. The father is displeased by the news, but undecided {{about how he}} should treat the visitors. In the end, he opts in favor of tricking them, offering them residence in a copper house, which he has ordered heated to an oven-like temperature. Gerilă, who has the foresight of entering ahead of his companions, proceeds to cool down the entire structure. In his attempt to delay the matter further, the Red Emperor then invites the group to a magnificent feast, and witnesses with alarm how his food and drink are rapidly consumed by Flămânzilă and Setilă. The emperor then decides to impose a test on Harap Alb and the others: that of sorting out a mierță (some 200 liters) of poppy seed from an equivalent quantity of fine sand {{in the space of}} one night, which Harap Alb manages with assistance from the ants. The monarch then tells the heroes that, if they want his daughter, they are to guard and follow for another night, <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> that he does not know her ways. At midnight, the princess tuns into a bird and escapes the palace, but, even though she takes refuge in the most inaccessible places, from [...] "the shadow of the rabbit" [...] {{to the far side of}} the Moon, she is tracked down by Ochilă and eventually grabbed by Păsări-Lăţi-Lungilă. As a final attempt at putting his guests on the spot, the princess' father then makes Harap Alb tell her apart from his adoptive daughter, who is her exact double. This the protagonist accomplishes with assistance from the queen bee, who sets down on the princess' cheek. A final challenge is presented by the girl herself, as a fantastical race between her turtle dove and his horse, to obtain [...] "from where the mountains bump head to head into each other" [...] three scions of apple tree and measures of living and dead water. Although slower, the horse forces the returning bird to hand him the items, and is first to return.|$|E
