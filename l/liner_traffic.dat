2500|$|From the 1870s {{until the}} Second World War Millbay was a busy landing point for rich {{travellers}} from the USA who preferred to disembark the transatlantic liners in Plymouth Sound, come ashore in tenders and catch fast trains from Millbay station to London Paddington, thereby substantially reducing travel time by avoiding the sea passage to Southampton or Tilbury. It {{was known as}} [...] "the route which cuts the corners off". An idea of the scale of this business {{can be seen from}} the fact that during the 20th century over six million passengers landed or were embarked from Millbay and as many as 800 passengers would come ashore from one liner. The peak year for <b>liner</b> <b>traffic</b> was 1930, when 788 liner calls were made to Plymouth. Millions of mailbags were handled too.|$|E

5000|$|SS Traffic was {{a tender}} of the White Star Line, and the fleetmate to the SS Nomadic. She {{was built for}} the White Star Line by Harland and Wolff, at Belfast, to serve the luxury Olympic-class ocean <b>liners.</b> SS <b>Traffic</b> ferried some of the third class {{passengers}} to [...] for her maiden voyage. She served as a tender for White Star, as a minesweeper for the French Navy between 1917 and 1919, and supported troop ships {{at the end of}} the First World War. After the war she was sold to Société Cherbourgeoise Transbordement, and later renamed Ingénieur Reibell. She was scuttled by the French as the Germans invaded in 1940, but was salvaged and used by the Germans as an armed coastal vessel until being sunk by the Royal Navy on 17 January 1941.|$|R
2500|$|In May and June 1947, Merivienti {{acquired}} three second-hand steamers {{for traffic}} into Europe.

With this in mind, Merivienti acquired three larger second-hand steamships, named , [...] and [...] To operate these ships, a new company Oy Finnlines Ltd, was founded in November 1947. Finnlines was a 100% subsidiary of Merivienti and owned no ships of its own—instead the Merivienti ships were operated by and marketed as Finnlines. In subsequent years, vessels owned by other companies, such as Enso-Gutzeit (for whom they managed [...] ), Neste, Outokumpu, Yhtyneet Paperitehtaat, Amer-Tupakka and Thomesto. Finnlines' traffic into the United States begun in 1948. The used ships were soon found to be too small and during the 1950s seven new freighters were delivered to various owners to be operated by Finnlines. At this time the company started using names with the [...] "Finn" [...] prefix that has become characteristic of their fleet. A line to the United Kingdom was opened in 1955.|$|E

50|$|Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) is an Army Service Component Command {{supporting}} United States Transportation Command. The command provides ocean terminal, commercial ocean <b>liner</b> {{service and}} <b>traffic</b> management services to deploy, sustain and redeploy U.S. forces {{on a global}} basis. The command is responsible for surface transportation and is the interface between DOD shippers and the commercial transportation carrier industry. This includes movement of DOD member household goods and privately owned vehicles. SDDC is the USA's largest customer to the moving industry with more than 500,000 household goods moves a year. The command also provides transportation for troops and materiel (materials) to ports of departure in the U.S. and overseas and provides SPM (Single Port Manager) functions at ports worldwide {{in support of the}} surface movement of United States Department of Defense cargo, including military terminals at Sunny Point, North Carolina, and Concord, California.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} heavily used during both World Wars, {{receiving}} troop trains {{from all over}} the United Kingdom, however a decline in Atlantic <b>liner</b> <b>traffic</b> in the 1960s due to the growing popularity of air travel saw its use decline.|$|E
50|$|The whole scheme also {{revealed}} {{a need for}} a small batch of locomotives to maintain connecting services between London (Waterloo) and the unelectrified area of Southampton Docks for the passenger Ocean <b>Liner</b> <b>traffic.</b> This need exceeded the capabilities of the already extant and versatile Class 73 Electro-diesels (1600 hp on electric & 600 hp on diesel) which provided motive power across the region for numerous secondary duties requiring locomotive haulage. To provide for this need, and keep the whole scheme within the limited budget available it was decided that 10 Class 71 2,550 hp straight electric locomotives operating on the South Eastern Division of the Region in the Kent area, that had become excess to operating needs be converted to Class 74. The alterations turned these locomotives into another Electro-diesel type with 2,550 hp on electric and 650 hp on diesel. As it transpired the locomotives as altered were fairly unreliable, and the Ocean <b>Liner</b> <b>traffic</b> for which they were primarily intended was rapidly vanishing. They were therefore a short lived type that was introduced from late 1967 and withdrawn within 10 years.|$|E
50|$|Greenock's Ocean Terminal {{facility}} handles cargo from smaller container ships. More recently, regular cruise <b>liner</b> <b>traffic</b> {{has built}} up, making the port very busy in season. Clydeport, North Ayrshire Council and Scottish Enterprise propose a £200m international deep-water container terminal, also at Hunterston, which would effectively {{act as a}} worldwide gateway port, and possibly become the major container port for the northern half of Europe. Initial environmental and economic impact studies are currently being undertaken.|$|E
50|$|South Harbour (Eteläsatama, Södra hamnen) is a bay and {{harbour area}} {{immediately}} {{next to the}} centre of the city of Helsinki, Finland. 4.7 millon passengers in <b>liner</b> <b>traffic</b> and some 37 000 international cruise passengers travel through it every year. In addition to that, also over million tonnes of unitized cargo passes through the South Harbour. The most of the harbour's traffic is to Stockholm, Sweden and Tallinn, Estonia, and cruises. In summertime, there is also much small ship traffic.|$|E

5000|$|Despite this {{downturn}} in ocean <b>liner</b> <b>traffic,</b> both P&O and Orient Line ordered new, larger vessels - [...] for the former, [...] for the latter. These were {{the largest and}} fastest ever ships for the England - Australia route, reducing the voyage time from 28 days to 21 days with their service speed of 27.5 kn. Although slightly smaller than Canberra, Oriana was the faster of the two and after the final takeover of Orient Line in 1966, Oriana took the P&O Golden Cockerel for fastest ship in the fleet from Canberra. However, the two ships' career as passenger liners was short-lived, being switched to full-time cruising from 1974 onwards.|$|E
