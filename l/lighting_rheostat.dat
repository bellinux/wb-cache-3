5000|$|GR Profile: 1294cc G1A, five doors. Intended as {{competition}} for such cars as the Austin Maestro HLE, the GR Profile used {{exactly the same}} G1A engine as the lower models in the range, but combined it with subtle aerodynamic improvements and lower rolling resistance tyres to reduce the drag coefficient of the car, with the brochure claiming a fuel economy improvement of 3 miles per gallon at a constant 75 mi/h km/h. The standard equipment list included an instrument <b>lighting</b> <b>rheostat,</b> a digital clock, an engine compartment undershield, a glovebox lamp, a carpeted boot and a boot light. Options included metallic paint, central locking, electric windows, and central locking. It was discontinued sometime in 1988, at {{about the time of}} the introduction of the GLX.|$|E

The driver's console on all models housed an array of warning <b>lights,</b> a <b>rheostat</b> and a lambda sensor monitor.|$|R
40|$|This {{simulation}} {{allows students}} to learn {{in the same way}} they do on a real microscope and improve their actual lab experience. They {{will be able to see}} the outside of the microscope to examine the controls, and can also look through the microscope at a specimen. These views can be switched at any time, but a student will not see a specimen unless the proper steps are followed. Students view images of actual specimens and can adjust all microscope controls including the <b>light</b> switch, <b>rheostat,</b> magnification, stage position, oculars, coarse and fine focus, and iris diaphragm. The simulation is accompanied by a tutorial and an instructional video. Educational levels: Middle school, High school, Undergraduate lower division...|$|R
