50|$|The {{turns of}} wire in {{proximity}} {{to each other}} have an equivalent self-capacitance that, when added to any cable capacitance present, resonates with the inductance of the winding. This resonance can accentuate certain frequencies, giving the pickup a characteristic tonal quality. The more turns of wire in the winding, the higher the output voltage but the lower this resonance frequency. The inductive source impedance inherent {{in this type of}} transducer makes it less linear than other forms of pickups, such as piezo-electric or optical. The tonal quality produced by this nonlinearity is, however, subject to taste, and some guitarists and luthiers consider it aesthetically superior to a more <b>linear</b> <b>transducer.</b>|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} low cost, {{hand-held}} convenience, {{wide selection of}} bandwidths, and ultrasound imaging capability, linear ultrasonic transducer arrays have been widely studied for photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT). As linear-array PACT suffers from a limited view, full-view imaging requires either the transducer or the object to be rotated. So far, both the central frequencies and bandwidth of <b>linear</b> <b>transducer</b> arrays applied in full-view PACT are low, limiting the spatial resolutions of the reconstructed images. Here, we present a multiview high-frequency PACT imaging system implemented with a commercial 40 -MHz central frequency <b>linear</b> <b>transducer</b> array.

40|$|Objective To prospectively {{assess the}} {{contribution}} of a high-frequency <b>linear</b> <b>transducer</b> and of moving target indicator (MTI) filtered color flow mapping in the visualization of cardiac fetal anatomy at the routine 11 to 13 + 6 -week scan. Methods This was a cross-sectional prospective study, including 300 singleton fetuses at 11 to 13 + 6 weeks' gestation. Patients were randomized into four groups and a detailed fetal cardiac examination was conducted transabdominally using either a conventional curvilinear transducer, a conventional curvilinear transducer and MTI filtered color flow mapping, a high-frequency <b>linear</b> <b>transducer</b> or a high-frequency <b>linear</b> <b>transducer</b> and MTI filtered color flow mapping. Regression {{analysis was used to}} investigate the effect on the ability to visualize different cardiac structures of the following parameters: gestational age at ultrasound examination; fetal crown-rump length (CRL); maternal body mass index (BMI); transducer-heart distance; the technique used at ultrasound; and the position of the placenta. Results The four-chamber view was visualized in 89. 0 % of fetuses and regression analysis showed this rate was correlated with CRL and the use of MTI filtered color flow mapping during ultrasonography, and inversely correlated with BMI and transducer-heart distance. Use of a conventional curvilinear transducer and MTI filtered color flow mapping allowed visualization of the four-chamber view in 97. 3 % of fetuses, while this was only possible in 84. 0 % of fetuses using a high-frequency <b>linear</b> <b>transducer.</b> The left and right outflow tracts were visualized in 62. 3 and 57. 7 % of fetuses, respectively. Regression analysis showed that the ability to visualize the left or the right outflow tract was correlated with the use of MTI filtered color flow mapping during scanning and was inversely correlated with transducer-heart distance. The use of a conventional curvilinear transducer and MTI filtered color flow mapping allowed visualization of the left and right outflow tracts in 96. 0 and 97. 3 % of fetuses, respectively, while this was only possible in 37. 3 and 26. 7 % of fetuses using a high-frequency <b>linear</b> <b>transducer.</b> Copyright © 2012 ISUOG.

30|$|We {{were not}} {{surprised}} to find a large variation of combinations of transducers, probe orientations and ultrasound modes reported by respondents. A review of published clinical studies and recommendations suggests that the choice of specific technique for LUS is relevant but {{this has not been}} systematically evaluated [2],[4],[6]. Few investigators specifically addressed the issue of differences between transducers regarding the capability to detect lung sliding. Targhetta et al. noted that 7.5 MHz <b>linear</b> <b>transducers</b> facilitated the detection of lung sliding [7]. Lichtenstein and Menu advised against the use of 2.75 MHz echocardiography transducers due to the lower sensitivity of these transducers as compared to microconvex transducers operating at higher frequencies [8]. Soldati et al., while using convex transducers in their study of occult pneumothorax, recommended the use of high-frequency linear probes in difficult cases, e.g. when lung sliding is reduced [9]. The majority of respondents to our survey preferred <b>linear</b> <b>transducers.</b> This is arguably a very reasonable choice, given that there is some indication that these types of transducers offer better sensitivity for the detection of lung sliding.|$|R

The highest uncertainties, when measuring harmonic active power, are introduced by the current and voltage transducers. This paper presents experimental results which show the impact of current transformers (CTs) on the accuracy of the harmonic power measurements. An expression for the evaluation of the power error in distorted conditions was developed which can be easily utilized in the case of <b>linear</b> current <b>transducers.</b> It is shown how CTs cannot be considered <b>linear</b> <b>transducers</b> and how the higher the absolute value of the CT phase angle error is, the higher becomes the harmonic power error. The harmonic power error reaches maximum value when the phase shift between the voltage and current harmonic nears +- 90 °.
