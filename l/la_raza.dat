After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Díaz himself.

In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, José Vasconcelos in his publication <b>La</b> <b>Raza</b> Cósmica (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the mestizo) not only biologically but culturally as well.|$|E
