5|$|Seeds of Evil {{begins with}} the new Turok, Joshua Fireseed, {{appearing}} through a portal to face a female alien named Adon. She explains he has been called by the Elders of the Lost Land, the Lazarus Concordance, to defeat the Primagen, a powerful alien entity that was imprisoned in the wreckage of his own <b>Lightship</b> after attempting to witness {{the creation of the}} universe. This incident {{led to the creation of}} the Lost Land, a bizarre and barbarian world where time has no meaning. Awakened by the events of Dinosaur Hunter, the Primagen mobilizes several races of primitive creatures from the Lost Land to destroy five Energy Totems, powerful devices that bound the Primagen to his <b>Lightship.</b> The destruction of these Energy Totems would allow the Primagen to escape the confines of his <b>Lightship,</b> and the resulting shockwave would destroy the known universe.|$|E
5|$|August 24, 1827– Two {{people are}} killed when the Diamond Shoals <b>Lightship</b> becomes loose from its moorings, {{due to a}} landfalling {{hurricane}} along the state's coastline. Damage is reported across the eastern portion of the state.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March, UB-16, {{now under}} the command of Oblt. Rudolf Stier, was {{responsible}} for sinking the 895-ton steamer Lisette near the Shipwash <b>Lightship.</b> One month later, on 13 April, the fishing smack Ruth was boarded and sunk by UB-16; Ruth was the final ship sunk by UB-16.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} use of <b>lightships</b> in the United States ended March 29, 1985, {{when the}} United States Coast Guard decommissioned its last such ship, the Nantucket I. Many <b>lightships</b> were replaced with Texas Towers or large navigational buoys - {{both of which}} are cheaper to operate than lightvessels. In fact, lighthouses often replaced <b>lightships.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Russia <b>lightships</b> {{have been}} {{documented}} since the mid 19th century. The lightvessel service was subordinated to the Russian Hydrographic Office {{and most of the}} <b>lightships</b> under it were in the Baltic Sea. In the early 1900s there were about ten <b>lightships</b> in the Russian sector of the Baltics. Among these the following may be mentioned: ...|$|R
5000|$|The naming and {{numbering}} of American <b>lightships</b> {{is often}} confusing. Up to {{and through the}} Civil War <b>lightships</b> were identified by name, usually that of the station where they served. As they were moved from station to station, however, the keeping of records became hopelessly tangled. Therefore, in 1867 all existing <b>lightships</b> were given numbers by which they would be permanently identified, and the station at which they were presently serving was painted on their sides, to be changed as needed. <b>Lightships</b> held in reserve to serve in place of those in dock for maintenance were labeled [...] "RELIEF". Surviving <b>lightships</b> are commonly taken to be named according to these labels, but for instance the [...] "Lightship Chesapeake" [...] actually served at two other stations {{as well as being}} used for examinations, and last served at the Delaware Light Station. In another case, the LV-114 was labeled [...] "NEW BEDFORD", though there has never been such a station. In an attempt to sort out the early <b>lightships,</b> they were assigned one or two letter designations sometime around 1930; these identifications do not appear in early records, and they are to some degree uncertain.|$|R
5|$|After O'Briens May 1915 commissioning, she sailed off {{the east}} coast and in the Caribbean. She {{was one of the}} U.S. destroyers sent out to rescue {{survivors}} from five victims of German submarine U-53 off the <b>Lightship</b> Nantucket in October 1916. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, O'Brien was sent overseas to patrol the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Escapees {{aimed for}} the western (West German) shore of the Bay of Mecklenburg, a Danish <b>lightship</b> off the port of Gedser, the {{southern}} Danish islands of Lolland and Falster, or simply the international shipping lanes {{in the hope of}} being picked up by a passing freighter. The Baltic Sea was, however, an extremely dangerous escape route. In all, 189people are estimated to have died attempting to flee via the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a <b>lightship</b> and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
40|$|In 1820, the United States Government began funding {{construction}} and conversion of watercraft {{for use as}} <b>lightships.</b> Floating beacons utilized to mark dangerous shoals, reefs, and shifting channels in inland as well as open waters, <b>lightships</b> served where lighthouse construction was unfeasible. This study intends to examine the general history of U. S. <b>lightships,</b> improvements to construction design, technological modifications in illumination and signaling, venue of employment, as well as use, re-use, and the maritime cultural landscape associated with these craft.   M.

5|$|Enemy naval {{targets were}} {{not subject to}} the prize regulations, so on 23 September, Wenninger torpedoed and sank the , a trawler of the French Navy off the Dyck <b>lightship.</b> There was only one {{survivor}} from the 303-ton ship's eighteen-man crew. Three months later, Wenninger misidentified the 74-ton French fishing ship Jesus Maria as a destroyer. UB-17 launched a torpedo which struck the ship and killed all six men of Jesus Marias crew.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, while {{searching for}} a U-boat {{in the area of}} Conigbeg Rock, the {{destroyer}} received word that the Conigbeg <b>Lightship</b> had rescued survivors from a fishing vessel. Wainwright rendezvoused with the craft to interview the four seamen of the smack Our Bairns. They revealed that the U-boat—which turned out to be —was of the latest type Germany had in action. The destroyer relieved the lighthouse vessel of the four fishermen and continued the search until dusk, when she headed back to Queenstown to land the rescued men.|$|E
5|$|Later, on 24 August, UB-16 {{was again}} patrolling off the Mass <b>Lightship</b> when Hundius stopped Velox, another Norwegian steamer headed for London. Crewmen from UB-16 boarded the 312-ton cargo ship, planted explosives, and sank the vessel and her general cargo. Velox {{was the last}} ship sunk by the UB-16 for nearly eight months, and the last sunk by Hundius before he was {{replaced}} by Oblt. Ernst Müller-Schwarz late in the month. Neither Müller-Schwartz, nor his January 1917 replacement, Oblt. Hans Ewald Niemer, sank any ships while in command of UB-16.|$|E

5|$|The first Hispanic-American {{to command}} a Coast Guard vessel (USRCS) was Joseph Ximenez, who took {{command of the}} Carysfort Reef <b>Lightship</b> in Florida in 1843. He was not, however, the first Hispanic officer. That {{distinction}} belongs to Domingo Castrano, who is listed by the United States Revenue Cutter Service Register as having served aboard USRC Grant in 1872, as an engineering officer. The first known Hispanics to have served in the U.S. Life-Saving Service were Surfmen Telesford Pena and Ramon Delgado who, in 1897, served at the Brazos Life-Saving Station in Texas.|$|E
5|$|After McDougals June 1914 commissioning, she sailed off {{the east}} coast and in the Caribbean. She {{was one of the}} U.S. destroyers sent out to rescue {{survivors}} from five victims of German submarine U-53 off the <b>Lightship</b> Nantucket in October 1916, and carried 6 crewmen from a sunken Dutch cargo ship to Newport, Rhode Island.

5|$|Assigned to the American Patrol Detachment, Schurz {{departed}} Charleston {{toward the}} end of April and, for the next two months, conducted patrols and performed escort duty and towing missions along the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 19 June, she departed New York for Key West. At 04:44 on the 21st, southwest of Cape Lookout <b>lightship,</b> she was rammed by the merchant ship Florida. The ship hit Schurz on the starboard side, crumpling that wing of the bridge, penetrating the well and berth deck about 12 feet, and cutting through bunker no. 3 to the forward fire room. One of Schurzs crewmen was killed instantly; twelve others were injured. Schurz was abandoned and sank three hours later. The ship was struck from the Navy list on 26 August 1918.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Junior Grade Clarence Samuels, born on Bohio, Panama, {{enlisted in}} the Coast Guard on July 16, 1920 and became a {{naturalized}} citizen of the United States on July 21, 1923. On May 12, 1939 he was appointed a chief photographer's mate becoming not only the first Hispanic of African descent photographer in the Guard, but also only the second photographer in {{the entire history of}} the Service. On July 29, 1944, he assumed command of <b>Lightship</b> No. 115, operating in the Panama Sea Frontier. Thus, he became the first admitted Hispanic of African descent to command a cutter, as well as the first one to be an officer-in-charge of a Coast Guard vessel during wartime. Samuels entered the Coast Guard as a seaman 2nd Class and reached the rank of lieutenant (as a part of the massive demobilization of the Coast Guard following the end of hostilities, his lieutenancy was revoked and he was dis-rated to chief photographer's mate). Samuels retired from the Coast Guard on September 1, 1947.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March, UB-6 {{departed}} Zeebrugge {{to patrol}} off the Mass <b>lightship.</b> Two days later, UB-6 entered Dutch territorial waters after Steckelberg made a navigational error, and ran aground {{at the mouth}} of the Maas River. Because the Netherlands was neutral during the war, and UB-6 did not leave Dutch territorial waters within 24 hours as required by international law, the submarine and her crew were interned by the Dutch. The Germans protested, but because UB-6s grounding was merely the result of an error and not because of distress, the Dutch could not release the submarine. UB-6 was taken to the port of Hellevoetsluis for internment, where, on 18 March, UB-6s crew scuttled her. The crew of UB-6 was interned for the duration of the war. After the end of the war, UB-6s wreck was surrendered to France, taken to Brest, and broken up in July 1921.|$|E
