[...] (Seminar: The Ego in Freud's Theory) In [...] "The Direction of the Treatment and the Principles of Its Power" [...] (Écrits) Lacan argues that desire is the metonymy of the <b>lack</b> of being (manque à être): the subject's <b>lack</b> of being {{is at the heart}} of the analytic experience and the very field in which the neurotic's passion is deployed.

In Section  2, <b>LACK</b> and DST are reviewed, and their features and relations are analyzed {{in order to}} show the potentials to corporate them together. Section  3 focuses on one of the DST on <b>LACK</b> scheme without quality control; this scheme proves the possibility to utilize DST on <b>LACK</b> and shows the capacity gains by adding DST on <b>LACK.</b> Section  4 proposes a DST on the <b>LACK</b> scheme with quality control; it not only improves the capacity of the <b>LACK</b> but also has the <b>LACK</b> adaptive over different quality settings. Section  5 shows the numerical results of the two proposed DST over <b>LACK</b> schemes compared with the conventional <b>LACK</b> scheme. Section  6 concludes this paper and provides the overview of the future work.|$|R
