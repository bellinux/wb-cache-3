Several methods have been developed to remove color from RBCC, but they are expensive or may produce difficult-to-remove toxic residues. Hydrogen peroxide treatment is a cheaper alternative. The effects of RBCC concentration, pH, and reaction temperature were the most important factors influencing the decolorizing process. They were investigated with the aim of developing a method that could be scaled to commercial level for producing a bioplastic feedstock. Initial trials showed pH was an important factor for decolorization and foaming. At pH 15 there was a 96 % reduction in solution color and 8. 4 % solids were <b>lost</b> due to <b>foaming.</b> There was a 76 % reduction in solution color at pH 2 and only 2. 6 % solids were <b>lost</b> due to <b>foaming.</b> The optimal reaction conditions were to centrifuge 9 % w/w, pH 2 aqueous RBCC solution to remove aggregates. The solution was reacted at 30 °C with 7. 5 g of 30 % (w/w) hydrogen peroxide.

A model for the dynamics of formation of polyurethane foams is presented, which includes thinning of foam lamellae. Experimental measurements for water blown flexible foam,formulations at different water concentrations are presented to validate the model. Adiabatic temperature rise measurements during foaming are used to obtain the kinetic parameters of the reactions of isocyanate with polyol and water. The variation of foam density during foaming is studied by weight loss and video shooting methods and both are compared to estimate the amount of blowing gas <b>lost</b> during <b>foaming.</b> The average thickness of the foam lamellae of the solid foam is obtained by SEM measurements.

In this work we investigated experimental and theoretical aspects of the precipitation of porcine insulin, a biomolecule of pharmaceutical interest, using CO(2) as an acid- precipitating agent. The Solubility of porcine insulin in NaHCO(3) solutions in pressurized CO(2) was determined as a function of temperature and pressure, with a minimum being observed close to the protein isoclectric point. A thermodynamic model was developed and successfully utilized to correlate the experimental data.

60|$|It was {{the hottest}} {{hour of the}} day. He had been fishing off the reef of rocks where he had first seen her, and had taken in his line and was leisurely pulling for the lighthouse. Suddenly a little musical cry not unlike a bird's struck his ear. He lay on his oars and listened. It was repeated; {{but this time it}} was unmistakably {{recognizable}} as the voice of the Indian girl, although he had heard it but once. He turned eagerly to the rock, but it was empty; he pulled around it, but saw nothing. He looked towards the shore, and swung his boat in that direction, when again the cry was repeated with the faintest quaver of a laugh, apparently on the level of the sea before him. For the first time he looked down, and there on the crest of a wave not a dozen yards ahead, danced the yellow hair and laughing eyes of the girl. The frightened gravity of her look was gone, lost in the flash of her white teeth and quivering dimples as her dripping face rose above the sea. When their eyes met she dived again, but quickly reappeared on the other bow, swimming with lazy, easy strokes, her smiling head thrown back over her white shoulder, as if luring him to a race. If her smile was a revelation to him, still more so was this first touch of feminine coquetry in her attitude. He pulled eagerly towards her; with a few long overhand strokes she kept her distance, or, if he approached too near, she dived like a loon, coming up astern of him with the same childlike, mocking cry. In vain he pursued her, calling her to stop in her own tongue, and laughingly protested; she easily avoided his boat at every turn. Suddenly, when they were nearly abreast of the river estuary, she rose in the water, and, waving her little hands with a gesture of farewell, turned, and curving her back like a dolphin, leaped into the surging swell of the estuary bar and was <b>lost</b> in its <b>foam.</b> It would have been madness for him to have attempted to follow in his boat, and he saw that she knew it. He waited until her yellow crest appeared in the smoother water of the river, and then rowed back. In his excitement and preoccupation he had quite forgotten his long exposure to the sun during his active exercise, and that he was poorly equipped for the cold sea-fog which the heat had brought in earlier, and which now was quietly obliterating sea and shore. This made his progress slower and more difficult, {{and by the time he}} had reached the lighthouse he was chilled to the bone.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Oxygen is an {{essential}} element of life in aerobic organisms. However, if not controlled, inhalation of oxygen under increased pressure in conditions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy can lead to serious damage and even death. Case report. We presented a 20 -year-old male who had begun exhibiting symptoms of epilepsy during diving test in a hyperbaric chamber while inhaling 100 % oxygen. He was immediately taken off oxygen mask and started breathing air and began rapid decompression. He <b>lost</b> consciousness, began <b>foaming</b> at the mouth, and had a series of tonic spasms. The patient was previously completely healthy and not on any medications. He was admitted for emergency treatment in our hospital, where he was treated for epilepsy. On admission, he complained of muscle and joint pain, and had erythematous changes on the forehead, neck and chest. All these changes occurred after leaving the hyperbaric chamber. Bloodwork revealed leukocytosis with neutrophil (Leukocytosis 16. 0 ´ 109 /L (reference values 4. 00 - 11. 00 ´ 109 /L), Neutrophili 13 ´ 109 /L (reference values 1. 9 - 8. 0 ´ 109 /L), with elevated enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 56 U/L (reference values 0 - 37 U/L), alanin aminotransferase (ALT) 59 U /L, (reference values 25 - 65 U/L), creatine kinase (CK) 649 U/L, (reference values 32 - 300 U /L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 398 U/L (reference values 85 - 227 U/L). Because of pain and his condition we began treatment in a hyperbaric chamber at a pressure of 2. 0 ATA for 70 minutes, resulting in a reduction of symptoms and objective recovery of the patient. Within 24 h, repeated laboratory tests showed a reduction of leukocytosis (13 ´ 109 /L and neutrophils (7. 81 ´ 109 /L), and the gradual reduction of the enzymes AST (47 U/L), ALT (50 U/L, CK (409 U/L), LDH (325 U/L). Since head CT and EEG were normal, epilepsy diagnosis was ruled out. This fact, along with medical tests, facilitated the differential diagnosis and confirmed that this was a case of neurotoxic effects of oxygen while the patient was in a hyperbaric chamber, not epileptic seizures. Conclusion. This case report suggests that in patients with symptoms of epileptic seizures while undergoing treatment in a hyperbaric chamber, it is always important to think of neurotoxic effects of pure oxygen which occurs at higher pressures and with a longer inhalation of 100 % oxygen. In these patients, reexposure to hyperbaric conditions leads to recovery. This effect is important in daily inhalation of 100 % oxygen under hyperbaric conditions which is why the use of pure oxygen is controlled and diving is allowed in shallow depths and for a limited time...|$|R
