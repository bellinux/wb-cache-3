40|$|Abstract: Paradigms in {{regional}} policy {{have changed in}} the past few years. Regional policies no longer focus upon rural regions but instead concentrate on areas where growth is likely, and therefore on agglomerations. This policy shift implies that the structurally rather weak, rural peripheral regions have to become responsible for autonomously valorizing their potentials. Often named potentials are an attractive landscape or an intact nature, which serve as basis for a tourism development. However, in view of the large and global pressure of competition, and given the increasing expectations of tourists for quality of tourism services, suitability of tourism as a motor of regional development must be queried. One of the reasons that tourism may not be the ideal motor is that rural small tourism firms are known to be particularly challenged by structural weaknesses. Taking the trekking tourism project “Grande Traversata delle Alpi ” (GTA) in the Piedmont Alps (Northern Italy) as an example, I studied the prospects of regional development by tourism in a peripheral <b>laggard</b> <b>region.</b> For the sake of generating inputs to regional development, a tourism project has to be competitive. So, the present study assesses GTA’s competitive situation by analyzing all of the factors influencing competitiveness on the micro and meso level, and examines the actions related to these competitive factors. This analysis focused on the logics and strategies of actions of all (potentially) involved actors in order to explain the reasons for the state of competitiveness. This heuristic presents a conceptual contribution to regional development analysis on the basis of Mayntz ’ and Scharpf’s actor-centere...|$|E

In particular, I investigate four different convergence hypotheses, namely: absolute, conditional, neoclassical and technological.

40|$|As {{the biggest}} {{producers}} and employers of the system, in general SMEs in <b>laggard</b> <b>regions</b> {{need to keep}} pace with the expanding rate of technological change that is taking place. To achieve that goal, adequate tools must be developed to generate sufficient transfer of knowledge to those regions and SMEs. The paper will analyze past development and the current situation of Technological Institutes (TI) as a feasible tool for transfering and managing technical change in SMEs. Analyzing their characteristics and proposing how they should be related to the industrial fabric of the region will be the main output of the paper. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} effects of Multinational and Domestic Enterprises (MNEs and DOMES respectively) on {{regional}} productivity both in theory {{and in the case}} of UK regions. Our empirical evidence shows that MNEs are more intensive in terms of R&D and intangibles and this has a stronger effect on regional productivity. This result however is moderated by the origin of the MNEs. When we control for this, we find that DOMEs can outperform certain MNEs from specific origins. In particular, we conclude that <b>laggard</b> <b>regions</b> can more easily absorb the managerial and organisational expertise of DOMEs; and that home country-shaped MNE strategies may not be always aligned to the needs of host regions...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} public expenditure on the regional distribution of economic activity (firm location). We adopt a modified core–periphery framework, with capital being inter-regionally mobile, but earnings from capital accruing to immobile capital owners. Government provides public services and this has consequences on demand and supply: public services are financed through taxation (which impacts negatively on the consumption of manufactured goods), but they increase anufacturing firms’ productivity. Given the model’s assumptions, the overall effect of government activity depends on the regional distribution of the tax burden and several scenarios could merge; an interesting insight is that the benefits that <b>laggard</b> <b>regions</b> could receive from the provision of public services substantially increase if these are partially financed by the more prosperous economies...|$|R

40|$|While {{assessing}} {{the status of}} the schooling infrastructure, the evaluation at the aggregate level (at the national or state level) always conceals the geographical spread across sub-regions, and therefore ignores regional disparities. The <b>laggard</b> <b>regions</b> always bring down the overall performance at the state/national levels. In the planning process there should be differential emphasis where the laggards have to be focussed more than others. To get an understanding of performance at the regional levels, it requires a disaggregated analysis to facilitate micro level planning given the information availability at this disaggregated level. Such a disaggregated analysis is not only limited to exposing the regional scene of educational progress/development but also helps in identifying specific aspects/features associated with varying degrees of progress across regions. On this premise an attempt is made here towards evaluating the current status of the educational development in an Indian state (Uttar Pradesh) at the district level. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} to quantify market {{potential in the}} context of an economic geography model. The model is then applied to the NUTS 2 regions of Portugal and Spain. Some results can be pointed out. First, the Iberian Peninsula presents a clear centre-periphery pattern. The market potential pike is situated in the region of Madrid, followed very closely by Cataluña and Pais Vasco. Also all Portuguese regions are at the bottom of the market potential rank, i. e. : Portugal is at the periphery of Spain. Second, the regional welfare index confirms market potential results. There is therefore a direct correlation between market potential and regional welfare. Third, a scenario of complete integration between the Portuguese and the Spanish economy is favourable to the most <b>laggard</b> <b>regions.</b> On the contrary, the most advanced regions of each country loose a little. However, ‘lock-in’ effects allow the most central regions to continue in the forefront of development and welfare.

S. price data and quality indicators for 24 wine regions within 11 countries using a hedonic model. We assess {{the value of}} producer brands vs. geographical indicators, defining an indicator for high, average, and low quality producers (brands) within a region based on relative peer performance, i. e., whether they consistently produce qualities above or below their regional average. In contrast to high quality producers from France and Italy, their counterparts from the New World never exceed prices for high quality Napa Valley brands. Thus, New World wine still has {{to catch up with}} the Old World in terms of regional reputation, but leading brands are able to pick up much of the price differential. Generic promotions, export quality controls, and regional quality leaders emphasizing origin in their own marketing may level the playing field for <b>laggard</b> <b>regions.</b> [EconLit citations: D 400, Q 130, L 140 ]. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{presence}} of stochastic and dynamic convergence of the 14 regional economies in the Philippines in terms of per capita Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) using regional panel data from 1988 to 2007. Stochastic convergence, which indicates convergence of regions in the long-run, is tested using Levin, Lin & Chu (LLC) and Im, Pesaran & Shin (IPS) panel unit root tests. The presence of convergence, on one hand, indicates that the economically <b>laggard</b> <b>regions</b> are gaining on the economically better-performing regions with respect to per capita GRDP. On the other hand, the lack of convergence indicates a need to reevaluate existing regional and national economic policies on development. Dynamic convergence reveals several convergence characteristics of individual regions over time. Dynamic convergence {{is determined by the}} time-varying parameter (TVP) model derived using the Kalman Filter. The paper proceeds to examine the individual convergence behavior of each region based on the value of the estimate of the parameter of the TVP. The results show that out of the 14 regions studied, seven regions are found to converge towards the average of the national per capita GDP growth rate over 1988 to 2007 while six regions lag behind the average of the national per capita GDP growth rate over the same period. No region converges towards the economic growth rate of National Capital Region, the lead region used in the study. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] -In common perception, {{economic}} development {{is supposed to}} proceed with the transformation of the main sector of the economy from agriculture to industry, then to services. The principal role of rural areas is, therefore, to provide cities with food, while excess labor gradually migrates from rural to urban areas. But during the last decades, in many countries, there is a tendency that superabundant laborers in rural areas immigrate to cities. Depopulation and senility of the rural areas are causing gradual serious social problem, because the lack of labor power and inefficiency, thus insufficient social infrastructure degrade productivity and living standard in those areas. How to develop the rural areas to stop the moving step of laborers is a meaningful research issue for many countries. In this paper, some cases in Yaeyama islands in Japan are studied by focusing some unique activities on establishing their regional culture which attracts outside people to move back to the rural regions. Even though Yaeyama Islands have its geographical disadvantages, they developed their own life style and culture based on the respect for native nature, under the endeavor of not only the original residents but also lots of immigrations with shared mission, which is called “Star sky manifesto”. This resulted attracting outside people including younger generation and preventing depopulation in local areas. Their successful experience could be a clue for many other rural <b>laggard</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper maps the {{emergence}} of ‘subnational innovation spaces’ in China as they result from the interaction between state restructuring and the diffusion of innovative activities. Several countervailing forces have {{played a part in}} outlining a number of supra-urban regions that diverge by their own capability to develop and govern innovation-related socio-economic processes. On the one hand, the downscaling of state power enables the local administrative units to plan place-based strategies to embed technological upgrading, such as driving indigenous innovative activities to cluster around industrial and technological parks. On the other hand, this clustering entails reconfiguring socio-spatial interactions, while experiencing new networked connections to be governed. Thus, technological upgrading and state restructuring are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Following this perspective, the authors have rearranged various data sets at the prefectural level and processed them to disentangle some of the main underlying processes: first, the distribution of innovation-related ‘infrastructures’ across cities; second, the evolution of innovative activities; third, the transition towards a firm-centred Science and Technology system. These factors have been then combined together with neighbourhood relations to outline different subnational innovation spaces. The result is a country-wide map describing how the geography of innovative activities in China exhibits features that are connected to the long-term processes of transition, industrialisation and state restructuring. This picture suggests that the catching up with ‘upgraded development’ in <b>laggard</b> <b>regions</b> could be further promoted identifying ‘up-scaled’ regional hubs to coordinate the development of wider areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} revival of {{regional}} industrial policy in the Western world. New policies have been built on recent insights into the drivers of competitive advantage and are characterized by a focus on local production systems, on networking and partnerships, and more strategic forms of policy intervention. In addition, policy formulation and implementation has generally become part of an interactive process of consultation and consensus building, and, to a large extent, involves the co-ordination and reshaping of existing instruments rather than the development of entirely new ones. This paper will discuss {{the emergence of new}} forms of industrial policy targeted on regional ?competitiveness? on the basis of case studies undertaken in Germany, the UK and Spain. The aim of the paper is to understand how the concept and understanding of ?competitiveness? by local makers and other actors has influenced the shaping of local industrial policy. Since all the case studies involve <b>laggard</b> <b>regions,</b> one of the key issues of the debate is how policy makers perceive the balance between more ingenious, innovation-oriented approaches and approaches targeted in foreign investments. To understand the different outcomes in the various regions, account is taken of the governance framework for industrial policy making and implementation, the concepts and models invoked and used by policy makers, the impact of external factors such as funding conditions and European programs and, most fundamentally, the industrial and political traditions which characterize each region. The paper will point at some of the remarkable changes concepts have made on their way from theoretical and conceptual thinking to policy implementation, and will discuss the implications of these changes for academic research as well as policy-making.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the dynamics of}} China's productivity for the period 1996 - 2004 with a newly developed methodology [...] generalized metafrontier Malmquist productivity index (gMMPI). Implementing the gMMPI, this paper reviews the inequality of the coastal and non-coastal provinces, {{as well as the}} latent impact of scale efficiency change (SEC) for China. Using provincial data for the years 1996 - 2004, the empirical results are as follows. On average, China demonstrates an annual 3. 191 % productivity change, which is lower than 4. 729 % for the conventional MPI and accounts for about 26. 508 % of output growth over the period 1996 - 2004. Most of this change is propelled by technical progress, while a fraction is driven by the adjustment in production scale, and the efficiency change has an adverse effect. Furthermore, regional inequality is also found in this empirical work, and the productivity change of the coastal region is actually stronger than that of the non-coastal region. This paper also casts some focus on the China Western Development policy. Indeed, we do not find any outstanding achievement from the policy in the sample period, except that the west region sustained its rate of productivity change after 2000. Moreover, the SEC is found to be trivial in the advanced coastal region, but {{plays an important role in}} the relatively <b>laggard</b> non-coastal <b>region.</b> The implication of the positive SEC in the non-coastal region means that China's Western Development policy will improve the scale efficiency and the TFP growth of the west region.

The paper also combines original data on real state per worker output with existing data {{to provide a more}} comprehensive series of real state output per worker from 1840 to 2000. These data show that the New England, Middle Atlantic, Pacific, East North Central and West North Central regions have been educational leaders over the entire time period. In contrast, the South Atlantic, East South Central and West South Central regions have been educational <b>laggards.</b> The Mountain <b>region</b> behaves differently than either of the aforementioned groups. Using our estimates of average years of schooling and average years of experience in the labor force, we estimate aggregate Mincerian earnings regressions. Our estimates indicate that a year of schooling increased output by between 8 percent and 12 percent, with a point estimate close to 10 percent. These estimates are in line with the body of evidence from the labor literature.

40|$|Trabajo presentado a la EU-SPRI Conference: "Science and Innovation Policy: Dynamics, Challenges, Responsibility and Practice", celebrada en Manchester (UK) del 18 al 20 de junio de 2014. This paper {{analyzes}} {{the determinants of}} human capital (HC) endowment in Spanish regions. To do so we elaborate an empirical analysis grounded in the interface of two consolidated areas of research. On the one hand is the literature on economic geography that articulates in great detail the effect of local characteristics {{on the performance of}} a regional economy. At the same time, we argue, the traditional measures of human capital in these studies mostly focus on the supply-side (i. e. total number of graduates) thus neglecting altogether the dynamics of local labour markets. On the other hand the labour economics literature proposes a more nuanced approach based on the study of changes in the relative demand of workers' skill. While this is a more direct measure of the transformations within labour markets, it is rarely used to capture geographical differences across regions. We bring together these two strands of literature to analyse the interplay between demand and supply of skills across 17 regions in Spain. Our analysis captures the effect of regional factor bias by using a novel indicator of university mission engagement as well as various local techno-economic characteristics. The main finding is that university orientation bears a differential effect on local labour markets. Accordingly we identify three groups: research-oriented regions (leaders); industry intensive regions (followers) and a group of backward <b>regions</b> (<b>laggards).</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
