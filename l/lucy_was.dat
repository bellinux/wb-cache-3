5|$|The poems {{were written}} during {{a short period}} while the poet lived in Germany. Although they {{individually}} deal {{with a variety of}} themes, as a series they focus on the poet's longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had stayed in England, and on his increasing impatience with his sister Dorothy, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, elegiac tone. Whether <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> based on a real woman or was a figment of the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.|$|E

25|$|Instead of Charles, one of Henrietta Maria's closest companions in {{the early}} days of her {{marriage}} was Lucy Hay. <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> the wife of James Hay, who had been a favourite of King James and who was now a gentleman of the bedchamber to Charles; James had helped negotiate Charles's marriage to Henrietta Maria. <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> a staunch Protestant, a noted beauty and a strong personality. Many contemporaries believed her to be a mistress to Buckingham, rumours which Henrietta Maria would have been aware of, and it has been argued that <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> attempting to control the new queen on his behalf. Nonetheless, by the summer of 1628 the two were extremely close friends, with Hay one of the queen's ladies-in-waiting.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} pike gets its common name from its {{resemblance to the}} pole-weapon known as the pike (from the Middle English for 'pointed'). Various other unofficial trivial names are common pike, great {{northern pike}}, Lakes pike, snot rocket, slough shark, snake, slimer, slough snake, northern, gator (due to a head similar in shape to that of an alligator), jack, jackfish, hammer handle, and other such names as long head and pointy nose.

25|$|It {{seems obvious}} that Gerda is the murderer. Henrietta steps forward {{to take the}} {{revolver}} from her hand, but apparently fumbles and drops it into the swimming pool, destroying the evidence. However, the pistol that Gerda was holding was not the gun used to kill John. None of the witnesses has seen Gerda shoot John. It seems difficult to build a case against {{any of the other}} potential suspects. <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> the next suspect, as she kept a pistol concealed in her basket of eggs. However, the pistol was the wrong calibre. Henrietta is the next suspect, having left an unusual doodle in the pavilion around the time John was killed. When the murder weapon turns up in Poirot's hedge, it has fingerprints that match none of the suspects.|$|E

One of her sons, David, became a physician in Steubenville, and married Lucy Norman, the daughter of a Virginia planter. Their marriage was met with the ire of Ohio's Quaker community, as <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> a Methodist, and not a Quaker. This forced David Stanton to abandon the Quaker sect.|$|E

25|$|In July 1847 Darley {{commenced}} {{studying at}} Trinity College, Dublin, and {{he graduated in}} July 1851 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA). He was called to the English bar at the King's Inn in January 1853 but returned to Ireland and practised there for about nine years on the Munster circuit. He met Sir Alfred Stephen when Stephen was {{on a visit to}} Europe, and was told that there were good prospects for him in Australia. Darley married Lucy Forest Browne at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, on 13 December 1860. <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> the sister of novelist Rolf Boldrewood (Thomas Alexander Browne) who is best known for the book Robbery under arms.

25|$|I Love Lucys {{pioneering}} use {{of three}} cameras led to it becoming the standard technique {{for the production}} of most sitcoms filmed in front of an audience. Single-camera setups remained the technique of choice for sitcoms that did not use audiences. This led to an unexpected benefit for Desilu during the series's second season when it was discovered that <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> pregnant. Not being able to fulfill the show's 39-episode commitment, both Desi and Jess Oppenheimer decided to rebroadcast popular episodes of the series's first season to help give Lucy the necessary rest she needed after she gave birth, effectively allowing fewer episodes to be filmed that season. Unexpectedly the rebroadcasts proved to be ratings winners, effectively giving birth to the rerun, which would later lead to the profitable development of the rerun syndication market. It also became the first television program to introduce English and Spanish.|$|E
25|$|Burbeck married Lucy Elizabeth Rudd Caldwell on December 13, 1813 in New London, Connecticut. She was the {{daughter}} of Corp. Daniel Rudd, Jr. and Abigail Allen. She was first married to Capt.

Caldwell was on the Little Belt during the Little Belt Affair, an event that is {{regarded as one of the}} causes of the War of 1812, and he testified during the Court of Inquiry on the Little Belt Affair which convened in New York in September 1811. <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> a descendant of Gov. William Bradford (1590-1657) of the Mayflower and Jonathan Rudd who was married, in a legendary ceremony, at Bride Brook in what is now East Lyme, Connecticut in December 1646. Burbeck was the same exact age as Lucy's father Daniel Rudd, Jr., both being born on June 10, 1754. At the time of his marriage to Lucy, Burbeck was 29 years her senior.|$|E

25|$|New South Wales {{politician}} Henry Parkes (who {{later became}} premier) {{was concerned about}} the state of the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary and appealed for help to Florence Nightingale for trained nurses. Consequently, in March 1868 Lucy Osburn was sent out as Lady Superintendent of the Infirmary and was accompanied by five trained nurses. Osburn won Parkes' trust and began the challenging task of cleaning up the crumbling, foul-smelling and vermin-infested Infirmary. A week after their arrival they had a royal patient, when the Duke of Edinburgh was wounded by a would-be assassin at Clontarf. They nursed him at Government House, not Sydney Hospital. In spite of the public acclaim this brought them, Lucy Osburn and her staff faced much resistance in their efforts to reform the infirmary. In addition to the appalling conditions, they met with hostility and opposition. The idea of gentlewomen working as hospital nurses was still novel, and to many people shocking. <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> continually obstructed by one surgeon, Dr Alfred Roberts, and personally attacked in the Parliament.|$|E

Knowing that it is a plan, Leon runs away and drunkenly ventures into the dark woods, cutting his hand. The next day the gang discover that Lucy let Leon run off and he was out all night. Peter and Fatboy then fear they hit Leon with the van the night before. Fatboy gets a voicemail from Leon saying he is hurt, and when he calls back, Zsa Zsa finds Leon's mobile phone in the leaves, smeared with blood.

25|$|In 1957, I Love <b>Lucy</b> <b>was</b> re-tailored into {{an hour-long}} show {{originally}} titled The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show {{that was to}} be part of an anthology series called the Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse. The hour-long Lucy-Desi show was to alternate on a monthly basis with other hour long Playhouse shows. The new series put a much heavier emphasis on big name guest stars as being part of the plot and although the Mertz characters continued into the new series, their roles became somewhat diminished. Although a lighter workload was welcomed by Frawley, Vance came to somewhat resent the change. Arnaz, in an effort to please Vance, for whom he had much respect, proposed doing a spin-off from I Love Lucy called The Mertzes. Seeing a lucrative opportunity and the chance to star in his own show, Frawley was enthused. Vance, however, declined for a number of reasons, the biggest factor being that she felt she and Frawley could barely work together on the ensemble show they were doing at the time, so it would be much less likely the two could work together on their own series. Vance also felt that the Mertz characters would not be as successful without the Ricardos to play-off each other, and despite being her biggest success, she was becoming interested in playing more glamorous roles rather than Ethel. In fact, during the thirteen-episode run of the Lucy-Desi hour-long shows, Vance was given a lot more latitude to look more attractive as Ethel Mertz, something she was denied during the run of the I Love Lucy episodes. Frawley's resentment of Vance intensified after she declined to do the spin-off show and the two rarely talked to each other outside of their characters' dialogue with one another.|$|E
