5|$|However, Bo's {{campaign}} {{was criticized for}} running roughshod over judicial due process and eroding the rule of law. Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labor. <b>Lawyers</b> <b>for</b> the accused were intimidated and harassed, and {{in at least one}} case, sentenced to 18 months in prison. Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, assets seized during the campaign were allegedly redirected to help pay for Bo's popular social housing programs. The Wall Street Journal reported that $11 billion went into government coffers through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, asserted that he became a target of Bo anti-corruption drive {{as a result of a}} land dispute with the government. When he refused government demands to give up the land, he claims that he was abducted and tortured, and that $700 million worth of assets in his business were seized.|$|E

5|$|Mansfield {{ordered a}} hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, {{the case was}} not heard until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, the case had {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund <b>lawyers</b> <b>for</b> both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Somersett, it was argued that while colonial laws might permit slavery, neither {{the common law}} of England, nor any law made by Parliament {{recognised}} the existence of slavery, and slavery was therefore illegal. Moreover, English contract law did not allow for any person to enslave himself, nor could any contract be binding without the person's consent. The arguments thus focused on legal details rather than humanitarian principles. A law passed in 1765 said that all lands, forts and slaves owned by the Africa Company were a property of the Crown, which could be interpreted to mean that the Crown accepted slavery. When the two <b>lawyers</b> <b>for</b> Charles Stewart put their case, they argued that a contract {{for the sale of}} a slave was recognised in England, and therefore the existence of slaves must be legally valid.|$|E
5|$|The Hale Commission was {{established}} by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate law reform. Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen, the Commission met approximately {{three times a week}} and proposed changes as radical (at the time) as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing witnesses, legal aid and <b>lawyers</b> <b>for</b> defendants in criminal cases and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for criminal cases. Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament, two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone's Parliament, and, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, most of the others were as well. Debate has occurred over the effectiveness and strife within the Commission between its more moderate and radical members; the general conclusion is that with the sheer volume of work produced and the vast proportion of moderate to radical members, it is unlikely such strife existed.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} appealed and {{heard by the}} Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the {{herbicides}} contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were {{not intended to be}} used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The <b>lawyers</b> <b>for</b> the Vietnamese filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied certiorari and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry {{was run by}} Sir Louis Blom-Cooper; Bird was {{formally}} fired as a Cabinet minister on 10 May, the day Blom-Cooper arrived on Antigua. Blom-Cooper began work on 4 June, with Bird retaining a team of six <b>lawyers</b> <b>for</b> his defence; the inquiry, concluded in November, recommended banning Bird from holding public office {{for the rest of}} his life. The report was acted on and Bird was banned from becoming a minister again, although he retained his seat in the House. The report did not, however, recommend that Bird be forced to resign from the House or prosecuted criminally; it was felt that the public ridicule the guilty parties had been subjected to was punishment enough. Bird was later re-hired by the government, not as a Minister but as a special advisor to the Prime Minister on the subject of Public Utilities. After the Prime Minister finally retired and Lester became Antigua and Barbuda's leader on 5 September 1995, Bird was made Chairman of the ALP.|$|E
5|$|The {{requisite}} Papal dispensation {{was obtained}} dated 22 April 1472. Michael Hicks {{has suggested that}} the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel. First degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon. In their case the papal dispensation was obtained after Catherine declared the first marriage had not been consummated. In Richard's case, there would have been first degree consanguinity if Richard had sought to marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard's marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon <b>lawyers</b> <b>for</b> 13 years.|$|E
