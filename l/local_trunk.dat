40|$|Objective To examine using surface {{electromyography}} whether stair climbing with abdominal hollowing (AH) {{is better}} at facilitating <b>local</b> <b>trunk</b> muscle activity than stair climbing without AH. Methods Twenty healthy men with {{no history of}} low back pain participated in the study. Surface electrodes were attached to the multifidus (MF), lumbar erector spinae, thoracic erector spinae, transverse abdominus- internal oblique abdominals (TrA-IO), external oblique abdominals (EO), and the rectus abdominis. Amplitudes of electromyographic signals were measured during stair climbing. Study participants performed maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) for each muscle in various positions to normalize the surface electromyography data. Results AH during stair climbing resulted in significant increases in normalized MVCs in both MFs and TrA-IOs (p< 0. 05). <b>Local</b> <b>trunk</b> muscle/global trunk muscle ratios were higher during stair climbing with AH as compared with stair climbing without AH. Especially, right TrA-IO/EO and left TrA-IO/EO were significantly increased (p< 0. 05). Conclusion Stair climbing with AH activates <b>local</b> <b>trunk</b> stabilizing muscles better than stair climbing without AH. The findings suggest that AH during stair climbing contributes to trunk muscle activation and trunk stabilization...|$|E
40|$|The {{communications}} {{system is a}} service integrated network combining a digital net and an analog net, both furnishing the services telephone, data, videophone, stereo broadcasting and television.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} home-based specific stabilizing exercises focusing on the local stabilizing muscles as the only intervention {{in the treatment of}} persistent postpartum pelvic girdle pain (PGP). Design: A prospective, randomized, single-blinded, clinically controlled study. Subjects: Eighty-eight women with PGP were recruited 3 months after delivery. Methods: The treatment consisted of specific stabilizing exercises targeting the <b>local</b> <b>trunk</b> muscles. The reference group had one telephone contact with a physiotherapist. Primary outcome was disability measured with Oswestry Disability Index. Secondary outcomes were pain, health-related quality of life (EQ- 5 D), symptom satisfaction, and muscle function. Results: No significant differences between groups could be found at 3 - or 6 -month follow-up regarding primary outcome in disability. Within-group comparisons showed some improvement in both groups in terms of disability, pain, symptom satisfaction and muscle function compared to baseline although the majority still experienced PGP. Conclusion: Treatment with this home-training concept of specific stabilizing exercises targeting the local muscles was no more effective in improving consequences of persistent postpartum PGP than the clinically natural course. Regardless of treatment with specific stabilizing exercises or not, the majority still experiences some back pain almost a year after pregnancy.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to compare the {{activation}} of global and local muscles of the trunk during bridging with sling exercise (BSE), bridging with ball exercise (BBE), and normal bridging exercise (NBE) and to conduct and analyze these exercises in supine and prone positions to prove the effectiveness of sling exercises. Thirty patients with current low back pain (LBP) were recruited. In the supine and prone bridging exercise, each subject lifted their pelvis with their legs and feet in contact with the sling, ball, or normal surface. The electrical activities of the inferior oblique (IO), rectus abdominis (RA), multifidus (MF), and erector spinae (ES) muscles during the bridging exercises on the 3 surfaces were measured using surface electromyography (sEMG). For normalization, maximum sEMG signals were evaluated during each maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) maneuver. The root mean square during the exercise was normalized {{as a percentage of the}} MVIC (%MVIC). In the supine and prone positions, %MVIC of the IO, RA, MF, and ES during BSE was significantly higher than those during BBE and NBE (p < 0. 05). In the supine position, %MVIC of the RA and ES during BBE was significantly higher than that during NBE (p < 0. 05). In the prone position, all %MVIC during BBE were significantly higher than NBE (p < 0. 05). These results verify the theory that the use of an unstable surface increases the activation of global and <b>local</b> <b>trunk</b> muscles during bridging exercises in the supine and prone positions. In conclusion, the use of BSE in a rehabilitation program may have therapeutic effects for patients with LBP by increasing trunk muscle activatio...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} <b>trunk</b> <b>local</b> stability {{in a group}} of patients with degenerative primary cerebellar ataxia and to correlate it with spatio-temporal parameters, clinical variables, and history of falls. Sixteen patients affected by degenerative cerebellar ataxia and 16 gender- and age-matched healthy adults were studied by means of an inertial sensor to measure trunk kinematics and spatio-temporal parameters during over-ground walking. <b>Trunk</b> <b>local</b> dynamic stability was quantified by the maximum Lyapunov exponent with short data series of the acceleration data. According to this index, low values indicate more stable trunk dynamics, while high values denote less stable trunk dynamics. Disease severity was assessed by means of International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) according to which higher values correspond to more severe disease, while lower values correspond to less severe disease. Patients displayed a higher short-term maximum Lyapunov exponent than controls in all three spatial planes, which was correlated with the age, onset of the disease, and history of falls. Furthermore, the maximum Lyapunov exponent was negatively correlated with ICARS balance, ICARS posture, and ICARS total scores. These findings indicate that <b>trunk</b> <b>local</b> stability during gait is lower in patients with cerebellar degenerative ataxia than that in healthy controls and that this may increase the risk of falls. Local dynamic stability of the trunk seems to be an important aspect in patients with ataxia and could be a useful tool in the evaluation of rehabilitative and pharmacological treatment outcomes...|$|R

50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as incoming trunk circuits. Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the trunk circuit for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a <b>local</b> outgoing <b>trunk</b> can be simpler.|$|R

It formed {{a component of the}} trunk mechanisation hierarchy that was commenced in 1939. The concept of group {{switching centre}}s became important with the introduction in the United Kingdom of subscriber trunk dialling (STD) in 1958, initially from Bristol central telephone exchange. They were typically located towards the centre of their corresponding group area, usually in a large town or city, and serviced a group of local and dependent telephone exchanges within their home and adjacent group areas. From 1 January 1958, the British network was divided into 639 charging groups. These areas provided the basis for tariff calculations for telephone calls.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{nature of}} {{synaptic}} transmission at functionally distinct synapses in intestinal reflex pathways {{has not been}} fully identified. In this study, we investigated whether transmission between interneurons in the descending inhibitory pathway is mediated by a purine acting at P 2 Y receptors to produce slow excitatory synaptic potentials (EPSPs). Methodology/Principal findings: Myenteric neurons from guinea-pig ileum in vitro were impaled with intracellular microelectrodes. Responses to distension 15 mm oral to the recording site, in a separately perfused stimulation chamber and to electrical stimulation of <b>local</b> nerve <b>trunks</b> were recorded. A subset of neurons, previously identified as nitric oxide synthase immunoreactive descending interneurons, responded to both stimuli with slow EPSPs that were reversibly abolished by {{a high concentration of}} PPADS (30 mM, P 2 receptor antagonist). When added to the central chamber of a three chambered organ bath, PPADS concentration-dependently depressed transmission through that chamber of descending inhibitory reflexes, measured as inhibitory junction potentials in the circular muscle of the anal chamber. Reflexes evoked by distension in the central chamber were unaffected. A similar depression of transmission was seen when the specific P 2 Y 1 receptor antagonist MRS 2179 (10 mM) was in the central chamber. Blocking either nicotinic receptors (hexamethonium 200 mM) or 5 -HT 3 receptors (granisetron 1 mM) together with P 2 receptors had no greater effect than blocking P 2 receptors alone...|$|R

40|$|Besides {{cognitive}} decline, dementia {{is characterized}} by gait changes and increased fall risk, also in {{early stages of the}} disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate differences in the relationship between executive function and gait variability and stability during single task and dual task walking in persons with and without dementia. The study sample consisted of three groups: fifteen dementia patients (aged 75 - 87), fourteen healthy elderly (aged 75 - 85), and twelve relatively younger elderly (aged 55 - 70). Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and tests of single and dual task walking while wearing an accelerometer. Outcome measures include stride related measures such as mean and coefficient of variation of stride time, and dynamic measures regarding the magnitude, smoothness, predictability and <b>local</b> stability of <b>trunk</b> accelerations. Patients with dementia exhibited a significantly (p. 51) were found between executive tasks and gait parameters. In conclusion, these findings indicate that decreased executive function plays an important role in increased gait variability in dementia patients; a fact that should be considered when designing fall risk interventions for this population. Furthermore, results indicate that measures of gait variability and stability should be deemed worthwhile in the diagnosis of dementia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A flexed posture (FP) is {{characterized}} by protrusion {{of the head and}} an increased thoracic kyphosis (TK), which may be caused by osteoporotic vertebral fractures (VFs). These impairments may affect motor function, and consequently increase the risk of falling and fractures. The aim of the current study was therefore to examine postural control during walking in elderly patients with FP, and to investigate the relationship with geriatric phenomena that may cause FP, such as increased TK, VFs, frailty, polypharmacy and cognitive impairments. Fifty-six elderly patients (aged 80 ± 5. 2 years; 70 % female) walked 160 m at self-selected speed while trunk accelerations were recorded. Walking speed, mean stride time and coefficient of variation (CV) of stride time were recorded. In addition, postural control during walking was quantified by time-dependent variability measures derived from the theory of stochastic dynamics, indicating smoothness, degree of predictability, and <b>local</b> stability of <b>trunk</b> acceleration patterns. Twenty-five patients (45 %) had FP and demonstrated a more variable and less structured gait pattern, and a more irregular trunk acceleration pattern than patients with normal posture. FP was significantly associated with an increased TK, but not with other geriatric phenomena. An increased TK may bring the body's centre of mass forward, which requires correcting responses, and reduces the ability to respond on perturbation, which was reflected by higher variation in the gait pattern in FP-patients. Impairments in postural control during walking are a major risk factor for falling: the results indicate that patients with FP have impaired postural control during walking and might therefore be at increased risk of fallin...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} trunk muscle {{activity in}} sitting i) baseline to facilitated segmental extension (FSE) ii) from FSE evaluating two progression exercises (1) bilateral arm raise and (2) unilateral leg lift. Relevance: Segmental {{extension of the}} lumbar spine is required when rehabilitating core stability (Edwards, 2002). This may activate local muscle stabilisers, multifidis and transversus abdominus (Akuthota and Nadler, 2004). FSE is utilised in neurological physiotherapy, however, there is no objective evidence regarding its effectiveness. The evidence is also scant {{in relation to the}} effectiveness of exercise progressions from FSE in sitting. Methods: Healthy volunteer subjects (mean (SD) age 46. 45 years ± 5. 25 (n = 22; 13 female) were recruited. Average normalised SEMG of bilateral Multifidis (M), Transverse abdominus/internal oblique (TA/IO), external oblique (EO), erector spinae (ES) was obtained for baseline sitting, post intervention (FSE) and following the progressions of bilateral arm raise and right leg lift. Local ethical approval was obtained. Analysis: A paired t test (alpha ≤ 0. 05) evaluated pre and post intervention muscle activity. A repeated measures ANOVA (alpha ≤ 0. 05) evaluated muscle activity from the FSE (new baseline) to progressions 1 and 2. Results: Results for pre to post intervention show a statistically significant increase in muscle activity in all trunk muscles. Left M (p= 0. 000), right M (p= 0. 002), left ES (p= 0. 029), right ES (p= 0. 015), left TA/IO (p= 0. 000), right TA/IO (p= 0. 000), left EO (p= 0. 008), right EO (p= 0. 044). Results from FSE to bilateral arm raise showed a statistically significant increase in Left M (F= 79. 02 p= 0. 000), right M (p= 0. 000), left ES (p= 0. 000), right ES (p= 0. 000). Values for the abdominal muscles were not significant, left TA/IO (p= 0. 899), right TA/IO (p= 0. 666), left EO (p= 0. 131), right EO (p= 0. 144). Results from FSE to right leg lift showed a statistically significant increase in Left M (p= 0. 000), right M (p= 0. 001), left TA (p= 0. 000), right TA (p= 0. 000), left EO (p= 0. 000), right EO (p= 0. 000). Results for ES were not significant, left ES (p= 0. 174), right ES (p= 0. 057). Conclusions: The results show that FSE activates <b>local</b> and global <b>trunk</b> stabilisers in sitting. During a bilateral arm raise (1) there is increased muscle activity in the stabilisers of the back but not the abdominals. With a unilateral leg lift (2) increases in all abdominals and bilateral Multifidis provide justification for its use as a progression. Limitations include the use of a small sample and healthy subjects. Future work should focus on patient populations. Implications: Clinically, this study provides evidence for the use of FSE as a therapeutic intervention and of a right leg lift as an exercise progression. Justification of a bilateral arm raise is only evidenced if specific rehabilitation of back extensors is required...|$|R
