5000|$|The title {{has been}} {{bestowed}} upon vessels that were especially liked or those {{considered to be}} especially beautiful or richly appointed. Such was the case as late as 1949, at which time the Noronic was so honored. It {{has been applied to}} the United States Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw for its long and significant role in facilitating Great Lakes shipping and safety. The most common use of the title, however, at least since the early 1940s, is to honor the largest vessel on the lakes. On April 20, 1841, the Detroit Free Press referred to the steamer Illinois as [...] "Queen of the Waters", but given that three vessels in that century were named Queen of the Lakes, its use as a title for the longest ship was not then common. The title is applied retroactively to vessels launched before this use of the title became popular. While some use gross tonnage, capacity, or length between perpendiculars as the criterion, the most commonly accepted standard is <b>length</b> <b>overall</b> (<b>LOA).</b> This article uses LOA as the standard.|$|E
50|$|Swan 65 is a large, GRP constructed, fin keeled {{masthead}} ketch or sloop rigged {{sailing yacht}} manufactured by Nautor’s Swan. It was introduced {{as the new}} flagship of Nautor in 1973. Swan 65 is in many respect a remarkable piece of engineering as {{at the time of}} its launch it was the largest GRP constructed yacht in the market and because of its excellent racing history, one of the most famous Swan models ever built. The first 65-footers were delivered to owners in 1973, and the production continued until 1989 with 41 hulls being built in total. The yacht was designed by Sparkman & Stephens which was considered by many, the number one yacht design company at the time. Swan 65 was designed to I.O.R Mk III to fulfil the continuously increasing demand for bigger sailing/racing yachts in the market. In order meet this demand Nautor had asked Olin Stephens to design a beautiful, fast and safe sailing yacht to continue the development of Swan range. Stephens combined the requested characteristics in a fiberglass hull together with a luxurious interior and technical features that were then current in successful racing boats. Its main dimensions are <b>length</b> <b>overall</b> <b>LOA</b> 19,9 m, Length of waterline LWL 14,33 m Beam 4,98 m. Up until the hull #019, the displacement was 31800 kg of which 10400 kg was ballast. From the hull #020 onwards the ballast was increased to 13900 kg resulting to a displacement of 35300 kg. Therefore, for the first 19 hulls the ballast to weight ratio was 31% which was then increased to 39% for the rest of the production. Although it replaced Swan 55 as the flagship of Nautor, the yacht has no actual predecessor in the Nautors own range and according to the designers comments the design is based on a successful American aluminium yacht Dora IV.|$|E
50|$|Swan 36 is a GRP constructed, fin keeled, one tonner {{masthead}} sloop {{and it is}} {{the first}} Swan sailing yacht ever produced. It was manufactured by Nautor Oy and the first boat Tarantella was launched in July 1967. The production continued until 1971 with a total of 90 Swan 36 boats being built. The yacht was designed by Sparkman & Stephens who were the number one designers in the world at the time and also the designers of the first 775 Swan yachts built by Nautor. Its main dimensions are <b>length</b> <b>overall</b> <b>LOA</b> 10,9 m, Length of waterline LWL 7,77 Beam 2,95 m, and displacement of 7000 kg, of which 3600 kg is ballast.Its racing success is very much based on the designer’s well timed decision to use a separate fin keel and rudder as opposed to the traditional full keel arrangement. This reduced the wetted surface area of the hull and thus also the frictional drag, which made the yacht faster and with the rudder placed further aft also more agile. Despite separate fin keel and a rudder had been used before in some of the Sparkman & Stephens' lighter sailboat designs such as the Lightning, {{this was the first time}} this arrangement was successfully used in production keelboats. For a short period of time this application made Swan 36 one of the fastest commercially available sailing yachts of its size and with a skilled crew she became the one to beat in the international sailing regattas. The yacht gained international recognition in 1968 when a Swan 36 called Casse Tete II (Renamed Carte Blanche) skippered by David Johnson scored a result that no one had done before and won all seven starts of that years Cowes Week regatta. Cowes Week was and still is, one of the largest sailing regattas of its kind in the world and winning it created a lot of media attention and publicity to this new 36 foot racing yacht. This racing success was very important for the future of the yard and generated immense positive feedback that was soon converted to increasing sales figures. However the racing success was not all the boat had to offer as it was also decided that it should be more comfortable and luxurious on the inside than any of the competing makes. For that reason, Nautor had decided to use their own interior designer to complete the management’s vision of a fast and luxurious racing yacht with an attractive price tag. The result was an unprecedented combination of competitiveness and comfort combined with a superior cost efficiency brought by the new fiberglass construction method and the skilled boatbuilders of Jakobstad. This well marketed combination of speed, quality and affordability enabled the subsequent commercial success for the whole yard and the creation of Swan brand. Nautor introduced its successor Swan 37 in 1970 which also became a very successful racing yacht.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} obtaining IP connectivity, a ship can be {{directly}} connected to a base station, provided that the base station is within its communication range by guaranteeing line-of-sight (LOS). Otherwise, the ship can be indirectly connected to the base station {{with the help of}} neighboring ships in an ad hoc manner. The VHF communication range of a ship depends on the length of its mast, which is determined by the <b>length</b> <b>overall</b> (<b>LOA)</b> [13]. In the case where the length of the mast is less than 5 m, the VHF communication range is from 20 to 30 km. In the case where the length of the mast is from 12 to 30 m, the VHF communication range is from 55 to 120 km. As an example, a ship with a mast of 30 m that makes a voyage along a sea route which is normally 100 nautical miles (i.e., 185 km) from the shore, it can achieve IP connectivity to a base station by going through three or four hops, provided that it locates its neighboring ships.|$|E
40|$|An LLP {{license is}} held by a person, and not by a vessel. NOAA Fisheries {{requires}} license owners to assign a vessel to the license {{before it can be}} used in a fishery subject to the LLP. Licenses may be transferred to a different vessel or owner once per calendar year (Jan 1 - Dec 31). The LLP license must be physically on board the vessel when it is engaged in activities authorized by the license. Area Endorsements – Each license carries one or more area endorsements authorizing entry into fisheries in those management areas (Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, Western GOA, Central GOA, and Southeast). For purposes of the LLP, the Central GOA area endorsement also allows vessels to fish in West Yakutat. Gear Designation- Each license carries a non-trawl and/or trawl gear designation which authorizes the license to fish using the designated gear type. Landing – For purposes of this analysis, a catcher vessel landing includes any LLP groundfish species landed during one calendar day. State waters and IFQ catch is not counted toward qualifying catch. Catcher vessel harvests are based upon ADFG Fish tickets. A catcher processor landing includes any groundfish landed during a one week interval, because catcher processor landings are based upon Blend and Catch Accounting data and are only specific to a week ending date.

40|$|One of {{the keys}} to an {{efficient}} loading of oil in the Arctic offshore is probably a subsea solution where the interference with ice is at a minimum. Therefore an attempt to assess the performance of an Arctic Shuttle Barge System including a subsea mooring and loading terminal was done at a model-scale of 1 : 25 in the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) ice tank in 1999. The system consists of a barge of about 120 000 tons loaded displacement and 80 000 tons ballast displacement (90 000 DWT, <b>length</b> <b>overall</b> <b>Loa</b> = 265. 5 m,) and a pusher/icebreaker of about 8000 tons displacement (2000 DWT, Loa = 86 m). The pusher serves as the main propulsion and connects/disconnects to a notch in the aft of the barge. The operational performance and forces exerted on the barge, the pusher and the mooring system, including a riser, were investigated. The system was pushed by the pusher through level ice or towed through level ice and pressure ridges by the mooring system. The latter simulated the moored condition in drifting ice. This paper describes the test set-up, procedures and performance of the concept when manoeuvring into the loading position in level ice. The maximum ice breaking force was about 23000 kN during a ridge event. The paper also elaborates on the use of a wedged plough and ice milling propellers to avoid ice from interfering with the mooring lines and riser. Finally we have a brief discussion on how the transhipment at the ice edge could be done. 1...|$|E

40|$|Competition among {{container}} ports {{continues to}} increase as the differentiation of hub ports and feeder ports progresses. Managers in many container terminals are trying to attract carriers by automating handling equipment, providing and speeding up various services, and furnishing the most current information on the flow of containers. At the same time, however, {{they are trying to}} reduce costs by utilizing resources efficiently, including human resources, berths, container yards, quay cranes, and various yard equipment. When planning berth usage, the berthing time and the exact position of each vessel at the wharf, as well as various quay side resources are usually determined in the process. Several variables must be considered, including the <b>length</b> <b>overall</b> (<b>LOA)</b> and arrival time of each vessel, the number of containers for discharging and loading, and the storage location of outbound/inbound containers to be loaded onto/discharged from the corresponding vessel. Furthermore, we aim to propose berthing plan that will be "robust", since the actual arrival time of each vessel can vary substantially from forecast. This is particular important for vessels from priority customers (called priority vessels hereon), who have been promised berth-on-arrival (i. e. within two hours of arriving) service guarantee in their contract with PSA. A robust plan will also helps to minimize the frequent updates (changes) to berthing plan that have repercussion in resource and sta deployment within the terminal. Thus, the problem reduces to one of finding a berthing plan, so that priority vessels can be berthed-on-arrival with high probability, and the vessels can be berthed as close to their preferred locations as possible, to reduce the cost of transporting the containers within the terminal. In this paper, we described an approach to address this problem. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|E
