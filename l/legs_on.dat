5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, {{the anatomy of}} the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of <b>legs.</b> <b>On</b> alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
5|$|The caterpillar-like larvae have hard sclerotinised {{heads with}} mandibles (jaws), short true <b>legs</b> <b>on</b> the thorax, prolegs {{on the first}} eight {{abdominal}} segments, and a suction disc or pair of hooks on the terminal tenth segment. The pupae have free appendages rather than being secured within a cocoon (they are exarate).|$|E
5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} been considered most {{closely related to the}} tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of <b>legs</b> <b>on</b> each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E

5|$|Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, {{have a hard}} (sclerotised) {{head with}} strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have {{cylindrical}} bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true <b>legs</b> <b>on</b> the thorax have five segments each. Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.|$|E
5|$|Most spiders that hunt actively, {{rather than}} relying on webs, have dense tufts of fine hairs between the paired claws at the tips of their legs. These tufts, known as scopulae, consist of {{bristles}} whose ends are split into as many as 1,000 branches, and enable spiders with scopulae to walk up vertical glass and upside down on ceilings. It appears that scopulae get their grip from contact with extremely thin layers of water on surfaces. Spiders, like most other arachnids, keep at least four <b>legs</b> <b>on</b> the surface while walking or running.|$|E
5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged <b>legs</b> <b>on</b> the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E

5|$|The Limousin {{is a large}} framed {{breed of}} beef cattle with a bright wheat-coloured coat, not too dark, a little lighter on the belly, {{the rear of the}} thighs, between the <b>legs,</b> <b>on</b> the anus, around the {{testicles}} or udder, and the tail tip. Absence of any spots or pigmentation, with pink mucous membranes. Short head, broad forehead and muzzle, lighter area around the eyes and muzzle, fine horns curved forward and slightly raised at the tip (if present). Short neck. Chest broad and rounded. Side round. Pelvis wide, especially at the pin bones, not too inclined. Bones of lower back and hips slightly protruding. Forequarter well-muscled, wide above and very muscular. Hindquarters thick, deep and rounded. Horns and hooves lighter coloured. Correct limbs. Fine supple hide.|$|E
5|$|The okapi can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with the giraffe. While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe, only males bear horns in the okapi. The okapi has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg {{on the same side}} of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate <b>legs</b> <b>on</b> either side of the body - and a long black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful in plucking buds and leaves as well as for grooming.|$|E
5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the <b>legs.</b> <b>On</b> the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E

5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true <b>legs</b> <b>on</b> the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E
