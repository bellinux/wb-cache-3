6000|$|This proneness to suicide, and <b>loose</b> <b>seat</b> in life, is not {{peculiar}} to the Marquesan. What is peculiar is the widespread depression {{and acceptance of}} the national end. Pleasures are neglected, the dance languishes, the songs are forgotten. It is true that some, and perhaps too many, of them are proscribed; but many remain, if there were spirit to support or to revive them. At the last feast of the Bastille, Stanislao Moanatini shed tears when he beheld the inanimate performance of the dancers. When the people sang for us in Anaho, they must apologise for the smallness of their repertory. They were only young folk present, they said, {{and it was only}} the old that knew the songs. The whole body of Marquesan poetry and music was being suffered to die out with a single dispirited generation. The full import is apparent only to one acquainted with other Polynesian races; who knows how the Samoan coins a fresh song for every trifling incident, or who has heard (on Penrhyn, for instance) a band of little stripling maids from eight to twelve keep up their minstrelsy for hours upon a stretch, one song following another without pause. In like manner, the Marquesan, never industrious, begins now to cease altogether from production. The exports of the group decline out of all proportion even with the death-rate of the islanders. [...] "The coral waxes, the palm grows, and man departs," [...] says the Marquesan; and he folds his hands. And surely this is nature. Fond as it may appear, we labour and refrain, not for the reward of any single life, but with a timid eye upon the lives and memories of our successors; and where no one is to succeed, of his own family, or his own tongue, I doubt whether Rothschilds would make money or Cato practise virtue. It is natural, also, that a temporary stimulus should sometimes rouse the Marquesan from his lethargy. Over all the landward shore of Anaho cotton runs like a wild weed; man or woman, whoever comes to pick it, may earn a dollar in the day; yet when we arrived, the trader's store-house was entirely empty; and before we left it was nearly full. So long as the circus was there, so long as the Casco was yet anchored in the bay, it behoved every one to make his visit; and to this end every woman must have a new dress, and every man a shirt and trousers. Never before, in Mr. Regler's experience, had they displayed so much activity.|$|E

6000|$|... 'The {{dichotomy}} of Lancelot's personality,' as the Germans {{would call}} it, returned as he dashed on. His understanding {{was trying to}} ride, while his spirit was left behind with Argemone. Hence loose reins and a <b>looser</b> <b>seat.</b> He rolled about like a tipsy man, holding on, in fact, far more by his spurs than by his knees, to the utter infuriation of Shiver-the-timbers, who kicked and snorted over the down like one of Mephistopheles's Demon-steeds. They had mounted the hill--the deer fled before them in terror--they neared the park palings. In the road beyond them the hounds were just killing their fox, struggling and growling in fierce groups for the red gobbets of fur, a panting, steaming ring of horses round them. Half a dozen voices hailed him as he came up.|$|R
5000|$|During their lifetime, seating {{arrangements}} were modified {{to suit the}} working being undertaken and included the removal of a varying number of seats for increased luggage capacity. From the mid-1970s the so-called [...] "Big Cab" [...] conversions were applied {{to a number of}} units. This involved the construction of a wall {{between the first and second}} rows of seats to create an isolated driver's cab. The back of the original driver's cab was removed and a <b>loose</b> <b>seat</b> provided. This conversion was applied to one end only and could be fitted to either the No.1 or No.2 End.|$|E
50|$|Back on the track, Fittipaldi was now 15 seconds behind Lauda, Jarier {{had retired}} with a seized rear wheel bearing, Brambilla dropped back to seventh {{suffering}} from <b>loose</b> <b>seat</b> supports, and Hunt, Mass, Peterson and Scheckter were battling for third. Mass overtook Hunt on lap 33. With nine laps to go, Peterson also passed Hunt, who {{was struggling with}} his gear selection and brake balance. Three laps from the finish, Mass's brakes began to fade, and Peterson closed, but locked up his left front tire under braking. The resulting flat spot slowed him enough for Hunt to retake fourth on the last lap. Lauda took the win by just under five seconds.|$|E
5000|$|During the Rococo period, {{furniture}} was lighthearted, physically and visually. The idea of furniture had evolved to {{a symbol of}} status and took on a role in comfort and versatility. Furniture could be easily moved around for gatherings, and many specialized forms came to be such as the fauteuil chair, the voyeuse chair, and the berger en gondola. Changes in design of these chairs ranges from cushioned detached arms, lengthening of the cushioned back (also known as [...] "hammerhead") and a <b>loose</b> <b>seat</b> cushion. Furniture was also freestanding, instead of being anchored by the wall, to accentuate the lighthearted atmosphere and versatility of each piece. Mahogany was widely used in furniture construction due to its strength, resulting {{in the absence of}} the stretcher as seen on many chairs of the time. Also, the use of mirrors hung above mantels became ever more popular in light of the development of unblemished glass.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To pilot data {{collection}} instruments {{and to make}} a preliminary estimate of the level of incorrect use of car seat belts and child restraints in Fife, Scotland. DESIGN: Cross sectional survey of cars containing adults and children at a number of public sites across Fife in 1995 to assess use of car occupant restraints. Trained road safety officers assessed whether seat restraints were appropriate for the age of the passengers and whether restraints were used correctly. These assessments were based on standards published by the Child Accident Prevention Trust. PARTICIPANTS: The survey gathered data from 596 occupants in 180 cars: 327 adults and 269 children. Ten per cent of drivers who were approached refused to participate. Car occupant restraint was assessed in 180 drivers, 151 front seat passengers, and 265 rear seat passengers. MAIN RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty one occupants wore seat belts, 68 were restrained by a seat belt and booster cushion, 63 in toddler seats, 25 in two way seats, and 18 in rear facing infant carriers. Ninety seven per cent of drivers, 95 % of front seat passengers, and 77 % of rear seat passengers were restrained. However, in 98 (52 %) vehicles at least one passenger was restrained by a device that was used incorrectly. Seven per cent of adults and 28 % of children were secured incorrectly. The commonest errors were <b>loose</b> <b>seat</b> belts and restraint devices not adequately secured to the seat. Rates of incorrect use were highest in child seat restraints, reaching 60 % with two way seats and 44 % with rear facing infant seats. CONCLUSIONS: The incorrect use of car occupant restraints is an under-recognised problem, both by health professionals, and the general public. Incorrect use has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of restraints, can itself result in injury, and is likely to be an important factor in child passenger injuries. The correct use of car seat restraints merits greater attention in strategies aiming to reduce road traffic casualties. Areas of intervention that could be considered include raising public awareness of this problem, improving information and instruction given to those who purchase child restraints, and encouraging increased collaboration between manufacturers of cars and child restraints, in considering safety issues...|$|E
60|$|Ann Veronica's {{appearance}} was brief and undistinguished. She {{had nothing to}} say for herself. She was guided into the dock and prompted by a helpful police inspector. She was aware of the body of the court, of clerks seated at a black table littered with papers, of policemen standing about stiffly with expressions of conscious integrity, and a murmuring background of the heads and shoulders of spectators close behind her. On a high chair behind a raised counter the stipendiary's substitute regarded her malevolently over his glasses. A disagreeable young man, with red hair and a <b>loose</b> mouth, <b>seated</b> at the reporter's table, was only too manifestly sketching her.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{bearings}} were of two types at first, ball and roller. In 1972 both bearings became roller-type, and the crankcase was stiffened. These main roller bearings {{in the now}} stiffer case would gall at high revs, leading to main bearing failure (resolved after the Combat model debacle, using the German-made [...] "Superblend" [...] bearing.) [...] The threaded aluminum knobs holding the seat would strip, leaving the <b>seat</b> <b>loose</b> (never resolved). The chain guard mount would fracture (later improved).|$|R
50|$|Jocko Flocko, Tim Flock's pet monkey, {{accompanied}} the racer in-car {{for the final}} time at the 1953 Grand National race. Somehow Jocko got <b>loose</b> from his <b>seat</b> harness and began exploring the race car. He found a string that lifted a trap door where the driver could check {{the condition of the}} right-front tire. As Jocko opened the door, a pebble flew up and struck him in the head. The monkey went berserk and Tim, who was leading the race at the time, had to pit to have the crazed primate removed from the car. Tim finished third as a result.|$|R
50|$|In 1973 {{to handle}} the heavy bookings on the Intercapital Daylight two of the RS cars (2299 & 2306) were rebuilt as ABS dining cars. These cars were fitted with fixed tables and <b>loose</b> 48 <b>seats,</b> the {{separate}} kitchen was also enlarged and rebuilt. Due to objections by the Victorian Railways these rebuilt cars were not used on their intended service but on the Gold Coast Motorail instead. During 1975-76 a further four were rebuilt as ABS type cars (2300, 2302, 2303 & 2305) to provide dining car service on the Brisbane Limited and North Coast Daylight Express. In 1985 RS 2304 was also rebuilt as an ABS car, but this car varied slightly by having low partitions separating the tables with fold down seats from these partitions. As the other ABS cars received workshop attention in the mid-1980s most also received this altered seating. In June 1989 RS 2301 was rebuilt as an 80 seat interurban car with no toilet to operate on the South Coast Daylight Express in company with 1100/1200 class carriages and recoded BKS.|$|R
50|$|Most {{commercial}} aircraft that operate at high flight altitudes are pressurized at a maximum cabin altitude of approximately 8,000 feet. On most pressurized aircraft, if cabin pressurization is lost when the cabin altitude is above 14,000 feet, compartments containing the oxygen masks will open automatically, either above or {{in front of}} the passenger and crew seats, and the oxygen masks will drop down {{in front of the}} passenger. Oxygen masks may also drop on extremely rough landings or during severe turbulence if the oxygen mask panel becomes <b>loose.</b> Rows of <b>seats</b> typically have an extra mask (i.e. 3 seats, 4 masks), in case someone has an infant in their lap, or someone in the aisle needs to grab one.|$|R
50|$|The Mitzvah Technique {{contends that}} {{activating}} and practicing the Mitzvah Exercise and mastering its discipline are what corrects faulty posture and, by extension, {{many of the}} aches and pains associated with it. The Mitzvah Exercise {{is a set of}} movements involving sitting, standing, and walking. The Exercise requires no special equipment other than a chair or stool and space for walking around. The seat should be firm and flat and low enough so that the feet will be flat on the floor when the body is <b>seated.</b> <b>Loose</b> clothing and no shoes are suggested. This is to allow freedom of movement at the hip joint and the transfer of energy through the feet.|$|R
5000|$|Horses play a {{large role}} in the daily and {{national}} life of the Mongols; it is traditionally said that [...] "A Mongol without a horse is like a bird without the wings." [...] Elizabeth Kendall, who travelled through Mongolia in 1911, observed, [...] "To appreciate the Mongol you must see him on horseback,—and indeed you rarely see him otherwise, for he does not put foot to ground if he can help it. The Mongol without his pony is only half a Mongol, but with his pony he is as good as two men. It is a fine sight to see him tearing over the plain, <b>loose</b> bridle, easy <b>seat,</b> much like the Western cowboy, but with less sprawl." [...] (see also A Wayfarer in China).|$|R
50|$|By lap 17, the Ferraris of Ickx and Regazzoni {{had moved}} by Rodríguez, {{but by that}} time, Stewart's lead was nearly twenty seconds. Graham Hill, in a privately entered Lotus 72, came into the pits on lap 30 with fuel {{sloshing}} around in the cockpit, as a fitting had come <b>loose</b> under the <b>seat.</b> The team took 10 minutes to fix the leak, threw some water on Hill, whose overalls were soaked in fuel, and sent him back out. Several laps later, Hill returned to request they find him some dry overalls, as the gasoline was burning his skin. When he stopped again to change clothes, the team said {{they had not been}} able to locate any new ones. Hill, however, saw John Surtees, who had retired on the seventh lap, sitting on the wall, and promptly stripped him of his overalls and undergarments. The two former World Champions were naked in the pits as Hill was doused with water before donning Surtees' clean clothes and returning to the track, only to retire on lap 72 with a broken clutch.|$|R
40|$|WILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON (1742 – 79), {{chief justice}} of South Carolina, Revolutionary leader, and wealthy {{plantation}} owner, was born near Charlestown. His family on both sides were wealthy planters and prominent politicians, enabling young William Henry to study in London and Oxford. Upon his return he married a South Carolina heiress, turned to politics, and {{was elected to the}} Assembly. Drayton championed the cause of British interest in the colonies and opposed such popular measures as the non-importation movement while defending the rights of the individual. Upon <b>loosing</b> his <b>seat</b> in the Assembly, Drayton left for England and returned shortly thereafter to sit on the Council of the province (1770 – 75), supported by relatives who served as Lt. Governor and members of the Council. If his appointment was largely the result of his loyalty to the Crown, Drayton made a complete turnabout during the political turmoil preceding the War of Independence. In 1774, he published A Letter from “Freeman” of South Carolina to the Deputies of North America, essentially arguing for a federal system and independent government in the American colonies while maintaining allegiance to the Crown. Upon Drayton’s suspension in 1775, he joined the Revolutionary forces, recruited volunteers for armed resistance, and was elected president of South Carolina’s provincial Congress. In his elected position as chief justice (March 1776), he became a radical supporter of American Independence, advocated the adoption of his state’s constitution, and represented South Carolina as an elected member to the Continental Congress, where he served from late 1778 until his death a year later. Drayton’s Charge on the Rise of the American Empire (1776) —here courtesy of the American Antiquarian Society—is an address to the Grand Jury of South Carolina at Charleston. Four months after the Declaration of Independence, Drayton enthusiastically outlines his Southern vision of the young United States in its progress toward becoming the next world empire...|$|R
5000|$|In 1976 the grille saw {{a new and}} finer crosshatching pattern. Cornering lamps got new {{horizontal}} {{chrome trim}} while tail lamps gained a new bold look. Eight different color accent stripes were available. Vinyl tops were now integral padded Elk grain material. New trims included sporty plaids, plush velours, knits and 11 distinctive genuine leathers. Coupe de Villes had a new vinyl roof whose top molding served as {{a continuation of the}} door [...] "belt" [...] molding. A Controlled (limited-slip) Differential was included for extra traction. An optional illuminated entry and theft deterrence system was optional. A new battery, called the Freedom battery, never needed water added. New turbine veined and wire wheel covers were offered. A new option locked the doors when the transmission lever was shifted to [...] "Drive". Cadillac also offered Track Master, a computerized skid prevention system that automatically pumped the back brakes in an emergency to shorten stopping distance. New options included a push-button Weather Band built into the AM/FM stereo signal-seeking radio, <b>loose</b> pillow style <b>seats</b> for d'Elegance packages, plus power passenger and manual driver seatback recliners for 50/50 front seats. Of the 15 standard and six optional Firemist body colors, 13 were new this year.

5000|$|A bergère is an {{enclosed}} upholstered French armchair (fauteuil) with an upholstered back and armrests on upholstered frames. The seat frame is over-upholstered, {{but the rest}} of the wooden framing is exposed: it may be moulded or carved, and of beech, painted or gilded, or of fruitwood, walnut or mahogany with a waxed finish. Padded elbowrests may stand upon the armrests. A bergère is fitted with a <b>loose,</b> but tailored, <b>seat</b> cushion. It is designed for lounging in comfort, with a deeper, wider seat than that of a regular fauteuil, though the bergères by Bellangé in the White House (one illustrated) are more formal. A bergère in the eighteenth century was essentially a meuble courant, designed to be moved about to suit convenience, rather than being ranged permanently formally along the walls as part of the decor. [...] The fanciful name, [...] "shepherdess chair", was coined in mid-eighteenth century Paris, where the model developed without a notable break from the late-seventeenth century chaise de commodité, a version of the wing chair, whose upholstered [...] "wings" [...] shielding the face from fireplace heat or from draughts were retained in the bergère à oreilles ("with ears"), or, fancifully, bergère confessionale, as if the occupant were hidden from view, as in a confessional. A bergère may have a flat, raked back, in which case it is à la reine, or, more usually in Louis XV furnishings, it has a coved back, en cabriolet. A bergère with a low coved back that sweeps without a break into the armrests is a marquise.|$|R
