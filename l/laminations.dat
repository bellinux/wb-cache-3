40|$|Stromatolite <b>lamination</b> is {{typically}} defined as alternation of {{dark and light}} laminae. Study of Lower Cretaceous stromatolites fromthe Leza Fm(N Spain) supports this statement, but recognises additional complexities in <b>lamination</b> that have implications for interpreting accretion processes. These stromatolites are partial analogues of present-day coarse-grained carbonate stromatolites in the Bahamas and Shark Bay (Australia) that mainly form by trapping and binding carbonate sand. The Leza examples contain both grain-rich and micrite-rich laminae with scarce particles, suggesting that they accreted both by trapping and not trapping grains. <b>Lamination</b> in modern and ancient coarse-grained stromatolites is commonly defined by thinmicritic crusts that formed during interruptions in accretion and separate contiguous grainy laminae (repetitive <b>lamination).</b> Leza examples also contain these thin hiatal crusts and locally showrepetitive <b>lamination,</b> but their conspicuous macroscopic <b>lamination</b> is defined by thicker alternating grain-rich and micrite-rich laminae (alternating <b>lamination).</b> This indicates that, although hiatuses in accretion occurred, change in accretion process was {{the main cause of}} macroscopic <b>lamination.</b> These differences in accretion processes and <b>lamination</b> styles between Leza examples and modern coarse-grained stromatolites may reflect differences in their environmental settings.

25|$|While prokaryotic {{cyanobacteria}} themselves reproduce asexually through cell division, {{they were}} instrumental in priming the environment for the evolutionary development of more complex eukaryotic organisms. Cyanobacteria (as well as extremophile Gammaproteobacteria) {{are thought to be}} largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primeval earth's atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria use water, carbon dioxide and sunlight to create their food. A layer of mucus often forms over mats of cyanobacterial cells. In modern microbial mats, debris from the surrounding habitat can become trapped within the mucus, which can be cemented by the calcium carbonate to grow thin <b>laminations</b> of limestone. These <b>laminations</b> can accrete over time, resulting in the banded pattern common to stromatolites. The domal morphology of biological stromatolites {{is the result of the}} vertical growth necessary for the continued infiltration of sunlight to the organisms for photosynthesis. Layered spherical growth structures termed oncolites are similar to stromatolites and are also known from the fossil record. Thrombolites are poorly laminated or non-laminated clotted structures formed by cyanobacteria common in the fossil record and in modern sediments.|$|E

40|$|This project {{focused on}} {{advancing}} radio-frequency (RF) <b>lamination</b> technology closer to commercial implementation, {{in order to}} reduce the energy intensity of glass <b>lamination</b> by up to 90 %. <b>Lamination</b> comprises a wide range of products including autoglass, architectural safety and innovative design glass, transparent armor (e. g. bullet proof glass), smart glass, mirrors, and encapsulation of photovoltaics. <b>Lamination</b> is also the fastest growing segment of glass manufacturing, with photovoltaics, architectural needs, and an anticipated transition to laminated side windows in vehicles. The state-of-the-art for glass <b>lamination</b> is to use autoclaves, which apply heat and uniform gas pressure to bond the laminates over the course of 1 to 18 hours. Laminates consist of layers of glass or other materials bonded with vinyl or urethane interlayers. In autoclaving, significant heat energy is lost heating the chamber, pressurized air, glass racks, and the glass. In RF <b>lamination,</b> the heat is generated directly in the vinyl interlayer, causing it to heat and melt quickly, in just 1 to 10 minutes, without significantly heating the glass or the equipment. The main purpose of this project was to provide evidence that low energy, rapid RF <b>lamination</b> quality met the same standards as conventionally autoclaved windows. The development of concepts for laminating curved glass with RF <b>lamination</b> was a major goal. Other primary goals included developing a stronger understanding of the <b>lamination</b> product markets described above, and to refine the potential benefits of commercial implementation. The scope of the project was to complete implementation concept studies in preparation for continuation into advanced development, pilot studies, and commercial implementation. The project consisted of 6 main tasks. The first dealt with <b>lamination</b> with poly-vinyl butyral (PVB) interlayers, which prior work had shown difficulties in achieving good quality laminates, working with Pilkington North America. The second task dealt with a study of current <b>lamination</b> processes in the various laminate industries, and development of concepts for integrating RF <b>lamination</b> into new or existing processes. The third task explored the use of a non-destructive technique for analyzing laminate adhesion with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The fourth task focused on developing concepts for curved glass <b>lamination</b> using RF <b>lamination.</b> The fifth and sixth tasks together comprised an analysis of laminate product markets, ranking for applicability and commercialization potential, and the development of commercialization strategies for those products. In addition, throughout the project as new experimental data and conventional process data were obtained, the benefits analysis of RF <b>lamination</b> was refined. The goals of the project described above were achieved, positioning RF <b>lamination</b> for the next stage growth envisioned in the original Industrial Grand Challenge proposal. Working with Pilkington North America, <b>lamination</b> of flat autoglass with PVB was achieved, meeting all 16 stringent industry tests. In particular, PVB laminates made with RF <b>lamination</b> passed environmental tests including the high temperature, 120 ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â‚ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â°C bake test, without significant formation of bubbles (defects). The adhesion of PVB to glass was measured using the pummel method. Adhesion values ranging from 1 to 7 out of 10 were obtained. The significant process parameters affecting the environmental and adhesion performance were identified through a designed experiment. Pre-lamination process variables including PVB storage humidity and the de-airing process (vacuum or nip rolling) were significant, as well as the level of pressure applied to the laminate during the RF process. Analysis of manufacturing with RF <b>lamination</b> equipment, based on the processes developed indicated that 3 RF presses could replace a typical auto-industry autoclave to achieve equal or greater throughput with possibly less capital cost and smaller footprint. Concepts for curved <b>lamination</b> identifying castable molds for prototyping were developed, which allowed Ceralink to obtain commitment to begin curved tooling development. The project significantly helped to advance RF <b>lamination</b> past the feasibility and novelty stage and into the realm of commercial acceptance as a viable alternative to autoclaves. The demonstration of autoclave-quality autoglass produced in just 1 minute with RF <b>lamination,</b> with validation by Pilkington, has fueled industry motivation to seriously consider RF <b>lamination.</b> The industry and other contacts and outreach made in the study of laminate markets (including 3 technical publications and 5 conference presentations), has resulted in a recent surge in RF <b>lamination</b> activity...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lamination</b> is {{a common}} feature in shales and other mud-dominated rocks. When {{combined}} with other geological evidence, the diverse <b>lamination</b> types can provide important information about sedimentary processes and depositional environments. Petrographic and Scanning Electron Microscope studies performed in the latest Cambrian- earliest Ordovician lower Member of the Volcancito Formation (Famatina Range) have revealed three distinct types of <b>lamination</b> in mudrocks. Thick horizontal <b>lamination</b> (> 0. 5 mm thick) is characterized by dark clay laminae alternating with calcite and quartz-rich light colored silt laminae. Silty laminae show micro-scours at the base, and unidirectional micro-ripple cross-lamination. This type of <b>lamination</b> is dominant in {{the lower part of}} the succession, and it is interpreted as formed by bottom flowing currents, probably induced by storms. Wavy <b>lamination</b> shows clear undulation surfaces at megascopic scale. In thin section, wavy <b>lamination</b> is composed by alternating black organic-rich laminae less than 0. 2 mm thick, and lighter colored carbonate-rich clay and fine silt laminae (0. 1 - 0. 2 mm thick). This second type of <b>lamination</b> is observed at the lower and middle parts of the sequence and it is interpreted as produced by benthic microbial mat development (probably cyanobacteria). Thin horizontal <b>lamination</b> (< 0. 5 mm thick) is characterized by dark organic and clay-rich laminae alternating with lighter colored quartz-rich silty laminae. This <b>lamination</b> may be associated with suspension settling from dilute suspended fine-grained sediment flows. Thin horizontal <b>lamination</b> is predominant at the upper part of the succession. Changes in <b>lamination</b> and sedimentary processes observed from base to top of the studied succession record a major deepening event in the basin during the latest Cambrian - earliest Ordovician, which finally triggered the deposition of a thick lower Tremadoc black shale package. This event was also responsible of a significant faunal change through the sequence. The representing fauna of the Parabolina frequens argentina Biozo-ne changes upwards from predominant benthic trilobites (e. g. Parabolinella, Angelina hyeronimi (KAYSER), Shumardia erquensis KOBAYASHI, Onyclopyge, etc.) to pelagic trilobites (exclusively Jujuyaspis), which occur associated with planktonic graptolites (Rhabdinopora). Changes in facies pattern and faunal components record a relative sea level rise, which resulted in a major transgression at the base of the Ordovician...|$|R
