As a result, {{it was found that}} both the { 1010 } and { 0001 } faces of plate-like ice crystals grown at - 28. 5 ℃ and <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation</b> grew by the Burton-Cabrera-Frank (BCF) mechanism, and when the relationship P_P>P_B held, plate-like ice crystals grew...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{instability and}} the growth mechanism of ice crystals grown in air at - 30 ℃ and at supersaturation below 4 % have been experimentally studied. Whether ice crystals grown under this condition would develop into long prismatic columns or into thin plates {{is dependent on the}} emergence of active screw dislocations on the { 0001 } or { 1010 } faces of the crystals. The morphological instability of ice crystals grown in air at <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation</b> is related to the emergence of active screw dislocations near the corners of the { 0001 } or { 1010 } faces.

40|$|Condensation nuclei {{measurements}} using a <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation</b> (about 10 %) {{thermal gradient}} diffusion cloud chamber (TGDCC) {{and a high}} supersaturation (about 200 %) expansion type instrument were compared {{on a series of}} three balloon flights over Laramie, Wyoming. In general, the two instruments produced similar vertical profiles but some discrepancies remain unexplained. Agreement between the two would indicate that the <b>low</b> <b>supersaturations</b> used in the TGDCC were still large enough to cause the instrument to count essentially all of the particles present. The TGDCC condensation nuclei (CN) counter was flown at several sites in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The results indicate the existence of a relative maximum in the CN mixing ratio associated with the upper equatorial troposphere and {{what appears to be a}} worldwide constant mixing ratio of CN above 20 - 25 km...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleation}} kinetics of hen egg-white lysozyme crystallization {{was investigated}} using a hot stage cooling crystallizer and a microscope {{to monitor the}} solution crystallization process in real time. Images of crystals were continuously recorded under varied precipitant and protein concentrations. The nucleation rate {{was found to be}} higher at higher precipitant concentration, and increase monotonically with protein concentration if the precipitant concentration was held constant. Attempt was made to interpret the experimental data using classical nucleation theory. It was found that the model predictions are lower than the experimental values at <b>low</b> <b>supersaturations</b> but agree well with experimental data at high supersaturations. The trends in the experimental data suggest that two nucleation mechanisms might co-exist: heterogeneous nucleation seeming to be the dominant at <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation</b> while at higher supersaturation homogeneous nucleation seeming to play the major role...|$|R

This was accomplished by keeping a <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation</b> through the following procedure: semi-continuous operating mode, slow reactant addition rate and addition of a calcium complexing agent. A high temperature (90 °C) and probably carbonate incorporation also favored the formation of a well crystallized material.

40|$|Measurements {{of cloud}} {{condensation}} nuclei (CCN) concentrations (cm − 3) between 0. 2 and 1. 0 % supersaturation, aerosol size distribution and chemical composition were performed at a remote marine {{site in the}} eastern Mediterranean, from September to October 2007 during the FAME 07 campaign. Most of the particles activate at ~ 0. 6 % supersaturation, characteristic of the aged nature of the aerosol sampled. Application of Köhler theory, using measurements of bulk composition, size distribution, and assuming that organics are insoluble resulted in agreement between predicted and measured CCN concentrations within 7 ± 11 % for all supersaturations, with a tendency for CCN underprediction (16 ± 6 %; r 2 = 0. 88) at the <b>lowest</b> <b>supersaturations</b> (0. 21 %). Including {{the effects of the}} water-soluble organic fraction (which represent around 70 % of the total organic content) reduces the average underprediction bias at the <b>low</b> <b>supersaturations,</b> resulting in a total closure error of 0. 6 ± 6 %. Using threshold droplet growth analysis, the growth kinetics of ambient CCN is consistent with NaCl calibration experiments; hence the presence of aged organics does not suppress the rate of water uptake in this environment.

Tapered CdS nanobelt growth process includes VLS mechanism in axial direction and vapor–solid mechanism in lateral direction under high supersaturation. CdSe nanowires growth proceeds by VLS mechanism under <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation.</b> The PL measurements recorded from the as-prepared CdS and CdSe 1 D nanostructures show only a bandgap emission with relatively narrow fwhm, {{which means they}} possess high-quality optical property.

Growth {{is conducted}} under very <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation</b> conditions where adatom incorporation occurs predominantly at step edges, and lateral growth is strongly preferred. The achievable step-free area {{is limited by}} the substrate dislocation density. For ammonothermal crystals with an average dislocation density of ∼ 1 × 104 cm− 2, step-free mesas up to 200 × 200 μm 2 in size are achieved.

The real-time microscopic information allows a direct visualization of near-critical nuclei, determination of the supersaturation and the line tension of the crystallites, and, thus, derivation of the Gibbs free energy for nucleation. The resulting critical nucleus size nicely agrees with the measured value. Nuclei up to 4 - 6 times larger still decay with finite probability, urging reconsideration of the classic perception of a critical nucleus...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the isotropic-to-smectic transformation in a fluid of colloidal hard rods using computer simulations. At high supersaturation, we observe spinodal decomposition: many small clusters are formed {{at the initial}} stage of the phase transformation, which form a percolating network that eventually transforms into a stable bulk smectic phase. At <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> we find that nucleation and growth of the smectic phase is hampered by the pre-smectic ordering in the supersaturated isotropic fluid phase. As the system evolves mainly via cooperative motion of these smectic domains, the diffusion and attachment of single particles to the nucleation site is largely hindered...|$|R

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{development}} in pulsed lasers with ultrashort pulse widths or wavelengths, spatially precise, low-damage processing by femtosecond or deep-UV laser ablation has shown promise {{for the production}} of protein single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography. Femtosecond laser processing of supersaturated solutions can shorten the protein nucleation period or can induce nucleation at <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> which improves the crystal quality of various proteins including membrane proteins and supra-complexes. In addition to nucleation, processing of protein crystals by femtosecond or deep-UV laser ablation can produce single crystalline micro- or macro-seeds without deterioration of crystal quality. This tutorial review gives an overview of the successful application of laser ablation techniques to nucleation and seeding {{for the production of}} protein single crystals, and also describes the advantages from a physico-chemical perspective. Key learning points (1) Protein crystal nucleation and seeding by laser ablation enable the production of high-quality protein single crystals that are necessary for X-ray crystallography. (2) Use of lasers with ultrashort pulse widths or wavelengths allows spatially precise, low-damage processing of protein solutions and crystals via specific ablation processes (e. g. photomechanical and photochemical). (3) Processing of supersaturated solutions by femtosecond laser ablation can induce protein nucleation at <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> which results in the growth of high-quality single crystals. (4) Processing of protein crystals by femtosecond or deep-UV laser ablation can produce single crystalline micro- or macro-seeds without deterioration of crystal quality. 1...|$|R
40|$|In 1897 Ostwald {{formulated}} {{his step}} rule for {{formation of the}} most stable crystal state for a system with crystal polymorphism. The rule describes the irreversible way a system converts to the crystal with lowest free energy. But in fact the irreversible way a supercooled gas below the triple point temperature T_tr. p. crystallizes via a liquid droplet {{is an example of}} Ostwald's step rule. The homogeneous nucleation in the supersaturated gas is not to a crystal, but to a liquid-like critical nucleus. We have for the first time performed constant energy (NVE) Molecular Dynamics (MD) of homogeneous nucleation without the use of a thermostat. The simulations of homogeneous nucleation in a Lennard-Jones system from supersaturated vapor at temperatures below T_tr. p. reveals that the nucleation to a liquid-like critical nucleus is initiated by a small cold cluster [S. Toxvaerd, J. Chem. Phys. 143 154705 (2015) ]. The release of latent heat at the subsequent droplet growth increases the temperature in the liquid-like droplet, which for not deep supercooling and/or <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> can exceed T_tr. p [...] The temperature of the liquid-like droplet increases less for a <b>low</b> <b>supersaturation</b> and remains below T_tr. p., but without a crystallization of the droplet for long times. The dissipation of the latent heat into the surrounding gas is affected by a traditional MD thermostat, with the consequence that droplet growth is different for (NVE) MD and constant temperature (NVT) MD.

In contrast, ice-forming nuclei (IN) are defined as aerosol particles that act as the base of the deposition nucleation of cloud–ice particles or the heterogeneous freezing of supercooled droplets. At present, our knowledge of IN is less complete than that of CCN because of insufficient availability of measurements and experimental data to model the complicated ice-nucleation process (Pruppacher and Klett 1997).|$|R

As reported in earlier studies, the (101) growth rates are larger at <b>low</b> <b>supersaturations</b> than the (110) growth rates at the same conditions, and smaller at high supersaturations.

The particle size distribution (PSD) of the precipitates increased as the supersaturation decreased up to a mode of about 22 mu m at pH 5.
