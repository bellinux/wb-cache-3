25|$|Until it was {{required}} to sell Gatwick and Stansted Airports, Heathrow Airport Holdings held a dominant position in the London aviation market, and has been heavily regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) {{as to how much}} it can charge airlines to land. The annual increase in <b>landing</b> <b>charge</b> per passenger was capped at inflation minus 3% until 1 April 2003. From 2003 to 2007 charges increased by inflation plus 6.5% per year, taking the fee to £9.28 per passenger in 2007. In March 2008, the CAA announced that the charge would be allowed to increase by 23.5% to £12.80 from 1 April 2008 and by inflation plus 7.5% for each of the following four years. In April 2013, the CAA announced a proposal for Heathrow to charge fees calculated by inflation minus 1.3%, continuing until 2019. Whilst the cost of landing at Heathrow is determined by the CAA and Heathrow Airport Holdings, the allocation of landing slots to airlines is carried out by Airport Co-ordination Limited (ACL).|$|E

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} how aircraft noise {{can be translated}} into a form of <b>landing</b> <b>charge.</b> The objectives of the thesis were to develop noise landi'ng charges for six of the major airports in England and to determine what the implication it has on passengers' choice of airports. An airport choice model is developed distinguished by three market types: long-haul international scheduled, short-haul international scheduled and charter international. Modelling of airport choice was also carried out for passengers from the Greater London and South East areas. The best results are obtained using difference in access time, logarithmic difference in frequencies and weighted differences in fare variables. There is consistency in the access time coefficients for all three markets. Airport choice for international scheduled and charter passengers for the Greater London and other South East areas also show consistency in access time amongst different passenger groups in choosing airports. The implication of the noise charge particularly at Gatwick and Heathrow for the short and long haul markets reveal that the fare coefficients are sensitive and are subject to doubt. However Brooke et al (1994) acknowledge that exact fare details are difficult to obtain. Therefore {{it is a difficult}} task to produce accurate fare coefficients with published fare details that do not take into account discounts received by passengers. This is reflected in this study by observing the fact that high number of passengers change airports, when it may be argued that the noise charges are moderate. The sensitivity of the implications of the noise charge determined in this study have depended highly on the fare coefficients. This study has demonstrated the importance and perhaps the over reliance of depending on a single parameter for the evaluation of the implications of the noise charge...|$|E

The airport has been criticised by airlines, led by Air New Zealand, for its purportedly high <b>landing</b> <b>charges.</b> However research conducted in September 2010 by aviation consultants Jacobs indicates that Auckland Airport international charges are slightly below the average of the 20 largest international airports flown by Air New Zealand.
