40|$|DE 10059160 A UPAB: 20011026 NOVELTY - Bonding {{of plastic}} {{component}} (1) to support, comprising a laser-transparent section, {{at least in}} zones where there is contact (3) between the components on the side away from the surface. Contacts are illuminated by the laser through the support and energy is at least partially absorbed by the plastic component for welding at the contacts. The energy does not damage or alter outer surface. USE - The system is for applications such as bonding the inner lining to a vehicle door, a bumper, a mud guard wing cladding or a <b>luggage</b> <b>space</b> <b>cover.</b> ADVANTAGE - The system gives an effective and durable bond between the plastics lining and the vehicle bodywork, without marking or damaging the outer appearance, and at speeds matching the rate of a high speed vehicle production line...|$|E
