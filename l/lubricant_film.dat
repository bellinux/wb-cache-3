The film thickness is reduced to 1 - 2 [*]nm to minimize the magnetic spacing, and optimal, precise design is required to obtain sufficient lubrication. However, until now, there was no generally applicable method for investigating such thin films.

40|$|AbstractRotating {{floating}} {{rings in}} the rotor bearings {{are widely used}} for decrease of rotor vibrations in small rotor machines. Such bearings are named two-film, because have two <b>lubricant</b> <b>films.</b> Dynamics of the rotor with floating ring bearings is investigated in details in [1 – 3]. The charging system also use non-rotating floating rings in turbochargers of internal combustion engines [4]. In some combinations of design and condition parameters of the rotor bearing system, the dimension of rotor and rings motion trajectory can essentially increase, though it is still limited [1 – 3]. To decrease journal and ring oscillation amplitudes and loadings affecting the bearing, the design with three <b>lubricant</b> <b>films</b> can be used. It is achieved through installation of the floating ring package into a rotor machine case. Floating ring bearing package consists of one non-rotating floating ring (NF ring) and two rotating floating rings (RF ring) ...|$|R
50|$|Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming {{surfaces}} {{or higher}} load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, {{the motion of}} the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary lubrication regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness.|$|E
50|$|Hydrodynamic {{lubrication}} {{is where}} {{the motion of the}} contacting surfaces, and the exact design of the bearing is used to pump lubricant around the bearing to maintain the lubricating film. This design of bearing may wear when started, stopped or reversed, as the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> breaks down. The basis of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication is the Reynolds equation. The governing equations of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication and some analytical solutions {{can be found in the}} reference.|$|E
50|$|To prevent {{destructive}} burnishing, sliding must be avoided, and in rolling situations, loads must be {{beneath the}} spalling threshold. In {{the areas of}} a machine that slide with respect to each other, roller bearings can be inserted so that the components are in rolling contact instead of sliding. If sliding cannot be avoided, then a lubricant should be added between the components. The purpose of the lubricant {{in this case is}} to separate the components with a <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> so they cannot contact. The lubricant also distributes the load over a larger area, so that the local contact forces are not as high. If there was already a lubricant, its film thickness must be increased; usually this can be accomplished by increasing the viscosity of the lubricant.|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain a}} better {{understanding}} of how bonded solid <b>lubricant</b> <b>films</b> lubricate and wear (in general), the tribological properties of polyimide-bonded graphite fluoride films were studied (in specific). A pin-on-disk type of testing apparatus was used; but in addition to sliding a hemispherically tipped rider, a rider with a 0. 95 mm diameter flat area was slid against the film. This was done so that a lower, less variable contact stress could be achieved. Two stages of lubrication occurred. In the first, the film supported the load. The lubricating mechanism consisted of the shear of a thin surface layer (of the film) between the rider and the bulk of the film. The second occurred after the bonded film had worn to the substrate, and consisted of the shear of very thin <b>lubricant</b> <b>films</b> between the rider and flat plateaus generated on the metallic substrate asperities.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to {{describe}} mechanisms involved in a <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> formation in textured conformal contacts.

On {{the basis of these}} effects and the visual image of the contact, the flow of lubricant in the contact area is described. Shallow dimples lead to larger film thickness in elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication regime. They act like a lubricant reservoir. Deep dimples positively affect film thickness in hydrodynamic lubrication regime, where the effect of shallow dimples descend. During experiments, the formation of a cavitation is observed. The cavitation causes a starvation of dimples in many cases. This leads to reducing of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness. This effect can be eliminated by appropriate parameters of texture in operational conditions of elements...|$|E
40|$|The elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL) {{regime is}} characterized by the elastic deformation of the bodies in contact, hydrodynamics of viscous friction caused by shearing the lubricant, and dramatic viscosity increase due to high pressure. As technology for mechanical components advances towards higher energy efficiency and less energy loss from viscous friction, this advancement implies that <b>lubricant</b> <b>films</b> are decreasing towards thicknesses on the nanometer scale. However, these <b>lubricant</b> <b>films</b> may behave differently from what is predicted by classical EHL theory. While viscosity is affected by temperature, pressure, and shear rate, researchers have discovered that there is a new dependence of film thickness on viscosity, indicating that extreme confinement in EHL can affect the viscosity of the lubricant. In this work, we attempt to characterize the relationship between film thickness and viscosity for squalane using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations so that we may observe how the <b>lubricant</b> behaves with <b>film</b> thicknesses on the nanometer scale. However, we were unable to successfully obtain this relationship due to issues with the MD simulations. In addition, we attempt to improve the ability of EHL simulations to accurately capture the behavior of ultra-thin film lubricated interfaces by incorporating empirical models that describe the effect of confinement on fluid viscosity. The enhanced model reproduces trends seen in some EHL experiments where the film thickness of very thin <b>film</b> <b>lubricants</b> is larger than expected compared to classical EHL theory.

We found significant density oscillations in the <b>lubricant</b> <b>films,</b> especially near {{the top and bottom}} boundaries. Prom the density oscillations we can define 9 - 10 layers for a film of 44 Å thickness, and 5 layers for a 20 Å thick film. The motions of individual lubricant molecules in the direction perpendicular to the surfaces are rather restricted, spanning only 1 - 2 layers during the entire 200 ps. We also observed the stick-slip motion of the lubricant molecules near the bottom and top boundaries in the direction of shear. However, the change from stick to slip state (or vice versa) for a lubricant molecule does not correlate with the change in its radius of gyration or end-to-end distance. The characteristics of the stick-slip motion of the lubricant molecules are strongly influenced by the type of organic R-group in the wear inhibitor molecules...|$|R

40|$|Being {{particularly}} critical components, the serviceability {{of rolling}} element bearings is usually {{essential for the}} machines operation. They {{have been the subject}} of research for more than a 100 years. The work of this manuscript investigates two aspects of rolling element bearings. Firstly, the dynamic behaviour of a rolling element bearing is analysed. The study emphasises the influence of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> on the bearing dynamics. Secondly, the lifetime of the bearing is analysed. The study discusses the influence of external dynamic loads on the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> formation and wear of the raceway surfaces. The bearing dynamics and lifetime are experimentally analysed using an innovative and versatile test rig. The first contribution of the current work consists of the development of this test rig. The test rig is designed and constructed in-house and characterised by three unique features. Firstly, the test rig allows easy adjustment to test different types and sizes of rolling element bearings. The test bearing is mounted in a modular structure consisting of an auxiliary shaft and an intermediate sleeve. Secondly, the test rig allows applying a multi-axial static and dynamic load on the test bearing. The bearing load is controlled in both the radial and axial direction and has a static and dynamic component in both directions. Thirdly, the test rig allows simultaneous measurement of the bearing motion, the bearing dynamics and the behaviour of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film.</b> Relations between the different measurements can be derived experimentally. The radial, axial and tilt motion are measured free from disturbances of the surrounding structure. The bearing dynamics are identified in a frequency range below the resonances of the surrounding structures flexible modes. The behaviour of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> is analysed based on the electrical resistance through the bearing. In the current study, a single row deep groove ball bearing is used as a test bearing. The bearing motion, the behaviour of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> and cage slip are analysed for different operational conditions of the bearing. The three properties are derived using techniques which can be applied in most rotating machinery: measurement of the radial bearing displacement and the electrical resistance through the bearing. Clear trends w. r. t. the bearing load, temperature and speed are obtained. Clean analysis of the bearing motion and cage slip further proves precise operation of the test rig. The electrical resistance reveals the formation of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> during a run-up of the bearing speed. Estimation of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness based on the electrical resistance is validated using an analytical model. Exploring the possibilities to easily and accurately identify the properties is the second contribution of this work. Accurate knowledge on the bearing dynamic properties is essential during the design of many rotating machinery. They determine the machines critical speeds, the forces acting on the different components, etc. This work investigatestwo dynamic properties of the test bearing: the radial stiffness and damping in the direction of the static load. Variation of the bearing temperature reveals the influence of the lubricants viscosity on the identified stiffness and damping. Variation of the bearing speed reveals the influence of the film formation on the identified stiffness and damping. In the literature, no experimental measurements showing the relations between the behaviour of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> and the dynamic properties are reported. Revealing these relations is the third contribution of the current study. The results help to evaluate the significance of modelling the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> when numerically analysing the vibrations of a bearing system. Precise prediction of the lifetime of rolling element bearings is a crucial step towards a reliable design of many rotating machines. For bearings subjected to highly varying loads, a strong reduction of the actual bearing lifetime w. r. t. the classically calculated bearing lifetime is observed. This work investigates the effect of external dynamic loads on the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> formation and surface wear of the test bearing. When introducing a radial or axial excitation on the bearing, the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness follows the imposed variations of the load. An increase of metallic contact or breakdown of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> is not detected. Under axial excitation, sliding motion between asperities of the contacting surfaces in the bearing does occur. Accelerated lifetime tests under high axial dynamic load reveal polishing of the raceway honing structure. This polishing is clearly observed on SEM images of the inner raceway after a test duration of only 0. 5 % of the calculated L 10 life. Analysis of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> behaviour under dynamic load is not described in the current literature and is considered to be the fourth contribution of this work. Finally, the study promotes further research to analyse surface wear due to external dynamic loads. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Wind turbine gearbox {{operates}} under a {{wide array}} of highly fluctuating and dynamic load conditions caused by the stochastic nature of wind and operational wind turbine controls. Micropitting damage is one of failure modes commonly observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This article investigates gear micropitting of high-speed stage gears of a wind turbine gearbox operating under nominal and varying load and speed conditions. Based on the ISO standard of gear micropitting (ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010) and considering the operating load and speed conditions, a theoretical study is carried out to assess the risk of gear micropitting by determining the contact stress, sliding parameter, local contact temperature and <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness along the line of action of gear tooth contact. The non-uniform distributions of temperature and <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness over the tooth flank are observed due to the conditions of torque and rotational speed variations and sliding contact along the gear tooth flanks. The <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness varies along the tooth flank and is at the lowest when the tip of the driving gear engages with the root of the driven gear. The <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness increases with the increase of rotational speed and decreases as torque and sliding increase. It can be concluded that micropitting is most likely to initiate at the addendum of driving gear and the dedendum of driven gear. The lowest film thickness occurs when the torque is high and the rotational speed is at the lowest which may cause direct tooth surface contact. At the low-torque condition, the varying rotational speed condition may cause a considerable variation of <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness thus interrupting the lubrication which may result in micropitting...|$|E
