25|$|In May 2002, Swedish {{newspaper}} Expressen {{reported that}} Victoria {{had a new}} boyfriend, her personal trainer at Master Training, Daniel Westling. When the news broke and the media turned its attention on him, {{it was obvious that}} he did not <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public eye. Once Westling was photographed crossing a street against a red light in order to avoid a camera. In July 2002, Victoria and Daniel Westling were pictured kissing {{for the first time at}} a birthday party for Caroline Kreuger, a close friend of Victoria's.|$|E
25|$|In a {{relatively}} closely fought game at Chelmsford, the Essex team showed more resilience than the visitors, with nearly everyone chipping in {{to give the}} hosts {{a relatively}} comfortable victory. It started with a good bowling effort on the first day, after Ronnie Irani had chosen to put Leicestershire in. It nearly backfired, Darren Robinson and Darren Maddy easing their way to 98 for no loss, but the part-time medium pace of Essex number three Ravinder Bopara got Maddy out, resulting in a mini-collapse to 167 for 8. David Masters (27) and Phil DeFreitas (20) saved the innings somewhat, but Leicestershire's final total of 220 off 81 overs meant that Essex looked <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drivers' seat. Dale Steyn, the young South African pace bowler with three Test caps, took three for 69 on Essex debut, but Darren Gough was the pick of the bowlers with three for 46 - including Robinson, Paul Nixon for a golden duck and DeFreitas.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the new project, drummer Rob Bourdon said, [...] "We tend to be perfectionists and it's sort of how we work. We <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio {{and when we get}} in there we write a ton of material." [...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E
50|$|Albright and Mann {{note that}} while the Greek word angelos is {{commonly}} translated as angel it {{could just as well}} mean a generic divine messenger.

500|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by Japanese music critics, and {{was chosen as}} one of the eleven finalists for the 2011 CD Shop Awards. Toshitomo Doumei of Skream! named the album his third favorite of 2011, feeling that the album had simultaneously created new genres of alternative rock and pop music. He felt the album's music was catchy, and that its success was expected due to its high quality. Entertainment Media Kulture called Kikuuiki the album that established Sakanaction's current style. Yuji Tanaka of CDJournal felt the album was more cohesive than their previous works, praising the band's skill progression and Yamaguchi's lyrics, which he described as [...] "literary-style" [...] and [...] "cynical". He was struck by the [...] "heroic march" [...] after the album's introduction in the song [...] "Ushio", which made him feel [...] "suddenly intoxicated... <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ocean". Takayuki Endoh of Skream! similarly believed the album showed growth in the band. Although their previous releases incorporated dance and rock music, Endoh felt that the music on Kikuuiki had struck a better harmony between the two, and had simultaneously become more rock and dance–oriented. He praised the album's [...] "poppy floating feeling, highly literary lyrics, and romantic electro sound", feeling that the band was unique in the music industry.|$|E
500|$|The Stone Tape remains well-regarded to this day. [...] Roger Fulton, {{writing in}} The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction, calls it [...] "arguably the most creepy drama {{ever seen on}} television". The writer and critic Kim Newman regards it as [...] "one of the masterpieces of genre television, an {{authentic}} alliance of mind-stretching science fiction concepts with horror and suspense plot mechanics". Writer and member of The League of Gentlemen, Jeremy Dyson feels that The Stone Tape [...] "strikes a note that it just circumnavigates your intellect and gets you on a much deeper level [...] it just has this impact on you, rather <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room itself. Extraordinary piece of work". [...] Writer Grant Morrison recalled The Stone Tape as [...] "really creepy and very memorable. Just brilliant images. That {{scared the hell out}} of me!". Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, has said that [...] "The Stone Tape stands as perhaps his finest single work in the genre". Lez Cooke, in his book British Television Drama: A History, has praised the play as [...] "one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of Play for Today".|$|E

5000|$|Former West Monroe Mayor Bert Hatten, a {{longtime}} Young friend, said that Young [...] "knew {{a lot of}} people, liked people and many liked him in return and were lifetime friends.

2500|$|Charlie's Angels {{proved to}} be a runaway hit in the 197677 season in its first of five time slots, Wednesdays at 10:00pm, where it {{followed}} Baretta. Facing little competition from CBS and NBC, Charlie's Angels finished fifth in Nielsen ratings in the spring of 1977 with an average 26.0 rating. The three lead actresses were suddenly propelled to stardom, with Kate Jackson later commenting that the first few months were <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eye of a storm. Farrah Fawcett became hugely popular and was branded a phenomenon. However, the situation off screen was not as rewarding. The long working hours on set, combined with numerous calls for photo shoots, wardrobe fittings, and promotional interviews, took their toll on the trio. Jackson was especially unhappy as she felt the quality of scripts was declining and the format was now more [...] "cop story of the week" [...] rather than classy undercover drama, which had been the intention with the pilot film.|$|E

He had declared that he would pass his time between Naples, Rome, and Florence; but it seemed to his friends that Florence was, of the three, the most to his taste. He liked his room, he said, at the York Hotel, and he <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capital. That was his own statement. His friends said that he <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> with Carry Spalding, the daughter of the American Minister; but none of them, then in Italy, were sufficiently intimate with him to express that opinion to himself.|$|R

[...] Later in life, her country manners and full figure were severely in contrast with Jackson's tall, spindly form and developed genteel manners. However, her love for her husband was unmistakable: she languished when he was away for politics, fretted when he was away at war, and doted on {{him when he was}} at home. Unlike Jackson, Rachel never <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spotlight of events. She would consistently warn her husband to not let his political accomplishments rule him; for example, after Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans, she warned Jackson that his subsequent popularity (on the scope of George Washington) would tempt him to value his glory over his own family.|$|R
