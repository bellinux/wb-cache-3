500|$|Fantasia told Us Weekly {{that the}} lyrics revolve around [...] "how I don't let {{people talk about}} me <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> to [...] I control how I feel". She said the song deals with her {{attempted}} suicide and demanding relationships with her family, and how she wanted to bless people through her personal story and music. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Fantasia said the following about the song's message: [...] "I wanted {{people to know that}} I've been through the rain, I 've been broken into pieces, I had a daughter at such a young age. There were times people would say, 'That's it for her,' but that didn't happen." [...] Christian Todays Czarina Ong referred to [...] "I Made It" [...] as Fantasia's [...] "victory song" [...] and [...] "her song of success". According to Rito P. Asilo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the song represents how Fantasia has reconciled with her feelings of [...] "heartbreak, betrayal, and the character-forming pain of rejection and failure".|$|E

[...] Doolittle was fulsome in his praise for the novel, saying [...] "Fleming's new book will not disappoint his millions of fans". Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning, although even he admitted that [...] "you can't argue with success". However, {{he went on to say}} that [...] "simply pro forma, I must set down my opinion that this is a silly and tedious novel." [...] Boucher went on to bemoan that although On Her Majesty's Secret Service was better than The Spy Who Loved Me, [...] "it is still a lazy and inadequate story", going on to say that [...] "my complaint is not that the adventures of James Bond are bad literature... but that they aren't good bad literature". Boucher finished his review lamenting that [...] "they just aren't writing bad books <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> to." ...|$|E

I'm excited for all the fans to hear my real music". The tweet was soon followed up by another, with the singer tweeting [...] "Dub step records on my album sounding crazy!!!!". However, the tweet was later removed, suggesting that Brown gave away too much details about the album.|$|E
