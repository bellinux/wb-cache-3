We have compared the value of measurements of lung distensibility and a multibreath test of helium (He) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) washout in distinguishing between six men with mild impairment of airway function caused by asthma (group A) and six men with similar airway function but probable widespread emphysema (group E). In group E there were striking abnormalities in the static pressure-volume curve of the lungs (reduced <b>lung</b> <b>recoil</b> pressures, increased chord compliance, increased shape factor) and the relation between maximum expiratory flow and <b>lung</b> <b>recoil</b> pressure fell within the normal range. In group A there were only minor abnormalities in lung distensibility and maximum expiratory flow was reduced at a standard <b>lung</b> <b>recoil</b> pressure. In addition carbon monoxide transfer coefficient was reduced in group E but normal in group A. Normal values for He-SF 6 washout were similar to those previously described. Differences in He-SF 6 washout between group A and group E men were small and in part accounted for by differences in functional residual capacity. In subjects with lung disease, end-tidal He and SF 6 concentrations during washout were erratic and it was sometimes impossible to define a crossover point. We conclude that in our hands this technique is less useful for detecting acinar disease than are measurements of lung distensibility or carbon monoxide transfer.

40|$|SummaryThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} new reference values and predictive variables for dynamic and static pulmonary compliance in men. The investigation was conducted as a prospective study in healthy, non-smoking men with normal pulmonary function parameters including spirometry, bodyplethysmography and CO diffusing capacity. The esophageal pressure method was used to measure dynamic compliance (Cdyn), specific dynamic compliance (Cdyn/ITGV), static compliance (Cstat) and specific static compliance (Cstat/ITGV). <b>Lung</b> <b>recoil</b> pressures were recorded at different levels of total lung capacity (TLC). A total of 208 men aged 20 – 69 years were included in the study. The mean values for the compliance parameters were: Cdyn: 2. 91 ± 1. 08 L/kPa; Cdyn/ITGV: 0. 71 ± 0. 30 kPa− 1; Cstat: 3. 34 ± 1. 04 L/kPa; Cstat/ITGV: 0. 82 ± 0. 31 kPa− 1. Cdyn, Cdyn/ITGV and Cstat/ITGV were significantly correlated with age and Cstat was related to height, but in multiple regression analyses the predictability for compliance parameters was very low. <b>Lung</b> <b>recoil</b> pressures at all TLC levels significantly decreased with ageing.

Is the change in intrapleural pressure during vibration the sum of the intrapleural pressure due to recoil of the lung, chest wall compression, and chest wall oscillation?DesignRandomised, within-subject, experimental study. ParticipantsSeven experienced cardiopulmonary physiotherapists and three healthy adults. InterventionVibration (compression + oscillation), compression alone, and oscillation alone were applied manually to the chest walls of healthy participants during passive exertion and compared with passive expiration alone. Outcome measuresChest wall force, chest wall circumference, intrapleural pressure, and expiratory flow rate. ResultsDuring vibration, coherence was high (r 2 > 0. 97) between external chest wall force, chest wall circumference, intrapleural pressure, and expiratory flow. The mean change in intrapleural pressure during vibration was 9. 55 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 66), during chest compression alone was 8. 06 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 65), during oscillation alone was 7. 93 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 57), and during passive expiration alone was 6. 82 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 51). During vibration, compression contributed 13 % of the change in intrapleural pressure, oscillation contributed 12 %, and <b>lung</b> <b>recoil</b> contributed the remaining 75 %.

40|$|Lung volume {{reduction}} surgery {{has become}} an accepted therapeutic option to relieve the symptoms of selected patients with severe emphysema. In a majority of these patients, it causes objective as well as subjective functional improvement. A proper understanding of the physiological determinants underlying these beneficial effects appears very important {{in order to better}} select patients for the procedure that is currently largely carried out on an empirical basis. Lung volume reduction surgery has two distinct effects. Firstly, it causes an increased elastic recoil, which at least partially explains the enhanced maximal expiratory flow. Secondly, it is associated with a reduction of hyperinflation which allows for an increase in global inspiratory muscle strength and in diaphragmatic contribution to tidal volume as well as a decrease in the inspiratory elastic load imposed by the chest wall. Taken together, these effects result in a reduced work of breathing and in an enhanced maximal ventilation which both contribute to the increased exercise capacity and reduced dyspnoea after surgery. The improved <b>lung</b> <b>recoil</b> and the reduced hyperinflation after volume reduction surgery were the primary postulates upon which the usual selection criteria for the procedure were based. It is now likely that these are correct. Nevertheless, some patients do not benefit from lung volume reduction surgery and the current literature does not allow for a refinement of the selection process from a physiological point of view. The exact mechanisms underlying the improvement in <b>lung</b> <b>recoil,</b> lung mechanics, and respiratory muscle function remain incompletely understood. Moreover, the effects of lung volume reduction surgery on gas exchange and pulmonary haemodynamics still need to be more fully investigated. An analysis of the characteristics of patients who do not benefit from the procedure and the development of an animal model for lung volume reduction surgery would probably help address these important issues. status: publishe...|$|E

On the contrary, static compliance, static <b>lung</b> <b>recoil</b> pressure and diffusing capacity are seldon abnormal.

Since <b>lung</b> <b>recoil</b> is largely determined by surface tension for resting tidal volumes, this will dominate the stretch of mechanoreceptors.

The {{total lung capacity}} was 81 percent of control. The static pressure-volume curve of the long intersected the normal one in the vicinity of functional residual capacity (i. e. the recoil pressure was increased at large lung volumes and diminished at low lung volumes), and both expiratory compliance and Pel max were significantly decreased. In 13 of the 15 patients, the minimal (inspiratory) pleural pressure-volume curve was shifted so that the pressures generated by the inspiratory muscles were less negative than normal at any given lung volume. The decrease in Pel max was proportional to the alteration in muscle pressures. These findings indicate (1) that patients with mitral valve disease have compromised function of the inspiratory muscles, and (2) that this alteration is responsible for the low Pel max.

However, there is variability of zero leveling procedures, and the current recommendation of end-expiratory reading {{may not always be}} adequate. A review of physiological and anatomical data, supported by recent imaging, leads to the practical recommendation of zero leveling at the cross-section of three transthoracic planes, which are, respectively midchest frontal, transverse through the fourth intercostal space, and midsagittal. As for the inevitable respiratory pressure swings, end-expiratory reading at functional residual capacity allows for minimal influence of elastic <b>lung</b> <b>recoil</b> on pulmonary pressure reading. However, hyperventilation is associated with changes in end-expiratory lung volume and increased intrathoracic pressure, eventually exacerbated by expiratory muscle contraction and dynamic hyperinflation, all increasing pulmonary vascular pressures. This problem is amplified in patients with obstructed airways. With the exception of dynamic hyperinflation states, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that negative inspiratory and positive expiratory intrathoracic pressures cancel each other out, so averaging pulmonary vascular pressures over several respiratory cycles is most often preferable.

If aging has independent effects on the pathophysiology of asthma, then the clinical expression of disease and its response to treatment will be different in old com-pared with young patients with asthma. It is, therefore...|$|R
