50|$|The bonefishes' closest {{relatives}} are the tarpons and <b>ladyfishes</b> {{in the order}} Elopiformes. Bonefishes are unlike tarpons in that their mouths are under the snout rather than the end of it. Like tarpons and <b>ladyfishes,</b> bonefishes can breathe air via a modified swim bladder and are found in brackish waters. Bonefish larvae are leptocephalic.|$|R
50|$|The {{superorder}} Elopomorpha {{contains a}} variety of types of fishes that range from typical silvery-colored species, such as the tarpons and <b>ladyfishes</b> of the Elopiformes and the bonefishes of the Albuliformes, to the long and slender, smooth-bodied eels of the Anguilliformes. The one characteristic uniting this group of fishes is they all have leptocephalus larvae, which are unique to the Elopomorpha. No other fishes have this type of larvae.|$|R
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, <b>ladyfish,</b> sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E

5000|$|Pacific <b>ladyfish</b> are pelagic, marine forms preferring either {{brackish}} {{or fresh}} water {{unless they are}} breeding. They prefer specific water depths {{of no more than}} 8 m. Little is known about the ecology of this species, but they are known to be highly carnivorous, feeding on smaller fish and crustaceans. [...] This behavior is very similar to their relative, the Atlantic <b>ladyfish.</b> Maximum size is relatively larger than most Arizona fish, reaching lengths of 1 m. A negative correlation exists between size and presence in the Colorado River. As they become larger in size, they enter more brackish waters for unknown reasons. Larval and juvenile stages of fish have large records of distribution near Rocky Point, in the Sea of Cortez tidal inlets. Their spawning areas are usually closer to coastal areas, because they use saltier waters for their young.|$|E
