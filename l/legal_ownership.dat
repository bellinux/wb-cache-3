5|$|Tracing {{is divided}} into two forms, common law tracing and {{equitable}} tracing. Common law tracing relies on the claimant having <b>legal</b> <b>ownership</b> of the property, and will fail if the property has been mixed with other property, the legal title has been transferred to the defendant, or the legal title has been transferred by the defendant to any further recipient of the property. Equitable tracing, on the other hand, relies on the claimant having an equitable interest in the property, and can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E
5|$|Howard Peck, {{an animal}} trainer, brought the eight-month-old collie to Hollywood animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax {{in order to}} break the animal of {{uncontrolled}} barking and a habit of chasing motorcycles. After working with the dog, Weatherwax gained control of the barking {{but was unable to}} break Pal of his motorcycle-chasing habit. Peck was disappointed with the results and gave the dog to Weatherwax in exchange for the money Peck owed him. Weatherwax, in turn, gave the dog to a friend, but when he learned that Eric Knight's 1940 novel, Lassie Come-Home, was being considered as a feature film by MGM, Weatherwax sensed Pal was the dog to fill the role, and bought Pal back from his friend for $10.00 USD. Peck later tried to reclaim him after he became famous as Lassie, but Weatherwax's <b>legal</b> <b>ownership</b> was upheld. Rudd's brother Frank Weatherwax, who trained dogs for such films as The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T and The Wizard of Oz, assisted Rudd in training Pal.|$|E
5|$|Zahir's {{father and}} {{grandfather}} had both served as the multazim (chief tax collector) of Tiberias, having been appointed by the Druze emirs (princes) of the Ma'an dynasty which governed the region from their headquarters in Mount Lebanon. In 1698, Umar az-Zaydani was appointed multazim of the Safad region by Bashir Shihab I, the Sunni Qaisi emir who succeeded the Ma'ans as governor of the Mount Lebanon Emirate. The Zaydani family maintained commercial trade relations extending from Galilee to Aleppo and controlled tax farms in Galilee; Zahir's uncle Ali, for instance, held the tax farm of al-Damun. Zahir's elder brother Sa'd became {{the head of the}} family when their father died in 1706, but the family's tax farms were transferred to Zahir, who was still a teenager. This was done as a precautionary measure, so that {{in the event of a}} default in tax payments, the Ottoman government would not be able to hold the practical owners of the tax farms accountable. Nonetheless, <b>legal</b> <b>ownership</b> of the Zaydani tax farms gave Zahir considerable power within his clan.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} <b>legal</b> form of <b>ownership</b> of a hospital on its fi- nancial performance in the Czech republic. Applying the 2009 cross-sectional data on hospitals, several performance indicators were explored. We used both external and internal hospital characteristics determining financial performance, which we observed {{on the basis of}} accounting data. Through employed regression analysis, the relationship between the <b>legal</b> form of <b>ownership</b> and performance was not confirmed. On the other hand, the analysis found significant positive influence of private ownership, which is an essential condition of utilization of potencial positive effects of the corporate <b>legal</b> form of <b>ownership.</b> Better financial performance of the private hospitals and non-significant differences in the performance of public hospitals of both <b>legal</b> forms of <b>ownership</b> (semi- budgetory organization or corporation) confirm these conclusions. Moreover, according to our results, hospital profitability is determined by some demografic factors {{as well as by the}} size of hospitals. This thesis reveals that effort of the state to increase financial performance of public hospitals through the change of their legal form does not bring desired effects...|$|R

It gave the government control of the commercialization of the resources and allowed for continuous government control with annual audits. It also ordered companies to consult with indigenous groups who live on land containing gas deposits. The law stated that the 76 contracts signed by foreign firms must be renegotiated before 180 days. This has not yet been done. Protesters argued that the new law did not go far enough to protect the natural resources from exploitation by foreign corporations, demanding a complete nationalization of the gas and process in Bolivia.|$|E

Plans to demolish the building, the site where Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot, were met with strong opposition from preservationists. In August 2005, LAUSD settled a lawsuit over the matter that had been filed by numerous preservationist groups: most of the Ambassador complex would be destroyed, but the Paul Williams-designed coffee shop and the Coconut Grove nightclub would be preserved, with the Grove serving as the auditorium for a new school to be built on the site.

25|$|In {{the three}} decades after 1860, {{southern}} Malawi was transformed {{by a combination}} of warfare and raiding for slaves and ivory from a region where farming supported a reasonable population to one where the lack of security led to the widespread abandonment of agriculture land. Local chiefs attempted to gain protection from European settlers by granting them the right to cultivate land which, although fertile, was insecure and therefore vacant. Once the British Central Africa Protectorate had been proclaimed in 1891, these settlers gained <b>legal</b> <b>ownership</b> of this land from the protectorate administration. Although many of the grants contained “non-disturbance” clauses allowing resident Africans to continue to cultivate their existing fields rent-free, most owners claimed the right to demand labour in exchange for allowing them farm part of their land. The Nyasaland settlers adopted the term “thangata” for this from the Chewa language, where it meant freely-given help with agricultural work, but its colonial meaning was performing labour in lieu of rent.|$|E
25|$|Systematic use {{of child}} labour was common {{place in the}} colonies of European powers between 1650 and 1950. In Africa, colonial administrators {{encouraged}} traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. Millions of children worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries. Sophisticated schemes were promulgated where children in these colonies {{between the ages of}} 5–14 were hired as an apprentice without pay in exchange for learning a craft. A system of Pauper Apprenticeship came into practice in the 19th century where the colonial master neither needed the native parents' nor child's approval to assign a child to labour, away from parents, at a distant farm owned by a different colonial master. Other schemes included 'earn-and-learn' programs where children would work and thereby learn. Britain for example passed a law, the so-called Masters and Servants Act of 1899, followed by Tax and Pass Law, to encourage child labour in colonies particularly in Africa. These laws offered the native people the <b>legal</b> <b>ownership</b> to some of the native land in exchange for making labour of wife and children available to colonial government's needs such as in farms and as picannins.|$|E
25|$|Nezahualcoyotl, {{for whom}} the city and {{municipality}} were named, was the lord of Texcoco, one of the allies of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Texcoco dominated {{the area in which}} the modern municipality stands; however the land on which Ciudad Neza stands was under Lake Texcoco until the 20th century. Drainage of the interconnected lakes of the Valley of Mexico began in the early colonial period. The first major drainage project was begun in 1590, with the aim of eliminating the chronic flooding that plagued Mexico City. By the time of the Mexican War of Independence, flooding was still a problem in the Mexico City area, and at that time a project was begun to drain Lake Texcoco directly. The Lake Texcoco area was declared federal property in 1912, after which efforts to completely drain the lake commenced which continued until the 1930s. Starting in 1917 under Venustiano Carranza, efforts to determine <b>legal</b> <b>ownership</b> of lands that began to appear due to the drainage of the lake were undertaken. Most of this land was declared federal property to be sold. In 1933, the Mexico City–Puebla highway was built through this area. The first settlements in what is now the municipality were extensions of the municipalities of Chimalhuacán, La Paz and Ecatepec.|$|E

25|$|The 1870s and 1880s in Malawi were unsettled, {{and local}} chiefs sought to gain European {{protection}} from their enemies by granting settlers what they probably considered {{was only a}} right to cultivate vacant land. Soon after the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in 1891, these Europeans secured <b>legal</b> <b>ownership</b> of this land from the protectorate administration. The new owners also claimed all rights that the traditional leaders had or were thought to possess, asserting that thangata work was an obligation that the landlord could impose on tenants. In the early colonial period, thangata took on a new meaning of performing labour in lieu of rent. In {{the early years of}} the protectorate, the estates established in under-populated areas needed workers to establish plantations. Few Africans were resident on estate lands, and some of those who remained left when labour rents were introduced. New workers, who were often migrants from Mozambique, were encouraged to move onto estates and grow their own crops, but were required to pay rent and Hut tax, usually satisfied by two months’ labour a year at this time. Before 1905, relatively little land on the estates was planted, as the owners were experimenting with a variety of crops. However, from 1905, cotton was successfully grown in commercial quantities. Cotton has a 5 or 6 month growing season, throughout which it needed much labour for a successful result. Between 1910 and 1925, tobacco was also grown in plantations and, like cotton it required a great deal of labour to grow successfully. As tenancies were based on verbal contracts, tenants had little or no chance to dispute the owners’ interpretations of them. On several estates, the obligations of labour tenants were extended, sometimes to a total of four or five months a year for thangata and Hut tax, much of this in the growing season leaving tenants with little time to grow food. As the Crown lands near the estates were already crowded, and as most of estate tenants were migrants from Mozambique with no claim to communal land, they had little option but to stay. In this situation thangata came to mean forced labour.|$|E
