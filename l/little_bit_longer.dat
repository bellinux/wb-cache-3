5|$|Everyone in {{the family}} has to create budget cuts in their daily routine, such as Homer having {{to give up on}} buying beer and Marge having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly lottery ticket. Bart must get his hair cut at a local barber school, Lisa can no longer get her volumes of Encyclopedia Generica, and Maggie's clothes have to last a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>longer.</b> They {{eventually}} save up enough money for the operation, which is a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the morale of the family suffers and they take their annoyance out on Santa's Little Helper. Feeling unwanted, he runs away from home and goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken to the dog pound, and adopted by Mr. Burns, who trains him to be one of his vicious attack hounds. After a long brainwashing process, consisting of the Ludovico technique, Santa's Little Helper is turned into a bloodthirsty killer.|$|E

It was confirmed that the tour would be promoted by AEG Live and Buena Vista Concerts, a division of The Walt Disney Company.

In October2007, another date was annexed in order to meet demand. In December2007, a fourteen-date extension of the tour was announced, with American duo Aly & A.J. opening seven of them; the opening act for the remaining dates was yet be announced. The extension featured new opening acts because the Jonas Brothers pulled out to record their then-forthcoming album A <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>Longer</b> (2008). Subsequently, in the same month, one final date was annexed, and the American band Everlife was announced to as the final opening act. One dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, a center dedicated to the prevention, treatment and research for the cure of cancer. In total, the Best of Both Worlds Tour raised over US $2million for the center.|$|E
500|$|Mars and Lawrence {{started working}} {{together}} and writing songs together for Mars to perform, but they received many rejections from labels. The duo considered {{moving back to}} their home cities. However, in that week, they {{got a call from}} Brandon Creed (Mars' former manager) who was A a reunited Menudo who needed songs. Creed liked their song [...] "Lost", which was written for Mars. At first Mars and Lawrence didn’t want to give it up, so Creed offered $20,000 for it. They were so surprised that they said [...] "You can have that one and whatever else you need!" [...] It was that call that saved them, allowing them to stay in L.A. a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>longer.</b> After that, they were asked by Aaron-Bay Schuck (Mars' A) to help write Flo Rida's number one single [...] "Right Round".|$|E

500|$|Lead artist Arnold Tsang recounted {{that the}} body size, {{as well as the}} running pose of a character, were both {{characteristics}} that were considered during character design in order to make each one identifiable. Tracer, for instance, has a wild running animation, in addition to a unique trail of blue light, which follows behind her. Nathan Grayson of Kotaku commented that her jump animation appears [...] "hyper-exaggerated and kinda goofy looking". This {{is a result of the}} smear frame, combined with squash and stretch animation techniques, implemented in Overwatch. With respect to Tracer, Blizzard senior animator David Gibson pointed out frames from her jump animation, stating, [...] "we're trying to just push it a little further than normal. Something as simple as stretching the torso out, having her hang [...] just a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>longer</b> than normal. Really squashing her when she lands. Her head is tucking in. Everything is supporting this basic principle of squash and stretch in a gameplay asset." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Obsessed" [...] {{was written}} by Roger Lavoie. Because the EP's {{production}} personnel did not understand it, the song was at first denied of inclusion. However, once [...] "Obsessed" [...] reached Cyrus, she continually insisted the track be included on the EP because she felt related to it. Cyrus described the song as depicting the emotions one feels when one cannot stop thinking of a person and believed it related to numerous fans having their first love. [...] "It's a really romantic song", she concluded. [...] "Before the Storm", originally released on the Jonas Brothers' fourth studio album Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009), is included on The Time of Our Lives as a live rendition. The song {{was written by}} Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas, Kevin Jonas, and Cyrus. At first, the song was solely written by the Jonas Brothers for their third studio album A <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>Longer</b> (2008), but {{did not make the}} final cut. Nick and Cyrus later reworked the song's lyrics to fit their past romance using a grand piano.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Mosley {{represented}} FOCA in the [...] "FISA-FOCA War", {{a conflict between}} FOCA, representing the mainly UK-based independent teams, and FISA, which {{was supported by the}} [...] "grandee" [...] constructors owned by road car manufacturers (primarily Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Renault). In 1981, FOCA announced its own World Federation of Motor Sport and ran the non-championship 1981 South African Grand Prix. The staging of this event, with worldwide television coverage, helped persuade Jean-Marie Balestre, the FISA president, that FISA would have to negotiate a settlement with FOCA. As Mosley has since commented: [...] "We were absolutely [...] If Balestre could have held the manufacturer's support for a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>longer,</b> the constructors would have been on their knees. The outcome would then have been very different." [...] Mosley helped draw up the Concorde Agreement, a document which resolved the dispute by essentially giving FISA control of the rules and FOCA control of commercial and television rights. The most recent version of the Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December 2007, and a new one was being discussed, as of 2008. In 1982, the year after the first Concorde Agreement was signed, Mosley left his role at FOCA, and Formula One, to work for the Conservative Party.|$|E

500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>longer,</b> I believe he would have." ...|$|E

[...] He added that the band thought they [...] "hit a ceiling" [...] with Hopeless Records since [...] "trying to tackle things like getting radio [...] and things like that was sort of becoming harder and harder {{based on the fact that}} the label hadn’t really done it before." [...] In December, the band began writing for their next album. The band demoed around 20 songs for inclusion on their next album before whittling the number down, with the aim of recording 15 or 16 of them. After touring in Australia as part of the Soundwave festival in February and March 2010, Gaskarth spent time writing new material in Los Angeles.|$|E
