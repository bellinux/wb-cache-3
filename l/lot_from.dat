5|$|The $4.2 million {{expansion}} {{will expand}} the rail trail parking <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> 70 spaces to 210. Completion {{is scheduled for}} spring 2018. A handicapped-accessible sidewalk and a kiss-and-ride lane / bus loop will be constructed next to the station, with plans for a future pedestrian plaza and restrooms where the USO building was located. The project will not include renovations to make the station handicapped accessible, which would have substantially increased the project cost. However, with the parking issues settled and the accessible entry point in place, Ayer may {{be included in the}} next round of MBTA station overhaul projects.|$|E
5|$|This {{building}} on Main Street was originally a garage owned by Sycamore resident Frederick B. Townsend. Townsend's Queen Anne style home overlooks the <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> a small incline. The distinctive stone structure {{was constructed in}} 1906 {{for use as a}} garage for the estate of Frederick B. Townsend, his former home is the Queen Anne mansion that overlooks the garage property. Today it is home to a restaurant. After the building left private ownership the property was exploited for commercial use and became a gas station. Despite the years and the changes in function the building's historical character remains intact.|$|E
5|$|When Dave Toschi met Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt, the {{director}} {{told him that}} he was not going to make another Dirty Harry (which had been loosely based on the Zodiac case). Toschi was impressed with their knowledge of the case and afterwards, he realized that he had learned a <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> them. In addition, the Zodiac's two surviving victims, Mike Mageau and Bryan Hartnell were consultants on the film.|$|E
40|$|Attachment {{and growth}} of {{mammalian}} cells plated at low cell density require optimum conditions for the cells to form colonies. Reliability, reproducibility, {{and validity of the}} plating efficiency test for evaluating cell culture sera were determined by measuring the plating efficiency of 37 lots of fetal bovine serum obtained from 8 suppliers (5 <b>lots</b> <b>from</b> each of 7, 2 <b>lots</b> <b>from</b> 1 supplier), by using hamster embryo fibroblasts plated at low cell density. The test revealed considerable variation between lots of serum and between suppliers. The five <b>lots</b> <b>from</b> some suppliers had consistently high plating efficiencies, whereas one or more <b>lots</b> <b>from</b> other suppliers had quite low efficiencies. The results were reproducible in repeated tests, and control experiments indicated that the test measured the efficiency of the test serum independently of the efficiency of the serum used for the primary outgrowth of the hamster embryo cells...|$|R

5|$|As {{the club}} was {{dissatisfied}} with this arrangement, it launched plans to establish its own venues. First it needed to secure a lot, and in the late 1920s lied its eyes on a parcel of land owned by Hamar Jernstøperi. However, the lot was sold to Oplandske Kreditbank in 1930 and the club had to negotiate purchasing the <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> the bank. The club established a new committee {{to look into the}} stadium issue. Hamar IL was invited to become part-owner of the venue, but they chose to remain at Hamar stadion. As Briskebyen was not able to secure a partner to share the costs with, opposition towards the project grew within the club. Yet, the decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April.|$|E
5|$|In the 400m {{freestyle}} heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in {{an attempt}} to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim hard {{in the first half of}} the race before slowing down. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4min 21.6s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly his responsibility and that he learnt a <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> it.|$|E
5|$|The club held an {{architecture}} competition, and received six bids. On 28 September 2005, Start Toppfotball {{announced that they}} had selected the design by Kjell Kosberg from Kosbergs Arkitektkontor, who had previously designed Aker Stadion and Briskeby Arena. The default proposal contained a spectator capacity for 9,948 people, but the plans were scalable, allowing for increased capacity if the club so wanted. Ernst Ravnaas, co-owner of the club, stated that given the recent high attendance, he {{wanted to build a}} larger stadium than the default proposal. Financing was planned with a free <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> Kristiansand Municipality, a NOK40 million loan from the municipality, a NOK20 million grant from Cultiva, a municipal culture fund, NOK20 in value added tax refund, NOK10 to 20 million in naming rights, the sale of commercial property, NOK30 to 40 million in a bank loan, and the remaining with share capital from Start Toppfotball.|$|E

40|$|Seed {{germination}} {{patterns were}} studied in Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench grouped by seed source, {{one group of}} seven <b>lots</b> <b>from</b> commercially cultivated populations and a second group of nine <b>lots</b> regenerated <b>from</b> ex situ conserved wild populations. Germination tests were conducted in a growth chamber in light (40 μmol·m– 2 ·s– 1) or darkness at 25 °C for 20 days after soaking the seeds in water for 10 minutes. Except for two seed <b>lots</b> <b>from</b> wild populations, better germination was observed for commercially cultivated populations in light (90 % mean among seed <b>lots,</b> ranging <b>from</b> 82 % to 95 %) and in darkness (88 % mean among seed <b>lots,</b> ranging <b>from</b> 82 % to 97 %) than for wild populations in light (56 % mean among seed <b>lots,</b> ranging <b>from</b> 9 % to 92 %) or in darkness (37 % mean among seed <b>lots,</b> ranging <b>from</b> 4 % to 78 %). No germination difference was measured between treatments in light and darkness in the commercially cultivated populations, but significant differences were noted for treatments among wild populations. These results suggest that repeated cycles of sowing seeds during cultivation without treatments for dormancy release resulted in reduced seed dormancy in E. purpurea...|$|R

25|$|Even {{as a young}} boy, Ryelandt had a mind of his own. Much as he revered his “best piano teacher,” Franz Devos (of the Ghent Conservatory) {{who gave}} him private lessons, he wrote that Devos “did not pay enough {{attention}} to technique, which left me unsatisfied.” While he learned a <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> Tinel, whose technical mastery he greatly admired, he also let himself be influenced by Wagner, whom Tinel detested, and by French composers such as Franck, Fauré and Debussy, whereas Tinel was primarily German-oriented. But Ryelandt never belonged to any school or fashion; in fact, he despised fashion.|$|E
25|$|The Oto-Manguean {{languages}} {{have changed}} quite a <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> the very spartan phoneme inventory of Proto-Oto-Manguean. Many languages have rich inventories of both vowels and consonants. Many {{have a full}} series of fricatives, and some branches (particularly Zapotecan and Chinantecan) distinguish voicing in both stops and fricatives. The voiced series of the Oto-Pamean languages have both fricative and stop allophones. Otomian also have full series of front, central and back vowels. Some analyses of Mixtecan include a series of voiced prenasalised stops and affricates; these can also be analysed as consonant sequences {{but it would be}} the only consonant clusters known in the languages.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005, Rader {{attempted}} {{to leave a}} cereal box {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck at a Home Depot in Wichita, but the box was discarded by the truck's owner. It was later retrieved from the trash after Rader asked what had become of it in a later message. Surveillance tape of the parking <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> that date revealed a distant figure driving a black Jeep Cherokee leaving the box in the pickup. In February, more postcards were sent to KAKE, and another cereal box left at a rural location was found to contain another bound doll, apparently meant to symbolize the murder of 11-year-old Josephine Otero.|$|E
