A time resolved stress detection technique was employed to measure transient stress profiles and amplitudes. Optical microscopy was used to characterize ablation craters qualitatively, while a wide band acoustic transducer helped to quantify tissue mechanical response and the ablation threshold. The ablation threshold was measured as a function of laser pulse duration and <b>linear</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient.</b> For nanosecond pulses the ablation threshold was found to have a strong dependence on the <b>linear</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the material. As the pulse length decreased into the subpicosecond regime the ablation threshold became insensitive to the <b>linear</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The ablation efficiency was found to be insensitive to both the laser pulse duration and the <b>linear</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient.</b> High quality ablation craters with no thermal or mechanical damage to surrounding material were obtained with 350 fs laser pulses. The mechanism of optical breakdown at the tissue surface was theoretically investigated. In the nanosecond regime, optical breakdown proceeds as an electron collisional avalanche ionization initiated by thermal seed electrons. These seed electrons are created by heating of the tissue by linear absorption. In the ultrashort pulse range, optical breakdown is initiated by the multiphoton ionization of the irradiated medium (6 photons in case of tissue irradiated at 1, 053 nm wavelength), and becomes less sensitive to the <b>linear</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The energy deposition profile is insensitive to both the laser pulse duration and the <b>linear</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient...</b>|$|E
