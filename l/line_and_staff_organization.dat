Ink, paper, and movable type challenged the authority of the Roman church in the West and eventually provided the underpinnings of the nation state (Eisenstein 1980). Telegraph lines running alongside railroads helped create the managerial (rather than entrepreneurial) corporation in the late nineteenth century (Chandler 1990 b). Interstate highways built both predictable supply chains and consumer demand for US fast food restaurant chains such as Howard Johnson’s and McDonald’s after World War II (Schlosser 2000). Such common managerial artifacts as <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> <b>organization,</b> complex reporting relationships (and the organization charts that encode them), and titles to reflect one’s status and stature emerged from the twentieth century military and industrial organizations that were built to harness new technological capabilities.|$|E
40|$|Occupational Safety and Health (OS&H) {{appears to}} be a {{particularly}} complex topic in the case of large public facilities open to the patrons (Ministries, public offices) due to a number of quite typical characteristics that, consequently in many cases, can make inadequate the usual approaches to the OS&H problems suitable to the industrial activities or secondary educational institutions. The paper discusses the results of a multidisciplinary work -made exhaustive thanks to the presence of highly qualified experts in the staff- carried out in cooperation by Italian Universities for the definition of a Guideline for the Occupational Risk Assessment and Management of employees and students in the Italian Universities. The Guideline was specially conceived to substantially improve the continuous effort towards the OS&H management in a sound quality approach, and provide for each person the actual residual exposure to Hazard Factors, resulting from a consistent and undoubtedly updated System and Job analysis. The Guideline, since the very first step of the study, stresses the paramount importance of a detailed and unambiguous definition of the <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>Organization</b> upon which to base the approach composed by 3 basic hierarchical phases. The Guideline was carefully tested both in terms of general approach and in some sub-applications to special critical topics. The importance of the presence, among the Universities teaching and research staff, of resources qualified on OS&H aspects should not be underestimated. Their deep knowledge of the local situation can be, in fact, a precious help both in the Occupational Risk Assessment and Management for complex problems, and in organization of Information, Formation and Training -IFT...|$|E
40|$|OS&H {{appears to}} be {{particularly}} complex {{in the case of}} large public facilities (Ministries, public offices, [...] .) open to the patrons, due to a number of typical characteristics, such as the often very large number of workers and patrons and the wide range of patrons' typologies, the age and historical/artistic value of many Italian settlements, the common possibility of internal/external interference of functional volumes. As a consequence, the usual approaches to the OH&S problems in industrial activities or secondary educational institutions can prove quite inadequate in many cases. The task of Occupational Risk Assessment and Management analysts becomes even more demanding where the attention is focused on activities which are institutionally involved in both high degree university education and in advanced research, the latter carried on in laboratories where also special devices, often of original or somehow modified design, are used. On the basis of literature findings, no very helpful suggestion based on real case histories are available, and in many cases the approach is limited to general purpose references on a limited number of Hazard Factors, integrated with spots on demand interventions, whilst both Prevention through Design general approaches to the OS&H problems, and quality approaches (e. g. according to OHSAS 18000) in the Residual Risk Assessment and Management are not common. The present thesis discusses with particular reference to Universities in general and to the Italian situation in particular, the results achieved in a multidisciplinary work -made exhaustive thanks to the presence of highly qualified experts among the staff- carried out in cooperation by Politecnico di Torino and Università degli Studi di Torino. The most important outcome was the definition of a Guideline for the Occupational Risk Assessment and Management of workers and users of large public facilities, specially conceived to provide for each involved person an effective evaluation of the actual residual exposure to the total number of Hazard Factors, systematically identified by means of a consistent Job Analysis. The Guideline, focalized in particular on the universities, stresses the paramount importance of a detailed and unambiguous definition, since the very first step of the study, of the <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>Organization,</b> upon which to base the discussion of the three basic Occupational Safety topics in the following hierarchic order: a) the workplace general safety characteristics, b) the workers OS&H along their activity in terms of involved residual risks, taking into account the available equipment (tools, machines and fittings), and c) the quality management of the OS&H system. The technique, carefully tested both in its general approach and in a number of sub-applications for special aspects, can moreover play an effective role in the continuous process of assisted training of the subjects operating in the various Areas (Departments, Services, [...] .) who, thanks to the detailed knowledge of their area, will be able to provide a capillary contribution in the phases of Hazards Factors Identification, and of suitable OH&S conditions -as defined in the Risk Management process- conservation and improvement. This PhD thesis, analyzes in depth the applicative phases and sub-phases of the proposed model with some examples of real cases. In particular, the thesis stresses the essential need of following the hierarchical phases of approach to provide an exhaustive management tool for Occupational Risk Assessment and Managemen...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{corporations}} {{must have}} an environmentally oriented management system. Because it is an open system that adapts to its environments. If a corporation is unable to adapt to its environments, it cannot survive in its environments (i. e., economic, social and natural environments). Therefore, modern corporations must build an environment management system. This article explains what environment management system modern corporations must have, and tries to build a model of environment management system in modern corporations. The environment management system must cover every function of corporations' managements, i. e., (i) vertical functions of management (top, middle and lower managements), (ii) horizontal functions of management (<b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> management), <b>and</b> (iii) process of management (Plan, do and see it!). In the system of environment management, environmental goals, which are decided by top management, will be environment strategies, and then these planned strategies are operated by <b>line</b> management, <b>and</b> finally controlled by top, middle and lower management of <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R

So, the main aim of our paper was to identify certain benefits from the knowledge of <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> organizational analysis for modern managers as well as for employed people in an organisation. In the paper is concluded that the degree or extent of complexity, dependability, stability and adaptability of the technology and techno-structure of an organization will naturally dictate the way and manner the operations of the enterprise are distributed. By implication, the technology of an enterprise always dictates its span of control authority levels and extent of delegation, responsibility assignment, and number of steps along the ladder of responsibilities...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate differences in administrative attitude adopted by line versus staff type administrators of community college based allied health career education programs when professionally and non-professionally related job responsibilities were considered. The population included 126 administrators each of whom represented a community college which hosted from five to fifteen allied health career programs, inclusively, and which maintained a full time equivalent enrollment of 2000 or more students. Seventy-three administrators identified themselves as <b>line</b> type <b>and</b> fifty-three as <b>staff</b> type. Data for the study constituted responses to a questionnaire survey instrument comprising twenty statements divided equally between professionally related and nonprofessionally related job responsibilities. Responsibility statements were adapted from conference reports citing specific competencies for allied health career administration. Participants responded to each of the twenty responsibility statements by selecting one of five equally marked referent positions on a leadership-management scale. Responses were quantified as <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> group mean scores and analyzed statistically. Five null hypotheses were tested using non-directional t tests at the 0. 001 level of significance. Where significance was determined, F tests were employed to verify homogeneity of variance. Three hypotheses were structured to test inter-group score differences when all and sub-sets of responsibilities were considered. Two hypotheses were employed to test intragroup score differences when professionally versus nonprofessionally related statements were considered. Analysis of data, organized relative to each of the hypotheses, led to the following conclusions:Line type administrators, as a group, adopted a moderate position of leadership when all twenty job responsibility statements were considered. Staff administrators tended toward an attitude of management. The difference was statistically significant. When professionally related statements were considered, both <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> groups adopted attitudes of leadership. Line administrators, however, adopted a stronger referent than did staff. The difference was significant. Statistically significant difference was determined between <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> responsibility referents to nonprofessionally related statements. Line administrators tended to a leadership referent <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> adopted a slight managerial referent. Observably large standard deviations for <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> group mean scores necessitated tests of homogeneity of variance. These tests showed statistical significance when line versus staff group scores were compared in response to all twenty responsibility statements as well as in response to professionally related statements. Frequency polygon plots of individual scores depicted a bimodal distribution of staff respondent scores. The line administrator group adopted a position of leadership for both professionally and non-professionally related statements of job responsibility. This referent was expressed more so for the former set of responsibilities than the latter. The difference between referents was statistically significant. Staff administrators adopted a group attitude slightly on the leadership side of the leadership-management scale when professionally related statements were considered and slightly on the management side for non-professionally related statements. The difference, however, was not statistically significant. Tabulation of descriptive data revealed that approximately three-fifths of both <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> respondents possessed a health career credential. Fifty-two per cent of line respondents compared to thirty-three per cent of staff reported that they occupied their position for five or more years. In summary, this study confirmed differences in attitudes of leadership and management adopted by line versus staff type administrators of allied health career programs when identical statements of job responsibility were considered. Ambivalence of <b>staff</b> group leadership <b>and</b> management attitude to responsibilities was also noted. The inherent nature of the line type administrative position as opposed to a staff type suggests a basis for these findings. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
