5|$|The Lunar Module (LM) was {{designed}} to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage {{was designed}} totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely <b>lightweight</b> <b>construction.</b> It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, {{each with its own}} engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended Lunar Module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly.|$|E
25|$|The Typhoon {{features}} <b>lightweight</b> <b>construction</b> (82% composites {{consisting of}} 70% carbon fibre composite materials and 12% glass fibre reinforced composites) {{with an estimated}} lifespan of 6,000 flying hours.

25|$|Between 1934 and 1935 the German Ministry of Aviation (RLM) ran {{a contest}} {{to produce a}} modern fighter for the {{rearming}} Luftwaffe. Kurt Tank entered the parasol-winged Fw 159 into the contest, against the Arado Ar 80, Heinkel He 112 and Messerschmitt Bf 109. The Fw 159 was hopelessly outclassed, and was soon eliminated from the competition along with the Ar 80. The He 112 and Bf 109 were generally similar in design but the 109's <b>lightweight</b> <b>construction</b> gave it performance edge the 112 {{was never able to}} match.

25|$|Starting in {{the early}} 2000s, {{the rapid growth of}} {{legislation}} and regulations allowing concealed carry by law-abiding citizens in various jurisdictions created a large market for handguns manufactured specifically for such use. Desirable characteristics for firearms of this type include: small size, thinness, high magazine capacity, <b>lightweight</b> <b>construction</b> (often achieved through the use of polymer frames), stealthy darkened stainless steel slides, high visibility and/or night sights, and large ergonomic ambidextrous manual thumb safeties and magazine releases. Ruger specifically designed the SR9 pistol to address the very active and profitable concealed-carry handgun market segment and it possesses the majority of the aforementioned attributes.|$|E
500|$|The {{station at}} Worle was {{developed}} as a joint initiative between British Rail and Avon County Council. It cost £700,000 and was built using <b>lightweight</b> <b>construction</b> materials due to being sited on marshy ground. The station was opened on 24 September 1990 by Councillor Betty Perry, the chair of Avon Council. The first train was a westbound Regional Railways service, operated by [...] Sprinter DMU 150270. All services were local ones– no scheduled intercity services would call at Worle until 2007.|$|E

500|$|Style and {{structural}} {{elements of the}} Zephyr were incorporated into the EMC [...] "E" [...] series diesel locomotives introduced in 1937, featuring [...] "shovel-nose" [...] front ends beneath their elevated cabs. [...] The E5 units produced for CB paid homage to the original Zephyr trainsets with a stainless steel body, fluted lower bodywork, horizontal black stripes across the front, and faux grillework flanking the upper headlamp.

500|$|The {{ancestor}} of the Metroliner multiple unit railcar was the Budd Pioneer III {{which had been}} developed for the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1958 as a new concept in long distance passenger service in the east. The cars used new propulsion technologies and <b>lightweight</b> <b>construction</b> {{in an effort to}} improve performance compared with older electric multiple unit technology. After a fleet of 55 improved Pioneer III cars referred to as Silverliners were ordered for commuter trains in the Philadelphia area, the United States Department of Transportation placed a follow up order for 4 Silverliners, specially modified for high speed operation on the PRR's Northeast Corridor. Equipped with several modifications, including a semi-streamlined slab end {{on the front of the}} lead car, the experimental train ran a series of test runs, reaching a speed of [...] on April 2, 1967. This success allowed Metroliner testing to begin.|$|E
500|$|The presacral {{vertebrae}} (vertebrae {{before the}} sacrum) were heavily pneumatised {{to the point}} where the column consisted of a series of hollow [...] "shells", each divided by a thin septum in the middle. It had little to no cancellous bone, making the centra thin bone plates filled with air spaces. The vertebral arches were so heavily pierced by extensions of the external air sacs that of their side walls little remained but [...] thick intersecting laminae, the ridges between the pneumatic openings. The vertebrae of the tail, however, did have solid centra. The pelvic and pectoral girdle bones were very thin also, often only several millimetres thick. Like other sauropods, its limbs were robust, contrasting with the extremely <b>lightweight</b> <b>construction</b> of the rest of the skeleton. The limbs were not as specialised as the rest of the skeleton, and the front legs of Nigersaurus were about two-thirds the length of the back legs, as in most diplodocoids.|$|E

40|$|In the {{derivation}} of {{the equation}} for the flanking sound reduction index for EN 12354 - 1, reciprocity {{was used to remove}} the radiation efficiencies of the elements from the calculations. The exclusion of the radiation efficiencies was beneficial since they are often not known. However, the assumption of reciprocity may only be applicable to the heavy monolithic constructions for which EN 12354 - 1 was intended. If EN 12354 - 1 is applied to <b>lightweight</b> <b>constructions</b> which may exhibit direction dependent sound transmission, the assumption of reciprocity may contribute to an over prediction of the apparent sound reduction. A correction factor is proposed to correct for the over prediction due to the assumption of reciprocity. However, due to the inclusion of the radiation efficiencies in the correction factor, its use is limited. Alternatively, the correction factor may be used to estimate the error due to the assumption of reciprocity so that the accuracy of the EN 12354 - 1 predictions can be assessed for <b>lightweight</b> <b>constructions.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|The fleet {{was ordered}} by the British Transport Commission as direct {{comparison}} with British Rail Class 40, and were not actually wanted by the Western Region, who preferred their production fleet of D800 Warships.

[...] They were much heavier than production Warships (almost [...] compared to [...] ) and can be regarded as standard 1950s British design diesel locomotives that just happened to contain two lightweight, high-revving diesel engines coupled to hydraulic transmissions rather than one large, slow-revving diesel engine and electrical generator set. [...] For this reason they were practically obsolete in design terms before they had left the drawing board.|$|E

2500|$|One of Disneyland's {{signature}} attractions is its Disneyland Monorail System monorail service, {{which opened}} in Tomorrowland in 1959 as the first daily-operating monorail train system in the Western Hemisphere. The monorail guideway has remained {{almost exactly the same}} since 1961, aside from small alterations while Indiana Jones Adventure was being built. Five generations of monorail trains have been used in the park, since their <b>lightweight</b> <b>construction</b> means they wear out quickly. The most recent operating generation, the Mark VII, was installed in 2008. The monorail shuttles visitors between two stations, one inside the park in Tomorrowland and one in Downtown Disney. It follows a [...] long route designed to show the park from above. Currently, the Mark VII is running with the colors red, blue and orange. The monorail was originally a loop built with just one station in Tomorrowland. Its track was extended and a second station opened at the Disneyland Hotel in 1961. With the creation of Downtown Disney in 2001, the new destination is Downtown Disney, instead of the Disneyland Hotel. The physical location of the monorail station did not change, but the original station building was demolished as part of the hotel downsizing, and the new station is now separated from the hotel by several Downtown Disney buildings, including ESPN Zone and the Rainforest Café.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work {{is to improve the}} thermal {{performance}} of <b>lightweight</b> <b>constructions</b> making use of Phase Change Materials (PCMs). Typical <b>lightweight</b> <b>constructions</b> have lack of thermal inertia. The use of PCMs can remediate this problem and improve the building thermal performance. However there are few studies specifying the correct PCM to apply in each situation and the optimal quantity to use. In the present case, it was used a natural PCM – Coconut Oil, placed in plastic containers in the floor. For the study it was used the Test Cells built in the University of Minho. There were carried out several experiments with Coconut Oil, reproducing different thermal storage situations, from the total absence of this material (reference lightweight solution) to the application of all the available PCM. It was concluded that the introduction of PCMs improved substantially the Test Cell thermal inertia, but it would be necessary to also implement some modifications in the South façade (reduction of the glazing area and introduction of more thermal mass) in order to improve the overall thermal performance. Before the introduction of these modifications in the Test Cell, the Program VisualDOE was used in order to forecast the performance of the Test Cell and to optimize the final solution.
