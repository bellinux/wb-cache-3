40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation of an R 744 <b>liquid</b> <b>ejector</b> {{applied to a}} supermarket refrigeration system. The use of the <b>liquid</b> <b>ejector</b> enables {{the operation of the}} evaporator in a flooded mode and recirculates the R 744 liquid phase, which improves the energy efficiency of the refrigeration system. The investigation was performed using two ejectors of different sizes installed in a multi-ejector block. The numerical model was formulated based on the homogenous equilibrium model and validated with the experimental results. The influence of the pre-mixer, mixer and diffuser dimensions on the ejector performance measured using the mass entrainment ratio is presented. The results show that the best <b>liquid</b> <b>ejector</b> performance was obtained for the short lengths of the pre-mixer and mixer compared to the broadly investigated two-phase ejectors connected to the evaporator port. In addition, wide diffuser angles improved the mass entrainment ratio of both liquid ejectors, which may lead to a reduction in the diffuser length...|$|E

40|$|The {{prediction}} of removal efficiency of gas in <b>liquid</b> jet <b>ejector</b> {{is an important}} factor as it influences the design of the mass transfer equipment. The major factors which affect the efficiency of jet ejector are flow rates like gas and liquid and the concentration of absorbing liquid and solute in the gas. This paper deals with statistical modeling for removal efficiency of gas in multi nozzle jet ejector for industry scale jet ejector. The developed model is based on statistical techniques to predict removal efficiency for variation in gas and liquid Concentration. The model is simulated using STATGRAPHICS PLUS 4. 0 software for plotting the response surface. The same model is validated by experimental data of industry scale jet ejector...|$|R
40|$|The hydrodynamics of a loop-venturi reactor were {{investigated}} using a downflow <b>liquid</b> jet <b>ejector.</b> Both the gas entrainment {{rate of the}} ejector and the gas hold-up in the main holding vessel were shown {{to be influenced by}} the gas density. The amount of volumetrically entrained gas as well as the gas hold-up increase, whilst the average gas bubble diameter in the main holding vessel decreases with higher gas densities. The influence of the gas density on the gas entrainment rate could be explained from the Kelvin-Helmholtz stability analysis. This analysis showed that the initial amplitudes of the surface instabilities on the liquid jet surface are influenced by the aerodynamic forces, i. e. a higher gas density results in an increase of the jet width at the plunging point. The increased gas flow observed at higher gas densities could be well explained by this theory...|$|R

With the integration of an external siphoning system, the ejector is capable of jetting downward rather than only upward and refilling ink automatically without external force, which makes it suitable for 3 D printing applications. By applying the electric signal at 2. 4 MHz, the ejector can eject water downward with a speed of 0. 29 m/s and droplet dimension of 720 ÔÅ≠m...|$|E
40|$|Bubble size in a gas <b>liquid</b> <b>ejector</b> {{has been}} {{measured}} using the image technique and analysed for estimation of Sauter mean diameter. The individual bubble diameter is estimated {{by considering the}} two dimensional contour of the ellipse, for the actual three dimensional ellipsoid in the system by equating {{the volume of the}} ellipsoid to that of the sphere. It is observed that the bubbles are of oblate and prolate shaped ellipsoid in this air water system. The bubble diameter is calculated based on this concept and the Sauter mean diameter is estimated. The error between these considerations is reported. The bubble size at different locations from the nozzle of the ejector is presented along with their percentage error which is around 18 %...|$|E
40|$|The hydrodynamics {{and mass}} {{transfer}} {{characteristics of a}} loop-venturi reactor have been investigated using a downflow <b>liquid</b> jet <b>ejector.</b> The specific interfacial area of the ejector and the main holding vessel were determined separately. The cobalt catalyzed sulfite oxidation {{was used as a}} model system. The measured values of the interfacial area were in the range of 40, 000 to 70, 000 m 2 /m 3 in the ejector and 500 to 2500 in the total system. From this it can be concluded that the Loop-venturi reactor is particularly suitable for very fast reactions, in which the liquid phase mass transfer is the reaction limiting step of the process. Further it was demonstrated that the f low regime in the ejector has a huge influence on the mass transfer characteristics of the total system. From the results it is concluded that for a proper design of a loop-venturi reactor, the ejector and the main holding vessel should be considered as two reactors in series, which require individual modeling...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{visualization}} of CO 2 -oil mixture flows through channels that simulate CO 2 expansion devices was pursued. The existence of traces of lubricant oil (specifically polyolester (POE)) {{in the working}} medium makes the flow amenable to laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) diagnostics. This technique is used to visualize the flow of CO 2 -oil mixtures through an optically accessible test section under various operating conditions. The results of the measurements provide data on the concentration of the lubricant that is entrained by CO 2 in the expansion device {{as well as information}} about the form with which the oil is transported through the <b>ejector</b> (<b>liquid</b> films, droplets, mist, etc.). Further flow visualization was accomplished using high-speed cinematography, which revealed information about the oil film structure as a function of oil circulation rate and CO 2 flow rate. Further experiments using laserbased shadowgraph were conducted and the need for a square cross-section was established due to refraction in the round tubing. Results from these experiments will guide the design of practical ejector geometries and will also indicate the extent to which various flow models may be employed in the investigation of CO 2 refrigeration systems with ejectors.

40|$|The {{most basic}} design {{feature of the}} droplet core nuclear reactor is to spray liquid uranium into the core {{in the form of}} {{droplets}} on the order of five to ten microns in size, to bring the reactor to critical conditions. The <b>liquid</b> uranium fuel <b>ejector</b> is driven by hydrogen, and more hydrogen is injected {{from the side of the}} reactor to about one and a half meters from the top. High temperature hydrogen is expanded through a nozzle to produce thrust. The hydrogen pressure in the system can be somewhere between 50 and 500 atmospheres; the higher pressure is more desirable. In the lower core region, hydrogen is tangentially injected to serve two purposes: (1) to provide a swirling flow to protect the wall from impingement of hot uranium droplets: (2) to generate a vortex flow that can be used for fuel separation. The reactor is designed to maximize the energy generation in the upper region of the core. The system can result in and Isp of 2000 per second, and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1. 6 for the shielded reactor. The nuclear engine system can reduce the Mars mission duration to less than 200 days. It can reduce the hydrogen consumption by a factor of 2 to 3, which reduces the hydrogen load by about 130 to 150 metric tons...|$|R

"May 2012 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] An analytical model is proposed to extend the single-phase model for predicting ejector performance, particularly pressure recovery and efficiency, to entrained fluids of a liquid/gas mixture. <b>Liquid</b> <b>ejector</b> performance is studied experimentally when the entrained fluid is both a single-phase liquid (water) and a dual-phase liquid/gas mixture (water/air). The experimental program consists of 27 tests utilizing a clear ejector representative of those employed in aerospace applications for measurement of pressure profile and specially designed for visualization of bubble and flow patterns. Motive fluid is supplied from 4. 5 to 18 GPM and available fluid head is supplied from 3 to 9 inches of water above the secondary inlet. The analytical model extends previous models that describe single-phase performance from mass and energy conservation. The empirical loss coefficients are replaced by analytical equations accounting for the geometry of and flow conditions within the individual ejector components. The results show consistently better agreement with the experimental data than those delivered by existing models, reducing the root mean square error of the pressure recovery prediction to less than 10 % of its former value...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{technologies}} used {{to generate}} vacuum for steelmaking are steam <b>ejectors,</b> <b>liquid</b> ring vacuum pumps and systems combined of them. The steam ejector system has a capacity to generate a medium vacuum 101 kPa (1 atm) a 0, 1 Pa (0, 01 mbar), the liquid ring pumps only reach 3 kPa (30 mbar) and dried pump cover the range of 101 kPa (1 atm) at√© 67 Pa (0, 67 mbar), band required for use in secondary metallurgy and is the limit of this technology. In this work was realized {{a case study in}} the industrial sector that uses the vacuum generation through steam ejectors superheated at 250 ¬∞ C and 1, 2 MPa (12 kgf/cm 2). The vacuum is needed for removal of undesirable gases in the composition of the steel as nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur which causes weakness in the crystalline structure. Currently there have been technological innovations for vacuum generation in applications in VD (vacuum degassing), vacuums until to 67 Pa (0, 67 mbar) and VOD (decarburization) for vacuums of 8 - 20 kPa (80 - 200 mbar). One of these innovations is mechanical pumps dried formed by three-stage vacuum, joining various technologies, the first and second rotor roots and the third screw rotor. In this study the objective was to measure the real returns offered by the steam ejector system, along with the performance of the boiler compared to the new dry pump technology in steel making industry, will present the advantages, disadvantages and cost effective to replace the vacuum generating system.

40|$|This thesis extends {{previous}} {{work that has}} been carried out in an air-water system in a gas-liquid ejector. The thesis presents the experimental programme undertaken and contains a survey of the available literature on the effects of liquid physical properties in gas-liquid ejector systems. The survey concentrates on the effects of coalescence inhibition and touches on viscosity effects. Due to the lack of research in such systems, the literature review was extended to look at the work carried out in stagnant fluids and in other systems such as stirred tank reactors and bubble columns. This was used to identify a fluid that would represent a non-coalescing system. The experimental work was split into three parts: the effect a) of flow parameters on gas holdup and bubble size in an air-water system; b) of coalescence inhibition and c) of <b>liquid</b> viscosity on <b>ejector</b> performance. Parameters measured in order to establish the ejector performance in the coalescence inhibited and viscous solutions were gas entrainment, ejector pumping efficiency, bubble size, gas holdup and mass transfer. A non-coalescing fluid was simulated using a 0. 08 M Magnesium Sulphate solution. It is believed, based on results reported by various researchers that this concentration was sufficient to achieve a near non-coalescing fluid. Various experiments were carried out and the above mentioned parameters measured to assess the ejector performance against a pure water system. Experimental results showed that coalescence inhibition has little effect on gas entrainment or gas holdup (and hence slip-velocity). However, the Sauter mean diameter decreases with the non-coalescing nature and the bubbles were seen to be more spherical and appeared more rigid. Values of kLa are similar between coalescing and non-coalescing systems; this is due to an increase in a {{and at the same time}} a corresponding decrease in kL which may be due to a decrease in diffusivity. Newtonian CMC solution provided a viscous system over a range of viscosities (3 - 10 mPas). Comparisons were made with water (1 mPas) for the ejector performance parameters. Experimental results showed that viscosity has a small effect on gas entrainment and ejector pumping efficiency and little effect on gas holdup (and hence slip-velocity). Sauter mean diameter was found to decrease with an increase in liquid viscosity, producing more spherical bubbles. Values of kLa were smaller for an increase in viscosity, despite an increase in a. This is due to a more significant decrease in kL due to the effect of liquid viscosity reducing the diffusivity...|$|R
