The young <b>lady</b> <b>has</b> plucked her hairline to increase the expanse, and thus elegance, of her forehead, and a lock of hair falls at the back in a ponytail. A tight-fitting cap covers her ears, a fashion possibly due to the prevalent belief {{of the time that}} the Virgin Mary conceived through the ear.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Lady</b> <b>has</b> several missing teeth {{due to her}} facial injury. Her left {{alveolar}} {{plate and}} part of her left jaw were fractured, explaining {{what happened to her}} teeth. One tooth is visible within her mouth. The fracture involved most of her left alveolar plate distal to the left first incisor. This incisor is among the missing teeth. The right alveolar plate is in a better condition, though the sockets of the first incisor and the right canine tooth are empty, with these teeth missing. The rest of the teeth are still present, including an nonerupted third molar (wisdom tooth).|$|E
25|$|A {{finding of}} lesser {{importance}} {{is that the}} Younger <b>Lady</b> <b>has</b> a double-pierced ear. Pierced ears were rather common for women of the New Kingdom of Egypt, including royals and nonroyal women. The Lady's pierced ear can not help researchers determine her identity or social position. Similarly inconclusive for identification purposes was {{the discovery of a}} wig in KV35, which could have belonged to the Younger Lady. Supporters of the theory identifying the Lady with Nefertiti, pointed to the wig's perceived similarities with the type of wigs used by Nefertiti. They are fashion items used by Egyptian women of the same era, they can not help us identify the wig's user with the Queen.|$|E
500|$|Funny <b>Lady</b> <b>has</b> {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. A critic from Stereo Review {{was pleased with}} Streisand's Funny Lady, stating that it [...] "will surely bring out the ravening glutton I suspect is lurking in all who are her fondest fans". However, the reviewer did warn that soundtrack did not contain anything for those of a [...] "dispassionate and temperate nature". Also positive was a critic from Film, who called the album [...] "more satisfying than the film". Initially, AllMusic's William Ruhlmann awarded the album 2 out of 5 stars. He was critical of Caan's singing abilities, finding it hard [...] "to endure the singing of James Caan". In his review of the 1998 reissued CD, Ruhlmann listed [...] "Am I Blue" [...] {{as one of the}} best tracks on the album; he called it the [...] "chief virtue of the soundtrack , even if she sometimes camped [...] up". Allison J. Waldman, author of The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook, was disappointed by the soundtrack, claiming that it is more like a [...] "hodgepodge of a soundtrack". She also stated that it was [...] "not nearly as well-produced" [...] as the soundtrack for the predecessor, Funny Girl (1968).|$|E

The film {{became one of}} the biggest box office hits in India, earning , and grossed over [...] abroad, the biggest Bollywood success of all-time in the overseas market up until then. It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years. The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor. She described the role as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image. The Indian Express concurred that this was successful: [...] "The <b>lady</b> <b>has</b> not just looked glamorous but she has walked with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoken with calmness. Who would have thought that the bubbly girl could so skilfully shed her age-old tag and walk away as the don't-mess-with-me lass. So, all those who are in search of the peppy Preity, well, guys you've dialed the wrong number this time." ...|$|E
500|$|Minerva and Telemaco {{return to}} Ithaca in a chariot. Telemaco is greeted joyfully by Eumete and the {{disguised}} Ulisse in the woodland grove: [...] "O great son of Ulysses, you have indeed returned!" [...] After Eumete goes to inform Penelope of Telemaco's arrival {{a bolt of}} fire descends on Ulisse, removing his disguise and revealing his true identity to his son. The two celebrate their reunion before Ulisse sends Telemaco to the palace, promising to follow shortly. In the palace, Melanto complains to Eurimaco that Penelope still refuses to choose a suitor: [...] "In short, Eurymachus, the <b>lady</b> <b>has</b> a heart of stone." [...] Soon afterwards Penelope receives the three suitors (Antinoo, Pisandro, Anfinomo), and rejects each in turn despite their efforts to enliven the court with singing and dancing: [...] "Now to enjoyment, to dance and song!" [...] After the suitors' departure Eumete tells Penelope that Telemaco has arrived in Ithaca, but she is doubtful: [...] "Such uncertain things redouble my grief." [...] Eumete's message is overheard by the suitors, who plot to kill Telemaco. However, they are unnerved when a symbolic eagle flies overhead, so they abandon their plan and renew their efforts to capture Penelope's heart, this time with gold. Back in the woodland grove, Minerva tells Ulisse that she has organised a means whereby {{he will be able}} to challenge and destroy the suitors. Resuming his beggar's disguise, Ulisse arrives at the palace, where he is challenged to a fight by Iro, ("I will pluck out the hairs of your beard one by one!"), a challenge he accepts and wins. Penelope now states that she will accept the suitor who is able to string Ulisse's bow. All three suitors attempt the task unsuccessfully. The disguised Ulisse then asks to try though renouncing the prize of Penelope's hand, and to everyone's amazement he succeeds. He then angrily denounces the suitors and, summoning the names of the gods, kills all three with the bow: [...] "This is how the bow wounds! To death, to havoc, to ruin!" ...|$|E

[...] Kossowski later commented on this project: Looking at these Mysteries now, and remembering the agonies, the frenzies and delights of this spontaneous work, I think my inexperience and technical near-impudence contributed much to the freshness and simplicity of these works which, I hope, redeem some of the shortcomings.|$|E

[...] As of February 2013, Bishop told reporter Patrick Radden Keefe that she was being treated for paranoid schizophrenia with haloperidol. Miller told a reporter for The New York Times that, [...] "This is not a whodunit. This <b>lady</b> <b>has</b> committed this offense or offenses in front of the world. It gets to be a question in my mind of her mental capacity at the time, or her mental state at the time that these acts were committed." ...|$|E
2500|$|An alarmed, but cloistered, Pauline {{began to}} write letters to Thérèse and {{attempted}} various strategies to intervene. Eventually Thérèse recovered after she had turned to gaze at the statue of the Virgin Mary placed in Marie's room, where Thérèse had been moved. She reported on 13 May 1883 {{that she had seen}} the Virgin smile at her. She wrote: [...] "Our Blessed <b>Lady</b> <b>has</b> come to me, she has smiled upon me. How happy I am." [...] However, when Thérèse told the Carmelite nuns about this vision at the request of her eldest sister Marie, she found herself assailed by their questions and she lost confidence. Self-doubt made her begin to question what had happened. [...] "I thought I had lied – I was unable to look upon myself without a feeling of profound horror." [...] "For a long time after my cure, I thought that my sickness was deliberate and this was a real martyrdom for my soul." [...] Her concerns over this continued until November 1887.|$|E
2500|$|As a piece within Shakespeare's sonnet collection, Sonnet 147 {{lies within}} the Dark Lady sonnets {{sequence}} (Sonnets 127-154), following the Fair Youth sequence (Sonnets 1-126). Placed after the Fair Youth sonnets, which [...] "celebrate a young male love object", The Dark Lady sonnets {{are associated with}} a woman of dark physical and moral features. Unlike the Fair Youth sonnets, which refer lovingly and admirably to the beauty and person-hood of a young male, the Dark Lady sonnets frequently include harsh and offensive language, often including sexual innuendos, to describe a woman who is neither admirably beautiful, or of admirable means or aristocratic status. By writing about this dark and simple woman, Shakespeare writes in stark contrast to most poets of his time, who often and predominantly wrote about fair, virginal, young girls who were of high social status. As with the questioned identity of the inspiration for the Fair Youth sonnets, the identity of the original Dark <b>Lady</b> <b>has</b> been disputed and argued for centuries. Unlike the Fair Youth sonnets, however, there is little academic [...] "proof" [...] to back up any proposed female muses, though historical characters ranging from Shakespeare's wife Anne Hathaway, Emilia Lanier, and even Queen Elizabeth herself have been suggested as potential femme fatales.|$|E

2500|$|The missing {{right arm}} of the mummy {{was the cause of}} a minor {{controversy}} between researchers. Two severed arms had been located within KV35, and either one was thought likely to belong to the Younger Lady. One was a bent arm with a clenched fist, while the other was a straight arm. It was typical for female Egyptian mummies to be positioned with one of their arms bent and the other one in a straight position. The hand more likely to be positioned as bent was the left hand. The Egyptian Mummy Project of Ashraf Selim examined both arms to resolve the controversy. The bent arm was compared to the Younger Lady's attached left hand, and was found to be too long to belong to the same woman. The bones of the two compared arms were also found [...] "different in consistency". The straight arm was then compared to the Young Lady's left arm. It was found to be of similar length and similar bone density, so the Project concluded that the straight arm most likely did belong to the Younger Lady. The identified right {{arm of the}} Younger <b>Lady</b> <b>has</b> two breaks, [...] "one in the upper arm and one at the wrist". The hand has been severed {{from the rest of the}} limb.|$|E
2500|$|The author Joseph Pequigney {{discusses}} the historic {{background of the}} rival poet, fair youth, and lady and states, [...] "The rival poet referred to in Sonnet 78 to 86, (a) are wholly fictitious, or (b) are depictions of real but unknown persons, or (c) admit of historical identifications. In the case of (c) speculation centers mostly on the youth who is surmised to be either the earl of Southampton or the earl of Pembroke or, occasionally, some other nobleman. Marlowe and Chapman are the leading candidates {{for the role of}} the literary rival, the <b>lady</b> <b>has</b> generally fared less well in generating a historical counterpart. Regardless of whether the incidents and interpersonal transactions rendered are actual or imaginary, everything comes through as uncertain or indistinct because the Quarto, unauthorized and unsupervised by Shakespeare, (a) prints the Sonnets in a version to be understood as disarranged {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, or (b) the order of the poems in Q must be accepted in lieu of more satisfactory alternative, or (c) the lost original order may be reconstructed by acute transpositions." [...] As with the fair youth there is some debate over the personage of the rival poet. Other experts disagree with Pequigney's assessment and another expert stated, [...] "Among biographically minded commentators, a favourite candidate for Rival Poet has been Christopher Marlowe".|$|E
2500|$|The Younger <b>Lady</b> <b>has</b> {{a gaping}} {{wound in the}} left side of her face. Julian Heath {{suggests}} that the wound was likely the result of an axe blow. Below her left breast there is another gaping wound, likely {{to be the result of}} a stab wound. In 2003, a scientific team from York University, working under Joann Fletcher, examined the mummy. A member of the team realized that the face wound could have been a premortem wound, and not a postmortem wound as previously assumed. Instead of the Younger Lady's remains simply being mutilated after her death by tomb robbers motivated by malice, it seemed likely the Lady had been injured while still alive. The conclusion was considered uncertain. At a later point, Ashraf Selim lend support to this theory. He noted that if the Younger Lady's had been damaged following the embalming process, then bits of dried bone and flesh could be located in the mummy's wounds. Since no such findings occurred, he was certain that this was a premortem wound. Further, Selim viewed the wound as too violent to be the result of an accident. The Lady had been injured in an act of deliberate violence. The Egyptian Mummy Project which used a CT scan to examine the mummy, located [...] "very few pieces of the relevant broken bones" [...] in the sinus cavity. They concluded that the Young Lady's face had been damaged before the embalming process, and likely prior to her death. Indeed, the face wound was determined to be a probable cause of death for the Lady.|$|E
