25|$|Contact with Europeans {{brought a}} series of devastating {{epidemics}} of diseases from Europe the people had no immunity to. The result was a dramatic population collapse, culminating in the 1862 Smallpox outbreak in Victoria that spread throughout the coast. European settlement did {{not bode well for}} the remaining native population of British Columbia. Colonial officials deemed colonists could make better use of the land than the First Nations people, and thus the <b>land</b> <b>territory</b> be owned by the colonists. To ensure colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land, natives were relocated onto reserves, which were often too small to support their way of life. By the 1930s, British Columbia had over 1500 reserves.|$|E

25|$|Africa Vetus ("Old Africa"), the <b>land</b> <b>territory</b> of Phoenician Carthage, roughly {{corresponding}} to modern northeastern Tunisia, fell into Roman hands {{after the final}} defeat and destruction of Carthage {{at the end of}} the Third Punic War (146 BC). The fertility of its soil was proverbial among the Romans, far greater than it is today. It was populous (ca. 1.5 million inhabitants, roughly the same as contemporary Britain) and was, by 50 BC, the most important source of the City of Rome's grain supply. It was said that Africa fed the Roman populace for 8 months in the year, while Egypt provided the remaining 4 months' supply. The province was a land of vast estates (latifundia) owned by absentee landlords. Pliny the Elder states that in the time of Nero (ruled 54–68), half of all arable land in the province was owned by just six Roman senators. Until 45 BC, the rest of northwest Africa was organised as two Berber Roman satellite-states, Numidia (Tripolitania, western Tunisia/eastern Algeria) and Mauretania (central/western Algeria and Morocco).|$|E

Canada's southern border with the United States is the world's longest bi-national land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its <b>land</b> <b>territory</b> being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. It is highly urbanized with 82 per cent of the 35.15million people concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, many near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, and its five largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary and Ottawa.|$|E

2500|$|The current {{relationship}} between core countries and periphery countries was mostly {{defined in the}} era of imperialism that occurred in the late 19th through the early 20th centuries. [...] It was at this time that the countries with the strongest economies and militaries began to exploit those countries with weaker states. [...] A result of this exploitation was the tendency of underdeveloped states or colonies to move more towards the production of one type of export that would then come to [...] dominate their <b>land,</b> <b>territory</b> and lifestyle economy. [...] Some examples of the time include Brazil's coffee production and Cuba's cigar production.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the death}} of Agüeybaná I, the Taíno high chief who struck the initial peace {{agreement}} with Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León in 1508, Agüeybaná II rose to power. Beginning his reign amidst native dissatisfaction with the encomiendas system and the acquisition of <b>land</b> <b>territory</b> that his predecessor allowed, the new leader soon formed a coalition that included several southern caciques, such as Urayoán, Coxiguex, Yauco, Jumacao, Loquillo, Orocobix, Guayama and [...] "Luis" [...] among several others, and declared war on the European settlers. The first act of war {{carried out by the}} Taínos was the execution of Cristóbal de Sotomayor, a high-ranking Spanish officer, and the burning of his settlement. From this point onward, the conflict took place in stages, the first being an open confrontation where both sides clashed. Two such confrontations took place in 1511 with the Spaniards, led by Ponce de León, winning the initial confrontations despite the numeric advantage of the Taínos.|$|E
