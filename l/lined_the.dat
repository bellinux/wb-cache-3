5|$|After the Six-Day War, Jerusalem's {{municipal}} borders were {{expanded to}} include the Old City and beyond. Barricades that had <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> border were torn down. Many buildings on Mamilla's eastern end were in shambles from the fighting and lack of maintenance. Several historic buildings were condemned. One was the Stern House, which housed Zionist leader Theodor Herzl on his 1898 visit. However, popular outcry brought Supreme Court involvement {{which led to the}} temporary dismantling and reassembly nearby of this historical landmark.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Leicester's march up {{the league}} system hit a breakthrough. Their 2–1 win over Sheffield Wednesday, {{combined}} with losses by Queens Park Rangers and Derby County, allowed Leicester City to clinch a promotion to the Premier League after a ten-year absence. Later that month, a win at Bolton saw Leicester become the {{champions of the}} 2013–14 Championship, the seventh time they had been champions of England's second tier. On 5 May 2014, 35,000 fans in Leicester <b>lined</b> <b>the</b> streets for a parade in celebration of the team's success.|$|E

By the time the ride closed, many of the effects were no longer active or had been covered up.

These gave a 3-D appearance when the rider wore special glasses purchased at the beginning of the queue.|$|E
