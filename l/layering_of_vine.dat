2500|$|The low {{mountains}} of the Redwood Zone ecoregion lie entirely within the coastal fog zone. Elevation varies from 50 to 1800 feet (15 to 550 m). Historically, unbroken redwood forests moderated the local climate by trapping the coastal fog and producing shade. Remnants of unlogged redwood forest still survive east of Brookings, Oregon. Today, {{the region is}} characteristically covered by a mixed forest of coast redwood and Douglas-fir, with a shrub <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> maple, rhododendron, sword fern, and oxalis. The region covers [...] in the far southwestern corner of Oregon. Larger sections in northwestern California have not been mapped yet.|$|R
5000|$|The seed is planted at {{the foot}} of a small tree and the vine scrambles up the trunk. When it gets too tall to be easily reached, it is {{detached}} from the trunk and wound round it, the trunk becoming surrounded by multiple <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>vine.</b> The plant starts flowering when three years old, and as the flowers only last for a day, hand-pollinating them needs to be done in a timely manner. The pods develop over a period of about nine months, and when they turn reddish-brown, they are picked by hand. They are then sun-dried by day and placed in sweatboxes by night. The curing and fermentation process lasts for about three months, during which time the pods lose much of their moisture and become supple and oily.|$|R
50|$|The nest of {{this species}} was first {{described}} in 2003 based on two nests found in Manú National Park, Peru.The nests are oven shaped suspended between thin branches. The nests had four layers, an inner <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fine palm fibres, a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> dry leaves, a structural <b>layer</b> composed <b>of</b> flexible <b>vine</b> stems and an outer <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> dry leaves that made the nest difficult to see. One of the nests contained a single egg, the other two eggs. The eggs were white with a light dusting of purple spots. Both parents participate in incubation and feeding the chicks. When the nest is threatened by predators the parents will give a broken-wing display in order to distract {{attention away from the}} nest.|$|R
5000|$|Act I (The Spell)It {{is the day}} of Princess Aurora's sixteenth birthday. Celebrations are underway, {{though the}} King is still {{unsettled}} by Carabosse's omen. Catallabutte discovers several peasant ladies knitting nearby (a forbidden activity, as it involves spindles potentially harmful to the princess) and alerts the King, who initially sentences the women to a harsh punishment. The Queen gently persuades him to spare the innocent citizens, and he agrees. The townsfolk perform an elaborate waltz with flower garlands, and Princess Aurora arrives afterwards. She is introduced to four suitors by her doting parents. Aurora and the suitors perform the famous Rose Adagio, {{one of the most}} notoriously difficult sequences in all of ballet. Presently, a cloaked stranger appears and offers a gift to the princess: a spindle. Having never seen one before, Aurora curiously examines the strange object as her parents desperately try to intervene. As predicted, she pricks her finger on the spindle (in some versions, the [...] "gift" [...] is a nonthreatening bouquet of flowers with the spindle hidden within). While initially appearing to recover quickly, she falls into a swoon and collapses. The cloaked stranger reveals herself to be Carabosse, who believes that her curse still stands and that the princess is dead. Once again, the Lilac Fairy quells the hubbub and reminds the King and Queen that Aurora is merely asleep. The princess is carried off to bed, and the Lilac Fairy casts a spell of slumber over the entire kingdom, which will only be broken when Aurora awakens. She then uses her magic to cover the castle in <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> and brambles.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to compare the course of agro-ecological {{indicators}} according to the internationally acknowledged parameters – the balance <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> bunches, the berry balance, the weight <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> bunches, the berry weight in 7 varieties <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> in three resistant white varieties Merzling, Malverina and Hibernal and in one blue variety – Medina, then in classical varieties Aurelius, Chardonnay and Muscat Moravian in two locations Perna (sub-region Mikulovice) and Sadek (sub-region Znojmo). The evaluation of the grape quality {{was carried out in}} accordance with common standards used in the Czech Republic. The following parameters were monitored The agro-ecological indicators were compared according to the internationally acknowledged parameters in the work – the balance <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> bunches, the berry balance, the weight <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> bunches, the berry weight for 7 varieties <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> in three resistant white varieties Merzling, Malverina and Hibernal and one blue – Medina, then in classical varieties Aurelius, Chardonnay and Muscat Moravian in two locations Perna (sub-region Mikulovice) and Sadek (sub-region Znojmo).
