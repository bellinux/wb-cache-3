This conceptual analysis then explores the intellectual antecedents which inform Big Society ideology, arguing that the eclectic nature of Conservative Party thinking draws on liberal, conservative, radical and socialist models of community, civil society and the role of the state in relation to these. Theoretical models such as <b>Lévi</b> <b>Strauss’s</b> (1962) model of bricolage, Hall’s (1998) agency of political ideas and Vidovich’s (2007) ‘hybridised model’ help uncover the contradictions and limitations in Big Society policy-making and implementation. The thesis argues that there is a distinct silence in relation to the role of capitalism, either in the historical narratives or its place in the new political order that makes up the Big Society. Absent also, is any clear notion of the role and contribution of education in this context. Analysis of Secretary of State Michael Gove’s education policy 2010 - 2014, demonstrates that an education system constructed on notions of freedom, responsibility and fairness may have radically changed the education landscape in England but has ultimately failed to stem the tide of neo-liberal hegemony, the effects of which the Big Society attempted to ameliorate...|$|R

40|$|Keywords: deconstruction, {{creative}} concept, television advertising, semiotic analysis The {{more widespread}} television advertising, creative advertising push {{to create a}} creative advertising concept that is more unique, hit targets {{and be able to}} increase sales, attract a variety of display ads that are served as part to persuade the public. One of them is body care ads incessantly exploits women as models, particularly for shampoo ads that always brought the concept of a beautiful woman with long hair and shiny as a model. But on the other hand not all the shampoo ad package their products by utilizing the woman with her beautiful hair category, one of which version of Sunsilk shampoo ad spending in the Supermarket. These ads featuring everyday a veiled Muslim women with all their activities. Attraction researchers raised this ad as an object of study because these ads do not show the beauty of the hair shampoo ad but generally focus more on the benefits of the shampoo itself. With the concept of Clean Fresh Riding Hood contained such profound meaning more than mere physical beauty. The formulation of the problem in this research is how the signs in a Sunsilk shampoo ad spending in the supermarket version that is used to construct and deconstruct the creative concepts. to reveal the meaning of the sign contained in the television ad text, the researcher uses semiotic studies referring to the model of Roland Barthes, Charles Sanders Peirce, and <b>Levi's</b> <b>Strauss,</b> and Jacques Derrida. Through Barthes meaning of a sign made with two levels of denotation and connotation, Barthes also look at other aspects of tagging is a growing perluasaan of connotations, so it appears the meaning of creative concepts that ad. While through Peirce's model of data grouped according to the type of sign whether including into icons, indices, or symbols, which is representamen which will lead to the interpretation of the ad. Meanwhile, with <b>Levi's</b> <b>Strauss's</b> paradigmatic analysis will be conducted comparing the patterns of pairs of hidden opposition and generate new meanings that can be compared to that in the end will be known deconstruction of the creative concepts in advertising expenditures in the Supermarket Sunsilk version which according to Derrida's deconstruction.

Using a semiotic analysis that focuses on the sign and the text as a study. While the unit of analysis is the technique of shooting (shot), angle, facial expression, language act and dress style which appears in this Sunsilk Shampoo ad. Pengumpulalan data is done by seeing and reading and doing recording footage of the shooting technique (shot), angle, facial expression, language act and dress style. The data then analyzed textually. For simplicity made the research table with a view to find hidden codes, in the language of images that later will be known depiction of the meaning of Sunsilk Shampoo advertising in accordance with the formulation of the problem that exists to achieve the purposes of research. From the results of this study concluded that in a Sunsilk ad Supermarket shopping in this version, creative concepts commonly used ad creators have striking ideas by using the slice model, in which the beautiful-haired model is no longer a barometer in this ad and positive personality traits than Physical appearance becomes the main priority even though in essence this ad still sell the widest in the community. To further recommended that researchers better understand and explore references associated with the methodology of research and study so that the use of semiotic theory is used more significantly with the ad you want researched. From the research that has been done, it is expected to become inputs for the ad creators to produce an ad that is more creative, with new concepts are different for conventional unimpressed that tend to be conservative. And for the people expected to be more sensitive and able to broaden the perspective in appreciating the concepts of advertising messages that appear on television screens, as well as in advertisements under study that this ad does not contain a social mission, such as raising the degree of veiled women, but merely for the sake of expanding market share and capital development...|$|R

This matter because of most Indonesia society represent follower of culture of patriarki, that is tending to to major men more than woman. So that role of existing gender in society progressively setle happened. Even, consciously or not mass media - specially media print, also have a share in effort overspread imbalance of gender in society. Though gender alone represent result of social construction able to be commuted for one otherly. selected of magazine of Ayahbunda as research object, hence this research represent effort to look for researcher answer about how balance representation of gender in magazine of Ayahbunda, tend to bias gender or not. Research method which] used in this research by alliing two approach in text semiotic, there are social semiotic Halliday and connotation semiotic Rolland Barthes. And afterwards, continued by using <b>Levi's</b> <b>Strauss</b> structuralis semiotic. Pursuant to model analyse social semiotic Halliday, to know meaning from a text, hence {{we have to know}} elements of it self Ianguage, that is: text, situation, or register (Ianguage style), code, linguistics system, and social structure. Later;Then know component as semantic as, there are three: Idea function, Component of Interpersonal, and Component of tekstual. While text interpretation process (sign) refer to model of two phase signification of Rolland Barthes, that is to check connotation-connotation which there are in text, and find ideology in text. Afterwards researcher to do a comparison of contrary opposition couple patterns, which hidden and yield meaning, that is using concept of paradigmatic Levi's Strausss, using the tables of binary opposition. With result of all analysis, hence can know depiction (balance representation) of gender in magazine of Ayahbunda, do magazine of ayahbunda tend to bias gender or not. From result of data analysis, hence can be concluded is, first, magazine of Ayahbunda in election of Ianguage and appearance of appetite represent effort of Ayahbunda to give well-balanced gender representation, but implicitly Ayahbunda still instruct woman up at limited role. Both, magazine of Ayahbunda in representation to balance of gender have tendency bias gender. That thing is because of Ayahbunda embrace ideology of capitalis-patriarki. Which role of woman in family still stereotype just domestic region, though by eksplisit mentioned that woman also can work outdoorsly. But mentioned implicitly have a meaning that woman as housewife, also can plunge public region as does husband, but obligation of mother in taking care of house, mothering child, and also serve husband nor may be left. So that role of woman in family tend to more and longer than role of men. Pursuant to this research, can know that a mass media masterpiece don't only seen from external appearance (categorized bias gender or not), but also have to be seen from its items substansi (mount psychological effect and education to reader). Thereby, needed studys concerning gender inequalities in mass media, passing various study to usage of Ianguage in text of gender in media, with a purpose to open awareness and improve knowledge for public about ideological strategy media in influencing view, action, and reader enthusiasm. Therefore, suggested to researcher hereinafter to be more try to test method capacities analyse semiotic at other rubric or other medias which of a kind, because study of semiotic more is giving to possibility of unloading messages which hidden in mass media.

40|$|In {{this study}} we discuss the structuralist {{approach}} popularity of which grew in a diverse range of fields, including linguistics,sociology, psychology and ethnography in social sciences starting from the 1950 s {{and one of the}} most fundamental members ofsructuralist movement, Levi-Strauss and the reasons his thought is based on this concept. In this context the term of structuralistapproach, the origin of structuralism, the difficulty of its definition as a movement, the concept of structure whose origins can betraced back to ancient Greek and the structuralist mode of reasoning which became the focus of philosophical and scientificstudies in 20 th century, its founder members, concepts and definitions, the language it uses within itself, are introduced regardingthe scientific and philosophical condition of the era. Claude Levi-Strauss in the 1950 s, analyzed cultural phenomena including mythology, kinship (the Alliance theory and theincest taboo), and food preparation. In addition to these studies, he produced more linguistically-focused writings where heapplied Saussure's distinction between langue and parole in his search for the fundamental mental structures of the human mind,arguing that the structures that form the "deep grammar" of society originate in the mind and operate in us unconsciously. Levi-Strauss was inspired by information theory and mathematics. In the very beginning of anthropology, the theorists believed Levi-Strauss analyzes cultural phenomena such as languages,myths and kinship systems to discover what ordered patterns, or structures, they seemed to display. These, he suggested, couldreveal the structure of the human mind. He reasoned that behind the surface of individual cultures there must exist naturalproperties (universals) common to us all. Levi-Strauss focused his attention on the patterns or structures existing beneath thecustoms and beliefs of all cultures. Although structuralism searches universal laws of human mind but the inquiry and its analysisis fundamentally distinctive from the evolutionary point of view. He believed in mental structure on the basis of universal mentalthought process, emphasizing on the perception, 'mental thought process is universal and innate'. Levi-Strauss an interpretation provided new impetus to the understanding of human mind as well as the cultural world thatdiffused beyond the frontier of contemporary anthropology. Levi-Strauss derived structuralism from a school of linguistics whosefocus was not on the meaning of the word, but the patterns that the words form. Levi-Strauss's contribution gave us a theory ofhow the human mind works. Man passes from a natural to a cultural state as he uses language, learns to cook, etc [...] . Structuralismconsiders that in the passage from natural to cultural, man obeys laws he does not invent it's a mechanism of the human brain. Levi-Strauss views man not as a privileged inhabitant of the universe, but as a passing species which will leave only a few fainttraces of its passage when it becomes extinct. Levi-Strauss's contribution to structuralist thought is that he provides a scientificaccount which shows the world as a world of meanings; he believes that structuralism can be used to reveal the unity of allcultures. Levi-Strauss is interested in the structural pattern which gives the myth its meaning. Through his examination of mythsfrom all over the world, he has identified that myths are organised in binary oppositions (for example, good/evil) just like thebasic linguistic units. Myths can be broken down into individual units (“mythemes”) which, like the basic sound units of language(“phonemes”) acquire meaning only when combined together in particular ways. Levi-Strauss is then interested in the structuralpattern which gives the myth its meaning. He believes this linguistic model will uncover the basic structure of the human mind,that is, the structure which governs the way human beings shape all their institutions, artefacts and their forms of knowledge. Therules which governed these combinations could be seen as a kind of grammar, a set of relations beneath the surface of thenarrative which constituted the myth's true “meaning”. Further, modern structuralist analysis of narrative (known as narratology) began with Levi-Strauss's pioneering work on myth. Levi-Strauss and his type of structuralism are no longer fashionable as atheoretical approach or method, and has since been taken over by post-structuralists such as Derrida. However, it is important toremember that Levi-Strauss and his structuralism provided an important contribution for debating the nature of “meaning”. As a conclusion we can say that Levi-Strauss’s aim is to find unconscious quality of collective events and unchangeablestructures related to the human mind. In spite of his important place in contemporary thinking, preoccupying many sociologistsand also richness of his thoughts and results that he came through he could not make a certain and consistent comment on hismethod. Also the plentifulness of unclear and inconsistent points, is an another criticism about his writings. Thus his method’s conclusion about structuralism, particularly about <b>Levi</b> <b>Strauss’s</b> structuralism we can say that although it is criticized as being aspiritual “fashion” or as a new “cult” etc. with its’ rejection of conceptualization of humanist, historic and empiric knowledge ofmethod in social sciences and its’ claim about basic aim of human sciences which is not to form a person but just the opposite, itcan be called as original and alternative approach...|$|R
