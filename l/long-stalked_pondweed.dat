50|$|Potamogeton praelongus, {{commonly}} known as whitestem pondweed in North America and <b>Long-stalked</b> <b>Pondweed</b> in Britain, is a large, perennial aquatic plant in the family Potamogetonaceae. It is widely distributed in lakes and rivers in the northern hemisphere, but is sensitive to poor water quality.|$|E

50|$|<b>Long-stalked</b> <b>pondweed</b> is {{relatively}} easy to identify. It could be confused with narrow-leaved forms of Potamogeton perfoliatus, but the persistent stipules, leaves only partially clasping the stem, larger fruits and (usually) zigzag pattern of the stem are distinctive. Hybrids may be more difficult to identify but usually show various features of the other parent.|$|E
50|$|Potamogeton × griffithii is {{a sterile}} hybrid {{pondweed}} between red pondweed Potamogeton alpinus and <b>long-stalked</b> <b>pondweed</b> Potamogeton praelongus. It occurs in clear, oligotrophic, low to moderate alkalinity lakes. It {{was discovered in}} 1882 in Llyn Anafon, North Wales by J.E. Griffith, a Victorian botanist, and was named after him by the noted pondweed expert Arthur Bennett.|$|E
50|$|<b>Long-stalked</b> <b>pondweed</b> has tall stems to 3 m {{growing from}} stout, rusty-spotted {{perennial}} rhizomes. The stems often change direction between each node, giving a characteristic zig-zagging pattern. The transparent pale to deep green leaves are typically between 60 and 150 mm long but occasionally reach 250 mm and are 14-40 mm wide. The stipules are persistent, open, whitish and translucent, with prominent veins when dry. Floating leaves and turions are absent. The inflorescences are produced quite early for a pondweed, in May-June, and have 15-20 inconspicuous greenish flowers {{and held on}} robust peduncles 80-200 mm long. The fruits are large for a pondweed, 4.5-5.5 x 2.5-3.6 mm.|$|E
