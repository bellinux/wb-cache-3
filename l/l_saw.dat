40|$|Accepted 10 th May 2017 We {{report on}} the first-of-a-kind {{experimental}} demonstration of the calcination of alumina with concentrated solar thermal (CST) radiation at radiative fluxes up to 2190 suns using a 5 kW novel solar transport reactor. Aluminium hydroxide was calcined at nominal reactor temperatures over the range 1160 – 1550 K to yield chemical conversions of up to 95. 8 % for nominal residence times of approximately 3 s. Solar energy conversion efficiencies of up to 20. 4 % were achieved. The mean pore diameter and specific surface area of the solar-generated alumina with the greatest chemical conversion were 5. 8 nm and 132. 7 m² g⁻¹, respectively, which are higher values than are typical for industrial alumina production. In addition, the product {{is dominated by the}} γ-phase, which is desirable for the downstream processing to aluminium. This suggests that CST can improve the quality of alumina over existing fossil fuel based processes though a combination of a high heating rate and avoided contamination by combustion products. Furthermore, the solar-driven process has the potential to avoid the discharge of combustion-derived CO₂ emissions for the calcination stage of the conventional Bayer process, which is typically 165 kg-CO₂ per tonne-alumina.

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of mean gas residence time in the bubbling fluidised bed, τ f, {{on the performance of}} a pilot scale 100 kW dual fluidised bed gasifier was experimentally investigated. In the experiments, inert greywacke river sand was used as the bed material, and wood pellets of radiata pine sawdust were used as the feedstock. The gasification temperature and the steam to biomass ratio were set at 730 – 750 °C and 0. 8 kg/kgdry, respectively. The τ f was varied using three different bed material inventories in the gasification reactor of 5. 8, 9. 1 and 12. 1 kg with the corresponding τ f being calculated to be 0. 16, 0. 19 and 0. 21 s, respectively. The results of this study show that the overall performance of the dual fluidised bed steam gasifier increased with τ f. The key findings are: (1) the total tar concentration in the producer gas was reduced by 24 % (except C 3 tar) with the τ f increasing from 0. 16 to 0. 21 s, thus the tar dew point decreased by 16 °C, from 188 °C to 172 °C; (2) the carbon conversion rate and the cold gas efficiency increased by 8 % and 3 %, respectively, as the τ f was increased in the above range and (3) the water–gas shift reaction appeared to play a more important role with the increase of τ f.

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{reactivity of}} the chars from both raw and torrefied wood, grape marc, and macroalgae {{has been investigated}} in this paper. The variations in char gasification reactivity were explained using further investigation of the physicochemical characteristics of the char that can influence the gasification reactivity, i. e., specific surface area, uniformity of the carbonaceous structure, and concentration of alkali metals (Na and K). It {{was found that the}} influence of the torrefaction process on the char gasification reactivity strongly depends upon the solid fuel properties and pyrolysis conditions. For a pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C, the gasification reactivity of the chars from both the torrefied grape marc and the torrefied macroalgae was lower than that of the chars from their corresponding raw fuels. This is mainly due to a lower specific surface area and a lower content of alkali metals (Na and/or K) in the chars produced from both the torrefied grape marc and the torrefied macroalgae than for those chars produced from their corresponding raw fuels. However, the opposite influence of torrefaction was found for the macroalgae char when the pyrolysis temperature was increased to 1000 °C. This is attributed mostly to the higher Na content and the more amorphous carbonaceous structure for the torrefied macroalgae char than for the raw macroalgae char.

40|$|A new {{configuration}} of solar hybridized dual fluidized bed (DFB) gasification process is proposed with char separation {{for the production}} of Fischer–Tropsch (FT) liquid fuels from solid fuels of biomass and/or coal. The addition of carbon capture with sequestration and FT reactor tail-gas recycle configurations is also assessed. The studied FT liquid fuels production systems are simulated by using a pseudodynamic model incorporating a year long, hourly averaged solar insolation time-series. For the case with a solar multiple (i. e., the heliostat field area relative to that required to meet the demand of the DFB gasifier at the point of peak solar thermal output) of 2. 64 and bed material storage capacity of 16 h, the calculated annual solar share of the solar hybridized coal-to-liquids system can be increased from 12. 2 to 20. 3 % by the addition of the char separation for a char gasification conversion of 80 %. To achieve the well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions for FT liquid fuels parity with diesel derived from mineral crude oil, a calculated biomass fraction of 58 % is required for the nonsolar coal case, also with a char gasification conversion of 80 %. This fraction can be reduced to 30 % by carbon capture and sequestration and further reduced to 17 % by the integration of solar energy, based on a solar multiple of 2. 64 and bed material storage capacity of 16 h. This reduction is significant given that biomass is much more expensive than coal. However, because of the higher content of light hydrocarbons content in the syngas produced with the studied biomass gasification, the specific FT liquids output per unit feedstock of the system decreases with an increase in the biomass fraction. As the biomass fraction is increased from 0 to 100 %, this specific output is decreased from 59. 6 to 48. 3 % but can be increased to 71. 5 and 70. 9 %, respectively, by incorporating tail-gas recycle.

40|$|A novel solar hybridized dual {{fluidized}} bed (DFB) gasification process for Fischer–Tropsch liquid (FTL) fuels production is proposed and investigated {{here for the}} case with lignite as the fuel, although it is also applicable to biomass. The concept offers sensible thermal storage of bed material, the use of inert particles in the solar receiver to avoid the need for sealing, and a process that delivers a constant production rate and quality of syngas despite solar variability. This solar hybridized coal-to-liquids (SCTL) process is simulated using a pseudodynamic model that assumes steady state operation at each time step for a one-year, hourly integrated solar insolation time series. The annual energetic and environmental performance of this SCTL process is investigated {{as a function of}} the solar multiple (i. e., the heliostat field area relative to that required to meet the demand of the DFB gasifier at the point of peak solar thermal output), bed material storage capacity, the assumed char conversion in the bubbling {{fluidized bed}} gasifier (BFBG), and the solar resource. This revealed that solar energy can be stored in the bed material to increase both the solar share and output while decreasing the CO 2 emissions, with a commensurate increase in the heliostat field area. For a solar multiple of 3 and bed material storage capacity of 16 h, the annual solar share is 21. 8 % and the annually averaged utilization factor of the heliostat field is 40. 8 %, assuming that the char conversion in the BFBG is 100 %. However, the solar share is also found to be strongly dependent on the char conversion in the BFBG, so that the solar share decreases to zero as the conversion is decreased to 57 %. The sensitivity of the SCTL performance to the quality of the solar resource is also reported. Peijun Guo, Philip J. van Eyk, Woei <b>L.</b> <b>Saw,</b> Peter J. Ashman, Graham J.

40|$|Synaesthesia is a {{fascinating}} condition whereby individuals report extraordinary experiences when presented with ordinary stimuli. In this thesis, we examine an individual (L) who experiences time units (i. e., months and hours) and numbers as occupying specific spatial locations (e. g., January is 30 º to the left). This type of spatial-form synaesthesia has been recently investigated by Smilek et al. (2007), demonstrating that synaesthetic time-space associations are highly consistent, occur regardless of intention, and can direct spatial attention. We extended this work in Chapter 2 by showing that for L, her time-space vantage point changed {{depending on whether the}} time units were seen or heard. For example, when <b>L</b> <b>saw</b> the word JANUARY, she reported experiencing January on her left side, however when she heard the word "January" she experienced the month on her right side. In this thesis, we validated L’s subjective reports using a spatial cueing task. The names of months were centrally presented followed by targets on the left or right. L was faster at detecting targets in validly cued locations relative to invalidly cued locations both for visually presented cues (January orients attention to the left) and for aurally presented cues (January orients attention to the right). We replicated these vantage-point dependent cueing effects also using hours of day. In Chapter 3, we further explored whether synaesthetic number forms could bias spatial attention using a spatial cueing and SNARC-type task. Two synaesthetes (L and B) both described experiencing the numbers 1 through 10 running vertically from bottom to top. Both experiments confirmed their synaesthetic number forms, such that when making odd-even judgments for the numbers 1, 2, 8, and 9, they showed SNARC-compatibility effects for up-down movements (aligned with their number form), but not left-right (misaligned) movements. Likewise in the spatial cueing task, both synaesthetes showed significantly faster response times to detect targets {{on the bottom of the}} display if preceded by a low number (1, 2) and the top of the display if preceded by a high number (8, 9), whereas they showed no cueing effects when targets appeared on the left or right (misaligned with their number forms). Both synaesthetes were, however, reliably faster to detect left targets following the presentation of numbers 10, and 11, and right targets following numbers 19 and 20 (running from left to right). Hence, we demonstrated that cueing and SNARC tasks could be used to empirically verify synaesthetic number forms. Moreover, we showed that numbers could direct spatial attention to idiosyncratic locations similar to time-units, replicating and extending our findings from Chapter 2. Lastly, Chapter 4 was aimed to explore the automaticity and involuntary nature of L’s number-forms. We continued to use the spatial cueing task and sought to eliminate any influence of strategy on L’s performance by: (1) shortening the interval between the cue and target onset to only 150 ms and (2) having the targets only fall in synaesthetically cued locations on 14. 2 % of trials. As a result, these manipulations should eliminate any cuing effects if L’s performance was attributable to intentionally using the cue to predict target location. However, our findings still showed an attentional bias consistent with L’s synaesthesia. We attributed L’s resilient cueing effects to the automaticity of her number-forms, thus demonstrating one of the hallmark attributes of synaesthesia. Overall, this series of studies convincingly demonstrated the reality of time-space and number-form synaesthesia and Chapter 5 concludes by discussing how this work has significantly contributed to the synaesthesia literature and to the study of perception overall...|$|E
