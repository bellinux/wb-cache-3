50|$|Decomposition, simplification, or slowing of multijoint {{movement}} {{may also}} be an effective strategy that therapists may use to improve function in patients with ataxia. Training likely needs to be intense and focused—as indicated by one study performed with stroke patients experiencing <b>limb</b> <b>ataxia</b> who underwent intensive upper limb retraining. Their therapy consisted of constraint-induced movement therapy which resulted in improvements of their arm function. Treatment should likely include strategies to manage difficulties with everyday activities such as walking. Gait aids (such as a cane or walker) can be provided to decrease the risk of falls associated with impairment of balance or poor coordination. Severe ataxia may eventually lead {{to the need for}} a wheelchair. To obtain better results, possible coexisting motor deficits need to be addressed in addition to those induced by ataxia. For example, muscle weakness and decreased endurance could lead to increasing fatigue and poorer movement patterns.|$|E

40|$|Background: Joubert Syndrome (JS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterised clinically by neonatal breathing dysregulation, developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, ataxia, nystagmus. Case Report: We present another case of this uncommon syndrome in a 12 years old patient presenting with classical complaints of developmental delay, intellectual impairment, weakness in both lower <b>limbs,</b> <b>ataxia</b> and abnormal facies and diagnosed on Computed Tomography. Conclusions: Joubert Syndrome should be ruled out in all patients presenting with hypotonia, ataxia, nystagmus, breathing abnormalities and developmental delay. Its neuroimaging hallmarks include molar tooth sign and batwing shaped fourth ventricle. As JS is associated with multiorgan involvement, these patients should enter a diagnostic protocol to assess systemic abnormalities.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Upper <b>limb</b> <b>ataxia</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common motor {{disorders}} associated with cerebellar damage and it might lead to motor impairment and disability. OBJECTIVE: In this study, a subject with disabling upper <b>limb</b> <b>ataxia</b> and intention tremor underwent a six weeks intervention of robot-assisted training combined with Botulinum Toxin Type A (BTX-A). METHODS: Robot-assisted therapy which includes repetitive, goal-directed reaching movements was administered after upper-limb BTX-A injections. Improvements in arm coordination and motor performance were assessed throughout a kinematic analysis and an activity daily living-based questionnaire. RESULTS: After this six weeks training program all spatio-temporal parameters were improved with no additional functional gains. CONCLUSIONS: The positive effects on motor coordination in our subject might help to design clinical trials that combine BTX-A injections and robot-assisted therapy in order to improve upper-limb coordination in subjects with ataxia. Furthermore, if exercises focused on ADLs will be included, they might help to regain a functional use of the arm...|$|E

40|$|The {{autosomal}} dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of degenerative diseases presenting with ataxic gait, <b>limbs</b> <b>ataxia,</b> dysarthria and cerebellar oculomotor disturbances. Usually, cerebellar signs {{are associated with}} pyramidal signs, extra-pyramidal signs, spinal signs and signs of peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathological studies have disclosed an involvement of the cerebellum and its afferent/efferent pathways, of the brainstem and of the spinal cord. Distinct entities are now recognized :SCA 1, SCA 2, SCA 3 /Machado-Joseph disease, SCA 4, SCA 5, SCA 6, SCA 7 and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). In most cases, a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion has been demonstrated by genetic investigations. Moreover, {{recent studies have shown}} that {{autosomal dominant}} spinocerebellar ataxias are characterized by intra-nuclear inclusions containing polyglutamine in affected cells. These complexes might play a determinant role in the neurodegenerative process. Cell death could be due to accumulation of a polyglutamine as a result of trinucleotide repeats.

40|$|Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive spinocerebellar ataxia which {{in the majority of}} cases is associated with a GAA-trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of Frataxin gene located on chromosome 9. The clinical features include progressive gait and <b>limb</b> <b>ataxia,</b> cerebellar dysarthria, neuropathy, optic atrophy, and loss of vibration and proprioception. Ataxia with ocular motor apraxia type 1 (AOA 1) is another {{autosomal recessive}} cerebellar ataxia which is associated with oculomotor apraxia, hypoalbuminaemia, and hypercholesterolemia.

500|$|An {{inherited}} genetic {{problem that}} exists in the breed is globoid cell leukodystrophy. It is not breed-specific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including Beagles and Pomeranians. It is a neurological disease where the dog lacks an enzyme called galactosylceramidase. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid breeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed. Another genetic condition that affects the breed is [...] "white dog shaker syndrome". As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and Maltese, the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same condition has since been found in other nonwhite breeds including the Yorkshire Terrier and the Dachshund. The condition typically develops over one to three days, resulting in tremors of the head and <b>limbs,</b> <b>ataxia,</b> and hypermetria. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of their lives.|$|R

Because infarcts in the {{territory of}} the 1 PICA have rarely been studied specifically, 10 patients with this type of infarct are reported. An 1 PICA infarct was isolated in only three patients, whereas it was associated with brainstem infarct in four, with occipital infarct in one, and with multiple infarcts in two patients. The most common symptom at onset was acute unsteadiness and gait ataxia without rotatory vertigo (six patients). Unilateral cerebellar dysfunction was found in all patients, with <b>limb</b> <b>ataxia</b> (nine patients), dysdiadochokinesia (five patients), and ipsilateral body sway (four patients), but dysarthria and primary position nystagmus were notably absent.

40|$|The {{cerebellum}} is a key-piece {{for information}} processing and {{is involved in}} numerous motor and nonmotor activities, thanks to the anatomical characteristics of the circuitry, the enormous computational capabilities and the high connectivity to other brain areas. Despite its uniform cytoarchitecture, cerebellar circuitry is segregated into functional zones. This functional parcellation {{is driven by the}} connectivity and the anatomo-functional heterogeneity of the numerous extra-cerebellar structures linked to the cerebellum, principally brain cortices, precerebellar nuclei and spinal cord. Major insights into cerebellar functions have been gained with a detailed analysis of the cerebellar outputs, with the evidence that fundamental aspects of cerebrocerebellar operations are the closed-loop circuit and the predictions of future states. Cerebellar diseases result in disturbances of accuracy of movements and lack of coordination. The cerebellar syndrome includes combinations of oculomotor disturbances, dysarthria and other speech deficits, <b>ataxia</b> of <b>limbs,</b> <b>ataxia</b> of stance and gait, as well as often more subtle cognitive/behavioral impairments. Our understanding of the corresponding anatomo-functional maps for the human cerebellum is continuously improving. We summarize the topography of the clinical deficits observed in cerebellar patients and the growing evidence of a regional subdivision into motor, sensory, sensorimotor, cognitive and affective domains. The recently described topographic dichotomy motor versus nonmotor cerebellum based upon anatomical, functional and neuropsychological studies is also discussed. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.
