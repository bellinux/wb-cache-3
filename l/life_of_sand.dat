40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the problem of}} quality of casting moulds made <b>of</b> self-hardening <b>sand,</b> especially for manufacturing moulds for large-sized iron alloy castings.

40|$|Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) inhabit subtidal {{sediment}} wave {{fields in}} the San Juan Islands of Washington state. Although they are an important forage fish, serving as a trophic link between zooplankton and larger organisms, very little is known <b>of</b> the <b>life</b> history <b>of</b> subtidal <b>sand</b> lance in the sediment wave fields. Here, I hypothesize that spatial and temporal patterns <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> lance abundance are influenced {{by a variety of}} physical factors, including sediment grain size and tidal currents. Using a Van Veen grab sampler to collect sand lance in the sediment fields, and an ADP to measure current velocities over two, 3 hour sampling periods aboard the R/V Centennial, I found anomalously high numbers <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> lance in the sediment during slack before flood tides when northward velocities measured between +/- 15 cm s- 1. In contrast, negative anomalies that occurred during weak ebb tides of - 20 to - 40 cm s- 1. This suggests fine scale temporal variation in sand lance presence in the sediment fields may be tied to tidal cycles, and that sand lance may enter and leave the fields during the fall and early winter. The sediment fields near Sucia Island composed of large (1 mm) shell hash, contained only mature fish, while the finer grained (1 / 2 mm) sediments of the San Jean Channel wave field had larger proportions of juveniles less than 90 mm in length, suggesting a relationship between sediment grain size and life stage. Other factors including depth and tidal mixing may also {{play a role in the}} spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> lance. ...|$|R

Bio-indicators {{that can be used}} in conjunction with rodent-targeted sand fly control methods also have been developed to demonstrate that the insecticide treatments are reaching the targeted <b>life</b> stages <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> flies and to quantify the effect of the insecticide treatments on sand fly populations. This article presents new results from a field study on the use of rodent bait containing a systemic insecticide in Kenya. The objective of this field study was to incorporate the fluorescent dye rhodamine B into rodent baits to determine the level of blood feeding by the sand fly Phlebotomus duboscqi on targeted rodents, and to demonstrate the effect of rodent bait containing the systemic insecticide ivermectin on bloodfeeding adult females of P. duboscqi. Over 50 % of the bloodfed females of P. duboscqi collected at sites that were treated with rodent baits containing rhodamine B alone were positive for the presence of rhodamine B while no blood-fed females of P. duboscqi collected at the sites treated with rodent baits containing rhodamine B plus ivermectin were positive for the presence of rhodamine B.

40|$|A Framework for {{decision}} making in the foundry industry on the lines <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Cycle Assessment has been proposed.

The framework estimates the total <b>life</b> cycle costs <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> in the foundry. Total life cycle costs is made up of two sub costs [...] economic cost and environmental cost. Individual cost components that make up these sub costs are calculated and added up. This cost structure is then used to compare processes in a Criterion Function Decision Matrix. Weights of the Criterion Variables are decided using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The alternative with the minimum Criterion Function is judged the best.

40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} and standardized a sanding method {{to evaluate the}} emission of airborne particles from products that contain carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under different conditions, including three types of sandpaper and three sanding disc speed. We also characterized the emission of the airborne particles from one neat epoxy test sample, four CNTs-incorporating test samples with different CNTs loading, and two commercial products. The total number concentration, respirable mass concentration, and particle size number/mass distribution of the emitted particles were calculated and compared, followed by an electron microscopy (EM) analysis. These {{data suggest that the}} sanding process can produce substantial quantities of airborne particles. Also, the emission of airborne particles was associated with different test conditions. EM analysis of the airborne particle samples showed embedded CNTs protruding from the outer surface, which was different from CNTs-incorporating bulk material.

50|$|The {{earliest}} archaeological discoveries from Eversen {{date to the}} end of the Old Stone Age. Finds of flint tools, as well as {{the remains}} of fireplaces, are evidence of at least periodic settlement by itinerant hunter-gatherer cultures. Numerous finds from the Middle Stone Age testify to a dense settlement <b>of</b> the <b>sand</b> dunes lying east of the river Örtze in the area of the present-day village of Sandberg. In the New Stone Age and the transition from an appropriative to a productive way <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> the <b>sand</b> dunes proved unsuitable for agriculture and were largely abandoned as places of settlement. Only on the so-called Kolk and on the Lerchberg is there evidence of settlers during that period. There, access to water and the relatively better quality of soil in comparison with the other sites nearby provided the essential requirements for arable farming. There are no traces of settlement in the area of the village from the Ice Age, i.e. the time from about 800 BC to 400 AD.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{sand fly}} Phlebotomus papatasi transmits Leishmania major, which causes {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis, in vast {{regions of the}} Old World. In addition to blood, the sand flies feed on plants. In a study of this diet, we observed that one night of feeding on branches of Solanum jasminoides, Ricinus communis, or Bougainvillea glabra drastically shortened the <b>life</b> span <b>of</b> the <b>sand</b> flies. Flowering B. glabra attracted P. papatasi in the field. Nevertheless, in the region endemic for L. major in yards abounding with vector sand flies, the number of P. papatasi trapped near hedges of B. glabra was eight times less (62 versus 502 flies trapped) than in the control sites. The results imply that B. glabra affords local protection against sand fly bites and decreases the risk of leishmaniasis. We suggest that this and other ornamental plants that are harmful to sand flies {{can be used as}} a tool for this purpose...|$|R

60|$|The {{biography}} {{of a very}} great man from the pen of a very ladylike writer--this is the best description we can give <b>of</b> M. Caro's <b>Life</b> <b>of</b> George <b>Sand.</b> The late Professor of the Sorbonne could chatter charmingly about culture, and had all the fascinating insincerity of an accomplished phrase-maker; being an extremely superior person {{he had a great}} contempt for Democracy and its doings, but he was always popular with the Duchesses of the Faubourg, as there was nothing in history or in literature that he could not explain away for their edification; having never done anything remarkable he was naturally elected a member of the Academy, and he always remained loyal to the traditions of that thoroughly respectable and thoroughly pretentious institution. In fact, he was just the sort of man who should never have attempted to write a <b>Life</b> <b>of</b> George <b>Sand</b> or to interpret George Sand's genius. He was too feminine to appreciate the grandeur of that large womanly nature, too much of a dilettante to realise the masculine force of that strong and ardent mind. He never gets at the secret <b>of</b> George <b>Sand,</b> and never brings us near to her wonderful personality. He looks on her simply as a litterateur, as a writer of pretty stories <b>of</b> country <b>life</b> and <b>of</b> charming, if somewhat exaggerated, romances. But George Sand was much more than this. Beautiful as are such books as Consuelo and Mauprat, Francois le Champi and La Mare au Diable, yet in none of them is she adequately expressed, by none of them is she adequately revealed. As Mr. Matthew Arnold said, many years ago, 'We do not know George Sand unless we feel the spirit which goes through her work as a whole.' With this spirit, however, M. Caro has no sympathy. Madame Sand's doctrines are antediluvian, he tells us, her philosophy is quite dead and her ideas of social regeneration are Utopian, incoherent and absurd. The best thing for us to do is to forget these silly dreams and to read Teverino and Le Secretaire Intime. Poor M. Caro! This spirit, which he treats with such airy flippancy, is the very leaven <b>of</b> modern <b>life.</b> It is remoulding the world for us and fashioning our age anew. If it is antediluvian, it is so because the deluge is yet to come; if it is Utopian, then Utopia must be added to our geographies. To what curious straits M. Caro is driven by his violent prejudices may be estimated {{by the fact that he}} tries to class George Sand's novels with the old Chansons de geste, the stories of adventure characteristic of primitive literatures; whereas in using fiction as a vehicle of thought, and romance as a means of influencing the social ideals of her age, George Sand was merely carrying out the traditions of Voltaire and Rousseau, of Diderot and of Chateaubriand. The novel, says M. Caro, must be allied either to poetry or to science. That it has found in philosophy one of its strongest allies seems not to have occurred to him. In an English critic such a view might possibly be excusable. Our greatest novelists, such as Fielding, Scott and Thackeray cared little for the philosophy of their age. But coming, as it does, from a French critic, the statement seems to show a strange want of recognition of one of the most important elements of French fiction. Nor, even in the narrow limits that he has imposed upon himself, can M. Caro be said to be a very fortunate or felicitous critic. To take merely one instance out of many, he says nothing <b>of</b> George <b>Sand's</b> delightful treatment <b>of</b> art and the artist's life. And yet how exquisitely does she analyse each separate art and present it to us in its relation to life! In Consuelo she tells us of music; in Horace of authorship; in Le Chateau des Desertes of acting; in Les Maitres Mosaistes of mosaic work; in Le Chateau de Pictordu of portrait painting; and in La Daniella of the painting of landscape. What Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Browning have done for England she did for France. She invented an art literature. It is unnecessary, however, to discuss any of M. Caro's minor failings, for the whole effect of the book, so far as it attempts to portray for us the scope and character <b>of</b> George <b>Sand's</b> genius, is entirely spoiled by the false attitude assumed from the beginning, and though the dictum may seem to many harsh and exclusive, we cannot help feeling that an absolute incapacity for appreciating the spirit of a great writer is no qualification for writing a treatise on the subject.|$|R

In the present paper, the effects <b>of</b> <b>sand,</b> i. e. particle size and fineness module <b>of</b> <b>sand,</b> sand to paste ratio (Rs/p) and paste film thickness (PFT) on the {{rheological properties}} of CA mortar were studied {{with the use of}} a rheometer. The results show that the properties and content <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> have a strong influence on the rheology of CA mortar. The yield stress and apparent viscosity of CA mortar is decreased with the increasing of particle size and fineness module <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> and PFT, and the decreasing of Rs/p. The key factor <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> to determine the rheology of CA mortar is the PFT...|$|R
