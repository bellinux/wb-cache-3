500|$|The {{film has}} come to be seen as the archetypal {{portrayal}} of 1980s excess, with Douglas advocating [...] "greed, for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> is good". Wall Street defines itself through a number of morality conflicts putting wealth and power against simplicity and honesty, and an attack on the value system of extreme competitiveness where ethics and the law are simply irrelevant parts of the show.|$|E
500|$|Wall Street (1987) – The notorious [...] "corporate raider" [...] and [...] "greenmailer" [...] Gordon Gekko, {{representing}} {{a synthesis of}} the worst features of various famous private equity figures, intends to manipulate an ambitious young stockbroker {{to take over a}} failing but decent airline. [...] Although Gekko makes a pretense of caring about the airline, his intentions prove to be to destroy the airline, strip its assets and lay off its employees before raiding the corporate pension fund. [...] Gekko would become a symbol in popular culture for unrestrained greed (with the signature line, [...] "Greed, for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> is good") that would be attached to the private equity industry.|$|E

500|$|Despite her {{physical}} {{absence from the}} entry, Cher's presence can be felt throughout the narrative. Negra argues that Cher's [...] "flamboyant and self-authored body" [...] {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "the possibility of self-transformation". In addition, her voice, heard via songs like [...] "Walking in Memphis", is associated with the idea of [...] "circumvent patriarchy." [...] Negra notes that Cher's music is used in scenes during The Great Mutato's sexual encounters with women. Negra asserts that [...] "this juxtaposition of sound and image cues our perception that we have entered the realm of carnival where the normal order of things is inverted." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club reasons that the ending was not the actual conclusion of the episode, but rather the fanciful and elaborate happy ending that was concocted by Izzy Berkowitz, the writer of the comic book, after talking to Mulder. In this manner, VanDerWeff notes, [...] "the episode abandons logic and reality and, for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> transcends." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com postulates that the entire episode never happened [...] "rom a canonical perspective" [...] due to the entry's comic book setting, the various meta-references and the [...] "happy ending".|$|E
500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} creation and execution of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling like we had limited time to capture something, I felt like we could take our time with the songs, and come back the next day to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> sloppy. But in a good way. We spent a lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records. On this one, we went more with the vibe of the particular take in question." ...|$|E

[...] Although Merrily closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, [...] "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs... But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I feel betrayed? I'm not sure I would put it like that.
