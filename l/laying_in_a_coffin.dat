It {{was a man who}} {{presented}} himself as the fifth lover and invited the woman for <b>a</b> walk <b>in</b> which she agreed. Meanwhile, Lange Wapper hid in the house and used his shapeshifting gift. He wanted to know if the men really loved the woman so he gave them a task. The first man was sent to the cemetery to sit under the big cross. The second had to <b>lay</b> down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffin</b> under the cross. The third had to knock on the coffin until someone turned up. The fourth had to walk on the cemetery with a large chain. The four men and the woman died: the first one scared to death when the second one crawled into the coffin. The second man scared to death when the third one knocked on the coffin.
