5|$|Mother 3 is a single-player {{role playing}} video game similar to {{previous}} {{games in the}} Mother series. The player controls a party of playable characters who explore the game's two-dimensional fictional world, primarily shown from a top-down perspective. While navigating the overworld, the player may converse with non-player characters, obtain items, or encounter enemies. Winning battles against enemies awards experience points to the party, which is required for <b>leveling</b> <b>up.</b> <b>Leveling</b> <b>up</b> a character permanently enhances its individual attributes such as maximum hit points (HP), power points (PP), offense, and defense. Weapons, armor, or accessories can be equipped on a character to increase certain attributes. The player can restore their characters' HP and PP or heal various status ailments by visiting hot springs which are placed abundantly in the game world, and the player can save the game by talking to frogs. Currency is introduced in the later half of the game as Dragon Points (DP), earned by winning battles and used to purchase items. The player can deposit or withdraw DP from frogs.|$|E
5|$|During combat, Aya gains {{experience}} {{points and}} gains experience levels when a certain quantity is achieved. Gaining a level both restores her health and raises her maximum health and energy levels. Weapons also gain levels {{the more they}} are used. In addition to <b>leveling</b> <b>up,</b> Aya's stats can be customized using Over Energy (OE) clips found during missions or acquired during Overdive attacks. Using a 3x3 grid accessed in the hub area, certain OE clips grand different stat boosts and abilities. Creating a new grid automatically deletes {{the effects of the}} original.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the five}} band members has a unique {{character}} class, which vary from one another mainly by the special magical attacks, called Anar-chi, that they can use. Anar-chi attacks include Tommy Homicide's ability to summon acid-coated buzzsaws and The Rexecutioner's ability to summon and use a debris-spitting drum kit. Players are able to use new abilities by visiting an in-game tattoo parlor. Tattoos, and the special abilities that they unlock, are character-specific. Players can also unlock new abilities, including additional combination attacks, group attacks, {{and the ability to}} use two weapons at once, by <b>leveling</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
50|$|Campaign Game: The single player {{campaign}} has 37 missions {{for a total}} playing time of around 35-45 hours, depending on difficulty level selected. The player controls a team of up to six Ghosts through the story based campaign, <b>leveling</b> them <b>up</b> and upgrading their equipment as the story progressed.|$|R
50|$|The player uses Miis to {{interact}} in this game. Players can transfer their Miis from their Wii console to their Nintendo DS, make friends, perform everyday tasks, and give clothes, food, and special items to the Miis to gain experience for each Mii, <b>leveling</b> them <b>up</b> and {{allowing them to}} collect rewards for each level-up. New areas and shops on the island the Miis inhabit will open as the player's population grows and special conditions are met.|$|R
50|$|The player {{character}} can have 3 Sigils applied {{at any given}} time. Sigils act as elemental schools of magic for the player to cast. This includes Fire, Ice, Lightning, Corruption, and more which are unlocked as the player progresses through the story-line. At a Reliquary, the player can switch between which Sigil {{he or she has}} equipped. Each Sigil can be leveled up by completing an objective which is shown when the player inspects it. <b>Leveling</b> it <b>up</b> allows for the player to enhance one of three statistics.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, {{as is the}} case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon <b>leveling</b> <b>up,</b> access shops remotely and use additional battle commands.|$|E
5|$|Oblivion can {{be played}} in either a first-or third-person view, except in the mobile phone version, in which the game can only be played in {{isometric}} projection. The player may change {{the level of difficulty}} at any time, thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success for particular actions. The screen constantly presents a heads-up display, which provides information about the character's health, magicka, and fatigue, all of which can be increased by <b>leveling</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sonic and the Secret Rings is a 2007 {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by Sonic Team {{and published by}} Sega for the Wii. A spin-off to the Sonic the Hedgehog series, {{it is the first}} title in the franchise for the system, and follows Sonic the Hedgehog's quest to stop an evil genie named the Erazor Djinn. In addition to the basic platforming gameplay of previous Sonic titles, Secret Rings uses a system of experience points and levels, as well as special moves that are unlocked via <b>leveling</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Before {{performing}} any fret work, the fingerboard {{and body}} of the instrument are covered with low tack tape to prevent any damage from files and other tools. Leveling is achieved by running a leveling [...] file or <b>leveling</b> bar lengthwise <b>up</b> and down the neck. This process takes [...]002 to [...]005 inches of material off the frets, bringing them to a uniform height while creating flat tops on the frets.|$|R
50|$|Detroit traded Looney to the Washington Redskins, {{where he}} had an uneventful tenure. He had 55 carries for 178 yards. The only {{highlight}} of his time with the Redskins came on a play in {{which he did not}} even have the ball. He was pass protecting for quarterback Sonny Jurgensen, and ended <b>up</b> <b>leveling</b> an onrushing pass rusher with a right hook to the jaw. When he tried to renegotiate his contract, he was let go.|$|R
50|$|The {{eastern side}} of the present Market Hall stands on what was until the 18th century the moat of the castle of Bydgoszcz, parting the Old Town and the {{fortified}} edifice of the Starostwo. At the end of the 18th century, the moat, useless, had gradually silted <b>up,</b> <b>leveling</b> with the area around. In 1787, Prussian authorities constructed in its place a parish evangelical church, the first non-Catholic church in the city. This church served the Evangelical urban communities throughout the 19th century.|$|R
5|$|The {{real-time}} battle {{system used}} in Secret of Mana {{has been described}} by its creators {{as an extension of the}} battle system used in the first three flagship Final Fantasy titles. The system for experience points and <b>leveling</b> <b>up</b> was taken from Final Fantasy III. According to Tanaka, the game's battle system features mechanics that had first been considered for Final Fantasy IV. Similarly, unused features in Secret of Mana were appropriated by the Chrono Trigger team, which like Final Fantasy IV was in production at the time.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} goals within the games: {{following}} through the main storyline and defeating the Elite Four and Lance to become the new Champion, and completing the Pokédex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 251 creatures. A major aspect of this is developing and raising the player's Pokémon by battling other Pokémon, {{which can be found}} in the wild or owned by other Trainers. This system of accumulating experience points (EXP) and <b>leveling</b> <b>up,</b> characteristic and integral to all Pokémon video games, controls the physical properties of the Pokémon, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves learned.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{comes in}} the form of both avoidable random {{encounters}} and scripted fights where the camera is fixed within the fighting area: enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology. Battles are triggered only when enemies are near, with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons sheathed. In combat, characters attack and guard using a single-button prompt, while another button accesses items such as healing potions. Continuously attacking triggers combos. Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons, which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into the air with an upward slash. Additional offensive items such as smoke bombs are acquired during the course of the game. At the end of each battle, experience points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished: <b>leveling</b> <b>up</b> increases a character's health, stats, and the amount of damage inflicted upon enemies.|$|E
50|$|This {{stage is}} {{characterized}} by limestone rock walls that make <b>up</b> <b>leveling</b> platforms as well as housing foundation, with figurines and some pots found. These materials show that the site was then a small village - perhaps dependent on a larger Olmec-related culture (Mezcala) settlement in the Balsas River region during the mid-preclassical era (800-1000 BCE), or, as it seems more likely, that it was inhabited by people who settled here around 600 BCE, at {{the decline of the}} Olmec sites.|$|R
25|$|Gabala started December with a 2-1 {{win over}} Mil-Muğan in the Azerbaijan Cup, {{with the goals}} coming from Leonardo and Abdulwaheed Afolabi, his first goal for the club. Gabala's next game was on 8 December against Simurq, which ended as a 2-1 victory to Gabala after Danijel Subotić scored an injury time winner {{following}} his early goal and Amit Guluzade scored an own goal for Simurq. Gabala suffered their fifth defeat of the season on 15 December away to Neftchi Baku. Neftchi took the lead through a 12th minute Araz Abdullayev penalty after Flavinho had been fouled, with Leonardo <b>leveling</b> things <b>up</b> in first half stoppage time from the penalty spot. Mushfig Teymurov was sent off for Gabala after collecting two yellow cards, before Mahir Shukurov scored an injury time free-kick to seal the victory for Neftchi. On 18 December, Diego underwent surgery for a knee injury sustained during training the previous week. Gabala's last game before the winter break, and the last {{in the first round}} of 19 matches, was on 20 December at home to Baku. Gabala won the game 2-0 with goals from Danijel Subotić and Lorenzo Ebecilio, two go 2nd in the table.|$|R
50|$|Prior to opening, however, Mell Kilpatrick was {{sought by}} Walt Disney to {{photograph}} the construction of Disneyland. Being so far from Burbank, Disney had few personnel and structural resources, including a dark room. Mell offered both his dark room and services to Disney. Taking full opportunity of his press pass to the construction site, Mell photographed every phase of construction from the first <b>leveling</b> of dirt <b>up</b> through opening day, and beyond. Other photographers had documented the construction but only during short visits just prior to opening day. Delmar Watson visited the park a couple months prior to opening to take photos of the Sleeping Beauty Castle and other landmarks of the park. Renie Bardeau also took a few selected photos of Walt Disney inside the park. But the far majority of existing photos of construction of the park are from Mell Kilpatrick's work.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of equipment increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon <b>leveling</b> <b>up</b> or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} unique Titan classes, {{variants}} of light, medium, and heavy, with inversely related speed and armor: the all-rounder Atlas, the bulky Ogre, and the fleet-footed Stryder. The latter two chassis are unlocked upon finishing both faction campaigns and were later made unlockable by <b>leveling</b> <b>up</b> as well. Each chassis has a respective Core power that {{works on a}} cooldown timer: respectively, increased damage, increased shields, and unlimited dashes. Titan tactical ability options include stopping enemy ammunition in midair to throw back in their direction, emitting electrified smoke to hurt and repel pilots climbing the Titan's back, and deploying a defensive wall. Additionally, players can equip two perk kits to customize for their preferred strategy. Their primary weapons include rocket launchers, lightning cannons, and chainguns. Titans can act autonomously when put in guard and follow modes, which directs the Titan either to protect their vicinity or to tail their pilot, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, <b>leveling</b> <b>up,</b> Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E
5000|$|When available, {{each of the}} player's four weapons can {{be charged}} up for a more {{powerful}} attack. Moreover, the player can level-up weapons with prolonged use of them. Depending on the weapon, <b>leveling</b> one <b>up</b> will allow for more attacks, increased attack range, or shortened charge time. In previous Mega Man games, the player would obtain new weapons from defeated bosses and could in turn use those weapons against other bosses and minor enemies. In Mega Man Zero, defeating some bosses earns the player elemental chips (thunder, fire, or ice) {{that can be used}} during a charged attack to further damage foes weak to a specific element. Mega Man Zero also introduces [...] "Cyber Elves", which can be found hidden in certain missions or dropped by enemies. Cyber Elves are collectible, single-use aids with either temporary or permanent effects on Zero or the game's levels. Cyber Elf effects range widely, from reducing the life gauge of a boss to slowing down all enemies in a stage. Up to three Cyber Elves can be equipped for a given level and some can only be activated once they are fed sufficient energy crystals picked up or collected from defeated enemies. The player's performance is scored on a percentage scale and graded {{at the end of each}} mission. The results are based on parameters including the completion time, the number of enemies destroyed, and the player's total damage.|$|R
50|$|Rise of the Eldrazi {{introduced}} {{a number of}} new mechanics, including annihilator, level up, rebound and totem armor. Annihilator is found on large Eldrazi creatures, and whenever a creature with it attacks, defending player sacrifices a set number of permanents. Creatures with the new level up keyword can become larger or acquire new abilities for a small investment of mana. The number of level counters on a creature tells you its current level, and its current level tells you its power, toughness, and extra abilities. <b>Leveling</b> a creature <b>up</b> can only be played as a sorcery. Spells with Rebound are exiled after being cast, and can be cast again during your next upkeep for free. After the rebound has triggered, the spell enters the graveyard as normal. Totem Armor is found on white, green and blue Aura Enchantments. If the enchanted creature were to be destroyed (by lethal damage or effects saying Destroy), the enchantment would go to the graveyard instead of the creature.|$|R
50|$|The {{storm surge}} from Hurricane Katrina that hit Pass Christian was {{estimated}} at 8.5 m (27.8 ft), which is the US record high, <b>leveling</b> Pass Christian <b>up</b> to half a mile inland from the shore; estimation of highest storm surges was complicated because high-water markers were also destroyed. Highway 90 along the beach was damaged, and the bridge over the Bay of St. Louis was thrown completely apart, not being reopened until a new bridge was partially completed in May 2007. (Connection was temporarily replaced by a ferry service.) Sewage contamination rendered the local water supply unusable, as some samples tested positive for more than 250 bacteria and parasites. By late September 2005, access was restricted south of the railroad tracks (about four blocks inland) without proper credentials, as crews continued to search for victims and clear debris. In early 2007, although rebuilding was underway {{in much of the}} city, a large portion of empty, deserted homes and other structures remain. Many residents were still living in FEMA trailers, and out-of-state volunteers were still needed for the rebuilding effort.|$|R
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, {{with the}} player, enemies, and {{sometimes}} non-playable characters each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are {{won by the}} player defeating all enemies in a map or killing a boss character. Enemies include human troops and monsters. The players are given {{a limited number of}} units, which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also affects their range of movement on the battlefield. In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set but can switch once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess. Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase based on a percent chance unique for each character. Spells for magical classes are learned through <b>leveling</b> <b>up</b> rather than being part of a separate system, and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.|$|E
5|$|As in Forza Motorsport 3, {{there is}} a career mode for players to complete, which sees players racing at {{multiple}} locations around the world. This is known as World Tour Mode in Forza Motorsport 4, previously known as Season Play in Forza Motorsport 3. However, one new feature that appears in Forza Motorsport 4 is the game's ability to adapt the difficulty as the player progresses through the career, and collect a trend of data {{to see how well}} they perform. This allows AI drivers to change and upgrade their cars automatically to suit the player's driving abilities. There are several types of races besides the standard format. Forza Motorsport 4 includes the original bumper-to-bumper races, but also has drift, autocross, and multiple-heat races. Unlike in Forza Motorsport 3 where players had no choice over which car they received after <b>leveling</b> <b>up,</b> in Forza Motorsport 4 players are now able to choose one out of several cars as a prize, which are automatically upgraded to the high end of their class. Players are able to import their Forza Motorsport 3 profiles into Forza Motorsport 4. This gives them the ability to transfer a certain number of in-game credits and gifted cars into their new garage. The allowed number transferred is based on how long they have played the game and how many cars and credits they have. Players have the option to create car clubs and share cars in their garages within that club. Previous games in the series were limited to eight cars on the track, however Forza Motorsport 4 supports 16 player racing online, and two players offline.|$|E
5|$|In battle, {{players can}} perform {{multiple}} actions: walking or running along a fixed axis, freely {{running around the}} battlefield, jumping in any direction, guarding against attacks, and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack. Characters can launch various attacks, from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy attacks. The player character's attacks can be chained together to create combo attacks, which create a continual flow of attacks without giving the enemy a chance to attack. Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike, which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses. Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses {{at the end of}} the battle. During battle, landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an Over Limit meter. Once the meter is full, the player character can perform continual attacks and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit's duration. During battles, Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions. Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item. All characters can use Artes, special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard attacks to healing magic. Learned by <b>leveling</b> <b>up</b> a character, Artes can be both specifically directed and have a general area of effect. Four Artes can be assigned to each character, and each Arte can be assigned to a hot key. Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters. In addition to standard Artes, each character can access Mystic Arts, extra-powerful cinematic attacks.|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of immiscible blends of nylon 6 and ethylene propylene rubber blends (EPM) was studied. The blends {{were prepared}} by melt blending in a twin-screw miniextruder and a Haake Rheocord mixer. The {{influence of the}} blend ratio, time of mixing, rotation speed of the rotors, mixing temperature, and quenching of the extruded melt at low temperature on the phase morphology of the blends was quantitatively analyzed. The morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after preferential extraction of the minor phase. The SEM micrographs were quantitatively analyzed for domain-size measurements. The morphology of the blends indicated that the EPM phase was preferentially dispersed as domains in the continuous nylon matrix up to 40 wt % of its concentration. A cocontinuous morphology was observed at 50 and 60 wt % EPM content followed by a phase inversion beyond 60 wt % of EPM where the nylon phase was dispersed as domains in the continuous EPM phase. The size, shape, and distribution of the domains were evaluated by image analysis {{as a function of}} the bleed composition, The effect of the time of mixing on the phase morphology was studied up to 20 min for the 30 / 70 EPM/nylon blend. The most significant domain breakup was observed within the first 3 min of mixing followed by a <b>leveling</b> off <b>up</b> to 15 min. This may be associated with the equilibrium between the domain breakup and coalescence. The influence of rotor speed on the morphology was insignificant at a high rotor speed although a significant effect was observed by changing the rotor speed from 9 to 20 rpm. The influence of high-temperature annealing, repeated cycles of extrusion, the molecular weight of the nylon matrix, and the nature of the mixer type (twin-screw miniextruder versus Haake Rheocord mixer) on the morphology was also investigated in detail. The experimental results were compared with literature data. Finally, the extent of interface adhesion in these blends was analyzed by examination of the fracture-surface morphology.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the painting technique used in the Etruscan tomb “Tomba della Quadriga Infernale”. This tomb was discovered in Sarteano (Siena, Italy) in October 2003 and dated back to {{the second half of the}} 4 th century BC. Red, dark red, pink, yellow, white, black and grey colours were used in the tomb in order to create paintings, which now represent a very precious record of the Etruscan art of wall painting in a hypogeal environment. The technical features of the painting were revealed by stratigraphy using optical and electronic microscopy. The components and preparatory layers of the painted areas were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). XRD, SEM-EDS and optical microscopic techniques were also used for mineralogical analysis of the rock substrate. The SEM-EDS and FTIR analyses showed that red and yellow ochre, calcite and vegetable charcoal were used to paint the walls of the tomb: the pigments, either alone or mixed together, were utilized to produce pure colours (red, yellow, white and black) and intermediate tonalities (pink, dark red, grey). SEM-EDS, FTIR and XRD highlighted that the painting was made on a preparatory layer of calcite, applied onto a <b>leveling</b> material made <b>up</b> of calcite, clay minerals, quartz, and iron oxides. GC/MS analyses revealed that egg was used as an organic binder to disperse the pigments...|$|R
5000|$|Ryu's first {{destination}} {{is the town}} of Nanai, under which the Earth Key is sealed. He seizes the key from the Dark Dragon forces stationed there, but ends <b>up</b> <b>leveling</b> the town doing so since the Earth Key governs seismic activity. He then travels to Windia ("Winlan" [...] in the official translation) but discovers that the King there has been poisoned. He briefly meets Nina, the princess of Windia, and then has to rescue her from the tower of Karma after her mission to obtain the remedy for her father goes awry due {{to the use of}} a toxic weapon called Xeon Gas which was seemingly developed by the Dark Dragons. Once Nina's father awakens, Nina herself elects to join Ryu on his further adventures, and the two next travel to the home of the wolf-like Forest Clan. The Dark Dragons have a presence here, though: the chieftain of the village neighboring the Forest Clan's is in fact an impostor working for the Dark Dragon Empire. Ryu and Nina venture to a nearby forest to rescue the real chief, but things do not go as planned. Fortunately, they meet Bo, a warrior of the Forest Clan who had just escaped the custody of the Dark Dragons, and he frees the real chief and the pair: he also joins them on their continued quest: he even helps them locate the Space Key which is needed for the party to progress.|$|R
25|$|Materialist: Rewards are material, {{rather than}} Experience Points, <b>Leveling</b> <b>Up,</b> and so on. Also, Newtonian physics {{tends to be}} followed.|$|E
25|$|The game {{also carries}} RPG {{elements}} such as <b>leveling</b> <b>up</b> by winning enough experience when defeating enemies. Enemies' attacks can also affect the player's commands with items he picks up across the stages and activate them while opening the menu.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there are}} three races: human, elf and giant. When {{creating}} a character, one may choose an age between ten and seventeen. The character will age one year every (real) week. Different ages yield different initial stats and affect the amount of stats raised when <b>leveling</b> <b>up.</b> AP (Ability Points) are also granted when aging; the younger one is, the more AP they will get when they age.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling and monitoring work {{related to the}} mediaeval bridge Azzone Visconti in Lecco (the "old bridge"). Metric information was acquired with different instruments and techniques for an integrated digital documentation that combines observations with variable precision: ± 0. 1 mm {{for the analysis of}} small vertical movements and subcentimeter precision for the geometrical reconstruction. The complexity of the bridge, with irregular constructive elements and different materials, required a detailed geometrical survey with laser scanning and photogrammetric techniques for the generation of plans and sections along with an accurate 3 D parametric representation based on Building Information Modeling. A strategy based on NURBS curves and surfaces was implemented to overcome the lack of BIM libraries for historical constructions. Modeling was carried out at a metric scale 1 : 50 by assembling BIM objects following the logic of construction of the bridge. A semi-Automated strategy that incorporates point clouds was developed to use information gathered by other data sources, such as historical analysis, destructive and non-destructive testing, and existing documentation. The monitoring project aimed at revealing vertical movements during loading tests. The measurement phase was carried out with a high-precision geometric <b>leveling</b> network made <b>up</b> of 47 benchmarks, resulting in redundant measurements adjusted via least squares techniques. The combined use of (i) photogrammetry and laser scanning for the 3 D modeling project and (ii) geometric leveling for the analysis of vertical displacements allowed one to capture the metric information needed not only for specialists in the field of surveying, monitoring and modeling, but also for the other specialists (architects, engineers, etc.) involved in the project...|$|R
25|$|Similar to Raid Decks, Dungeon Decks {{are large}} scale {{encounters}} designed for multiple players to play against. The main difference from Raid Decks {{is that a}} Dungeon Deck runs itself with no need for an additional player to act as the Raid Master. Additionally Dungeon Decks {{are designed to be}} played against basic starter decks with players unlocking the ability to add new cards by gaining experience from defeating dungeons and <b>leveling</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|Components of {{the game}} world go through a <b>leveling</b> <b>up</b> process after each {{selection}} is made. Because previously engaged components {{of the game}} world remain on the screen, later button pushes will often allow new areas of the environment to interact with previous areas. These interactions may cause the environmental component to level up, level down, or remain the same. By keeping track of which buttons have which effects on {{the other parts of}} the game world, the player can home in on the good ending by maximizing the visual reward. Once all components have been maximized and the world is fully developed, the player wins.|$|E
