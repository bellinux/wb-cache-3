40|$|Aluminium <b>Lost</b> <b>Foam</b> {{castings}} {{were made}} using gravity and counter-gravity filling techniques. Tensile strength {{was found to}} be most uniform in those castings which had been filled slowly from the bottom and where the metal front had remained stable throughout filling sequence. Pores containing carbon deposits were found on the fracture surfaces of all the castings made and this suggested that the defect was caused by polymer entrapment. A Saffman-Taylor instability was observed at the interface between Hg and a viscous glucose syrup which were contained in an analogue, that was used simulate the casting of <b>Lost</b> <b>Foam</b> <b>moulds</b> at room temperature. The liquid degradation products of the polystyrene patterns were also found to be viscous, although this was reduced by treatment with Br. Under the same conditions of temperature and velocity, the interface observed during the filling of a Br-treated pattern was planar whereas that of an untreated pattern was unstable. This demonstrated not only that the interfacial instability entrapped polymer degradation products, which adversely affected casting quality, but was probably of the Saffman-Taylor type.

40|$|Integral <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> (IFM) is an {{economical}} way {{to produce}} castings with integrated cellular structure, i. e. a solid {{skin and a}} foamed core. IFM {{has been known for}} polymers for more than four decades and is well established in industrial production. Polymer integral foam parts are accepted as a material system with own properties which simplifies designs, reduces production costs and weight, and increases stiffness and overall strength. On the other hand, integral <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> for metals is a new field of research. The development of metal based integral <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> processes at WTM moves along analogous paths as that of polymers by transferring and adapting successful moulding technologies for polymer integral foam to metals. Two moulding techniques for metal integral foam are presented, a low and a high pressure process. In the low pressure process, the molten metal charged with blowing agent is injected into a permanent steel mould without completely filling it. In this case, the mould gets eventually filled by foam expansion. In the high pressure process foaming is initiated by expansion of the mould cavity after it has been filled completely with the mixture of the metal melt and the blowing agent. The moulded parts are characterized with respect to their cellular structure, density profile and pore size distribution. Mechanical properties such as stiffness and damping behaviour are discussed.

40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. It was {{published}} in the journal, Plastics, rubber and composites : macromolecular engineering [© Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining] and is also available at: [URL] polyurethane (PU) <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> process involves the use of sacrificial release agents (SRAs) that are both costly and harmful to the environment. This research proposes the use of low surface energy, polymer substrates, as a means of eliminating SRAs from the <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> process. Previous work identified the major factors affecting the ability of a polymer surface to release a PU foam part as being the surface energy and surface roughness of the substrate, and the proportion of isocyanate in the foam. The research described here has built upon these results and quantified the effects of each factor by using a D optimal design of experiment structure. Crucially it has also been shown that, given the surface energy of a polymer substrate, its roughness and the composition of the foam, it is possible to predict whether or not unaided release should be possible, and a model has been produced in order to allow this prediction for the foams under consideration. This capability will provide the PU <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> industry with the possibility of identifying polymeric mould materials, and levels of finishing for these moulds, which have the potential to allow the elimination of SRAs from the production process...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Lost</b> <b>Foam</b> Casting {{process has}} been firmly {{established}} for Aluminium and ferrous alloys. This process offers many advantages over conventional casting processes but its full potential {{has yet to be}} reached due to the many defects introduced to the casting associated with decomposition of the <b>foam</b> pattern during <b>mould</b> filling. The <b>foam</b> pattern commonly used in this process is Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) which degrades to liquid and vapour byproducts. The liquid decomposition byproducts travel to the metal/mould interface, where the globules of liquid foam can become trapped against the coating and their molecular weight is reduced due to the heat from the molten metal. At the same time, they release bubbles of gas into the castings. These globules can wick into the refractory coating only if their molecular weight is sufficiently reduced to below a critical molecular weight. In this study, {{to improve the quality of}} Aluminium alloys made by <b>Lost</b> <b>Foam</b> Casting, easier removal of the decomposition byproducts was obtained by using low molecular weight foam patterns. The molecular weight of expanded Polystyrene was not reduced when it was exposed to γ-rays because of cross-linking while the molecular weight of Poly Methyl Methacrylate (PMMA) was significantly due to chain session.
