5|$|Later Hurley brings Jack and Charlie water, {{he notes}} Charlie doesn't look well but Jack covers for him {{saying that he}} has the flu. Hurley tells him to get better and Charlie looks thankful to Jack. He sees Locke and asks him for his heroin and Locke gives it back. Charlie <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> for a moment before tossing it into the fire, smiling. Locke tells Charlie he's proud of him and that he always knew he could do it. Charlie and Locke see a moth flying away.|$|E
25|$|Rattling Blanket Woman was the {{daughter}} of Black Buffalo and White Cow (also known as Iron Cane). Her older siblings were Lone Horn (born 1790, died 1877) and Good Looking Woman (born 1810). Her younger sister was named <b>Looks</b> <b>At</b> <b>It</b> (born 1815), later given the name They Are Afraid of Her. The historian George Hyde wrote that Rattling Blanket Woman was Miniconjou and the sister of Spotted Tail, who became a Brulé head chief.|$|E
25|$|The gospels {{can be seen}} {{as having}} three {{separate}} lines: A literary line which <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from a textual perspective, secondly a historical line which observes how Christianity started as a renewal movement within Judaism and eventually separated from it, and finally a theological line which analyzes Christian teachings. Within the historical perspective, the gospels are not simply used to establish the existence of Jesus as sources in their own right alone, but their content is compared and contrasted to non-Christian sources, and the historical context, to draw conclusions about the historicity of Jesus.|$|E

60|$|Lammle {{produced}} it, {{not without}} reluctance. Fledgeby <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> identified it, twisted it up, {{and threw it}} into the fire. They both <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> as it blazed, went out, and flew in feathery ash up the chimney.|$|R

25|$|Tournée: To {{determine}} trump, declarer {{picks up}} one card of the skat and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> If declarer wants this card's suit as trump, the card {{is shown to}} the other players. Otherwise the hand is played as Passt mir nicht (it doesn't suit me) and the other card in the skat is turned up to determine trump. A jack gives declarer the choice of either playing grand (jacks only) or the jack's suit as trump. Once trump has been determined, both the skat cards are added to declarer's hand and then two are removed and placed face down to begin his or her pile of cards won.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} for authors and researchers, whether individually or in a team, to spot every mistake or flaw in a complicated piece of work. This {{is not necessarily a}} reflection on those concerned, but because with a new and perhaps eclectic subject, an opportunity for improvement may be more obvious to someone with special expertise or who simply <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with a fresh eye. Therefore, showing work to others increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and improved. For both grant-funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also normally a requirement that the subject is both novel and substantial.|$|E
25|$|The game {{features}} a simple interface, with icon menus instead of text. Character movement and most object manipulation are mouse-directed, although the player may use a keyboard or joystick. The player chooses all actions (except movement and projectile weapons) by pressing a single action key (or mouse button), which causes the character to automatically take the correct action with an object; the character either automatically picks up important objects or {{can take the}} object when the character <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> To talk to characters, or attack monsters with the scimitar, the player moves the character towards the target and clicks. The player selects the game's difficulty level of the game, which affects the monsters' power. At {{the beginning of the}} game, the player learns to maneuver the character by racing through a trap-filled dungeon hallway. Al-Qadim features simple, real-time combat, with the character using up to two weapons at a time. The character's scimitar can become more powerful with special objects, and his projectile weapon is a sling or magic shards which cast spells. If the character is injured, he can restore his hit points by drinking healing potions or be magically healed when he visits special locations.|$|E

6000|$|He laughed harshly at the package, {{which was}} still in his hand. [...] "Poor little glove," [...] he said; [...] "and she did not even take the trouble to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you. You might have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> Grizel. I have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> a good deal. It meant {{something}} to me once upon a time when I was a vain fool.

500|$|Archibald Leitch {{designed}} the Goodison Road Stand with construction in 1909. In September that year Ernest Edwards, the Liverpool Echo journalist who christened the terrace at Anfield the [...] "Spion Kop", {{wrote of the}} newly built stand, [...] "The building as one <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> suggests the side of Mauretania at once." [...] The stand was occasionally {{referred to as the}} [...] "Mauretania Stand", in reference to the Liverpool-registered , then the world's largest ship, which operated from the Port of Liverpool.|$|E
500|$|An {{animated}} {{music video}} was produced for [...] "Hello Sunshine", directed by Pete Fowler, Neil McFarland and Passion Pictures and featuring Fowler's cartoon drawings. The video {{begins with the}} sun rising over a country landscape. A small, blue, 'Hello Sunshine' winged horse flies across the sky and is watched by a man holding a 1:16 scale model kit for the same horse. The picture of the horse on the box flies away as he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and lands on one of five hot air balloons flown by cartoon representations of the Super Furry Animals. The video cuts to a brief shot of a man staring through a shop window at an advertising display featuring models of the 'Hello Sunshine' horse before we see Gruff Rhys coming across a huge statue of the same horse in his car.|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but I still think it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Ida, [...] "I'll show you. I {{mentioned}} the picture once before, but you didn't think it worth while to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> That {{was left to}} me. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> very often while you were away." ...|$|R
5000|$|John E. McLaughlin, who at {{the time}} was the Deputy Director of the CIA, {{described}} the extent of the Agency's investigation into the claim: [...] "Well, on something like the Atta meeting in Prague, we went over that every which way from Sunday. We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from every conceivable angle. We peeled open the source, examined the chain of acquisition. We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> photographs. We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> timetables. We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> who was where and when. It is wrong to say that we didn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> In fact, we <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with extraordinary care and intensity and fidelity." ...|$|R

George, that dreadful brute," [...] and {{she pointed}} to the dead elephant, [...] "has killed our baby. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it!</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it!</b> We must be {{everything}} to each other now, dear, as we were before it came--unless God sends us another." ...|$|R
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in which Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Michael Emerson comments Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him {{is a sort of}} scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science. He also described the events as a demonstration that [...] "Ben has more cards than you think; ... he's a step or two ahead, one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game". The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|E

2500|$|Once inside Bellona, an engineer, Tak Loufer, who {{was living}} a few miles outside of the city when the initial {{destruction}} happened, meets and befriends him. Tak has moved to Bellona and stayed there ever since. Upon learning that he cannot remember his name, Tak gives him a nickname—the Kid. Throughout the novel he is {{also referred to as}} [...] "Kid", [...] "Kidd", and often just [...] "kid." [...] Next Tak takes Kid on a short tour of the city. One stop is at a commune in the city park, where Kid sees two women reading a spiral notebook. When Kid <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> we see what he reads: The first page contains, word-for-word, the first sentences of Dhalgren. As he reads further, however, the text diverges from the novel's opening.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), at Mount Hor, God told Moses and Aaron: [...] "Let Aaron be {{gathered}} to his kin: {{he is not}} to enter the land that I have assigned to the Israelite people, because you disobeyed my command about the waters of Meribah." [...] Moses took Aaron and his son Eleazar up on Mount Hor, and there he stripped Aaron of his vestments {{and put them on}} Eleazar, and Aaron died there. The Israelites mourned Aaron 30 days. The king of Arad engaged the Israelites in battle and took some of them captive. The Israelites vowed that if God gave them victory, they would destroy Arad. God delivered up the Canaanites, and the Israelites killed them and destroyed their cities, calling the place Hormah. The people grew restive and spoke against God and Moses, so God let loose serpents that killed many of the Israelites. The people came to Moses, admitted their sin by speaking against God, and asked Moses to intercede with God to take away the serpents, and Moses did so. God told Moses to mount a Nehushtan, or bronze serpent figure, on a pole, saying: [...] "If anyone who is bitten <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> he shall recover." ...|$|E
