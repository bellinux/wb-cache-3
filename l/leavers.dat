5|$|In England and Wales, {{this age}} {{has been raised}} {{numerous}} times since the introduction of compulsory education in 1870. On 1 September 1972, the age was raised from 15 to 16, following preparations which began eight years earlier in 1964. This left a gap year of school <b>leavers</b> who, by law, had to complete an additional year of education from 1973 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Sabah state {{government}} also emphasises pre-school {{education in the}} state. This was followed with the aid from Sabah Foundation (Yayasan Sabah) and Nestlé who helped to establish pre-schools in the state. Sabah has two public universities: Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). Universiti Tun Abdul Razak (UNIRAZAK) has set up their regional centre in Kota Kinabalu. As of 2016, there is around 15 private colleges, two private university colleges together with other newly established colleges. In 1960, the overall literacy rate in North Borneo was only 24%. The recent findings in 2011 found the literacy rate have increase to 79%. Most of secondary schools <b>leavers</b> also did not continue their studies after completing their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) mainly due to financial burden as well {{because of the lack}} of interest and confidence to continue their studies in local higher learning institutes, with a survey in 2015 saw only 16,000 out of more than 20,000 secondary schools <b>leavers</b> continuing their studies.|$|E

60|$|The loving {{couple were}} thus loving {{all the way}} to Twickenham, but when we arrived there (by which time the amateur crew looked very thirsty and vicious) they were more playful than ever, for Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> threw stones at Mr. <b>Leaver,</b> and Mr. <b>Leaver</b> ran after Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> on the grass, in a most {{innocent}} and enchanting manner. At dinner, too, Mr. <b>Leaver</b> WOULD steal Mrs. <b>Leaver's</b> tongue, and Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> WOULD retaliate upon Mr. <b>Leaver's</b> fowl; and when Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> was going to take some lobster salad, Mr. <b>Leaver</b> wouldn't let her have any, saying that it made her ill, and she was always sorry for it afterwards, which afforded Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> an opportunity of pretending to be cross, and showing many other prettinesses. But this was merely the smiling surface of their loves, not the mighty depths of the stream, down to which the company, to say the truth, dived rather unexpectedly, from the following accident. It chanced that Mr. <b>Leaver</b> took upon himself to propose the bachelors who had first originated the notion of that entertainment, in doing which, he affected to regret that he was no longer of their body himself, and pretended grievously to lament his fallen state. This Mrs. <b>Leaver's</b> feelings could not brook, even in jest, and consequently, exclaiming aloud, 'He loves me not, he loves me not!' she fell in a very pitiable state into the arms of Mrs. Starling, and, directly becoming insensible, was conveyed by that lady and her husband into another room. Presently Mr. <b>Leaver</b> came running back to know if there was a medical gentleman in company, and as there was, (in what company is there not?) both Mr. <b>Leaver</b> and the medical gentleman hurried away together.|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} {{believed that}} the changes were needed because of the collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school <b>leavers</b> at 16 years of age are finding it increasingly more difficult to find employment, consequentially in many cases making them unemployable. Within the last 40 years, the number of unskilled jobs available have more than halved, from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to the increasing demand for skilled labour. This, together with fewer students continuing their further education, increase the difficulty for young school <b>leavers</b> to find work if they were either not able, or chose not to, stay on at school and complete further education.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} two major further {{education}} institutions. York College is an amalgamation of York Technical College and York Sixth Form College.

Askham Bryan College offers further education courses, foundation and honours degrees, specialising in more vocational subjects such as horticulture, agriculture, animal management and even golf course management.|$|E
60|$|Now, a moment's {{reflection}} {{might have}} convinced the loving wife, that unless {{her husband were}} endowed with some most surprising powers of muscular action, he never could be dead while he kicked so hard; but still Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> cried, 'Is he dead? is he dead?' and still everybody else cried--'No, no, no,' {{until such time as}} Mr. <b>Leaver</b> was replaced in a sitting posture, and his oar (which had been going through all kinds of wrong-headed performances on its own account) was once more put in his hand, by the exertions of the two firemen-watermen. Mr. <b>Leaver</b> then exclaimed, 'Augustus, my child, come to me;' and Mr. <b>Leaver</b> said, 'Augusta, my love, compose yourself, I am not injured.' But Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> cried again more piteously than before, 'Augustus, my child, come to me;' and now the company generally, who seemed to be apprehensive that if Mr. <b>Leaver</b> remained where he was, he might contribute more than his proper share towards the drowning of the party, disinterestedly took part with Mrs. <b>Leaver,</b> and said he really ought to go, and that he was not strong enough for such violent exercise, and ought never to have undertaken it. Reluctantly, Mr. <b>Leaver</b> went, and laid himself down at Mrs. <b>Leaver's</b> feet, and Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> stooping over him, said, 'Oh Augustus, how could you terrify me so?' and Mr. <b>Leaver</b> said, 'Augusta, my sweet, I never meant to terrify you;' and Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> said, 'You are faint, my dear;' and Mr. <b>Leaver</b> said, 'I am rather so, my love;' and they were very loving indeed under Mrs. <b>Leaver's</b> veil, until at length Mr. <b>Leaver</b> came forth again, and pleasantly asked if he had not heard something said about bottled stout and sandwiches.|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps no work by Vittor {{created as}} much {{controversy}} and media coverage as did his nude statue of Henrietta <b>Leaver,</b> Miss America 1935. Though <b>Leaver</b> posed for Vittor, {{she did so}} in a bathing suit, accompanied by her grandmother. Upon first viewing the lifesize 5-foot 5-inch plaster statue <b>Leaver</b> was shocked {{that it was a}} nude and demanded her representation be draped or veiled. Vittor did not agree and called in art experts to judge the work and all agreed it should stay as it had been created. <b>Leaver</b> did not back down and demanded people her own age review [...] "The American Venus," [...] as it had originally been called. Unfortunately for <b>Leaver</b> her 60 peers, many of whom were art students, agreed it should remain unveiled. Though the strong disagreement between the two eventually did subside, <b>Leaver,</b> Vittor and the statue resurfaced five decades later in recaps of controversial Miss America mishaps.|$|R

60|$|In {{the bustle}} of the scene, Mr. and Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> stole down to the boat, and {{disposed}} themselves under the awning, Mrs. <b>Leaver</b> reclining her head upon Mr. <b>Leaver's</b> shoulder, and Mr. <b>Leaver</b> grasping her hand with great fervour, and looking in her face {{from time to time}} with a melancholy and sympathetic aspect. The widow sat apart, feigning to be occupied with a book, but stealthily observing them from behind her fan; and the two firemen-watermen, smoking their pipes on the bank hard by, nudged each other, and grinned in enjoyment of the joke. Very few of the party missed the loving couple; and the few who did, heartily congratulated each other on their disappearance.|$|R

5|$|Cullompton United Charities {{provides}} {{a number of}} charitable services to residents of Cullompton. The majority of the funds come from bequests made to the parish from the seventeenth century onwards. Thirteen separate charities were combined in 1921 and then in 1953 further amalgamation went on with the Trott's almshouses, John Lanes Charity and the Charity of George Spicer combining to form the current United Charities. There are nine local almshouses which are available to local residents {{over the age of}} 55. They also offer Alpha Piperline emergency call services for the elderly, can refund up to £100 to school <b>leavers</b> under 25 who have spent money equipping themselves with tools, books, vocational training or further education and offer financial help needy individuals resident in the parish to help them purchase specific items. They also own a building called Community House in the town centre, where local organisations can hire meeting rooms.|$|E
5|$|Other {{private colleges}} {{can be found}} through the city {{with most of the}} colleges are {{subsidiaries}} from universities and university colleges established in West Malaysia, such as SEGi College, Sarawak, Sunway College Kuching, Limkokwing Borneo, PTPL Sarawak, Wawasan Open University, Open University Malaysia, and Twintech College Sarawak. There are private institutions conducting franchised programmes from full-fledged universities (apart from running their own courses) such as SATT College (conducting franchised programmes from Universiti Teknologi MARA) and the Institute of Dynamic Management, Sarawak (conducting franchised programmes from Universiti Tun Abdul Razak). The International College of Advanced Technology Sarawak or ICATS is an institution created as the state government's initiative to enhance technical and vocational training education among school <b>leavers.</b> The college was established from the former INTI College Sarawak facilities.

5|$|The {{local council}} {{operates}} a two-tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend {{one of the}} 26 primary schools in the borough before completing their education at secondary school. Bournemouth {{is one of the}} minority of local authorities in England still to maintain selective education, with two grammar schools (one for boys, one for girls) and ten secondary modern/comprehensive schools. There are also a small number of independent schools in the town, and a further education college. Bournemouth has two universities: Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth, both of which are located across the boundary in neighbouring Poole. They are also home to AECC University College (formally known as Anglo European College of Chiropractic), which is located on Parkwood Road in Bournemouth. In 2012, 60.7% of the borough's school <b>leavers</b> gained 5 GCSEs of grade C or above. This was slightly better than the national average of 59.4% and above the average for the rest of Dorset, with 58.8% of pupils from the local authority of Poole, and 54.1% from the remainder of the county, managing to do likewise.|$|E

5|$|The census {{enumeration}} {{was carried}} out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school <b>leavers</b> and 8,400 census supervisors deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the enumerators. There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details about individual members of the family. When the respondent was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. The details in form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by the proxy members, most of whom did not have full information about all the family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the enumerators. Compared to the form used during 2000 census enumeration, there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albimism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010. The enumeration was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining {{regions of the country}} were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011.

In line with previous successful programs, first year non-school <b>leaver</b> Justice students were supported by students who had progressed at least to second year in their degree and had achieved a grade point average of at least 5.

It concludes with recommendations on how the program can be improved in the future to further support non-school <b>leaver</b> students...|$|R
