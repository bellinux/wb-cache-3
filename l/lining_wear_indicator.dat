2500|$|Some <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> <b>indicators,</b> located {{either as}} a semi-metallic layer within the brake pad {{material}} or with an external [...] "sensor", {{are also designed to}} squeal when the lining is due for replacement. The typical external sensor is fundamentally different from the noises described above (when the brakes are applied) because the wear sensor noise typically occurs when the brakes are not used. The wear sensor may only create squeal under braking when it first begins to indicate wear but is still a fundamentally different sound and pitch.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application. [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.

40|$|The present master thesis {{focuses on}} the study of brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> calculation. This brake system {{regulation}} function is worldwide only provided in passenger cars of the BMW Group. It calculates continually the wear of brake linings and displays to the driver the kilometre availability, as part of the Conditioned Based Service. The task assignment consists in the analysis and improvement of the current brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> monitoring function that is used by BMW. First of all, the preliminary required task would be to understand and analyse the current status of the brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> calculation. For that purpose, {{it will be necessary to}} build up a simulation environment, in which the calculation algorithm could be tested. The virtual calculation results can be compared with available experimental data from brake test bench and vehicle tests. Furthermore, in order to understand wear process, a study of all possible influence variables on the brake <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> will be required. The conclusion of this analysis will serve to design an experimental planning to test brake linings. Then, a method has to be developed to find out possible empirical equations of wear that fit the characteristic diagram obtained on the brake test bench. Finally, the models obtained must be tested and validated with real test bench wear measurements...|$|R
