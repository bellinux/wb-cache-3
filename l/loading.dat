25|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>loads</b> that {{structure}} engineering must encounter in the design. First type of <b>load</b> is called Dead <b>loads</b> that consist of the weights of the various structural members and the weights of any objects that are permanently attached to the structure. For example, columns, beams, girders, the floor slab, roofing, walls, windows, plumbing, electrical fixtures, and other miscellaneous attachments. Second type of <b>load</b> is Live <b>Loads</b> which vary in their magnitude and location. There are many different types of live <b>loads</b> like building <b>loads,</b> highway bridge <b>Loads,</b> railroad bridge <b>Loads,</b> impact <b>loads,</b> wind <b>loads,</b> snow <b>loads,</b> earthquake <b>loads,</b> and other natural <b>loads.</b>|$|R

40|$|A Day of Launch flight <b>loads</b> {{assessment}} {{technique that}} determines running <b>loads</b> calculated from flexible body coupled <b>loads</b> {{was developed for}} the Ares I-X Flight Test Vehicle. The technique was developed to quantify DOL flight <b>loads</b> in terms of structural <b>load</b> components rather than the typically used q-alpha metric to provide more insight into the DOL <b>loads.</b> In this technique, running <b>loads</b> in the primary structure are determined from the combination of quasi-static aerodynamic <b>loads</b> and dynamic <b>loads.</b> The aerodynamic <b>loads</b> are calculated {{as a function of}} time using trajectory parameters passed from the DOL trajectory simulation and are combined with precalculated dynamic <b>loads</b> using a <b>load</b> combination equation. The potential change in aerodynamic <b>load</b> due to wind variability during the countdown is included in the <b>load</b> combination. In the event of a <b>load</b> limit exceedance, the technique allows the identification of what <b>load</b> component is exceeded, a quantification of how much the <b>load</b> limit is exceeded, and where on the vehicle the exceedance occurs.

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of an impact, {{significant}} acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact <b>loading,</b> are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial <b>loading,</b> usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact <b>loading,</b> the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along the path of a projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E
