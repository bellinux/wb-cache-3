25|$|It is {{possible}} to detect land mines by directing sound waves at the area to be demined, which causes the land mines to vibrate, and then using a laser to search for vibrations on the surface {{by means of the}} Doppler shift - this technique is termed scanning <b>laser</b> <b>doppler</b> vibrometry.

25|$|Instruments {{such as the}} <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> {{velocimeter}} (LDV), and acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) {{have been}} developed to measure velocities in a fluid flow.

2500|$|Other {{techniques}} {{used to measure}} flows are <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> velocimetry [...] and hot-wire anemometry. The main difference between PIV and those techniques is that PIV produces two-dimensional or even three-dimensional vector fields, while the other techniques measure the velocity at a point. During PIV, the particle concentration is such {{that it is possible}} to identify individual particles in an image, but not with certainty to track it between images. When the particle concentration is so low {{that it is possible to}} follow an individual particle it is called Particle tracking velocimetry, while Laser speckle velocimetry is used for cases where the particle concentration is so high that it is difficult to observe individual particles in an image.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> Velocimetry predates PIV as a laser-digital {{analysis}} {{system to}} become widespread {{for research and}} industrial use. Able to obtain all of a fluid's velocity measurements at a specific point, it can be considered the 2-dimensional PIV's immediate predecessor. [...] PIV itself found its roots in Laser speckle velocimetry, a technique that several groups began experimenting with in the late 1970s. In the early 1980s {{it was found that}} it was advantageous to decrease the particle concentration down to levels where individual particles could be observed. At these particle densities it was further noticed that it was easier to study the flows if they were split into many very small 'interrogation' areas, that could be analyzed individually to generate one velocity for each area. The images were usually recorded using analog cameras and needed immense amount of computing power to be analyzed.|$|E
