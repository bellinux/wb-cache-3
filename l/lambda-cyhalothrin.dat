The results in the present study can be applied in the development of management programs targeting S. frugiperda resistance to pyrethroid <b>lambda-cyhalothrin.</b> The integration of Bt cotton concurrent with biological control by the Asopinae P. nigrispinus is important for successfully managing S. frugiperda resistance to <b>lambda-cyhalothrin.</b> 201...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} trials were {{conducted}} during 1994 and 1995 to determine effects of coapplication of pyrethroid insecticides (cypennethrin, <b>lambda-cyhalothrin)</b> with fungicides and a bactericide used for pathogen management for onion thrips control. In {{two out of}} four trials, co-application of insecticides with the chlorothalonil fungicide formulation Bravo 720 reduced control of onion thrips. Control was also reduced in the single trial when the bactericide Kocide DF was applied with <b>lambda-cyhalothrin.</b> Other fungicide formulations did not show reduction of onion thrips control in co-application with an insecticide, and the fungicides did not have direct effects on onion thrips populations.

40|$|In the {{laboratory}} and in cages in the greenhouse, we evaluated the toxicity of two insecticides (<b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> and spinosad) on the parasitoid, Diadegma insulare (Cresson), and the predator, Coleomegilla maculate (DeGeer), both natural enemies of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.). <b>Lambda-cyhalothrin</b> was very toxic to both natural enemies. Spinosad was less toxic to C. maculata adults and larvae, and slightly toxic to D. insulare. Both natural enemies suppressed P. xylostella populations in cages with 80 % spinosad-treated and 20 % nontreated plants; such suppression was not seen when <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> was used. Using broccoli, Brassica oleracea L. variety italica, a common host for P. xylostella, we also studied direct and indirect effects of both natural enemies in the presence and absence of the two insecticides and to different P. xylostella genotypes: resistant to the insecticide, susceptible, or heterozygous. Neither natural enemy could distinguish host genotype if P. xylostella were feeding on nontreated plants. They could also not distinguish between larvae feeding on spinosad-treated plants and nontreated plants, but D. insulare could distinguish between larvae feeding on <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> treated and nontreated plants. Our studies suggest that <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> has direct toxicity to these two natural enemies, can affect their host foraging and acceptance of P. xylostella and consequently would not be compatible in conserving these natural enemies in a program for suppression of P. xylostella. In contrast, our studies suggest that treatment with spinosad has much less effect on these natural enemies and {{would allow them to}} help suppress populations of P. xylostella. These findings are discussed in relation to the evolution of insecticide resistance and suppression of the pest population...|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} window {{screens and}} eave baffles (WSEBs), which enable mosquitoes to enter but not exit houses, {{as an alternative}} to indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria vector control. WSEBs treated with water, the pyrethroid <b>lambda-cyhalothrin,</b> or the organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl, with and without a binding agent for increasing insecticide persistence on netting, were compared with IRS in experimental huts. Compared with IRS containing the same insecticide, WSEBs killed similar proportions of Anopheles funestus mosquitoes that were resistant to pyrethroids, carbamates and organochlorines and greater proportions of pyrethroid-resistant, early exiting An. arabiensis mosquitoes. WSEBs with pirimiphos-methyl killed greater proportions of both vectors than <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> or <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> plus pirimiphos-methyl and were equally efficacious when combined with binding agent. WSEBs required far less insecticide than IRS, and binding agents might enhance durability. WSEBs might enable affordable deployment of insecticide combinations to mitigate against physiologic insecticide resistance and improve control of behaviorally resistant, early exiting vectors. 28418299 PMC 540305...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Iran has {{recently}} initiated a malaria elimination program {{with emphasis on}} vector control strategies which are heavily reliant on indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets. Insecticide resistance seriously threatens the efficacy of vector control strategies. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the insecticide susceptibility of Anopheles stephensi to DDT and current insecticides in Jask county as an active malaria focus in southeastern Iran. Methods In this study, the anopheline larvae were collected from different aquatic habitats in Jask county and transported to insectarium, fed with sugar and then 3 -day-old adults were used for susceptibility tests. WHO insecticide susceptibility tests were performed with DDT (4  %), malathion (5  %), <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> (0. 05  %), deltamethrin (0. 05  %) and permethrin (0. 75  %). Results The field strain of An. stephensi was found resistant to DDT and <b>lambda-cyhalothrin.</b> The LT 50 values for DDT and <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> in this species were 130. 25, and 37. 71  min, respectively. Moreover, An. stephensi was completely susceptible to malathion and permethrin and tolerant to deltamethrin. Conclusion The present study results confirm the resistance of the major malaria vector, An. stephensi, to DDT and <b>lambda-cyhalothrin,</b> and tolerance to deltamethrin, which could gradually increase and spread into other malaria endemic areas. Thus, {{there is a need for}} regular monitoring of insecticide resistance in order to select suitable insecticides for vector control interventions towards malaria elimination...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Drainage ditches are {{indispensable}} {{components of}} the agricultural production landscape. A benefit of these ditches is contaminant mitigation of agricultural storm runoff. This study determined bifenthrin and <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> (two pyrethroid insecticides) partitioning and retention in ditch water, sediment, and plant material as well as estimated necessary ditch length required for effective mitigation. A controlled-release runoff simulation was conducted on a 650 -m vegetated drainage ditch in the Mississippi Delta, USA. Bifenthrin and <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> were released into the ditch in a water–sediment slurry. Samples of water, sediment, and plants were collected and analyzed for pyrethroid concentrations. Three hours following runoff initiation, inlet bifenthrin and <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> water concentrations ranged from 666 and 374 mg/L, respectively, to 7. 24 and 5. 23 mg/L at 200 m downstream. No chemical residues were detected at the 400 -m sampling site. A similar trend was observed throughout the first 7 d of the study where water concentrations were elevated at {{the front end of}} the ditch (0 – 25 m) and greatly reduced by the 400 -m sampling site. Regression formulas predicted that bifenthrin and <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> concentrations in ditch water were reduced to 0. 1 % of the initial value within 280 m. Mass balance calculations determined that ditch plants were the major sink and/or sorption site responsible for the rapid aqueous pyrethroid dissipation. By incorporating vegetated drainage ditches into a watershed man...|$|E
40|$|By {{applying}} insecticides {{at lower}} rates of active ingredients per unit area, survival rates of the pests' natural enemies can be enhanced, whereas pest mortality can remain high. The effects of reduced application rates of the insecticides <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> and dimethoate on the mortality of bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphon padi (L.), and lacewing Micromus tasmaniae Walker were determined in the laboratory and field. Cholinesterase (ChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities in survivors provided a measure of sublethal effects and general fitness. In the laboratory, lacewings were less sensitive than aphids to both insecticides, and dimethoate was more toxic than <b>lambda-cyhalothrin.</b> However, these results could not be recreated in the field, {{in part due to}} very low recapture rates. In summary, <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> seemed to have no effect on aphids, but it was toxic to lacewings. Dimethoate was far less toxic in the field, but aphids were still more sensitive than were lacewings. Cholinesterase activity was reduced by dimethoate exposure in the laboratory in both species, but there were species-specific differences. Dimethoate and <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> had no effects on GST activity in either species. The high mortality rate for lacewings and aphids exposed to dimethoate in the field suggests that the application rate could be reduced to as low as 10 % of that recommended by manufacturers, and this should still be highly efficacious against aphids, while protecting the predatory lacewing. Measurement of enzyme activity could provide a useful indicator of "fitness" of survivors...|$|E
40|$|The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), a major pest of cruciferous crops {{throughout}} the world, has demonstrated {{an ability to}} develop resistance to many different classes of insecticides, including proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis that are expressed in plants (Bt plants). The ovipositional preferences and larval survival of strains (resistant strain, RR; heterozygous strain, RS; susceptible strain, SS) of P. xylostella to Cry 1 Ac-expressing broccoli or broccoli plants treated with <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> or spinosad were studied under greenhouse condition. Numbers of eggs per plant did not differ between Bt broccoli and non-Bt broccoli for Bt-RR, Bt-RS, and Bt-SS adults. Ovipositing adults (spinosad-RR, spinosad-RS, and spinosad-SS) also could not discriminate between spinosad-treated and untreated plants, and oviposition did not increase over the 13 d after spinosad treatment. For broccoli treated with <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> at the diagnostic dose of 20 ppm, all three insect strains (lc-RR, lc-RS, and lc-SS) had constant oviposition over time based on linear regressions. At the field dose of 80 ppm, the lc-RR strain had constant oviposition over time. The lc-SS susceptible strain had increasing oviposition over time, but the oviposition pattern on the nonsprayed broccoli also increased over time. Susceptible females layed fewer eggs on plants sprayed with <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> than on unsprayed plants. A residue-persistence test showed that spinosad and <b>lambda-cyhalothrin</b> could effectively control SS P. xylostella larvae for 7 - 9 d after application.
