25|$|An {{object in}} motion that {{moves out of}} its natural arc for no {{apparent}} reason will appear erratic rather than fluid. For example, when animating a pointing finger, the animator should be certain that in all drawings in between the two extreme poses, the fingertip follows a logical arc from one extreme to the next. Traditional animators tend to draw the arc in <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> paper for reference, to be erased later.|$|E

25|$|The weapons {{used are}} also in debate. As {{mentioned}} above, some claim Gonnosuke was using a long staff (bo) reinforced with metal rings. Other versions claim he used an exceptionally long wooden sword which was above {{the average length of}} a Japanese sword over four shaku 1 long, (roughly 121cm or 48 inches), instead of the normal length bokuto of around 2.45 Shaku (roughly 74cm or 29 inches). Musashi's weapon of choice is also debated. One version say he was armed with only a half-finished bokuto, which Musashi was actually still carving as the duel began, and used it to overwhelm Gonnosuke without ever using the X-shaped block, instead hitting him <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehead as to demonstrate his superior stance in battle and emphasizing proper distance to an opponent, or Maai.|$|E
2500|$|The woman rests {{her right}} cheek <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{back of her}} right hand and narrows her eyes in thought.

2500|$|Pinot Meunier can be {{identified}} by ampelographers by its indented leaves that appear downy white, like flour has been dusted liberally on the underside, and <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper side, of the leaf. The name [...] "Meunier" [...] comes from the French word for miller {{with many of the}} grapevine's synonyms (see below) also hearkening to this association-such as [...] "Dusty Miller" [...] which is used in England, [...] "Farineaux" [...] and [...] "Noirin Enfariné" [...] used in France as well as [...] "Müllerrebe" [...] and [...] "Müller-Traube" [...] used in Germany. This characteristic derives from large numbers of fine white hairs on the leaves. However, some clones of Pinot Meunier {{have been found to be}} completely hairless—a chimeric mutation, in fact—which has led ampelographers to more closely draw a link between Meunier and Pinot noir.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pamphlet}} [...] "Why Freegan?"—written {{by former}} Against Me! drummer Warren Oakes in Gainesville, Florida in 1999—defines freeganism as [...] "an anti-consumeristic ethic about eating" [...] {{and goes on}} to describe practices including dumpster diving, plate scraping, wild foraging, gardening, theft, employee scams, and barter as alternatives to paying for food. The pamphlet also expanded the activities associated with [...] "freeganism" [...] with a long section on non-alimentary practices, including conserving water, pre-cycling, reusing goods, and using solar energy. More than just a set of behaviors, though, the pamphlet presents freeganism as having an overarching political goal: an [...] "ultimate boycott" [...] of [...] "all the corporations, all the stores, all the pesticides, all the land and resources wasted, the capitalist system, the all-oppressive dollar, the wage slavery, the whole burrito" [...] in favor of [...] "liv a full satisfying life...while treading <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ECoG {{recording}} {{is performed}} from electrodes {{placed on the}} exposed cortex. [...] In order to access the cortex, a surgeon must first perform a craniotomy, removing {{a part of the}} skull to expose the brain surface. [...] This procedure may be performed either under general anesthesia or under local anesthesia if patient interaction is required for functional cortical mapping. [...] Electrodes are then surgically implanted {{on the surface of the}} cortex, with placement guided by the results of preoperative EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). [...] Electrodes may either be placed outside the dura mater (epidural) or under the dura mater (subdural). [...] ECoG electrode arrays typically consist of sixteen sterile, disposable stainless steel, carbon tip, platinum, Platinum-iridium alloy or gold ball electrodes, each mounted on a ball and socket joint for ease in positioning. [...] These electrodes are attached to an overlying frame in a “crown” or “halo” configuration. Subdural strip and grid electrodes are also widely used in various dimensions, having anywhere from 4 to 256 electrode contacts. [...] The grids are transparent, flexible, and numbered at each electrode contact. [...] Standard spacing between grid electrodes is 1cm; individual electrodes are typically 5mm in diameter. [...] The electrodes sit <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cortical surface, and are designed with enough flexibility to ensure that normal movements of the brain do not cause injury. [...] A key advantage of strip and grid electrode arrays is that they may be slid underneath the dura mater into cortical regions not exposed by the craniotomy. [...] Strip electrodes and crown arrays may be used in any combination desired. [...] Depth electrodes may also be used to record activity from deeper structures such as the hippocampus.|$|E
