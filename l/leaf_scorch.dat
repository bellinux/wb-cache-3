Os experimentos foram conduzidos em telados, com trigo cultivado em vasos. A aclimatação e a incidência de geada foram simuladas em câmaras de crescimento. Os fatores abióticos avaliados foram: regimes de aclimatação (com e sem); gradiente de temperatura (2, - 2, - 4 e - 7 °C); e variação de disponibilidade hídrica no solo, antes da geada (9, 6, 3 e 1 dia sem irrigação). Todos os fatores foram avaliados no afilhamento, alongamento e espigamento das cultivares: BR- 18 Terena, mais tolerante à geada; e BRS 194, menos tolerante. As variáveis avaliadas foram: grau de queima de folhas, sete dias após a geada; massa de matéria seca total; e massa de grãos. A aclimatação do trigo, antes da geada, diminuiu os danos provocados antes do espigamento, e resultou em menor queima de folhas e maior rendimento de grãos. A temperatura de - 7 °C, no espigamento, resultou em falha na produção de grãos de ambas as cultivares; e os prejuízos com geada foram menores nas plantas com nove dias sem irrigação.

The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the influence of acclimatization, frost intensity and soil water availability on damage caused by frost on wheat. The experiments were carried out in screen house conditions. The wheat plants were grown in pots. The acclimatization and frost incidence were simulated in a growth chamber. The abiotic factors evaluated were: acclimatization regimes (with and without); temperature gradient (2, - 2, - 4 and - 7 °C) and variation of soil water availability prior to frost incidence (9, 6, 3 and 1 day without irrigation). All factors were evaluated at tillering, stem elongation and heading stage on wheat cultivars BR- 18 Terena, more tolerant to frost, and BRS 194, less tolerant. The response variables were: degree of <b>leaf</b> <b>scorching</b> symptoms at 7 days after frost; total dry weight; and grain weight. The acclimatization, before frost, decreased the damage caused on wheat heading stage, which resulted in less <b>leaf</b> <b>scorching</b> symptoms and higher grain yield.

Growth conditions in the greenhouse were: temperature: min/max 20 / 40 °C and relative humidity: min/max 50 / 95 %.

40|$|We {{postulated}} that a synergistic {{combination of two}} innate immune functions, pathogen surface recognition and lysis, in a protein chimera {{would lead to a}} robust class of engineered antimicrobial therapeutics for protection against pathogens. In support of our hypothesis, we have engineered such a chimera to protect against the Gram-negative Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), which causes diseases in multiple plants of economic importance. Here we report the design and delivery of this chimera to target the Xf subspecies fastidiosa (Xff), which causes Pierce disease in grapevines and poses a great threat to the wine-growing regions of California. One domain of this chimera is an elastase that recognizes and cleaves MopB, a conserved outer membrane protein of Xff. The second domain is a lytic peptide, cecropin B, which targets conserved lipid moieties and creates pores in the Xff outer membrane. A flexible linker joins the recognition and lysis domains, thereby ensuring correct folding of the individual domains and synergistic combination of their functions. The chimera transgene is fused with an amino-terminal signal sequence to facilitate delivery of the chimera to the plant xylem, the site of Xff colonization. We demonstrate that the protein chimera expressed in the xylem is able to directly target Xff, suppress its growth, and significantly decrease the <b>leaf</b> <b>scorching</b> and xylem clogging commonly associated with Pierce disease in grapevines. We believe that similar strategies involving protein chimeras can be developed to protect against many diseases caused by human and plant pathogens...|$|R
30|$|Starting from 2010, on {{the west}} coast of Salento area (Lecce province, {{southern}} Italy), symptoms of the so-called CoDiRO “Olive Quick Decline Syndrome” were observed (i.e., <b>leaf</b> <b>scorching,</b> twig and branch wilting, tree die-back) [1]. Subsequently, the syndrome spread over many hectares of olive trees causing dramatic effects and currently it represents a serious local emergence [2]. Xylella fastidiosa is a Gram-negative bacterium member of the Xanthomonadaceae (γ-proteobacteria) which colonizes the xylem of host plants and the foreguts of insect vectors [3]. This plant pathogen was recently found associated with the CoDiRO [4, 5]. X. fastidiosa infects a wide range of host plants, such as grapevine, almond, blueberry, cherry, peach, coffee, and citrus trees, causing great economic losses mainly in North, Central and South America [6]. The pathogen is also known to infect landscape and ornamental trees such as oak, maple, and oleander [4]. The introduction of latently infected ornamental plants from Central America was reported as the venue for the subsequent spread of the pathogen in Salento [7]. The main symptoms associated with infections of X. fastidiosa are the marginal and or apical <b>leaf</b> <b>scorching,</b> twig and branch die-back and plant death [3]. The symptoms have been attributed to prolonged water stress caused by bacterium growth and biofilm formation in the xylem vessels [8]. The negative socioeconomic impact of X. fastidiosa infection in North and South America (i.e., USA and Brazil) and now in Italy is well known. In the latter case, the negative impact is due not only to relevant economic losses, but also to the dramatic effect on the typical cultural heritage represented by olive trees. Apulian 1000 -year-old olive trees are protected as local patrimony and considered a symbol of the local identity, also for their massive presence in the territory. Moreover, six over a number of 60  mln of olive trees were classified as monumental, as resulted from the first olive tree census in the whole Apulia region [9]. For these reasons, when implementing a specific control method in order to contain the further disease spread, it is important to study also its social and cultural acceptability as well as its socioeconomic impact [10]. Therefore, the need to adopt specific agronomic and phytosanitary measures to improve the vegetative state of the plants has been recently raised. For these reasons, the study of the CoDiRO effects on symptomatic olive trees by using the NMR-based metabolomics approach was carried out. In this study, we analyzed the effects of a CE approved fertilizer, known as DENTAMET® (i.e., a mixture of zinc and copper complex with hydracids of citric acid [11]) sprayed on symptomatic olive trees located in Salento. This fertilizer can be considered as a product with a dual action formulation by which the correction of Zn and Cu deficiencies occurs very quickly, as well as a resistance is induced by the cyclic peptide resembling the chemical structure of several antimicrobial substances released from the plant in response to different stresses. Thanks to the low environmental impact and few restrictions on its use, DENTAMET® is allowed for organic farming and commercialized in more than 30 countries in the world [11].|$|R
40|$|A {{strain of}} Xylella fastidiosa is ravaging the olive trees of Southern Apulia, Italy (Saponari et al., 2013). The {{bacterium}} causes the Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS), a disease showing symptoms of apical and marginal <b>leaf</b> <b>scorching,</b> extensive branch and twig dieback {{and death of}} the trees (Martelli et al., 2016). Transmission tests demonstrated that the Xylella fastidiosa-olive infecting strain is transmitted by the xylem-feeding meadow froghopper Philaenus spumarius (Saponari et al., 2014) whereas genome studies proved that {{it belongs to the}} subspecies pauca, sequence type 53 (Giampetruzzi et al., 2015). Field observations allowed to identify a possible source of resistance in the olive cv Leccino, which reacts with milder symptoms, and hosts a much lower bacterial concentration of bacterial cells than the locally grown cv Ogliarola salentina. A global transcriptome profiling revealed that a higher number of genes is altered upon Xylella fastidiosa infection in the susceptible cv Ogliarola salentina compared to the resistant cv Leccino, with respect to the healthy plants of the same cultivars (Giampetruzzi et al., 2016). Gene expression analysis showed that both cultivars perceive the presence of the bacterium with the involvement of membrane signaling receptors, whose characterization is ongoing. Analysis of altered genes of the susceptible cv Ogliarola salentina (expansin, early-late inducible proteins, late embryogenesis abundant proteins and involvement of the abscissic acid pathway) indicated that plants are subjected to a intense water stress.

Expanding leaves typically showed net losses of CO 2 to the atmosphere in both burned and unburned trees, even under saturating irradiance.

This decline was thought to have resulted from reduced availability of C substrate for respiration, due to reduced canopy photosynthesis caused by <b>leaf</b> <b>scorching,</b> and to priority allocation of fixed C towards reconstruction of a new canopy. At the ecosystem scale, we estimated the annual above-ground woody-tissue CO 2 efflux to be 275 g C m(- 2) ground area year(- 1) in a non-fire year, or approximately 13 % of the annual gross primary production. We contrasted the canopy physiology of two co-dominant overstory tree species, one of which has a smooth bark on its branches capable of photosynthetic re-fixation (Eucalyptus miniata), and the other of which has a thick, rough bark incapable of re-fixation (Eucalyptus tetrodonta). Eucalyptus miniata supported a larger branch sapwood cross-sectional area in the crown per unit subtending leaf area, and had higher leaf stomatal conductance and photosynthesis than E. tetrodonta. Re-fixation by photosynthetic bark reduces the C cost of delivering water to evaporative sites in leaves, because it reduces the net C cost of constructing and maintaining sapwood. We suggest that re-fixation allowed leaves of E. miniata to photosynthesize at higher rates than those of E. tetrodonta, while the two invested similar amounts of C in the maintenance of branch sapwood...|$|R
