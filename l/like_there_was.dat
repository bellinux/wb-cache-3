China has been the leader of Asia's space race {{since the beginning of the}} 21st century. The first Chinese manned spaceflight, in 2003, marked the beginning of a space race in the region. At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events <b>like</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.|$|E

500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1958, Bánáthy {{recruited}} two patrols of boys to take part. [...] Chiorini was recruited to serve as senior patrol leader.

At the time, Scouting was not necessarily a boy-led program. I remember it was very clear in Béla’s mind what a boy-led Scouting program looked <b>like.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> no question about who was in charge in White Stag. The boys were." [...] Fran Peterson, a local Scouter who served on the National Engineering Service for the Boy Scouts of America, along with St. Clair, Sujan, and Tripp, helped Bánáthy develop the White Stag program.

It seems <b>like</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head.

[...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children.

500|$|Ball {{was partly}} {{inspired}} by two encounters {{he had in}} the early 1990s. In about 1991–92, Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center. He watched the bag for 10 minutes, saying later that it provoked an [...] "unexpected emotional response". In 1992, Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial. Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal, he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized. He said he [...] "felt <b>like</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a real story underneath [...] more fascinating and way more tragic" [...] than the story presented to the public, and attempted to turn the idea into a play. Ball produced around 40 pages, but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film. He felt that because of the visual themes, and because each character's story was [...] "intensely personal", it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version, but Carolyn did not feature strongly; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles.|$|E

[...] The first part was slower, [...] "more groove-oriented", while the second was a spirited rocker. [...] To give the second part more of a live sound, Douglas overdubbed crowd noise from The Concert for Bangladesh, the 1971 benefit organized by George Harrison. [...] Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, who worked with Lou Reed and Alice Cooper, were brought in to record the guitar parts. [...] According to Hunter, [...] "We [...] wanted to keep the solos equal so we'd sit down... and go through the material so it was totally even... We didn't want it to look <b>like</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a rhythm guitar player and a lead guitar player, because that's what we both did". [...] Hunter later elaborated: ...|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was <b>like</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E

[...] Jill Mader of Inside Pulse also gave the episode a {{more positive}} review, praising [...] "that the episode ended with a really sweet moment for Howard as, after all, he is a character who doesn't often get to be sweet" [...] and claimed that it was [...] "definitely about people changing and moving forward, and The Big Bang Theory {{has done a great}} job of emotionally maturing many of their characters over the past couple seasons". Despite this, she said that [...] "the episode wasn't as [...] as [...] hoped it would be" [...] and [...] "felt <b>like</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more potential in Howard's bachelor party than just revealing some unflattering secrets to Bernadette." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode as 56 out of 100, describing Howard's [...] "little speech" [...] as [...] "very well written and performed". However, he considered most of the comedy [...] "generic", especially in regards to the jokes about Jewish stereotypes and Penny's dismissal of Leonard. Overall, Pierson said it [...] "wasn't the strongest episode of comedy" [...] and [...] "wasn't a particularly interesting episode until the end".|$|E
500|$|Secrets reveal {{themselves}} steadily {{throughout the}} episode. Xander fears that his future marriage will turn {{him into an}} argumentative drunk like his father. He attempts to avoid his fears through the song [...] "I'll Never Tell", singing [...] "'coz there's nothing to tell", after summoning Sweet to Sunnydale to show him that he and Anya will be happy. Amid the various annoyances Xander and Anya express through this song, some verses are clear-sighted observations of behavior, such as Anya's accusation that Xander—once in love with Buffy—uses Buffy as a mother figure to hide behind. Anya also avoids the truth by burying herself in wedding plans without thinking critically about what being married will entail; instead she considers Xander an accessory to her desired lifestyle. Of all the characters, Anya is the most preoccupied with the style of singing and songs, demanding to know if Spike sang [...] "a breakaway pop hit, or a book number", and asking Dawn if the pterodactyl she facetiously says {{she gave birth to}} also broke into song. Anya and Xander's duet is the only song in the episode to address the audience directly. During the long single-shot scene when she and Xander talk over each other insisting to Giles that evil must be at play, Anya refers to the audience, saying [...] "It was like we were being watched... <b>Like</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a wall missing ... in our apartment... Like there were only three walls and not a fourth wall." [...] Albright asserts that Anya's constant preoccupation with her and others' performances indicates that she has serious doubts about her future supporting role as Xander's wife.|$|E

On November 8, 2005, Horton was placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury. He was activated on December 1 and scored in his first game back against the Washington Capitals to help the Panthers win 32. Horton added 2 goals against the Chicago Blackhawks in the Panthers' next game to bring his season total to 10 in 17 games. Against the Nashville Predators on December 13, Horton recorded his first career hat trick and stated after the game that, [...] "It's a pretty nice feeling. I felt <b>like</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no one on me. I just tried to get it to the net and it went in every time." [...] Despite missing 10 games to injury, Horton was tied with teammate Olli Jokinen for the team lead in goals with 16 after 38 games. Against Washington on January 9, Horton and Joe Nieuwendyk scored a goal in the shootout to help the Panthers win 43. Two days after his shootout goal, Horton was promoted to the Panthers' first line. Despite his promotion to the first line, Horton's name was mentioned in a potential trade with the Vancouver Canucks; however, nothing materialized. [...] In a 62 win over the Ottawa Senators, Horton scored 2 goals including one on a rebound, after which he said, [...] "It just popped right out to me. It was a long time coming for goals for me. I got lucky tonight and hopefully they keep going in." [...] In March, Horton began playing in penalty kill situations for the first time in his career. Also against the Lightning, Horton scored the Panthers' only goal with his 27th goal of the season. Horton completed the season playing 71 games, scoring 28 goals and adding 19 assists.|$|E
