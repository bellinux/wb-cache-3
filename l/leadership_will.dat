40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{relationship}} between transactional <b>leadership</b> and <b>willing</b> organizational commitment in two significantly different organizations (one from the healthcare sector and one from manufacturing). Design/methodology/approach - Partial Least Squares was used to develop a mediation model explaining the underlying mechanism between contingent reward <b>leadership</b> and <b>willing</b> organizational commitment. Findings - The data indicates that, as expected, the relationship between transactional <b>leadership</b> and <b>willing</b> commitment in the manufacturing organization was mediated by both competence and relatedness; however, in the healthcare organization, to the surprise, this relationship was mediated by competence only. Practical implications - The authors develop a model that could help organizational managers and consultants improve the productivity and effectiveness of their work by taking the findings into account. Originality/value - Previous research has focused on the effectiveness of transformational research: this paper is one of the first to explore the relationship between transactional <b>leadership</b> and <b>willing</b> organizational commitment, taking into account the mediation effect of psychological need satisfaction...|$|R

[...] Rasmussen said that by taking the lead in security on Tuesday, Afghan forces were completing a five-stage transition process that began in March 2011. [...] "They are doing so with remarkable resolve," [...] he said.

He is in favour of assimilating all that is good in Western culture, but by no means a slavish admirer of our ways.|$|E
