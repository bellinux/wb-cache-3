In this context, we found that the banking sector is still subject to the trends of government authorities to justify this relationship by looking forward to achieving economic development, but on the other side this restricts the activity of banks in terms of banking intermediation. Banking intermediation raises several interrelated issues for banks, the central bank and the Treasury. It is linked to the gross domestic product, money supply and bank liquidity, etc. These elements will be examined in this article to <b>learn</b> the <b>elements</b> of <b>bank</b> intermediation in the Algerian banking system and ways of strengthening it...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Software Organization Platform (SOP) {{intends to}} support {{specific}} software engineering {{activities such as}} experience management, requirements engineering, or project management. Wiki pages can be easily used by a transformation engine to produce so-called <b>learning</b> <b>elements.</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>elements</b> are {{the building blocks of}} adaptive learning spaces, which enhance experience application and understanding in software engineering. This paper shows how learning content is collaboratively authored in the MediaWiki-based SOP in order to generate adaptive learning spaces. The authoring tool, which is embedded as an extension in SOP itself, helps the authors to annotate the <b>learning</b> <b>elements</b> with keywords from the SWEBOK ontology (available in OWL). In addition, a vocabulary manager supports the development of a pre-defined metadata set for annotating <b>learning</b> <b>elements.</b> The authoring environment is a promising technology for solving the problem of “closed content corpus ” and uses the advantages of ontologies and semantic relationships in Wikis. ...|$|R

40|$|Recently the use {{of neural}} {{networks}} as the inverse-kinematics model of a robot arm has been proposed in learning control of the robot arm. The forward and inverse modeling, the feedback error leaning schema and the goal directed model inversion were proposed to extend the acquisition of the inverse model for the systems with many-to-one input-output correspondence. However, these methods can be used only for on-line learning. The learning of neural networks usually requires many iterations of robot arm movement and of its position measurement. In {{order to reduce the}} number of movements of the robot arm, the hybrid system which consists of a <b>learning</b> <b>element</b> and an extended feedback controller are proposed. The <b>learning</b> <b>element</b> approximates the inverse kinematics model of the robot arm. By using the extended feedback controller, the high precision solutions of the inverse kinematics problems are obtained so that these solutions can be used for the teaching signal of the <b>learning</b> <b>element.</b> After the acquisition of these solutions, the off-line learning of the <b>learning</b> <b>element</b> is conducted. The use of forward model of the robot arm is also proposed. The numerical simulations show the good performance of the proposed system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between assessment for <b>learning</b> <b>elements</b> and student <b>learning</b> experiences in a design studio module. Our {{focus is on the}} Global Studio (Bohemia & Harman, 2008 forthcoming), a design module recently conducted at Northumbria University. Using a case study methodology with the aim of compiling rich, practice-based knowledges (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005; Gherardi, 2006), we draw on data gathered throughout the development and delivery of a particular design studio module in order to undertake our analysis. In {{the first part of the}} paper we briefly describe the Global Studio with a focus on the overall aims and the structure of the module. One aim of the Global Studio was the development of distance communication skills, thereby preparing students for work in geographically distributed workgroups. Thus, an important aspect of the course was the incorporation of the element of distance between geographically distributed student design teams. We also outline the assessment for <b>learning</b> <b>elements</b> that we use in our analysis. These include an emphasis on authentic assessment tasks, the extensive use of ‘low stakes’ confidence building opportunities, the provision of a learning environment that is rich in both formal and informal feedback and the development of students’ abilities to evaluate their own progress (McDowell et al., 2006; Sambell, Gibson, & Montgomery, 2007). Using the above assessment for learning framework we map various assessment for <b>learning</b> <b>elements</b> used in the Global Studio. We suggest in the first section of the paper that a number of assessment for <b>learning</b> <b>elements</b> were implicitly embedded in the structure and delivery of this particular module. In the second part of the paper we explore {{the relationships between}} assessment for <b>learning</b> <b>elements</b> (implicitly) used in the module and student learning experiences. Drawing on student evaluation data, both qualitative and quantitative, collected throughout the module we examine the learning experiences of students undertaking the module. Our focus here is on what students considered useful in the module in terms of learning and the links with assessment for <b>learning</b> <b>elements.</b> This analysis contributes to the collection of ‘rich’ case study material on assessment for learning in Higher Education with a focus on the subject area of design. We conclude that the assessment for <b>learning</b> <b>elements</b> used in the analysis provided a useful frame for examining student learning experiences in this particular design studio module. Therefore, we suggest that assessment for learning may provide a useful language for developing ongoing discussion and research in relation to teaching and learning in the subject area of design. For example, the following research questions might be explored: does the design studio, in general, incorporate assessment for <b>learning</b> <b>elements?</b> And if so, how are these contributing to enhanced student learning experiences...|$|R

It questions whether the primary remit {{of higher education}} should be the development of vocational skills for the workplace. It investigates: firstly, the perceived benefits to individuals undertaking a Foundation Degree in terms of developing appropriate employment related skills; secondly, whether the compulsory work based/related <b>learning</b> <b>element,</b> seen as the cornerstone of Foundation Degrees, provides students with the relevant skills for the workplace; thirdly, {{the assumption that the}} government's multiple-agendas of widening participation in education, as a means to improve social inclusion; upskilling the workforce; working collaboratively with employers and further education colleges, can be met through provision of shortened higher education degree programmes. Results from three research studies, indicate that students felt that undertaking a Foundation Degree would improve employment prospects; improve employment promotion prospects and develop employment skills. Students also felt the Foundation Degree prepared them for the third year of an honours degree programme. However, findings relating to whether the compulsory work-based <b>learning</b> <b>element</b> of the Foundation Degree provided students with the relevant skills for the workplace were inconclusive. The studies also found that, despite its compulsory nature, not all of the Foundation Degrees from which respondents were surveyed had a work-based <b>learning</b> <b>element</b> as part of the programme. The implications of this are that the work-based <b>learning</b> <b>element</b> is not being used to promote employer engagement in the manner that the government intended. The research also revealed that employers were not engaging in formal assessment of the Foundation Degree programme, neither were they providing mentoring for employees undertaking this form of study. This represented a missed opportunity for true engagement with employers in a manner that could help to bridge the divide between academic qualification and vocational relevance.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the use of}} an anticipatory <b>learning</b> <b>element</b> that ranks novel state-action pairs in reinforcement learning agents, replacing the use of uniformly optimistic initial values for exploration. We argue that reinforcement learning functions as a search process for situated agents, and that anticipatory learning can be viewed in this context as the process of learning a heuristic that guides search behavior. The discussion is grounded with some gridworld experiments that demonstrate that a simple <b>learning</b> <b>element</b> can <b>learn</b> to rank actions sufficiently accurately to rapidly improve search behavior. 1 Introduction Although the concept of anticipatory learning is intuitively appealing, its role and the potential behavioral benefits it brings to situated agents are not yet well understood [2]. In this paper, we consider one particular way in which an anticipatory <b>learning</b> <b>element</b> can provide useful behavioral benefits- that of learning to rank novel state-action pairs in reinforcement learning agents. Reinforcement learning provides an intuitively appealing agent learning model because it is well suited to the problems that situated agents face [10], and because it provides a principled way to build agents motivated by a set of internal drives. Unfortunately, the use of such drives inevitably results in situations where reward is delayed because it results from a long sequence of unrewarded actions. In such cases, the agent often spends a significant amount of time initially searching for any solution at all, since the impoverished nature of the reward signal is not sufficient to quickly guide it to a solution...|$|R
