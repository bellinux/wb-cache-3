The new {{development of technologies}} based on luminescence requires the materials to have high luminescence efficiency and mechanical strength. In this paper, we report the fabrication of <b>luminescent</b> <b>materials</b> possessing high mechanical strength by nanofabrication with polyvinyl alcohol used as a stabilizer or coupling agent. X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission microscope observations reveal that the nanocomposite sample contains ZnS and ZnO nanoparticles as well as kozoite and sodium nitrate. The mechanical strength and hardness of these nanocomposites are reasonably high, higher than polycarbonate and some carbon nanotube reinforced nanocomposites. Strong luminescence is observed in the new nanocomposites and the luminescence intensity does not degrade following up to 30 min of x-ray irradiation. Our results indicate that nanofabrication may provide a good method to improve the mechanical strength of <b>luminescent</b> <b>materials</b> for some applications in which high-strength <b>luminescent</b> <b>materials</b> are needed...|$|R

40|$|Fresnoite {{glass-ceramic}} powders {{were investigated}} as <b>luminescent</b> <b>materials,</b> {{due to their}} pronounced blue luminescence upon UV excitation. However, the luminescence intensity of mechanically milled <b>luminescent</b> <b>materials</b> decreases by reducing the particle size, because of the induced surface damage of the particles. Thus, the preparation of luminescent nano powders still represents a challenge in the processing of <b>luminescent</b> <b>materials.</b> In this work, different milling routes were carried out {{in order to achieve}} a submicron Eu 3 +-doped Fresnoite (Ba 2 TiSi 2 O 8) glass-ceramic powder, keeping sufficient luminescence intensity.

The microstructure of the powders was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The luminescence emission at UV excitation was recorded and related with the microstructure observed.

40|$|Sayong fired clay is a raw {{material}} for Labu Sayong craft making in Malaysia. Labu Sayong is a pottery where it's functioning as a water vessel which the design and form was adapted from the pumpkin. Basically, the term labu is a pumpkin and Sayong is a location in Kuala Kangsar, Malaysia. Hence, it was called Labu Sayong to signify {{the origin of the}} clay and its uniqueness. Originally, Labu Sayong appeared in black with decoration on its surface where the motive of the decoration was inspired from flora and fauna. In present, Labu Sayong is one ofthe most iconic ofthe national heritage. In this thesis, the aim and motivation of the work is to revive the appearance of Labu Sayong by introducing the luminescent effect on its body without compromising its original appearance. Hence, SrAlz 04 :(Eu z+,Dy +) ceramic compound was employed as a candidate for the <b>luminescent</b> <b>materials.</b> In the preliminary investigation, it was concluded to apply the <b>luminescent</b> <b>materials</b> on the decoration of the Labu Sayong.
