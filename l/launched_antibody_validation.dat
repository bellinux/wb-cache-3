40|$|Well {{validated}} antibodies {{are crucial}} to progress {{in a wide range}} of life science disciplines, but validating an antibody is a complex and ongoing process. <b>Antibody</b> <b>validation</b> is often carried out as preliminary work to a larger study so the validation data may go unpublished and needless duplication of efforts can occur. This collection of articles in F 1000 Research provides a home for papers describing <b>antibody</b> <b>validation</b> studies. Our goal is to encourage publishing of all studies, both positive and negative, which increase understanding of how antibodies perform. These could range from large studies with thousands of antibodies to small single figure studies which validate an individual antibody for a specific purpose. Opinion or Correspondence articles considering any aspect of <b>antibody</b> <b>validation</b> are also welcome.

50|$|The biggest {{limitation}} of RPMA, {{as is the}} case for all immunoassays, is its dependence on antibodies for detection of proteins. Currently there is a limited but rapidly growing number of signaling proteins for which antibodies exist that give an analyzable signal. In addition, finding the appropriate antibody could require extensive screening of many antibodies by western blotting prior to beginning RPMA analysis. To overcome this issue, two open resource databases have been created to display western blot results for antibodies that have good binding specificity within the expected range. Furthermore, RPMAs, unlike western blots, do not resolve protein fractions by molecular weight. Thus, it is critical that upfront <b>antibody</b> <b>validation</b> be performed.|$|R
40|$|Antibodies {{are widely}} {{exploited}} as research/diagnostic tools and therapeutics. Despite providing exciting research opportunities, {{the multitude of}} available antibodies also offers a bewildering array of choice. Importantly, not all companies comply with the highest standards, and thus many reagents fail basic validation tests. The responsibility for antibodies being fit for purpose rests, surprisingly, with their user. This paper condenses the extensive experience of the European Monoclonal Antibody Network to help researchers identify antibodies specific for their target antigen. A stepwise strategy is provided for prioritising antibodies and making informed decisions regarding further essential <b>validation</b> requirements. Web-based <b>antibody</b> <b>validation</b> guides provide practical approaches for testing antibody activity and specificity.

These practices affect the quality and utility of any global ChIP experiment. Through our experience in performing ChIP-seq experiments, the ENCODE and modENCODE consortia have developed a set of working standards and guidelines for ChIP experiments that are updated routinely. The current guidelines address <b>antibody</b> <b>validation,</b> experimental replication, sequencing depth, data and metadata reporting, and data quality assessment.

40|$|Four-and-a-half LIM-domain protein 2 (FHL 2) is a {{multifunctional}} scaffolding protein regulating signalling cascades {{and gene}} transcription. It shuttles between focal adhesions and the nucleus where it signals through direct interaction {{with a number}} of proteins including β-catenin. The multiplicity of molecular pathways affected by FHL 2 suggests an important role in several physiological and pathological events. The function of FHL 2 in cancer is particularly intriguing, since it may act as an oncoprotein or as a tumour suppressor in a tissue-dependent fashion. In this review we present the current knowledge on the role of FHL 2 in carcinogenesis, with emphasis on the digestive tract. We discuss the overexpression of FHL 2 in colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancer, the downregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma and the role of FHL 2 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We briefly look at the potential role of FHL 2 in the tumoural microenvironment and discuss how FHL 2 expression and function might influence cancer treatment.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} antibodies and immunofluorescence for subcellular localization of proteins. The key objective {{is the creation of}} an open-source atlas with information on the subcellular location of every human protein. Knowledge of the spatial distribution and the precise location of a protein within a cell is important for its functional characterization, and describing the human proteome in terms of compartment proteomes is important to decipher cellular organization and function.   Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of cultured cells were used for high-resolution detection of proteins on a high-throughput scale. Critical to immunofluorescence results are sample preparation and specific antibodies. Antibody staining of cells requires fixation and permeabilization, both of which can result in loss or redistribution of proteins and masking of epitopes. A high-throughput approach demands a standardized protocol suitable for the majority of proteins across cellular compartments. Paper I presents an evaluation of sample preparation techniques from which such a single fixation and permeabilization protocol was optimized. Paper II {{describes the}} results from applying this protocol to 4000 human proteins in three cell lines of different origin.   Paper III presents a strategy for application-specific <b>antibody</b> <b>validation.</b> <b>Antibodies</b> are the key reagents in immunofluorescence, but all antibodies have potential for off-target binding and should be validated thoroughly.

40|$|Background: Research {{antibodies}} {{are used}} by thousands of scientists working in diverse disciplines, but {{it is common to}} hear concerns about antibody quality. This means that researchers need to carefully choose the antibodies they use to avoid wasting time and money. A well accepted way of selecting a research antibody is to identify one which has been used previously, where the associated data has been peer-reviewed and the results published. Description: CiteAb is a searchable database which ranks antibodies by the number of times they have been cited. This allows researchers to easily find antibodies that have been used in peer-reviewed publications and the accompanying citations are listed, so users can check the data contained within the publications. This makes CiteAb a useful resource for identifying antibodies for experiments and also for finding information to demonstrate <b>antibody</b> <b>validation.</b> The database currently contains 1, 400, 000 antibodies which are from 90 suppliers, including 87 commercial companies and 3 academic resources. Associated with these antibodies are 140, 000 publications which provide 306, 000 antibody citations. In addition to searching, users can also browse through the antibodies and add their own publications to the CiteAb database. Conclusions: CiteAb provides a new way for researchers to find research antibodies that have been used successfully in peer-reviewed publications.

Although ERα phosphorylation correlates with patient outcome, ERβ is similarly phosphorylated but its significance {{in breast cancer}} has not been addressed. We investigated whether ERβ that is phosphorylated at serine 105 (S 105 -ERβ) is expressed in breast cancer and assessed potential clinical implications of this phosphorylation. Following <b>antibody</b> <b>validation,</b> S 105 -ERβ expression was studied in tissue microarrays comprising 108 tamoxifen-resistant and 351 tamoxifen-sensitive cases and analyzed against clinical data. S 105 -ERβ regulation in vitro was assessed by Western blot, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence. Nuclear S 105 -ERβ was observed in breast carcinoma and was associated with better survival (Allred score ≥ 3), even in tamoxifen-resistant cases, and additionally correlated with ERβ 1 and ERβ 2 expression. Distinct S 105 -ERβ nuclear speckles were seen in some higher grade tumors. S 105 -ERβ levels increased in MCF- 7 cells in response to 17 β-estradiol, the ERβ-specific agonist diarylpropionitrile, and the partial ERβ-agonist genistein. S 105 -ERβ nuclear speckles were also seen in MCF- 7 cells and markedly increased in size and number at 24 hours following 17 β-estradiol and, in particular diarylpropionitrile, treatment. These speckles were coexpressed with ERβ 1 and ERβ 2. Presence of S 105 -ERβ in breast cancer and association with improved survival, even in endocrine resistant breast tumors suggest S 105 -ERβ might be a useful additional prognostic marker in this disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to be a useful experimental platform for quantitative protein profiling in a high-throughput format. Target protein detection relies on the readout obtained from a single detection antibody. For this reason, antibody specificity is a key factor for RPPA. RNAi allows the specific knockdown of a target protein in complex samples and was therefore examined for its utility to assess antibody performance for RPPA applications. Results To proof the feasibility of our strategy, two different anti-EGFR antibodies were compared by RPPA. Both detected the knockdown of EGFR but at a different rate. Western blot data were used to identify the most reliable antibody. The RNAi approach was also used to characterize commercial anti-STAT 3 antibodies. Out of ten tested anti-STAT 3 antibodies, four antibodies detected the STAT 3 -knockdown at 80 - 85 %, and the most sensitive anti-STAT 3 antibody was identified by comparing detection limits. Thus, the use of RNAi for RPPA <b>antibody</b> <b>validation</b> was demonstrated to be a stringent approach to identify highly specific and highly sensitive antibodies. Furthermore, the RNAi/RPPA strategy is also useful for the <b>validation</b> of isoform-specific <b>antibodies</b> as shown for the identification of AKT 1 /AKT 2 and CCND 1 /CCND 3 -specific antibodies. Conclusions RNAi is a valuable tool for the identification of very specific and highly sensitive antibodies, and is therefore especially useful for the validation of RPPA-suitable detection antibodies. On the other hand, when a set of well-characterized RPPA-antibodies is available, large-scale RNAi experiments analyzed by RPPA might deliver useful information for network reconstruction. </p...|$|R

IDEXX HerdChek PRRS, a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), has become the industry standard for the detection of antibodies against PRRS virus (PRRSV). The need to accurately determine the PRRSV serostatus of herds and individual animals has prompted the development of several follow-up assay methods. A highly specific and repeatable blocking ELISA (bELISA) was developed on the basis of the use of an expressed PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein as the antigen and a biotinylated monoclonal <b>antibody.</b> <b>Validation</b> of the bELISA used sera from 316 animals experimentally and naturally infected with North American PRRSV and sera from 370 uninfected animals. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the data calculated a diagnostic sensitivity of 97. 8 % and a diagnostic specificity of 100 %. The between-run coefficient of variation of an internal quality control serum was 4. 24 %. The bELISA was able to detect seroconversion as well as the IDEXX ELISA and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay; kappa values were 0. 94 and 0. 96, respectively. A collection of 133 serum samples with unexpected positive IDEXX ELISA results was obtained from 4, 038 diagnostic samples submitted from farms from which PRRS-negative results were expected. The bELISA identified 97 % of the samples as PRRS seronegative, while the IFA identified 100 % as seronegative.

Western blotting on membrane protein isolated from superior temporal cortex of 70 patients with schizophrenia and 87 healthy comparison subjects, genotyped for GRM 3 SNP rs 10234440. ResultsOne (out of six) anti-mGlu 3 antibodies was fully validated, a C-terminal antibody which detected monomeric (~ 100 kDa) and dimeric (~ 200 kDa) mGlu 3. A second, N-terminal, antibody detected the 200 kDa band but also produced non-specific bands. Using the C-terminal antibody for western blotting in human brain, mGlu 3 immunoreactivity was found to decline with age, and was affected by pH and post mortem interval. There were no differences in monomeric or dimeric mGlu 3 immunoreactivity in schizophrenia or in relation to GRM 3 genotype. The antibody was not suitable for immunohistochemistry.

40|$|Abstract This report {{presents}} {{evidence for}} the specificities of select commercially available HOXA 4 antibodies in regards to concerns about the specificity of the HOXA 4 antibody used by Lillvis et al. (Regional expression of HOXA 4 along the aorta and its potential role in human abdominal aortic aneurysms. BMC Physiol 2011, 11 : 9). Using an antibody characterized extensively by us, Lillvis et al. report detecting HOXA 4 at a size of 33 kDa despite our previous reports that HOXA 4 is detected at ~ 37 - 39 kDa and that the ~ 30 - 33 kDa band is non-specific. Using small interfering RNA targeting HOXA 4, forced expression of full-length HOXA 4 and HOXA 4 -positive and -negative ovarian cancer cell lines, we confirm our previous findings that the ~ 30 - 33 kDa band is non-specific and that HOXA 4 is detected at ~ 37 - 39 kDa. Moreover, we demonstrate that HOXA 4 small interfering RNA reduces the ~ 37 - 39 kDa HOXA 4 band, but not the ~ 30 - 33 kDa non-specific band, in a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line used by Lillvis et al. Western blot analysis performed with two additional commercially available HOXA 4 antibodies also detected HOXA 4 at ~ 37 - 39 kDa. Lastly, immunofluorescent staining of a HOXA 4 -negative ovarian cancer cell line with the antibody used by Lillvis et al. yields strong perinuclear staining, similar to that observed by Lillvis et al., which cannot be attributed to HOXA 4. Our results highlight and briefly discuss the importance of careful <b>antibody</b> <b>validation</b> and selection for use in various applications. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background An {{interesting}} {{field of}} research in genomics and proteomics is to compare the overlap between the transcriptome and the proteome. Recently, the tools to analyse gene and protein expression on a whole-genome scale have been improved, including {{the availability of the}} new generation sequencing instruments and high-throughput antibody-based methods to analyze the presence and localization of proteins. In this study, we used massive transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the transcriptome of a human osteosarcoma cell line and compared the expression levels with in situ protein data obtained in-situ from antibody-based immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence microscopy (IF). Results A large-scale analysis based on 2749 genes was performed, corresponding to approximately 13 % of the protein coding genes in the human genome. We found the presence of both RNA and proteins to a large fraction of the analyzed genes with 60 % of the analyzed human genes detected by all three methods. Only 34 genes (1. 2 %) were not detected on the transcriptional or protein level with any method. Our data suggest {{that the majority of the}} human genes are expressed at detectable transcript or protein levels in this cell line. Since the reliability of antibodies depends on possible cross-reactivity, we compared the RNA and protein data using antibodies with different reliability scores based on various criteria, including Western blot analysis. Gene products detected in all three platforms generally have good <b>antibody</b> <b>validation</b> scores, while those detected only by antibodies, but not by RNA sequencing, generally consist of more low-scoring antibodies.

This thesis validates affinity-purified monospecific antibodies of polyclonal origin, for protein profiling in a broad spectrum of normal tissues and cells. <b>Validation</b> of <b>antibodies</b> is crucial for development of reliable binders for target proteins and this thesis evaluates the generation and application of large sets of msAbs in different settings. MsAbs were generated towards recombinant Protein Epitope Signature Tag (PrEST) antigens using a stringent affinity-purification strategy, presented in the first study. The specificity of msAbs was studied using reverse phase protein arrays and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and results presented over 90 % success rate in the protein array analysis. In IHC, 81 % of the msAbs displayed apparent specific staining in normal tissues. MsAbs were also compared with commercial analogs (cAbs) using IHC and Western blot. Results presented similar outcome between msAbs and cAbs in both applications, although interpretation suggested more extensive IHC staining patterns with msAbs than with monoclonal analogs. For <b>antibody</b> <b>validation,</b> an approach called paired antibodies was presented and involved the generation of two msAbs towards non-overlapping epitopes on the same protein. Similarities in protein detection between paired antibodies were studied using three different antibody-based methods. Similar results were observed in several applications, indicating that this strategy can be a useful tool for studying known and unknown proteins. Given the reliability of msAbs, they were also applied in a study investigating the impact of tissue fixatives on protein detection. The study showed that different fixation mechanisms appeared to affect protein recognition by indicating that aldehyde-based fixation, e. g. induced by neutral buffered formalin, was preferred for tissues used in IHC and non-aldehyde based fixation was applicable for tissues used in protein extraction analysis and Western blotting. Conclusively, validation results suggest that msAbs are reliable affinity binders that can be used as valuable tools for proteome-wide protein profiling in tissues and cells...|$|R

40|$|Over {{a decade}} after its start, Human Protein Atlas (HPA) has been {{developed}} as a universal database for human proteome. HPA has used both commercially designed and intra-designed antibodies for protein detection but both types should pass several validation tests like Western blot, immunohistochemistry, protein array and immunofluo-rescence. However, importance of data reliability requires more sensi-tive techniques to confirm specificity of antibodies to avoid any false data in HPA. Immunoprecipitation by help of magnetic beads (IP) coupled with Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry (MS) {{can be used as}} an <b>antibody</b> <b>validation</b> method with its incredible sensitivity and high capacity for different biological samples. In this study, it has been tried to test Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry and optimize a protocol for its future application as a validation method in HPA. Four proteins ATP 5 B, DDX 1, IL 18 and KRT 7 with high expression (according to RNA data and IHC staining) and high reliability score for their antibodies and four pancreatic markers, GPR 44, StradB, TMEM 100 and SerpinB 10 were selected to be detected in lysates from the cell lines, SIHA, RH- 30, BEWO and HACAT respectively (for each cell line one safe and one pancreatic marker). Protein lysates prepared by RIPA buffer were used for Immunoprecipitation and purified samples were run on SDS gel, stained with Coomassie blue and several bands were selected to be cut and prepared for MS run by in-gel digestion method. Peptides were run in Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry for detection. In total three samples out of seven were detected as correct targets (one ATP 5 B, and two for KRT 7), two samples with high molecular weight were detected as myosin which is a common contamination in proteomic lab and two bands belonging to GPR 44 and TMEM 100 failed in detection due to incorrect gel cutting. In total, HPA antibodies were successful in detection of target pro-teins when gel bands were cut at correct molecular weight, but their mono-specificity should be further investigated since KRT 7 came below contaminations. For a potential use of orbitrap MS as an anti-body validation test, it is required to use clean facility, to preincubate dynabeads with antibody, to cut the gel at expected molecular weight for target protein and finally to filter out common contaminants in MS analysis to facilitate target protein detection...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 94 % of {{colorectal}} cancers {{have been}} found with mutations in the Wnt signalling pathway. The majority of these cancers are caused by hyperactivated β-catenin dependent Wnt signalling. ROR 2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the Wnt signalling pathway which {{has been shown to}} antagonise downstream targets of β-catenin dependent Wnt signalling. This study examines colorectal cancer cell lines, adenomas and carcinomas for evidence of ROR 2 epigenetic silencing and investigates if ROR 2 expression changes can alter cellular proliferation, migration and invasion. Expression analysis of colorectal cancer cell lines found 76. 7 % (23 / 30) to have negligible ROR 2 expression levels. ROR 2 was also reduced in the majority of colorectal adenomas (5 / 6) and carcinomas (11 / 12) when compared to matching normal tissue. Bisulphite sequencing revealed that the ROR 2 expression loss was caused by epigenetic silencing through promoter hypermethylation in colorectal cancer cell lines, adenomas and carcinomas. Silencing of ROR 2 in colorectal cancer cell lines was found to increase proliferation and migration. However, ROR 2 modulation in different cell lines resulted in different expression changes amongst the Wnt target genes, suggesting that ROR 2 may trigger alternate Wnt responses depending on specific genetic and phenotypic profiles. ROR 2 has been reported to be upregulated in certain cancers whilst downregulated in others. A possible cause for this disparity may be off-target binding in the antibodies as our analysis of three commercial ROR 2 antibodies found that only one specifically bound to ROR 2. The use of antibodies with non-specific binding can adversely affect immunohistochemistry analysis, making prior <b>antibody</b> <b>validation</b> essential. Our immunohistochemistry analysis using a validated antibody confirmed that ROR 2 was downregulated in the majority of colorectal cancer cases and also found no correlation between ROR 2 presence and patient survival as had been reported in a previous publication. This study revealed epigenetic silencing of ROR 2 to be an early event in colorectal neoplasia. Functional assays also found that silencing of ROR 2 is associated with increased proliferation and migration in cell lines.

To reveal the function of each and every protein, investigation of protein localization at the subcellular level has become a central focus in this research area, since the localization and function of a protein is closely related. The objective of the studies presented in this doctoral thesis was to systematically explore the human proteome at the subcellular level using bioimaging and to develop techniques for validation of the results obtained. A common imaging technique for protein detection is immunofluorescence (IF), where antibodies are used to target proteins in fixated cells. A fixation protocol suitable for large-scale IF studies was developed and optimized to work for a broad set of proteins. As the technique relies on <b>antibodies,</b> <b>validation</b> of their specificity to the target protein is crucial. A platform based on siRNA gene silencing in combination with IF was set-up to evaluate antibody specificity by quantitative image analysis before and after suppression of its target protein. As a proof of concept, the platform was then used for <b>validation</b> of 75 <b>antibodies,</b> proving it to be applicable for <b>validation</b> of <b>antibodies</b> in a systematic manner. Because of the fixation, there is a common concern about how well IF data reflects the in vivo subcellular distribution of proteins. To address this, 500 proteins were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and used to compare protein localization results between IF to those achieved using GFP tagged proteins in live cells. It was concluded that protein localization data from fixated cells satisfactory represented the situation in vivo and together exhibit a powerful approach for confirming localizations of yet uncharacterized proteins. Finally, a global analysis based on IF data of approximately 20 % of the human proteome was performed, providing a first overview of the subcellular landscape in three different cell lines. It was found that the intracellular distribution of proteins is complex, with many proteins occurring in several organelles. The results also confirmed the close relationship between protein function and localization, which in a way further strengthens the accuracy of the IF approach for detection of proteins at the subcellular level.

In addition to commercialization of new products, important efforts {{in research and development}} have been made to <b>launch</b> new therapeutic <b>antibodies.</b> Many antibodies act through a mechanism of Antibody-dependant cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). National Health Agencies recommend or require the use of biological activity assays (potency) in order to characterize those pharmaceutical products.

40|$|Although human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is {{transmitted}} via the same routes as {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV), its worldwide seroprevalence differs drastically because HTLV {{is transmitted}} mainly via infected cells rather than free virus. The sharing of needles and other equipment places people who inject drugs (PWID) at particularly high-risk for such blood-borne diseases. To validate the methodology used to process and analyze the dried blood spots (DBS) utilized in the study, dried serum spots (DSS) with dilutions of sera from known HTLV infected individuals were analyzed by ELISA and Western blot. DBS collected between 2011 and 2015 from 2, 077 PWID in eight German cities recruited by respondent-driven sampling were tested for HTLV-specific <b>antibodies.</b> The <b>validation</b> demonstrated {{that the use of}} DSS allowed identification of samples with even low titers of HTLV-specific antibodies, although a confirmatory Western blot with an additional venous blood sample would often be required. Despite numerous HIV and HCV positive individuals being identified within the study population, none tested positive for HTLV. While the HIV and HCV prevalences in German PWID are comparable to those in other European countries, the very low prevalence of HTLV reflects the situation in the general population...|$|R
40|$|Background Poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) is a polymer {{synthesized}} by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) as a postranslational protein modification and catabolized {{mainly by}} poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase (PARG). In {{spite of the}} existence of cytoplasmic PARPs and PARG, research has been focused on nuclear PARPs and PAR, demonstrating roles in the maintenance of chromatin architecture and the participation in DNA damage responses and transcriptional regulation. We have recently detected non-nuclear PAR structurally and functionally associated to the E-cadherin rich zonula adherens and the actin cytoskeleton of VERO epithelial cells. Myelinating Schwann cells (SC) are stabilized by E-cadherin rich autotypic adherens junctions (AJ). We wondered whether PAR would map to these regions. Besides, we have demonstrated an altered microfilament pattern in peripheral nerves of Trembler-J (Tr-J) model of CMT 1 -E. We hypothesized that cytoplasmic PAR would accompany such modified F-actin pattern. Methods Wild-type (WT) and Tr-J mice sciatic nerves cryosections were subjected to immunohistofluorescence with anti-PAR <b>antibodies</b> (including <b>antibody</b> <b>validation),</b> F-actin detection with a phalloidin probe and DAPI/DNA counterstaining. Confocal image stacks were subjected to a colocalization highlighter and to semi-quantitative image analysis. Results We have shown {{for the first time the}} presence of PAR in sciatic nerves. Cytoplasmic PAR colocalized with F-actin at non-compact myelin regions in WT nerves. Moreover, in Tr-J, cytoplasmic PAR was augmented in close correlation with actin. In addition, nuclear PAR was detected in WT SC and was moderately increased in Tr-J SC. Discussion The presence of PAR associated to non-compact myelin regions (which constitute E-cadherin rich autotypic AJ/actin anchorage regions) and the co-alterations experienced by PAR and the actin cytoskeleton in epithelium and nerves, suggest that PAR may be a constitutive component of AJ/actin anchorage regions. Is PAR stabilizing the AJ-actin complexes? This question has strong implications in structural cell biology and cell signaling networks. Moreover, if PAR played a stabilizing role, such stabilization could participate in the physiological control of axonal branching. PARP and PAR alterations exist in several neurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Hungtington’s diseases. Conversely, PARP inhibition decreases PAR and promotes neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons in vitro. Coherently, the PARP inhibitor XAV 939 improves myelination in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Until now such results have been interpreted in terms of nuclear PARP activity. Our results indicate for the first time the presence of PARylation in peripheral nerve fibers, in a healthy environment. Besides, we have evidenced a PARylation increase in Tr-J, suggesting that the involvement of cytoplasmic PARPs and PARylation in normal and neurodegenerative conditions should be re-evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The pseudotype {{particle}} {{neutralization test}} (pp-NT) is a next-generation serological assay employed for the sensitive study of influenza antibody responses against hemagglutinin (HA), including stalk-directed <b>antibodies.</b> However, a <b>validation</b> of this assay {{has yet to}} be performed, and this limits its use to primarily research laboratories. To identify possible serological standards to be used in optimization and validation of the pp-NT, we have evaluated the cross-reactivity of hyperimmune chicken reference antisera in this assay. Our findings show that the cross-reactivity detected by the pp-NT is only partly explained by phylogenetic relationships and protein homology between the HA subtypes analysed; further studies are necessary to understand the origin of the cross-reactivity detected, and reference standards with higher specificity should be evaluated or generated de novo for future use in pp-NT...|$|R

Before the war, they had been successful in coupling anthracene isocyanate—a fluophore—to antipneumococcus antibodies. The resulting product retained its immunological function, and was capable of agglutinating pneumococcal bacteria. In addition, the organisms were brightly fluorescent and could be seen easily with a microscope that was fitted with an excitational ultraviolet light source. This basic laboratory paradigm was later applied to many antigens and <b>antibodies,</b> <b>launching</b> the clinical disciplines of diagnostic immunofluorescence microscopy for bacteriology and immunology, immunocytology, and immunohistochemistry in anatomic pathology. These methods are widely used today, globally, in clinical medicine and cell biology.|$|R
40|$|Oligoclonal Ig bands (OCBs) of the {{cerebrospinal}} fluid are {{a hallmark of}} multiple sclerosis (MS), a disabling inflammatory disease of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). OCBs are locally produced by clonally expanded antigen-experienced B cells and therefore are believed to hold an important clue to the pathogenesis. However, their target antigens have remained unknown, mainly because it was thus far not possible to isolate distinct OCBs against a background of polyclonal antibodies. To overcome this obstacle, we copurified disulfide-linked Ig heavy and light chains from distinct OCBs for concurrent analysis by mass spectrometry and aligned patient-specific peptides to corresponding transcriptome databases. This method revealed the full-length sequences of matching chains from distinct OCBs, allowing for antigen searches using recombinant OCB <b>antibodies.</b> As <b>validation,</b> we demonstrate that an OCB antibody from a patient with an infectious CNS disorder, neuroborreliosis, recognized a Borrelia protein. Next, we produced six recombinant antibodies from four MS patients and identified three different autoantigens. All of them are conformational epitopes of ubiquitous intracellular proteins not specific to brain tissue. Our findings indicate that the B-cell response in MS is heterogeneous and partly directed against intracellular autoantigens released during tissue destruction. In addition to helping elucidate the role of B cells in MS, our approach allows the identification of target antigens of OCB antibodies in other neuroinflammatory diseases and the production of therapeutic antibodies in infectious CNS diseases...|$|R
40|$|Proteins are {{involved}} in all of life's processes and are also responsible for many diseases. Thus, engineering proteins to perform new tasks could revolutionize many areas of biomedical research. One promising technique for protein engineering is computational structure-based protein design (CSPD). CSPD algorithms search large protein conformational spaces to approximate biophysical quantities. In this dissertation we present new algorithms to realistically and accurately model how amino acid mutations change protein structure. These algorithms model continuous flexibility, protein ensembles and positive/negative design, while providing guarantees on the output. Using these algorithms and the OSPREY protein design program we design and apply protocols for three biomedically-relevant problems: (i) prediction of new drug resistance mutations in bacteria to a new preclinical antibiotic, (ii) the redesign of llama antibodies to potentially reduce their immunogenicity for use in preclinical monkey studies, and (iii) scaffold-based anti-HIV <b>antibody</b> design.
