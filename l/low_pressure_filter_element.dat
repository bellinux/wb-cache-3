40|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{is one of}} {{the drilling}} operational problems. It refers to the total or partial loss of drilling fluid into highly permeable zones or natural or induced fractures. This problem is likely to occur when the hydrostatic head pressure of drilling fluid in the hole exceeds the formation pressure. Today, managing lost circulation remains a significant challenge to oilwell drilling operations because it may contribute to high non-productive time. It is imperative to note that the overbalance pressure situation also can cause the invasion of mud filtrate into production zones which will result in formation damage. To address these problems, an experimental investigation has been done on durian rind as an alternative fluid loss and lost circulation materials in water-based mud. Durian rind was selected as a mud loss control material because it contains close to 20 % pectin which may complement the formation of high quality mat-like bridges across openings of the formation. The test involved the use of standard mud testing equipment and a lost circulation test cell. Durian rind powder was prepared by cleaning and cutting the durian rind into small pieces of 1 to 2 cm, and then dried them in an oven at 60 °C for 48 hours before grinding into five different sizes from coarse to ultra-fine while Hydro-plug, the commercial lost circulation material was supplied by Scomi Energy. The fluid loss test was conducted using a standard <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>filter</b> press while the bridging test was carried out at 100 psi of pressure difference and ambient temperature using a lost circulation cell. Fine durian in the water-based mud gave the best fluid loss control compared to coarse durian rind, fine and coarse Hydro-plug. The experimental results also showed that at 15 lb/bbl (42. 8 kg/m 3) optimum concentration, coarse and intermediate durian rind have outperformed Hydro-plug by showing an excellent control of mud losses in 1 and 2 mm simulated fractures...|$|R
40|$|The {{filtration}} efficiency for separating liquid paraffin (or water) from a slurry consisting of 25 weight% spherical alumina in a Slurry Bubble Column Reactor (SBCR) comprised of a cylindrical tube of 10 cm diameter and 150 cm length was studied. Various differential pressures (ΔP) {{were applied to}} two separate tubular sintered metal stainless steel <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> with nominal pore size of 4 and 16 μm. The experimental results disclosed {{that the rate of}} filtrations increased on applying higher differential <b>pressure</b> to the <b>filter</b> <b>element.</b> Albeit this phenomenon is limited to moderate ΔPs and for ΔP more than 1 bar is neither harmful nor helpful.

Although the emitters used in microirrigation operate at <b>low</b> <b>pressures,</b> their <b>filters</b> require higher <b>pressures</b> and there is therefore no reduction in energy consumption. Part of the pressure drop found in filters is produced by the porous medium itself and this cannot be avoided. However, {{a large part of the}} pressure dissipated is caused by auxiliary <b>elements</b> of the <b>filter</b> and this could potentially be reduced without reducing the effectiveness of the filtration process. The auxiliary elements that produced most of the pressure drop in a sand filter were identified. The pressure drop in a scaled sand filter was measured at different points. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the filter was developed and validated using experimental data. Good agreement was observed between the measured and predicted pressures at the different locations. The CFD model was then used to analyse the regions and elements that produced most pressure drop in the filter and a new underdrain designed to reduce pressure drop was developed. It was predicted that the total pressure drop produced by the underdrain could be halved. In view of these results, a new underdrain design and packing strategy was proposed which could reduce the overall pressure drop in the filter by 35 %The authors would like to express their gratitude to the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation for their financial support for this experiment through grant CGL 2012 - 3118...|$|R

40|$|Electrostatic {{filtration}} media (electret) {{has been used}} in many applications due to its ability to efficiently collect submicron particles while maintaining a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> drop. <b>Filter</b> face velocities have ranged from 0. 01 - 0. 5 m/s in previous studies. However, in this study, measurements were conducted from 0. 5 - 2. 5 m/s, a region where Reynolds numbers range from 0. 05 - 0. 24. Within this regime, commonly used filtration theory is incomplete and does not predict performance of electret media, therefore data must be measured. Experimental measurements were conducted in various combinations of charge and neutralized filter media with aerosolized particles possessing the Boltzmann charge distribution or zero charge. Collection efficiency of the charged FiltreteTM media was significantly higher than the FiltreteTM which had been charged neutralized. As filter face velocity increased, however, collection efficiency decreased in the electret media. As filter face velocity increased for the neutralized media, collection efficiency increased due to inertial impaction. Particle bounce was assumed to occur with particles of aerodynamic diameter ≥ 400 nm. Electrostatic attraction, i. e. Coulombic, polarization and image forces were analyzed based on experimental data. The Coulombic force had the greatest effect on efficiency at all three filter face velocities, followed by the polarization force. The effect of image forces was negligible for all three filter face velocities. This study provides unique empirical data outside of the viscous filter flow regime, data which is useful in the design of, and performance prediction of, high volume commercial and industrial applications, such as HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems.

The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> can be used directly as inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> {{and the development of a}} new type of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is not a requirement of this technology.

The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less.

Pulse-jet cleaning of <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> is a key component {{in the operation of}} the filtration unit. The pulse-jet is introduced into the <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> cavities from the clean side, and the dust cakes on the outer surfaces of the <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> are detached and fall into the filter vessel. Sequential on-line cleaning of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> groups yields a filter operation with no shutdown for filter regeneration. Development of advanced technologies in the design and operation of the pulse cleaning is one of the important tasks in order to increase the system reliability, to improve the filter life and to increase the filtering performance. The regeneration of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> in gas filtration at high temperature plays a very important role for the operation of the process. Based on experimental observation and field operation, a numerical model is set up to numerically simulate the momentum and heat transport phenomena in the regeneration process, which is essential for understanding of the process, the optimization of process parameters and improvement of the design of the structure of venturi nozzle and the configuration of the apparatus...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{intake air}} {{filtration}} {{is a key}} element for limiting fouling, erosion, and corrosion in the compressor section and hot corrosion in the hot section of offshore gas turbine installations. Current intake air systems on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) are normally able to prevent serious corrosion and erosion problems in the compressor section and ensure acceptable service intervals for the hot section of the gas turbines, but compressor fouling remains a challenge. This compressor fouling occurs despite the presence of “state-of-the-art” intake air filtration systems. The performance deterioration caused by compressor fouling increases fuel consumption and emissions and has a particularly severe economic impact when it reduces the maximum available power from the gas turbine and consequently reduces oil and gas production. The main objective of this work is to determine the performance of current intake air filters offshore and their influence on gas turbine performance. The work is empirical, and the empirical data have been obtained from offshore installations, from tests performed on a GE J 85 - 13 jet engine at Kjeller, Norway, and from experimental tests on <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> in a test rig at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The filter test rig was designed and built as part of this work. The work has confirmed that considerable amounts of contaminants build up in the compressor section of offshore gas turbines despite the presence of state-of-the-art filtration systems, causing deterioration in gas turbine performance. It has been determined through analysis of compressor fouling in different offshore gas turbine engines that sodium-based salts are the dominant component of the fouling, and the influence of the observed contamination levels on gas turbine performance has been determined. The extensive test program on different types of deteriorated <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> from offshore service has revealed that accumulated salt and other contaminants are shed from the filters and re-entrained into the airflow on the downstream side of the filters when they are exposed to wet/humid operating conditions. The relationship between ingested amount of water and shed contamination from the <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> as well as the influence on differential pressure drop over the filters have been quantified. The review of offshore filter performance and experimental testing have documented that the current practice for condition monitoring of intake filter performance by monitoring the total pressure drop over the intake filters is inadequate. The re-entrainment of accumulated particles into the downstream side of the <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> causes a significant change in the pressure drop characteristics for some types of <b>filter</b> <b>elements.</b> After such incidents, an apparent improvement in filter performance in terms of reduced pressure drop will be accompanied by an increase in compressor fouling. The work has also revealed significant variations in the level of accumulated particle mass and differential <b>pressure</b> drop among <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> from the same installation. Such variations may cause some <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> to operate outside of their design criteria and will normally not be discovered by monitoring the total pressure loss over the intake filters. A thorough review of current international standards and available filter manufacturer specifications for intake air treatment systems has documented important shortcomings in how offshore-specific challenges pertaining to intake air filtration for gas turbines are handled and has revealed a need for new or improved standards for gas turbine intake systems offshore. No international standard for evaluating and documenting the performance of the complete gas turbine intake air systems in offshore applications exists. Applicable heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) air filtration standards for <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> fail to address the offshore-specific challenges related to salt removal and moist and wet operation and cannot be used to accurately predict operational performance or life. Some suppliers of <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> for offshore gas turbine application also choose not to test their filters in accordance with these standards. An international standard for offshore gas turbine air intake systems is needed {{in order to ensure that}} the specific challenges that stem from operating in an offshore environment are handled in a responsible manner. Such a standard should take a holistic approach to the intake air system rather than solely focusing on some specific components or conditions. Experimental performance evaluation of used filters from offshore service and filters exposed to accelerated deterioration in the laboratory has increased the knowledge of intake filter deterioration in offshore applications and created a basis for establishing guidelines and requirements for future standards for offshore gas turbine intake filters and systems. The accelerated saltwater deterioration method developed and applied in this work was effective in revealing significant variations in how new filters performed when exposed to this challenge. Saltwater ingestion caused filter performance to deteriorate within a short time frame, and the recorded increases in differential pressure drop were within the range of differential pressure drops recorded for used filters from offshore operation.
