500|$|Another {{innovation}} {{of the era}} secured Panavision's leading position: the Auto Panatar {{camera lens}} for 35mm anamorphic productions. Early CinemaScope camera lenses were notoriously problematic in close-ups with an optical aberration that was commonly known as [...] "the mumps": a widening of the face due {{to a loss of}} anamorphic power as a subject approaches the lens. Because of the novelty of the new anamorphic process, early CinemaScope productions compensated for this aberration by avoiding tightly framed shots. As the anamorphic process became more popular, it became more problematic. Panavision invented a solution: adding a rotating <b>lens</b> <b>element</b> that moved in mechanical sync with the focus ring. This eliminated the distortion and allowed for natural close-up anamorphic photography. The Auto Panatar, released in 1958, was rapidly adopted, eventually making CinemaScope lenses obsolete. This innovation earned Panavision the first of its 15 Academy Awards for technical achievement. Soon the screen credit [...] "Filmed in Panavision" [...] (as if Panavision itself were a widescreen format) began appearing on motion picture screen credits.|$|E
50|$|In {{the most}} common type (shown), the {{positive}} power of the crown <b>lens</b> <b>element</b> is not quite equalled by the negative power of the flint <b>lens</b> <b>element.</b> Together they form a weak positive lens that will bring two different wavelengths of light to a common focus. Negative doublets, in which the negative-power element predominates, are also made.|$|E
50|$|By {{reducing}} {{the distance between}} the rear <b>lens</b> <b>element</b> and the sensor, a more compact construction is possible.|$|E
50|$|Except for {{the most}} simple and {{inexpensive}} lenses, each complete lens is made up {{from a number of}} separate <b>lens</b> <b>elements</b> arranged along a common axis. The use of many <b>lens</b> <b>elements</b> serves to minimise aberrations and to provide a sharp image free from visible imperfections. To do this requires <b>lens</b> <b>elements</b> of different compositions and different shapes. To minimise chromatic aberrations, e. g., in which different wavelengths of light are refracted to different degrees, requires, at a minimum, a doublet of <b>lens</b> <b>elements</b> with a positive element having a high Abbe number matched with a negative element of lower Abbe number. With this design one can achieve a good degree of convergence of different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Most lens designs do not attempt to bring infrared wavelengths to the same common focus and it is therefore necessary to manually alter the focus when photographing in infrared light. Other kinds of aberrations like coma or astigmatism can also be minimized by combining different <b>lens</b> <b>elements.</b> Complex photographic <b>lenses</b> can consist of more than 15 <b>lens</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|R

50|$|Lenses are {{fitted to}} a lens board {{by placing the}} shutter {{assembly}} through {{the front of the}} board and securing the shutter assembly by threading a locknut to rear of the shutter. A front <b>lens</b> <b>element</b> will thread onto the mounted shutter and if necessary, a second <b>lens</b> <b>element</b> will thread onto the rear of the mounted shutter. This procedure can be accomplished by a camera technician, or by an end-user with the appropriate tools.|$|E
