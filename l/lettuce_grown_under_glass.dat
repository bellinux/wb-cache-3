40|$|In general, plants <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> {{diffuse light}} yield higher biomass than those <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> direct {{light as a}} result of a more uniform {{distribution}} of the light across the plant canopy. We compared the effects of a light-diffusing plastic film and a clear plastic film on growth of Batavia lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in two greenhouses during five growth periods. <b>Lettuce</b> <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the light-diffusing film were smaller (up to 36 %) than control plants <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the clear film, due to the fewer leaves per plant (up to 22 %) and lower mean values of individual leaf area (up to 29 %). The photosynthetically active radiations use efficiency was sometimes lower (up to 23 %) in <b>lettuces</b> <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the light-diffusing film. The pigment contents tended to be lower in plants <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the light-diffusing plastic. The total macroelement contents of the <b>lettuces</b> <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the light-diffusing plastic were up to 10 % higher than in the <b>lettuces</b> <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> clear plastic, mainly {{as a result of}} higher leaf K contents (up to 19 % higher). In addition, use of the light-diffusing plastic tended to increase leaf nitrate contents (by up to 23 %). The leaf solid soluble content and acidity values were higher in the <b>lettuces</b> <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the light-diffusing plastic, while leaf pH values were lower than in the control plants. The findings showed that the light-diffusing plastic was detrimental to production of compact heads of lettuce, and to some quality parameters such as nitrate and pigment contents. Nevertheless, open-leaf cultivars would likely show a different response to the diffuse light...|$|R

40|$|Red {{leaf lettuce}} (Lollo Rosso) was <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> {{three types of}} plastic films that varied in {{transparency}} to UV radiation (designated as UV block, UV low, and UV window). Flavonoid composition was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), total phenolics by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, and antioxiclant capacity by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. Exposure to increased levels of UV radiation during cultivation caused the leaves to redden and increased concentrations of total phenols and the main flavonoids, quercetin and cyanidin glycosides, as well as luteolin conjugates and phenolic acids. The total phenol content increased from 1. 6 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) /g of fresh weight (FW) for <b>lettuce</b> <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> UV block film to 2. 9 and 3. 5 mg of GAE/g of FW for <b>lettuce</b> <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the UV low and UV window films. The antioxiclant activity was also higher in lettuce exposed {{to higher levels of}} UV radiation with ORAC values of 25. 4 and 55. 1 mu mol of Trolox equivalents/g of FW for <b>lettuce</b> <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the UV block and UV window films, respectively. The content of phenolic acids, quantified as caffeic acid, was also different, ranging from 6. 2 to 11. 1 mu mol/g of FW for lettuce cultivated under the lowest and highest UV exposure plastic films, respectively. Higher concentrations of the flavonoid glycosides were observed with increased exposure to UV radiation, as demonstrated by the concentrations of aglycones after hydrolysis, which were cyanidin (ranging from 165 to 793 mu g/g), quercetin (ranging from 196 to 880,mu g/g), and luteolin (ranging from 19 to 152 mu g/g). The results demonstrate the potential of the use of UV-transparent plastic as a means of increasing beneficial flavonoid content of red leaf lettuce when the crop is grown in polytunnels...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to elucidate the effect of light-emitting diode treatment on early growth and inorganic elements in leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. 'Oak Leaf'). In changes to leaf mor-phology, shoot elongation and hypocotyl length showed poor growth under red light irradiation, while red+blue light irradiation induced shorter plant height and more leaves, resulting in increased fresh weight. With respect to Hunter's color and SPAD values, <b>lettuce</b> seedlings <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> red+ blue and fluorescent light irradiation had a higher a * value but showed no other changes to SPAD values. Interestingly, redness in relative chlorophyll content was 1. 4 times higher under red+blue light irradiation. Inorganic element (N, Ca, Mg, and Fe) and ascorbic acid concentrations increased in let-tuce plants <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> LED light irradiation compared to those of <b>lettuce</b> <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> fluorescent light, which showed a higher P content. In conclusion, red+blue light irradiation, which stimulates growth and higher nutrient uptake in leaf lettuce, could be employed in containers equipped with LEDs...|$|R
