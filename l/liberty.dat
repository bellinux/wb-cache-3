5|$|As {{part of the}} <b>Liberty</b> Bell Savings Bonds {{drive in}} 1950, 55replicas of the <b>Liberty</b> Bell (one each for the 48states, the District of Columbia, and the territories) were ordered by the United States Department of the Treasury and were cast in France by the Fonderie Paccard. The bells were to be {{displayed}} and rung on patriotic occasions. Many of the bells today are sited near state capitol buildings. Although Wisconsin's bell is now at its state capitol, initially it was sited {{on the grounds of}} the state's Girls Detention Center. Texas' bell is located inside the Academic Building on the campus of Texas A University in College Station. The Texas bell was presented to the university in appreciation of the service of the school's graduates. Walt Disney World has a replica of the <b>Liberty</b> Bell, which is located in <b>Liberty</b> Square in the Magic Kingdom. The replica was cast from the mold of the actual <b>Liberty</b> Bell in 1989.|$|E

5|$|On November 30, Louisiana Tech {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} Independence Bowl but asked for more time as they were in {{negotiations}} with the <b>Liberty</b> Bowl and Heart of Dallas Bowl. Louisiana Tech athletic director Bruce Van De Velde and WAC commissioner Jeff Hurd both claimed that on December 1, the <b>Liberty</b> Bowl executive director Steve Ehrhart guaranteed the Bulldogs a bowl invite. After the Independence Bowl's deadline for Louisiana Tech to accept their invitation passed, the Independence Bowl selected the MAC's Ohio (8–4) instead. On December 2, the <b>Liberty</b> Bowl extended their remaining bid to Iowa State (6–6) instead of Louisiana Tech (9–3).

The <b>Liberty</b> Bell was chosen for the stamp design theme because the symbol was most representative of the nation's independence.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} evolution of <b>liberties</b> for every country and protectorate in the world, 1972 - 1995. Separate {{attention is paid to}} political vs. civil <b>liberties,</b> and the data are also weighted by population. We explore both {{the evolution of}} average political and civil <b>liberties,</b> which provide a summary perspective, and the evolution of the entire probability distributions of political and civil <b>liberties,</b> which provide a more complete perspective. Second, we use a Markov model to quantify the evolution of <b>liberties.</b> We obtain exact maximum likelihood estimates of the model, which we use to assess the likely future course of the distribution of world <b>liberties.</b> We compute the implied steady-state distribution and compare it to the present distribution. The unweighted results favor eventual movement toward reduced <b>liberties</b> while the weighted results suggest movement away from the middle level of <b>liberties</b> and towards the highest and lowest levels. ...|$|R
5|$|Procedural due process, {{arising from}} the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, is {{minimally}} the right to notice and a hearing, but has been held to include in some circumstances rights to counsel and rights to confrontation. Procedural due process is required any time a person faces the deprivation of life, <b>liberty,</b> or property. As substantive due process arises from the <b>liberty</b> clause, a deprivation of a substantive due process right is a deprivation of <b>liberty</b> and thus requires procedural due process.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Liberty</b> Ridge Route, grade IV, {{was first}} climbed by Ome Daiber, Arnie Campbell and Jim Burrow in 1935 and {{is listed as}} one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America by Steve Roper and Allen Steck.

This route only accounts for approximately 2% of climbers on the mountain, but accounts for approximately 25% of deaths on the mountain.

They could also be equipped to carry a large number of troops by rigging bunks in the holds similar to those used by the armed guard. <b>Liberty</b> ships began taking troops and materials wherever they were needed, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
