5000|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>Market</b> is a {{term used}} in {{innovation}} theory and denotes a country or region, which pioneers the successful adoption of an innovative design. It sends signalling effects to other [...] "lag" [...] markets, which in turn helps in triggering a process of global diffusion. Marian Beise, {{one of the foremost}} propounders of this theory as it has been understood so far, states: [...] "Innovations that have been successful with local users in lead markets have a higher potential of becoming adopted world-wide than any other design preferred in other countries". Christoph Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal have described lead markets as [...] "… markets that provide the stimuli for most global products and processes of a multinational company. Local innovations in such markets become useful elsewhere as the environmental characteristics that stimulated such innovations diffuse to other locations". [...] To illustrate a <b>lead</b> <b>market</b> with some examples, Germany {{can be seen as a}} <b>lead</b> <b>market</b> for renewable energies and (premium) automobiles, while the USA would suit as a <b>lead</b> <b>market</b> for information technologies including e-commerce.|$|E

5000|$|The {{theory of}} lead markets {{has been criticized}} for not being [...] "consistent and stringent". While {{conventional}} wisdom, due to its emphasis on customer affluence and sophistication as inducers of innovation, has tended to see lead markets exist in economically highly developed countries; recent research, notably by Rajnish Tiwari and Cornelius Herstatt of Hamburg University of Technology (e.g. Tiwari and Herstatt, 2011a, Tiwari and Herstatt, 2011b), has emphasized the need to update/extend the <b>lead</b> <b>market</b> model to adjust it to the changing ground realities in the face of globalization and sustained economic growth in developing nations. Using examples of several frugal innovations from India, and more specifically the case of small car industry in India's automotive sector, Rajnish Tiwari in his dissertation at Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) has proposed that lead markets can emerge in developing nations as well provided the market size enables significant economies of scale and the country's innovation system is endowed with the necessary technological capabilities. These two conditions, seen in conjunction with several other factors such as embeddedness in the international trade and access to open global innovation networks (OGINs), can in many instances compensate other typical drawbacks of developing countries, such as low purchasing power. As a consequence, Tiwari's dissertation has proposed to update the model to include technology advantage in the model, while combining the export and transfer advantages as one single group. Factors within the individual groups of advantages have been also update/modified. The evolution of India's small car sector has also provided some valuable insights into possible emergence of a <b>lead</b> <b>market</b> in a country. This model, if validated by further research, would help enable an ex ante analysis of lead markets, whereas so far mostly ex post, macroeconomic analyses have been the norm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of liquidity in the price discovery process. Specifically, {{we focus on the}} credit derivatives markets {{in the context of the}} subprime crisis. We present a theoretical price discovery model for the asset swap packages (ASPs), bond and credit default swap (CDS) markets and then we test the model with data from 2005 to 2009 on Euro-denominated non-financial firms. Our empirical results show that the ASP <b>market</b> clearly <b>leads</b> the bond <b>market</b> in the price discovery process in all cases, while the leadership between ASPs and CDSs is very sensitive to the appearance of the subprime crisis. Before the crisis, the CDSs <b>market</b> <b>leads</b> the ASP <b>market,</b> but during the crisis, the ASP <b>market</b> <b>leads</b> the CDS <b>market.</b> The liquidity, measured as the relative number of market participants, helps to explain these results.
