5|$|Polarization {{of voting}} {{patterns}} based on religion {{was evident in}} the eastern provinces. Christianity-based Prosperous Peace Party (PDS) received 14.8 percent of votes in Christian-dominant North Sulawesi and 13 seats overall in the People's Representative Council. Likewise, Muslims were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for the PKS in regions where religious conflict has been historically prevalent.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the tally}} of Cardinal Charles de Lorraine-Guise {{in his letter}} to Henry II, once the twelve {{participating}} French cardinals reached Rome, twenty-three cardinals were aligned in the French faction, twenty-two in the Imperial faction, and four neutral; thus Guise judged it impossible for either faction to garner the necessary two-thirds simply by persuading neutral cardinals. In addition, eleven Italian cardinals whom Guise counted among the French faction were only <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for a fellow Italian, making the three favorites of Henry IILouis de Bourbon de Vendôme, Jean de Lorraine, and Georges d'Amboiseunfeasible. The non-French cardinal protector of France, d'Este, would then have been the choice of Henry II; Catherine de' Medici preferred her cousin Giovanni Salviati, who was extremely unacceptable to the Imperial faction and the Farnese.|$|E
25|$|Americans that {{identify}} as single, {{living with a}} domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> Democratic, in contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between Democrat and Republican.|$|E
50|$|Later in 2014, Bite The Ballot {{launched}} '#TheAmendment' {{to improve}} voter registration and engagement in Wales. Its aims {{were to get}} Electoral Registration Officers to target groups seen as less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> register <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> have voter registration sessions in schools and colleges, and to make registering <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> as simple and straightforward as possible.|$|R

50|$|However, {{this effect}} is not just {{contained}} to Uganda. Another natural experiment {{on the effects of}} the Sierra Leone civil war found that victimized households, household whose members were killed, injured, maimed, captured, or made refugees, were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> register <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> attend community meetings, and participate in local political and community groups than households that did not experience violence.|$|R
25|$|Though the {{majority}} (60–70%) of the country's Jews identify as Democratic, Jews span the political spectrum, with those {{at higher levels}} of observance being far more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> Republican than their less observant and secular counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Those with an {{internal}} locus of control {{are more likely to be}} of higher socioeconomic status, and are more likely to be politically involved (e.g., following political news, joining a political organization) Those with {{an internal}} locus of control are also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over 150 million Americans play video games, with {{an average}} age of 35 and a gender {{breakdown}} of 59 percent male and 41 percent female. American gamers are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean conservative.|$|E
50|$|This also {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} {{that members of the}} U.S. Senate or House of Representatives are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>voted</b> for on a year of the presidential election than a midterm.|$|R
50|$|Harry McGee of The Irish Times {{suggested}} that voter turnout would be low, with middle-class graduates with {{a vote in}} the Seanad university constituencies more <b>likely</b> both <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> and <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> No, and that Sinn Féin's campaign could be crucial for the Yes side.|$|R
50|$|Issues in the {{election}} included council tax levels and plans {{by the government to}} build 1,000 houses near Sarisbury. The national issue of the Iraq War was also seen as being <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> sway <b>votes</b> in {{the election}}.|$|R
25|$|Older {{people have}} {{different}} requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights. Older {{people are also}} more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> and in many countries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively more, or at least different, political influence.|$|E
25|$|In an October 17–20, 2008 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of {{registered}} voters, 2% said race {{made them more}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for Barack Obama, 4% said it made them less likely to do so, and 2% were not sure. The other 92% of respondents said race was not {{a major factor in}} their vote (margin of error was ±2.9%).|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Swainson was {{defeated}} by Republican George W. Romney, {{the chairman of the}} American Motors Corporation, who had never before held elected office. The win was attributed in part to Romney's appeal to independent voters, {{as well as to the}} increasing influence of suburban Detroit voters, who, by 1962, were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> Republican than the heavily Democratic city.|$|E
40|$|This study explores whether black and/or Latino {{respondents}} are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> over-report <b>voting</b> in districts with US House candidates {{of the same}} race/ethnicity and whether the overstating of political participation is contingent on shared partisanship between the candidate and the respondent. We test these relationships using vote-validated data from the 2006 and 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. We find that blacks and Latinos are not more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> over-report <b>voting</b> in districts with descriptive candidates {{regardless of whether the}} candidate and respondent share the same party identification or not. The results of this study provide support for previous and future studies linking descriptive representation to higher levels of black and Latino turnout using non-voter validated data...|$|R

25|$|Political {{behavior}} {{is affected by}} class; more affluent individuals are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> and education and income affect whether individuals tend {{to vote for the}} Democratic or Republican party. Income also {{had a significant impact on}} health as those with higher incomes had better access to health care facilities, higher life expectancy, lower infant mortality rate and increased health consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Another poll in May 2013 {{confirmed}} {{public support}} for the bill, with 53% in favour of same-sex marriage. A second poll in May showed a similar level of support (54%), and also found that 58% of those who considered same-sex marriage an important election issue would be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for a party that supported it. A May 2013 Ipsos poll found 55% of respondents in favour of same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|Socioeconomic factors {{significantly}} affect {{whether or not}} individuals develop the habit of voting. The most important socioeconomic factor affecting voter turnout is education. The more educated a person is, the more likely {{he or she is}} to vote, even controlling for other factors that are closely associated with education level, such as income and class. Income has some effect independently: wealthier people are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> regardless of their educational background. There is some debate over the effects of ethnicity, race, and gender. In the past, these factors unquestionably influenced turnout in many nations, but nowadays the consensus among political scientists is that these factors have little effect in Western democracies when education and income differences are taken into account. However, since different ethnic groups typically have different levels of education and income, there are important differences in turnout between such groups in many societies. Other demographic factors have an important influence: young people are far less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> than the elderly. Occupation has little effect on turnout, with the notable exception of higher voting rates among government employees in many countries.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether viewers {{of the popular}} television show, American Idol, are racially biased. I find strong evidence for same-race preferences, in particular among black viewers. Featuring more black contestants attracts more black households to tune in to watch the show. And, with more black viewers, a black contestant is less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>voted</b> off...|$|R
25|$|Those who {{described}} themselves as religious were the strongest supporters of prop 8. According to the NGLTF study, self-identified Catholics and Protestants supported Prop 8 by measures of 55% and 66%, respectively, while Jews overwhelmingly opposed it, with support at only 17%. Young voters were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>voted</b> against the ballot measure than older voters, while Republicans were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have supported the measure than were Democrats.|$|R

25|$|One 2017 {{study in}} the Journal of Politics found that, in the United States, incarceration had no {{significant}} impact on turnout in elections: ex-felons did not become less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> after their time in prison. Also in the United States, incarceration, probation, and a felony record deny 5-6 million Americans {{of the right to}} vote, with reforms gradually leading more states to allow people with felony criminal records to vote, while almost none allow incarcerated people to vote.|$|E
25|$|One {{explanation}} is that older Californians with fixed incomes had increasing difficulty paying property taxes, which were rising {{as a result of}} California's population growth, increasing housing demand, and inflation. Due to severe inflation during the 1970s, reassessments of residential property increased property taxes so much, that some retired people could no longer afford to remain in homes they had purchased long before. An academic study found support for this explanation, reporting that older voters, homeowners, and voters expecting a tax increase were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for Proposition 13.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the immigration-reduction {{advocacy}} {{think tank}} the Center for Immigration Studies released a poll {{that found that}} 68% of Americans think U.S. immigration levels are too high, and just 2% said they are too low. They also found that 70% said they are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for candidates that favor increasing legal immigration. In 2004, 55% of Americans believed legal immigration should remain at the current level or increased and 41% said it should be decreased. The less contact a native-born American has with immigrants, the more likely one would {{have a negative view}} of immigrants.|$|E
50|$|Polls vary in how {{weightings}} {{are applied}} {{and in which}} participants are excluded from the final data (based on how <b>likely</b> they are <b>to</b> <b>vote),</b> an inherent ± 3% margin of error based on a sample size of ~1,000, among other factors.|$|R
5000|$|The loss aversion theory [...] by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman {{is often}} {{associated}} with voting behavior as people are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use their <b>vote</b> <b>to</b> avoid the effect of an unfavorable policy rather than supporting a favorable policy.

50|$|During the 2016 US Presidential Election, {{researchers}} connected ambivalent sexism <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> intentions. In a non-representative {{sample of}} US voters, predominantly male, ambivalent sexism {{was found to}} be the sole predictor of intending <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for someone other than Hillary Clinton in the election. For every step up on the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, participants were 3.3 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>voting</b> for someone other than Hillary Clinton. Of those not voting for Clinton, they were not necessarily being pulled over to the Trump campaign, but rather, many were intending <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> Third Party or were still undecided. While higher Islamophobia predicted a vote for Trump, lower Islamophobia and higher ambivalent sexism predicted being undecided or voting for a Third Party.|$|R
25|$|According to an Opinium poll in December 2014 on {{the views}} of 17- to 22-year-olds, Farage was the least popular {{political}} leader. Only 3% of young people questioned said that they intended to vote for UKIP, compared with 19% among voters of all ages. The 17% who said they would vote outside the three main parties were four times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for the Green Party than for UKIP. Conversely, a March 2015 Ipsos Mori poll found among 18- to 34-year-olds UKIP was polling nearly {{as well as the}} Green Party, somewhat contradicting the idea that Farage lacked appeal for younger voters.|$|E
25|$|Aging has a {{significant}} impact on society. People of different ages tend to differ in many aspects, such as legal and social responsibilities, outlook on life, and self-perception. Young people tend to have fewer legal privileges (if they are below the age of majority), {{they are more likely to}} push for political and social change, to develop and adopt new technologies, and to need education. Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights. Older people are also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> and in many countries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively more, or at least different, political influence.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that 66% of social media users {{actively}} engage in political activity online, and like many other behaviors, online activities translate into offline ones. With research from the 'MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics' stating that {{young people who are}} politically active online are double as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> than those who are not politically active online. Therefore, political applications of social networking sites are crucial, particularly to engage with the youth, who perhaps are the least educated in politics and the most in social networking sites. Social media is therefore a very effective way in which politicians can connect with a younger audience through their political campaigns.|$|E
50|$|Interviewer {{effects can}} also be {{associated}} with the characteristics of the interviewer, such as race. Whether black respondents are interviewed by white interviewers or black interviewers has a strong impact on their responses to both attitude questions and behavioral ones. In the latter case, for example, if black respondents are interviewed by black interviewers in pre-election surveys, they are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>vote</b> in the upcoming election than if they are interviewed by white interviewers.|$|R
