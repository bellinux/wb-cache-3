40|$|Objectives: This {{analysis}} examines ethnoracial {{group differences}} in the transition from health to disability. Methods: Using data from the AHEAD study, the authors examine the relative influence of each stage in the disablement process in the evolu-tion of ethnoracial {{group differences in}} basic and instrumental disability. Results: Predisposing factors account for disability differences between Whites and other Latinos, whereas excess disability among African Americans stems from their higher level of cognitive limitation. The excess disability of Mexican Americans arises from their higher level of physical limitations. The data also reveal a larger impact of medi-cal conditions and physical <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> <b>acquisition</b> of disability among African Americans and Mexican Americans. This article demonstrates the importance of cog-nitive status in the disablement process, especially in ethnoracial group differences. Discussion: The authors discuss the practical implications for health care delivery to non-White elders and the theoretical implications for understanding the complexities of disablement. Older Latinos and African Americans experience greater disability and health disadvantage relative to older Whites (R. Angel & Angel...|$|R

40|$|Registration of {{three-dimensional}} ultrasound (3 DUS) volumes {{is necessary}} in several applications, such as when stitch-ing volumes to expand {{the field of view}} or when stabilizing a temporal sequence of volumes to cancel out motion of the probe or anatomy. Current systems that register 3 DUS volumes either use external tracking systems (electromagnetic or optical), which add expense and impose <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> <b>acquisitions,</b> or are image-based methods that operate offline and are incapable of providing immediate feedback to clinicians. This paper presents a real-time image-based algorithm for rigid registration of 3 DUS volumes designed for acquisitions in which small probe displacements occur between frames. Described is a method for feature detection and descriptor formation that takes into account the characteristics of 3 DUS imaging. Volumes are registered by determining a correspondence between these features. A global set of features is maintained and integrated into the registration, which limits the accumulation of registration error. The system operates in real-time (i. e. volumes are registered as fast or faster than they are acquired) by using an accelerated framework on a graphics processing unit. The algorithm’s parameter selection and performance is analyzed and validated in studies which use both water tank and clinical images. The resulting registration accuracy is comparable to similar feature-based registration methods, but in contrast to these methods, can register 3 DUS volumes in real-time...|$|R

As for the introduction of Dynamic Grammar Theory, after a more detailed explanation about the possible grammar, <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> the <b>acquisition</b> process greatly improved.

However, common points were also seen as, Dynamic Grammar Theory not only takes language acquisition as a basic problem and insist on birth characteristics of language acquisition {{in the same way as}} Universal Grammar, but also analyzes constructions based on a phrase-structure rule. Therefore, it can be determined that Dynamic Grammar Theory is one study in the extension line of Generative Grammar Theory, and not a completely different theory altogether.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} {{spectroscopic imaging}} (MRSI) enables acquisition of spatial-spectral nuclear spin distributions. Compared to conventional MRI, the additional spectral information provides {{a powerful tool}} for in vivo study of biological tissues. However, considerable practical challenges, which cannot be overcome using the traditional Fourier method, remain in obtaining spatial-spectral data with both high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, the choice of echo time (TE) during data acquisition affects the SNR and complexity of the model used to describe measured data. TE selection remains a complicated and controversial issue in proton MR spectroscopy. This dissertation addresses two issues, that is the problem of low SNR and the problem of TE selection. To address SNR limitations of MRSI, we first investigate a new scheme for denoising MRSI data, incorporating both an anatomically adapted spatial-smoothness constraint and an autoregressive spectral constraint within the penalized maximum-likelihood framework. Theoretical analysis is provided to characterize the denoising performance of this approach. Results demonstrate the ability of the spectral constraint to suppress noise in non-metabolite regions. However, this nonuniform spectral denoising effect may not be visually accepted, limiting the practical use of this denoising approach. We then further propose to denoise MRSI data by exploiting low-rank properties. These are two low-rank structures of MRSI data, one due to partial separability and the other due to linear predictability of MRSI data. Denoising is performed by arranging the measured data in appropriate matrix forms (i. e., Casorati and Hankel) and applying low-rank approximations by the singular value decomposition. Experimental results obtained from in vivo MRSI data demonstrate that the combination and a particular order of the two proposed low-rank approximations provide an effective way to denoise MRSI data in the case of typical severe noise contamination. To analyze the problem of TE selection for MRS data acquisition, we reconsider this problem from an estimation theoretic perspective. Specifically, we analyze the Cram??er-Rao lower bound (CRB) on estimated spectral parameters as a function of TE, which serves as a metric to quantify the reliability of the estimation procedure. This new approach provides a quantitative method for identifying potentially useful TEs in contrast to a common heuristic choice of TE. In addition, unlike empirical studies which face practical <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> <b>acquisition</b> time, the CRB analysis enables easy evaluation of an arbitrarily large range of TEs...|$|R
40|$|A precise {{knowledge}} of the myocardial fiber architecture is essential to accurately understand and interpret cardiac electrical and mechanical functions. Diffusion tensor imaging {{has been used to}} noninvasively and quantitatively characterize myocardial fiber orientations. However, because the approach necessitates diffusion to be measured in multiple encoding directions and frequently at multiple weighting levels, the required data set size may present a <b>limitation</b> <b>on</b> its <b>acquisition</b> time efficiency. Applying the principles of reduced encoding imaging (REI), four basic reconstruction schemes, keyhole using direct substitution, keyhole with baseline correction, symmetrically encoded REI with generalized-series reconstruction (RIGR), and asymmetrically encoded RIGR, are evaluated in terms of their accuracy in diffusion tensor fiber orientation mapping of excised myocardial samples. Results show that the performances of all REI schemes, at approximately 50 % reduced encoding, are at least comparable with that of a control experiment consisting of proportionally reduced number of full k-space images. Moreover, although performances of the symmetrically and asymmetrically encoded RIGR schemes are similar, both methods provide significant improvements over the control experiment and the direct-substitution keyhole technique. These findings demonstrate the potential of the general REI methodology for diffusion tensor imaging and pave the way for modified schemes involving rapid imaging sequences or alternative k-space sampling strategies to achieve even better data acquisition time efficiency and performance.

40|$|Commonality is {{a system}} architecting {{strategy}} widely used to improve affordability and reliability of families of products. However not all commonality is beneficial, and organizations must balance commonality benefits and commonality costs to pursue a successful strategy. The existing literature on commonality assumes that all commonality decisions are made within a single organization. This {{is not the case}} for NASA's human exploration architectures which are acquired through a network of prime contractors and sub-contractors. This thesis examines how the acquisition strategies chosen for NASA's human exploration architectures affect the realization of commonality in those architectures, and suggests ways in which acquisition architectures can be planned to improve commonality outcomes. The thesis synthesizes the requirements of NASA's exploration architectures and commonality best practice from existing literature. It also examines the Federal Acquisition Regulations in detail to assess the <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> government <b>acquisition</b> structures in the United States, and postulates a range of acquisition structures open to NASA. New research data is presented which specifically targets the interplay between acquisition and commonality. An assessment of practitioners' views <b>on</b> <b>acquisition</b> strategies for commonality examines three detailed case studies as well as summarizing a broad range of shorter interviews across NASA and DOD projects. Each of the postulated acquisition structures is evaluated against the NASA acquisition requirements and the synthesized commonality best practice. The evaluation demonstrates that current NASA acquisition strategies are geared towards commonality through reuse of existing components and systems, and forward-thinking investment in future commonality opportunities is unlikely. New strategies which involve less emphasis on competition between contractors in favor of greater continuity with experienced contractors are recommended to improve commonality. However, the commonality advantages from such strategies may be offset in a wider perspective by the costs of using such noncompetitive acquisition structures. by Anthony C. Wicht. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Introduction: Day Care Surgery (DCS) is the {{surgical}} care of patients on a planned non-residential basis. The {{objective of the}} study was to assess the performance of DCS in the context of a developing country within the private sector. Data from a new DCS unit was compared to internationally accepted indicators of the quality of care. Methodology: A hospital based retrospective chart review of all patients operated on within 10 surgical subspecialties was performed. The review period was the June 2006 to July 2007 (12 months). Analysis (SPSS version 11. 5) : Outcome measures included in-patient to DCS ratio in the various specialties; inpatients qualifying for DCS; overall unplanned admission rates; morbidity rates and the number of inappropriate daycare cases. Univariate analysis was used to test for factors affecting the unplanned admission rate. A logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. Results: Inpatient to DCS ratio in all the subspecialties was below recommended benchmarks. Thirty six percent (36 %, n= 328 / 910) of inpatients were candidates for DCS. The unplanned admission rate was 12 % (n= 47 / 395) with lack of outpatient insurance cover being the commonest reason (48. 93 %, n= 23 / 47). Multivariate analysis noted only two significant variables, ASA grading and postoperative morbidity. The overall morbidity rate of the DCS cases was 5 % (n= 18 / 395) pain being the most common type of morbidity. Almost 3 %(n= 13 / 395) of patients were inappropriately treated as DCS patients. Conclusions: The unplanned admission rate of 12 % compares unfavorably with other DCS units. Omitting cases of inappropriate insurance cover, the overall rate falls to 6. 45 %, comparing well to other units. The retrospective nature of the study placed important <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> the data <b>acquisition.</b> DCS is a feasible system of healthcare delivery in the private sector of developing countries...|$|R
