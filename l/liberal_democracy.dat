40|$|Much {{work has}} been done in recent {{political}} theory {{on the question of the}} appropriate scope of international involvement in the internal affairs of states. Two dominant debates come to mind in this respect: the ‘humanitarian intervention debate’, which explores the legitimacy of military intervention in cases such as massive violations of human rights, collapse of states and humanitarian disasters; and the ‘global justice debate’, which examines the appropriate scope of economic aid from rich to poor nations. In neither of these discussions has much attention been given to the particular question of the legitimacy and necessity of international military intervention, or supply of economic aid, to <b>democracies,</b> let alone <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies.</b> This omission may be due to the fact that <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> rarely find themselves in situations that provoke the outrage or concern of the international community. Even so, <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> do perpetrate, from time to time, serious injustices: in recent decades the world has witnessed <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> engaging in colonialism and occupation; <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> violating international treaties that forbid torture and indefinite detention of prisoners of war, and <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> denying political rights to minority groups within their borders.

5|$|The {{previous}} {{presidential election}} in 2002 brought major changes to Slovenian politics. The former president Milan Kučan, in office since the first free elections held in the Republic of Slovenia in April 1990 (before the country's independence from Yugoslavia), was forbidden by the constitution from running for President again, and announced his retirement from active politics. Prime Minister Janez Drnovšek of the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Democracy</b> of Slovenia stood for the office, comfortably winning the runoff against conservative candidate Barbara Brezigar.|$|E
5|$|Nasser made Egypt fully {{independent}} of British influence, {{and the country}} became a major power {{in the developing world}} under his leadership. One of Nasser's main domestic efforts was to establish social justice, which he deemed a prerequisite to <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy.</b> During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while feudalistic influence waned. By the end of his presidency, employment and working conditions improved considerably, although poverty was still high in the country and substantial resources allocated for social welfare had been diverted to the war effort.|$|E

5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, <b>liberal</b> <b>{{democracy}}</b> that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring {{reforms were}} a strong attempt by Dubček to grant {{additional}} {{rights to the}} citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization. The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the media, speech and travel. After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics, Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia and Slovakia, Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. This was the only formal change that survived the end of Prague Spring, though the relative success of the nonviolent resistance undoubtedly prefigured and facilitated the peaceful transition to <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> with the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, the Cold War raged {{between two}} superpowers: the United States, a {{capitalist}} <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy,</b> and the Soviet Union (USSR), a Marxist–Leninist socialist state {{ruled by the}} Communist Party. Expressing contempt for the U.S., Castro shared the ideological views of the USSR, establishing relations with several Marxist–Leninist states. Meeting with Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, Castro agreed to provide the USSR with sugar, fruit, fibers, and hides, in return for crude oil, fertilizers, industrial goods, and a $100 million loan. Cuba's government ordered the country's refineries – then controlled by the U.S. corporations Shell and Esso – to process Soviet oil, but under U.S. pressure, they refused. Castro responded by expropriating and nationalizing the refineries. Retaliating, the U.S. cancelled its import of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most U.S.-owned assets on the island, including banks and sugar mills.|$|E
40|$|Political {{campaigns are}} a {{relatively}} common occurrence whose outcomes range from democrati-zation and political reform to autocratization and civil war. Responses to these campaign vary, with some states resorting to military action and others responding {{in a more}} controlled manner. <b>Liberal</b> <b>democracies,</b> states with strong norms {{against the use of}} domestic military force and that actively promote democracy and political freedoms, have a preference towards constraint and, during such situations, are often attempting to constrain the actions of others. This research argues that military cooperation with <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> constrains the government from using extreme force to repress the campaign movement. The primary reason is that the cooperative-security channel provides a unique relationship with the military, the state actor responsible for the deployment of military force, through which coercion and socialization mechanisms directly flow from <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> to their security partners. The theory is tested using a new, latent measure of military cooperation and the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcome data. The empirical evidence demonstrates that military integration with <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> has a negative effect on the likelihood of extreme forms of repression being used on a political cam-paign, and thus provides one benefit to expanding multinational security cooperation initiatives involving <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|The repressive {{policies}} of the Ubico government resulted in a popular uprising led by university students and middle-class citizens in 1944. Ubico fled, handing over power to a three-person junta which continued Ubico's policies until it too was toppled, by the October Revolution that aimed to transform Guatemala into a <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy.</b> The largely free election that followed installed a philosophically conservative university professor, Juan José Arévalo, as the President of Guatemala. Arévalo's administration drafted a more liberal labor code, built health centers, and increased funding to education. Arévalo enacted a minimum wage, and created state-run farms to employ landless laborers. He also cracked down on the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour (Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo, PGT) and in 1945 criminalized all labor unions in workplaces with fewer than 500 workers. By 1947, the remaining unions had grown strong enough to pressure him into drafting a new labor code, which made workplace discrimination illegal and created health and safety standards. However, Arévalo refused to advocate land reform of any kind, and stopped short of drastically changing labor relations in the countryside.|$|E
