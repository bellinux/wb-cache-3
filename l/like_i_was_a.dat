In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me.

[...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E
