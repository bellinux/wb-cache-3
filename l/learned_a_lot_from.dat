This included the excision of [...] "Which Way is the Party?", the introductory song to the character Fiyero, which was subsequently replaced by [...] "Dancing Through Life" [...] in Schwartz's fear that the former failed to be a clear [...] "statement of Fiyero's philosophy of life". In addition, there was concern that Menzel's Elphaba [...] "got a little overshadowed" [...] by Chenoweth's Glinda. San Francisco Chronicle critic Robert Hurwitt wrote, [...] "Menzel's brightly intense Elphaba the Wicked Witch [...] a chance of holding her own alongside Chenoweth's gloriously, insidiously bubbly Glinda", so the creative team set about making her character [...] "more prominent". On {{the subject of the}} Broadway revisions, Schwartz recalled, [...] "It was clear there was work to be done and revisions {{to be made in the}} book and the score. The critical community was, frankly, very helpful to us. We <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>from</b> the reviews, which were honest and constructive in the aggregate, unlike New York, where the critics make up their minds before they come to the theatre."

[...] MTV stated [...] "West's breezy GOOD Fridays release gets a wintertime tune-up with Ross riding shotgun. The Miami Don's majestic contribution {{comes with a}} revamped breakdown setting up his slick boats. Still, Yeezy's verse holds up over the Boss's even with the refinement." [...] Dan Vidal of URB stated Ross brought his best to the track, writing that he [...] "steps his tired old coke-rhymes up to intense lyrical portraits on {{the final version of}} 'Devil In A New Dress'." [...] Stereogum's Amrit Singh described the production style as a throwback to vintage hip-hop beats, and praised West's extended use of metaphors on the track. AbsolutePunk's Drew Beringer cited the track as an example of West's [...] "penchant for soul", calling the track excellent. AllMusic's Andy Kellman also described the beat as a [...] "throwback soul production", writing that it was [...] "provided by the Smokey Robinson-sampling Bink, it’s as gorgeous as any of West’s own early work, yet it’s marred by an aimless instrumental stretch, roughly 90 seconds in length, that involves some incongruent electric guitar flame-out." ...|$|E

On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E

In his {{presence}} I was almost always reduced to total silence. This was an extremely good thing, as it meant that we concentrated exclusively on the music. Above all, he taught me the meaning of silence and the meaning of singing. He said I was incredibly obstinate and did only what I wanted to. It's true that I've only ever played what I wanted.
