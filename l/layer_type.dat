50|$|While {{the general}} idea sounded {{somewhat}} promising, the Hardiman had major limitations. It was impractical, {{due to its}} 680-kilogram (1,500 lb) weight. Another issue was {{that it is a}} master-slave system, where the operator is in a master suit, which, in turn, is inside the slave suit that responds to the master and handles the workload. This multiple physical <b>layer</b> <b>type</b> of operation may work fine, but responds slower than a single physical layer. When the goal is physical enhancement, response time matters. Its slow walking speed of 0.76 metres per second (2.5 ft/s) further limited practical uses. The project was not successful. Any attempt to use the full exoskeleton resulted in a violent uncontrolled motion, and as a result it was never tested with a human inside. Further research concentrated on one arm. Although it could lift its specified load of 340 kg (750 lb), it weighed three quarters of a ton, just over twice the liftable load. Without getting all the components to work together, the practical uses for the Hardiman project were limited.|$|E

New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified {{from a handful of}} existing networks. We introduce MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using Q-learning with an ϵ-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same <b>layer</b> <b>types</b> and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex <b>layer</b> <b>types.</b> We also outperform existing meta-modeling approaches for network design on image classification tasks...|$|R

In fact, there are several complementary ways to visualize and interact with the richness of data. Multivariate mapping is – besides animation – {{one of the most}} promising techniques. Starting with a sound discussion of visual variables occurring in a map, a new generic approach of multivariate mapping in high quality atlases is introduced. It supports the consistent handling of different map <b>layer</b> <b>types</b> (point, line, area, raster, chart, etc.) and multiple visual variables.

40|$|Abstract [...] Saponites and vermiculites {{may assume}} at least 11 ordered or semi-ordered layer {{stacking}} sequences. For a given relative humidity, the <b>layer</b> stacking <b>type</b> assumed {{is a function}} of the nature of the interlayer cation, the layer charge density, the mean size of the particles, and the di- or trioctahedral character of the sheets. For each interlayer cation, a succession of <b>layer</b> stacking <b>types</b> can be observed as relative humidity increases. For high relative humidity, some particular <b>layer</b> stacking <b>types</b> exist, but only for low-charge minerals. No other differences have been found for saponites and vermiculites in each successive <b>layer</b> stacking <b>type.</b> The degree of order that these <b>layer</b> stacking <b>types</b> imply is probably due to the existence of electrostatic bonds between hydrated interlayer cations and surface oxygens of the substituted tetrahedra. For octahedrally substituted 2 : 1 phyllosilicates, however, the disorder of the layer stacking sequences is related to a highly delocalized istribution ofnegative charges on the surface oxygens of the layers. A study of the superstructures detected in saponites and vermiculites indicates that he interlayer cations tend to be located as far as possible from one another. The superstructures exist only with some cations and some <b>layer</b> stacking <b>types</b> and if the layer charge density is compatible with the charge produced by the cation distribution i this kind of superstructure.
