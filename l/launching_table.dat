25|$|Under {{the vehicle}} is a <b>Launch</b> <b>Table,</b> with six Tail Service Masts (TSMs), two for each CBC. The <b>Launch</b> <b>Table</b> {{supports}} the vehicle on the pad, and the TSMs provide further support and fueling functions for the CBCs. The vehicle is mounted to the <b>Launch</b> <b>Table</b> by a <b>Launch</b> Mate Unit (LMU), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle by bolts that sever at launch. Behind the <b>Launch</b> <b>Table</b> is a Fixed Pad Erector (FPE), which uses two long-stroke hydraulic pistons to raise the vehicle to the vertical position after being rolled to the pad from the Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF). Beneath the <b>Launch</b> <b>Table</b> is a flame duct, which deflects the rocket's exhaust away from the rocket or facilities.|$|R

50|$|The 23rd, {{and last}} DSP {{satellite}} {{was scheduled to}} be launched on 1 April 2007, aboard a Delta IV Heavy rocket, but the launch was postponed until mid-August 2007 after two structural cracks were found in the metal <b>launch</b> <b>table</b> at pad 37B, caused by a fuel leak during testing.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the last}} launch, LC-15 {{remained}} active until its retirement from service. Much of the complex, including the tower, launch stand and erector was demolished in June 1967. The blockhouse, cable tunnel, {{and parts of}} the <b>launch</b> <b>table</b> and ramp were abandoned in place, and were all still standing until the demolition of the blockhouse in 2011.|$|R
50|$|The {{lifting frame}} was fitted with outlet sockets and wiring for field telephones. A main {{connection}} from the armoured launch vehicle switchboard to inlet sockets on the lifting frame provided circuits for four field phone stations at the Meillerwagen - one each {{at the upper}} and lower folding work platforms and two at the <b>launch</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
50|$|The rocket was {{provided}} with ejecting umbilical connectors, although their precise deployment evolved. Initially these 'Stotz plugs' travelled as Meillerwagen accessories, stowed on the lifting frame {{along with their}} cables. Later, the Stotz plugs were stowed in the cable box, and a ten metre cable mast was stowed on the lifting frame for ultimate erection on the <b>launch</b> <b>table</b> at the <b>launch</b> site.|$|R
50|$|Astrium assembles each Ariane 5 {{launcher}} in the Launcher Integration Building. The {{vehicle is}} then {{delivered to the}} Final Assembly Building for payload integration by Arianespace. The Final Assembly Building is located 2.8 km from the ELA-3 launch zone. The mobile <b>launch</b> <b>table</b> completes the trip with an Ariane 5 in about one hour. It is then secured in place over the launch pad's flame ducts.|$|R
50|$|A short railway is used {{within the}} Guiana Space Centre (this short railway is for {{transporting}} spacecraft inside the base to the launch pad, not for passenger use). The railway is double tracked {{and used by}} unpowered rail cars (tanker cars, flatcars and <b>launch</b> <b>table</b> transporter platforms fitted with bogies) and are towed by rubber wheeled vehicles with railway wheels or bogies to ride along the rail tracks.|$|R

50|$|The park {{also offers}} a marina and boat <b>launch,</b> picnic <b>tables,</b> a restaurant, a {{playground}} and recreation programs. Two piers are available for fishing and crabbing, and a put-in for kayaks is available for launching smaller watercraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{lifting frame}} {{included}} two accommodations for the rocket, a nose clamp around the warhead and a pivoting clamp around the rocket midsection. Both accommodations included a saddle, and various mechanisms to assist dismount of the rocket onto its <b>launch</b> <b>table.</b> The mechanisms were operated with two drive shafts {{running up the}} port lifting frame beam. The drive shafts ran within the integral rungs, and were operated by a crewman with a ratchet hand tool.The two drive shafts comprised a short shaft and a long shaft; both starting at the trunnion end of the lifting frame, one running half {{the length of the}} lifting frame while the other ran the full length.|$|R
50|$|Before <b>launching</b> Tasting <b>Table</b> in 2008, Bartakovics was a {{business}} manager in asset-backed finance at UBS Investment Bank. He studied English literature at the University of Chicago, and studied comparative literature and philosophy at the University of Hamburg as a Fulbright Scholar.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Martha's <b>Table</b> <b>launched</b> its Success Center {{in order}} to engage parents in their children's {{academic}} success.|$|R
50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} the pivot clamp around the rocket midsection, which could move the rocket 28 mm (~1") forward or backward along its centreline. The rocket midsection was {{fitted with a}} band which included trunnion pins placed in opposition; the pivot clamp held the rocket by the trunnion pins. The pivot clamp was able to rock on a transverse shaft, thus causing the rocket to move along its centreline. After erection of the rocket to a vertical position, it was held suspended above the launch table; by use of the pivot clamp, {{the weight of the}} rocket could be gently lowered onto the <b>launch</b> <b>table</b> until fully taken up, allowing the rocket to be unsecured from the lifting frame, thus dismounting it from the Meillerwagen.|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} the construction, {{organisation}} and publication of factor tables from 1660 to 1817, in itself a fascinating story, also touches upon many topics of general interest {{for the history of}} mathematics. The considerable labour involved in constructing and correcting these tables has pushed mathematicians and calculators to organise themselves in some network. Around 1660 J. Pell was the first to motivate others to calculate a large factor table, for which he saw many applications, not only in Diophantine analysis but also in arithmetic and even philosophy. Some hundred years later (1770), J. H. Lambert <b>launched</b> a <b>table</b> project that would engage many computers and mathematicians to (re) produce Pell’s table and extend it. Importantly, Lambert also pointed out that a theory of numbers, of divisors and factoring methods was still lacking. Lambert’s ideas were taken up by his colleagues at the Berlin Academy, and indirectly by L. Euler in St Petersburg. Finally, the many number-theoretical essays that were written in the context of Lambert’s table project contributed importantly to the birth of higher arithmetic around 1800, starting with A. -M. Legendre’s and C. F. Gauss’s work. Une histoire des Tables des Diviseurs, avec des Notes sur la Naissance de la Théorie des Nombres 1657 – 1817 L’histoire de la fabrication, l’organisation et la publication des tables de diviseurs, de 1600 à 1817, offre en et pour soi une histoir...|$|R
5000|$|Signer’s [...] "action sculptures" [...] involve setting up, {{carrying}} out, {{and recording}} [...] "experiments" [...] or events that bear aesthetic results. Day-to-day {{objects such as}} umbrellas, tables, boots, containers, hats and bicycles are part of Signer’s working vocabulary. Following carefully planned and strictly executed and documented procedures, the artist enacts and records such acts as explosions, collisions, and the projection of objects through space. Signer advocates ‘controlled destruction, not destruction for its own sake’. Action Kurhaus Weissbad (1992) saw chairs catapulted out of a hotel’s windows; <b>Table</b> (1994) <b>launched</b> a <b>table</b> into the sea on four buckets; Kayak (2000) featured the artist being towed down a road in a canoe. In documenta 8 (1987), he catapulted thousands of sheets of paper into the air to create an ephemeral wall in the room for a brief, but all the more intense moment. As the Swiss representative at the Venice Biennale in 1999, he made 117 steel balls fall from the ceiling on to lumps of clay lying on the ground. Many of his happenings are not for public viewing, and are only documented in photos and film. Video works like Stiefel mit Rakete (Boot with Rocket) are integral to Signer’s performances, capturing the original setup of materials that self-destruct {{in the process of}} creating an emotionally and visually compelling event.|$|R
40|$|In January 2012, Poland {{witnessed}} massive protests, both in {{the streets}} and on the Internet, opposing ratification of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which triggered a wave of strong anti-ACTA movements across Europe. In Poland, these protests had further far-reaching consequences, as they not only changed the initial position of the government on the controversial treaty but also actually started a public debate on the role of copyright law in the information society. Moreover, {{as a result of these}} events the Polish Ministry for Administration and Digitisation <b>launched</b> a round <b>table,</b> gathering various stakeholders to negotiate a potential compromise with regard to copyright law that would satisfy conflicting interests of various actors. This contribution will focus on a description of this massive resentment towards ACTA and a discussion of its potential reasons. Furthermore, the mechanisms that led to the extraordinary influence of the anti-ACTA movement on the governmental decisions in Poland will be analysed through the application of models and theories stemming from the social sciences. The importance of procedural justice in the copyright legislation process, especially its influence on the image of copyright law and obedience of its norms, will also be emphasised...|$|R

To commemorate the event, cast members including Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Anupam Kher, Farida Jalal, Mandira Bedi and Pooja Ruparel appeared on the television show Comedy Nights with Kapil. [...] Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and director Aditya Chopra also attended a live chat with fans and a black tie event at the theatre on 12 December. The same day, they <b>launched</b> a coffee <b>table</b> book written by Aditya Chopra about {{the making of the}} film. Also in December, Yash Raj Films announced the availability of a collection of commemorative, licensed merchandise from various suppliers to mark the event. The Maratha Mandir's management ended the film's run after 1,009 weeks on 19 February2015 because of low attendance (the last show was viewed by 210 people). However, after an outpouring of support from fans, and talks with the production company, they decided to reinstate the film.|$|R
