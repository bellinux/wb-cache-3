25|$|A {{inverter}} or capsizing {{line can}} {{be attached to the}} top of the bag. This line should be <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>and</b> strong enough to attach to an independent anchor point so that if the lift bag or rigging fails the bag will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally hold the bag in the upright position, so the tripping line may be subjected to considerable load and the bag may not invert. An inverter line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize the bag if it breaks free of the load, but this will not stop a runaway lift, and a holdback line is used for this purpose.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} breakthroughs in the prevention of altitude DCS is oxygen pre-breathing. [...] Breathing pure oxygen significantly reduces the nitrogen loads in body tissues by reducing the partial pressure of nitrogen in the lungs, which induces diffusion of nitrogen from the blood into the breathing gas, and this effect eventually lowers the concentration of nitrogen in the other tissues of the body. If continued for <b>long</b> <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> without interruption, this provides effective protection upon exposure to low-barometric pressure environments. However, breathing pure oxygen during flight alone (ascent, en route, descent) does not decrease the risk of altitude DCS as the time required for ascent is generally not sufficient to significantly desaturate the slower tissues.|$|E
500|$|Some Old Court partisans {{claimed that}} Governor Desha had offered Beauchamp a pardon {{if he would}} {{implicate}} Darby and Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, in his confession. Shortly before his execution, Beauchamp was heard to say he had [...] "been New Court <b>long</b> <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> would die an Old Court man." [...] Beauchamp had steadfastly identified with the Old Court, and his claim seems to imply that he had at least considered colluding with the New Court powers to secure his pardon.

Beauchamp ultimately rejected the deal for fear {{that he would be}} double-crossed by the New Court, leaving him imprisoned and deprived of the chivalrous motive for his actions.|$|E

Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election Radcliffe endorsed Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to the Labour Party, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He told The Big Issue: [...] "...I feel like this show of sincerity by a man who has been around <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>and</b> stuck to his beliefs long enough that he knows them and doesn't have to be scripted is what is making people sit up and get excited.

The first staged New York performance, by the New York City Opera under Leopold Stokowski on 29 September 1960, saw the American operatic debut of Gérard Souzay, one of several baritones who have sung the role of Orfeo. The theatre was criticised by New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg because, to accommodate a performance of Luigi Dallapiccola's contemporary opera Il prigioniero, about a third of L'Orfeo was cut. Schonberg wrote: [...] "Even the biggest aria in the opera, [...] "Possente spirito", has a good-sized slash in the middle ... is <b>long</b> <b>enough,</b> <b>and</b> important enough, not to mention beautiful enough, to have been the entire evening's opera." ...|$|E

500|$|The Glorious First of June, (known in France as Bataille du 13 prairial an 2 and {{sometimes}} called Third Battle of Ushant) of 1794 {{was the first}} and largest naval action between the French and British fleets during the French Revolutionary Wars. The action was fought over [...] west of Ushant, the most Western point on Britanny in France, deep in the Atlantic Ocean. The British fleet under Lord Howe was attempting to defeat a French fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse which was in turn attempting to lure Howe away from a grain convoy destined for France from the United States. The future of the French Revolution depended on this 117 strong convoy which would save France from famine if it arrived safely. Ultimately, both admirals were successful in their ambitions; Howe defeated Villaret in open battle and took seven of his ships.

On September 15, the three aircraft left Iwo Jima, flying north past Okinawa, where the typhoon had blown itself out. They continued to Hokkaidō where the approach involved some apprehension.
