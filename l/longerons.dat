5|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main <b>longerons</b> {{attached to the}} frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad stressed skinning were attached. The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short <b>longerons</b> from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|E
5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of <b>longerons,</b> beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage <b>longerons</b> {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
40|$|Beam {{geometry}} varied three-dimensionally after beam is deployed. When tetrahedral beam completely retracted, each <b>longeron</b> shortened indefinitely so frames at {{each end}} of <b>longeron</b> folded together to lie one against other. Each tetrahedral of beam so retracted to achieve compact packaging of entire beam. Each <b>longeron</b> shortened by folding at midlength and ends, by telescoping, or by other means. Beam becomes crane, manipulator arm, antenna feed support, or other type of lineal structural member. Beam completely packageable, automatically deployable, and capable of having geometry varied during use...|$|R
50|$|The HD.20 had a {{conventional}} tailskid undercarriage. Each mainwheel was {{mounted on a}} group of three struts, two to the lower fuselage <b>longeron</b> at points on the wing leading edge and at mid-chord and the third to the upper <b>longeron.</b> There was a solid rubber shock absorber in each hub. The wheels could be replaced with floats.|$|R

25|$|The wings were braced to the {{fuselage}} with a parallel pair of struts {{from the lower}} <b>longerons</b> to the spars at about mid-span assisted by N-form, cross-braced jury struts at right angles. Four very short struts from the upper fuselage <b>longerons</b> to the wing centre section formed a low cabane.|$|E
25|$|The DP.VII's mainwheels were {{mounted on}} a single axle, {{conventionally}} rubber sprung to a cross member attached to the lower fuselage <b>longerons</b> by a V-form pair of struts on each side. Less conventionally, the undercarriage structure was braced by another, transverse, V-strut from the cross piece centre to the <b>longerons.</b> There was a sprung tail skid at the rear.|$|E
25|$|Its main {{undercarriage}} had a wide track, with twin wheels on short axles mounted below each engine on inverted V struts, themselves further braced {{to the lower}} fuselage <b>longerons.</b>|$|E

50|$|The S.XII had conventional, fixed {{tailwheel}} {{landing gear}} with a track of 4.10 m. Each wheel was mounted {{on its own}} cranked axle from the lower fuselage <b>longeron</b> and had a rearwards drag strut from that <b>longeron.</b> A short, vertical Messier oleo strut {{was attached to the}} forward wing strut which was reinforced at that joint by two short struts to the fuselage side. The mainwheels had Bendix brakes and the tailwheel castored.|$|R

25|$|The E-34 had a {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage formed from steel tubing with internal wire bracing. Its cockpits were open. The undercarriage used {{a pair of}} internally sprung mainwheels with balloon tyres and a tailskid. A split axle was mounted on a short V-strut below the fuselage. On the prototype, the undercarriage main legs were short, mounted on the lower fuselage <b>longerons</b> and assisted by short forward struts. The second prototype and production aircraft had longer legs fixed to the upper <b>longerons.</b> The prototype and production series aircraft were powered, as {{the rules of the}} competition required, by a 105hp (78kW) Walter Junior four-cylinder inverted inline engine, although the second prototype was fitted with the more powerful 130hp (97kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major of the same configuration.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} extra engines {{and the very}} {{different}} crew compartment, together with the removal of passenger accommodation, the AB-20 and DB-70 had much in common: the thick centre section and high-mounted outer wings, twin fuselages carrying a long horizontal stabilizer, and twin fins and rudders. Both aircraft had conventional undercarriages with pairs of mainwheels widely separated on V-struts attached to the lower <b>longerons</b> of the centre section.|$|E
25|$|The Cherokee {{structure}} is built from wood {{and covered in}} doped aircraft fabric covering. The fuselage features truss construction, with <b>longerons</b> and gussets and a fixed monowheel landing gear. The wing has two spars, with geodetic braces handling the torsion loads and is built with a fixed center section and removable outer wing panels. The wings have spoilers on the top surfaces and use a Gö 549 airfoil.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the common}} {{configuration}} {{the wings of}} the D.XVI and D.XVII were different. The D.XVIIs wings had constant chord and overhung ailerons. [...] It was mounted over the fuselage on each side with an inverted V-form strut pair from the leading edge to the lower fuselage <b>longeron</b> and a second strut from the rear wing spar to the same <b>longeron</b> further aft. [...] The structure was stabilized laterally with a further outward leaning strut between top of the forward V-strut and the upper fuselage.|$|R

50|$|The rear fuselages were {{structurally}} modified with {{a special}} internal <b>longeron</b> and reinforced bulkheads designed to take the additional loads imposed by carrier landings: an additional bulkhead (No. 5a) was fitted.|$|R
25|$|The wings had {{constant}} chord with roughly elliptical tips, with roots joining the upper <b>longerons.</b> On each side, {{a pair of}} streamlined struts from {{the front and rear}} wing spars at mid-span transmitted lift loads {{to the end of the}} stub wing. There was another, slighter pair of struts from each engine mounting vertically to the wing. The wing structure was mostly metal, with some wooden components, then fabric covered. Each wing carried a pair of ailerons with trim tabs to reduce control loads. The fuselage was built around the usual four metal <b>longerons</b> and covered with an aluminium skin. Pilot and co-pilot sat side by side with dual control in an enclosed cabin just ahead of the leading edge, with fuselage windows on either side for lateral and downward vision. Access to the large passenger cabin, 4.60 m long, was via a radio compartment. The cabin seated ten passengers, five down each side with their own window. At the back were baggage spaces and toilet facilities. Passengers entered by a port-side door and luggage loaded through a door on the other side.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Theo Slot, who was {{responsible}} for all of Pander & Sons original designs, the Multipro is variously described as a side-by-side two-seat or three-seat light aircraft. It had high and almost constant chord wings, braced on each side by a V-form pair of struts fixed to the lower fuselage <b>longerons.</b> The fuselage was a rounded, plywood-skinned structure, contemporaries remarking, as they had with other Panders, {{on the quality of the}} finish.|$|E
25|$|The Gipsy powered P-1 and P-2 {{were also}} known as the Pander-Gipsy and the Pander Supersport. The two almost {{identical}} aircraft were parasol monoplanes. The wing was slightly tapered with rounded wing tips, mounted over the fuselage by a pair of parallel struts on each side from the forward and aft wing spars to the lower fuselage <b>longerons.</b> Centrally, over the fuselage, wing support was provided by four forward and two aft cabane struts.|$|E

50|$|In 1915, Heath married Marjorie, {{daughter}} of Brigadier General A. B. H. Drew, and had three sons and two daughters. In 1941, he remarried Kathleen <b>Longeron</b> of Auckland and had another son.|$|R
25|$|The Boarhound, {{designed}} by Captain Frank Barnwell, was a two-bay biplane which used {{a method of}} steel construction which involved high-tensile steel strips, rolled into cusped and flanged sections, which were riveted together to form <b>longerons</b> and struts. The resulting structure was lighter, stronger and cheaper than one made from drawn tubes. It had a deep fuselage allowing bulky radio and camera equipment to be carried, and was powered by a Bristol Jupiter IV engine with variable timing.|$|E
25|$|All F-15 {{aircraft}} were grounded by the US Air Force after a Missouri Air National Guard F-15C came {{apart in}} flight and crashed on 2 November 2007. The newer F-15E fleet was later cleared for continued operations. The US Air Force reported on 28 November 2007 that a critical {{location in the}} upper <b>longerons</b> on the F-15C model was suspected of causing the failure, causing the fuselage forward of the air intakes, including the cockpit and radome, to separate from the airframe.|$|E
25|$|Its wings were {{trapezoidal}} in plan, {{though with}} long, rounded tips. Their thickness reduced outwards, largely from below, {{contributing to the}} significant dihedral. Structurally, the wings were wooden, each with two <b>longerons</b> which were joined into a box spar by plywood skin out to three-quarter span; this appears dark in the photograph above. The rest of the surfaces, including the unbalanced ailerons which occupied about half the span, were silk covered. The ailerons had frames of elektron, a recently developed magnesium alloy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{experimental}} model {{was built in}} the nonlinear finite element software LS-DYNA. A metal tube wrapped fiberglass epoxy composite outside (called “composite tube ” for short) was impacted in its axial direction in the simulation. The key problems about building the model were discussed later. Comparing the simulation and experiment results, we proved the validity of the model. Furthermore, we applied the material type of the composite tube to vehicle <b>longeron,</b> and carried on the simulation of automobile frontal collisions in LS-DYNA. The simulation results showed using the new type composite material could reduce the <b>longeron</b> weight to original 33. 76 % without lowering the safety...|$|R
50|$|The CAP 1 had a conventional, fixed {{tailskid}} undercarriage, {{with independent}} pairs of mainwheels below the engines; each pair was mounted on {{two sets of}} V-struts, one vertical to the engine-bearing frame {{and the other to}} the lower fuselage <b>longeron.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Spitfire Mk 26 is an '80% or 90% scale' (but {{see note}} of scale {{inaccuracies}} in the Variants section below) replica {{based on the}} original Supermarine Spitfire design. Despite its smaller size provision is made for a passenger to be seated in tandem behind the pilot. The stressed skin structure consists of 2024 aluminium alloy skins, formers and <b>longerons</b> with some fibre-glass mouldings for parts such as fairings and air scoops. The design features retractable undercarriage with differential braking to the main wheels. The aircraft has {{been approved by the}} British Light Aircraft Association.|$|E
25|$|The Coccinelle is {{a simple}} wood framed, fabric covered monoplane, with {{shoulder}} mounted wings braced by a single strut each side from the lower fuselage <b>longerons.</b> The wings are essentially rectangular in plan, though with blunted forward tips, and have significant forward sweep. The balanced rudder is almost without a fin, {{though there is a}} shallow, triangular fillet in front of the rudder, which is large, straight edged and extends to the keel. The rectangular tailplane, mounted {{at the top of the}} fuselage, carries full span, rectangular plan elevators with a central cut-out to allow rudder movement.|$|E
25|$|Weight-saving was a {{priority}} across the aircraft; the airframe, {{other than the}} steel tube engine mount and cowling, featured a wooden rectangular monocoque structure. It had a glued plywood skin, fixed to the mahogany <b>longerons</b> and struts forming the internal structure, which was faired throughout {{to result in a}} low-drag extensions. A conventional fixed undercarriage was used; it had been deemed of greater importance to reduce the aircraft's weight than its drag, thus a retractable undercarriage was seen as counterproductive. The wings, which were constructed in three sections, had a center section integral with the fuselage; the internal structure used three main spars with plywood webs and mahogany flanges, which were covered with plywood sheeting.|$|E
50|$|It {{was a small}} mid-winged aircraft, {{with wings}} and other flying {{surfaces}} of constant chord. It had no fixed tail surfaces. The triangular cross-section fuselage was unusually deep, such that the undercarriage cross-axle {{was attached to the}} keel or bottom <b>longeron.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} {{design variables}} of a deployable three <b>longeron</b> truss beam, designed for minimum member loads during deployment, are identified and {{the sensitivity of}} the load level in the members of the truss beam due to variations of the design variables is established. The analysis of the deployment models, developed in this paper, is carried out using a commercially available computer code, called DADS. Based on the results of the analysis, guidelines are formulated for the design of a deployable three <b>longeron</b> truss beam to achieve minimum loads in the members during deployment. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the applicability of the approach, taken in this paper, to other truss configurations...|$|R
