40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} upper limb rehabilitation, sound measures of upper limb function, capacity, and performance are paramount. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review investigates reliability and responsiveness of upper <b>limb</b> measurement <b>tools</b> used in pediatric neurorehabilitation. METHODS: A 2 -tiered search was conducted up to July 2014. The first search identified upper limb motor assessments for 1 - to 18 -year-old children with neuromotor disorders. The second search examined {{the psychometric properties of}} the tools. Methodological quality was rated according to COSMIN guidelines, and results for each tool were assembled in a "best evidence synthesis. " Furthermore, we delineated whether tools were unimanual or bimanual tests and if they measured recovery or did not distinguish between physiological and compensatory movements. RESULTS: The first search delivered 2546 hits. Of these, 110 articles on 51 upper <b>limb</b> assessment <b>tools</b> were included. The second search resulted in 58 studies on reliability, 11 on measurement error, and 10 on responsiveness. Best evidence synthesis revealed only 2 assessments with moderate positive evidence for reliability, whereas no evidence on measurement error and responsiveness was found. The Melbourne Assessment showed moderate positive evidence for interrater and a fair positive level of evidence for intrarater reliability. The Pediatric Motor Activity Log Revised revealed moderate positive evidence for test-retest reliability. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high-quality studies about psychometric properties of upper <b>limb</b> measurement <b>tools</b> in children with neuromotor disorders. To date, upper limb rehabilitation trials in children and adolescents risk being biased by insensitive measurement tools lacking reliability...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{are remarkably}} {{proficient}} at controlling their <b>limbs</b> and <b>tools</b> {{from a wide}} range of viewpoints and angles, even in the presence of optical distortions. In robotics, this ability is referred to as visual servoing: moving a tool or end-point to a desired location using primarily visual feedback. In this paper, we study how viewpoint-invariant visual servoing skills can be learned automatically in a robotic manipulation scenario. To this end, we train a deep recurrent controller that can automatically determine which actions move the end-point of a robotic arm to a desired object. The problem that must be solved by this controller is fundamentally ambiguous: under severe variation in viewpoint, it may be impossible to determine the actions in a single feedforward operation. Instead, our visual servoing system must use its memory of past movements to understand how the actions affect the robot motion from the current viewpoint, correcting mistakes and gradually moving closer to the target. This ability is in stark contrast to most visual servoing methods, which either assume known dynamics or require a calibration phase. We show how we can learn this recurrent controller using simulated data and a reinforcement learning objective. We then describe how the resulting model can be transferred to a real-world robot by disentangling perception from control and only adapting the visual layers. The adapted model can servo to previously unseen objects from novel viewpoints on a real-world Kuka IIWA robotic arm. For supplementary videos, see: [URL] Supplementary video: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} thesis {{examined the}} risk of upper limb musculoskeletal disorders for cleaning workers while performing vacuum cleaning tasks in {{the normal course of}} their employment. The cleaning workers in this study were from three sectors of the workforce – government schools, hospitality and commercial office space. The vacuum cleaning tasks were divided into those performed with a back pack style vacuum cleaning machine and those using a canister/barrel machine. Three observational risk assessment tools were selected to measure {{the risk of}} these tasks to cleaning workers. The selected tools were the Manual Tasks Risk Assessment Tool (ManTRA) version 2. 0; the Quick Exposure Check (QEC) (Li 2 ̆ 6 Buckle, 1998); and the Rapid Upper <b>Limb</b> Assessment <b>tool</b> (RULA) (McAtamney 2 ̆ 6 Corlett, 1993). Results of this thesis study demonstrated that vacuum cleaning is a risk to the musculoskeletal health of cleaning workers, with some variation between the tool ratings, reflecting the specificity and/or sensitivity of each tool. Differences were found between the three cleaning sectors in terms of overall risk posed by vacuum cleaning tasks. The sector with the greatest risk was found to be the government school cleaners, followed by the hospitality and then commercial office space cleaning sectors. The ‘risk experience’ difference between the sectors cannot be attributed only to vacuum cleaner characteristics, but also, the environment and length of shift worked by the cleaning staff. Further research is required to determine the difference in risk exposure between the two types of vacuum cleaner (back pack and canister) ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{upper limb}} {{regional}} self-report outcome measures are criticized for poor clinical utility, including length, ease, {{and time to}} complete and score, missing responses, and poor psychometric properties. To address these concerns a new measure, the Upper Limb Functional Index (ULFI), was developed with reliability, validity, and responsiveness being determined in a prospective study. Patients from nine Australian outpatient settings completed the ULFI and two established scales, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) (n= 214) and the Upper Extremity Functional Scale (UEFS) (n= 64) concurrently to enable construct and criterion validity to be assessed. Two subgroups {{were used to assess}} test–retest reliability at 48 -hour intervals (n= 46) and responsiveness through distribution-based methods (n= 29). Internal consistency, change scores, and missing responses were calculated. Practical characteristics of the scale were assessed. The ULFI correlated with the DASH (r= 0. 85; 95 % CI) and UEFS (r= 0. 78; 95 % confidence interval [CI]), demonstrated test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient= 0. 96; 95 % CI) and internal consistency (Cronbach alpha= 0. 89). The change scores of the ULFI with standard error of the measurement was 4. 5 % or 1. 13 ULFI-points and minimal detectable change at the 90 % CI was 10. 4 % or 2. 6 ULFI-points. Responsiveness indices were standardized response mean at 1. 87 and effect size at 1. 28. The ULFI demonstrated an impairment range of 0 – 100 %, with no missing responses and a combined patient completion and therapist scoring time of less than 3 minutes.

It is totally safe, it provides high spatial and temporal resolution, and it is nowadays available at any hospital. This suggests that it {{could be used as a}} human–computer interface. In this paper, we use ultrasound images of the human forearm to predict the finger positions, including thumb adduction and thumb rotation. Our experimental results show that there is a clear linear relationship between the features we extract from the images, and finger positions, expressed as angles at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints. The method is uniformly valid for all subjects considered. The unavoidable movements of the ultrasound probe with respect to the skin and of the skin with respect to the inner musculoskeletal structure are compensated for using the optical flow. Typical applications of this system range from teleoperated fine manipulation to finger stiffness estimation to ergonomy. If successfully applied to transradial amputees, it could be also used to reconstruct the imaginary limb, paving the way to, e. g., fine control of hand prostheses, treatment of neuropathic/phantom limb pain and visualization of the imaginary <b>limb</b> as a <b>tool</b> for the neuroscientist.

The Strain Index (SI) and the Occupational Repetitive Actions (OCRA) Checklist are two popular upper <b>limb</b> risk assessment <b>tools</b> used in many industries, including the agro-food industry. Both methods are based on similar biomechanical, physiological and epidemiologic principles, but their approach to quantification and estimation of risk factor magnitude is quite different. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the inter-method reliability of SI and OCRA Checklist. Methods: Twenty-one jobs were video recorded in a Sardinian cheese manufacturing facility. Eight raters were recruited to assess job exposures to physical risk factors using the SI and OCRA Checklist. Inter-method reliability was characterized using proportion of overall agreement, Cohen’s kappa, and Spearman and Pearson correlations. Results: Strain Index and the OCRA Checklist assessments produced generally reliable results, classifying the risk of 35 of 42 (83 %) job exposures similarly. Conclusions: The OCRA Checklist and SI risk assessments are reliable upper limb measures of physical work exposures. Both measures appear useful for assessing risk of upper limb disorders of work tasks in the agro-food industry. However, the SI is specific to disorders of the distal upper limb and perhaps most useful for assessing risk in work primarily involving the wrist and fingers.

Methods. The functional ability of the more affected hand and arm was assessed for 67 hemiparetic patients, aged 18 to 83 years (mean ± standard deviation, 59. 8 ± 14. 0 years), at 1 to 264 months after a stroke (23. 6 ± 39. 6 months) using the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), upper limb motor Fugl-Meyer Assessment (F-M), Box and Block Test (BBT), grooved pegboard test, and wrist range of motion. We tested the strength of our proposed stratification scheme with a hypothesis-driven hierarchical cluster analysis using standardized raw scores and dichotomous BBT and grooved pegboard test values.

Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should include strength training, {{in particular to}} lower <b>limbs.</b> Furthermore, simple <b>tools</b> {{for the assessment of}} peripheral muscle performance are required. Objectives: To assess the peripheral muscle performance of COPD patients by the sit-to-stand test (STST), as compared to the one-repetition maximum (1 -RM), considered as the gold standard for assessing muscle strength in non-laboratory situations, and to evaluate the responsiveness of STST to a PR program. Methods: Sixty moderate-to-severe COPD inpatients were randomly included into either the specific strength training group or into the usual PR program group. Patients were assessed on a 30 -second STST and 1 -minute STST, 1 -RM, and 6 -minute walking test (6 MWT), before and after PR. Bland–Altman plots were used to evaluate the agreement between 1 -RM and STST. Results: The two groups were not different at baseline. In all patients, 1 -RM was significantly related to the 30 -second STST (r= 0. 48, P< 0. 001) and to 1 -minute STST (r= 0. 36, P= 0. 005). The 30 -second STST was better tolerated in terms of the perceived fatigue (P= 0. 002) and less time consuming (P< 0. 001) test. In the specific strength training group significant improvements were observed in the 30 -second STST (P< 0. 001), 1 -minute STST (P= 0. 005), 1 -RM (P< 0. 001), and in the 6 MWT (P= 0. 001). In the usual PR program group, significant improvement was observed in the 30 -second STST (P= 0. 042) and in the 6 MWT (P= 0. 001).

In September 2004, Health 2 ̆ 6 Safety Matters Pty Ltd was appointed to undertake research into this area, {{with a focus on}} conducting an assessment of the upper limbs demands of repetttive cleaning ta ks, and to provide advice on reducing the risk of MSDs. The objectives of the project were to: 1. explore the impact of upper limb musculoskeletal disorder injuries amongst cleaners; 2. describe the physical and work organisational demands of the upper limb work in cleaning; 3. develop an evidence-based guide to be used in conjunction with risk assessment checklists; and 4. develop with industry, case study examples of risk assessment to address hazards commonly faced by general cleaning. The literature shows there is strong evidence to support the link between work related upper limb MSDs and physical risk factors such as force, posture, repetttion, vibration or a combination of these factors; work organisation factors; and individual factors such as age and gender. Therefore, this study investigated all of these areas using a number of quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. Interviews were conducted with 66 cleaners at 23 worksites, and these explored work organisation and individual factors. Observation of the equipment, work environment and work tasks were conducted to gather information on current practices. Video footage was taken of 47 cleaners performing common cleaning tasks identified by the Steering Committee, and these videos were analysed using the Manual Tasks Risk Assessment Tool (ManTRA) and Rapid Upper <b>Limb</b> Assessment <b>Tool</b> (RULA) to determine the level of risk for upper limb MSD associated with these tasks. Findings from this study are consistent with other research into cleaning work overseas and in Australia that has confirmed that the physical demands, work organisation factors and individual characteristics of workers present a number of risk factors known to contribute to injury and disease, including specific risks for the development of upper limb MSDs. The physical risk analysis identified that each of the most commonly performed cleaning tasks were assessed as 2 ̆ 2 requiring changes 2 ̆ 2, with wet-mopping requiring the most immediate action. The upper limb was assessed as being at particular injury risk due to the combination of repetition with the other risk factors. The interviews with workers in this study highlighted the risks due to work rates, lack of control over the amount of work, lack of ability to obtain help (if required), as well as the lack of support from supervisors. Also of concern was the reported lack of consultation (eg regarding equipment selection and work rate setting) in many businesses, together with their low levels of responsiveness to problems or maintenance...|$|R

The main theories and computational models of the motor control of the upper limb are here described and classified depending on their characteristics, in terms of biologically inspired design. This classification helped getting {{a better understanding of the}} upper limb control mechanisms for the intelligent design of complementary control systems for assistive devices. The principal findings and some novel approaches in the development of devices for tremor suppression in the upper limb are described and this knowledge is used for the development of a original neural-based control architecture able to limit tremor in the arm using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). The importance of models as benchmark platform for the development of assistive devices is highlighted and the principal steps for the development of a biomechanical 3 D model of the upper <b>limb</b> as simulative <b>tool</b> for the design of tremor intervention strategies are addressed.

40|$|Nowadays, economical, {{technical}} and ergonomic factors {{have a great}} importance {{on the design of}} the agricultural tractors. The paper illustrates the use and the management of heterogeneous product information (manual measurements and drafts, 2 D drawings, technical documentation, photos), advanced CAD modeling tools and digital human models, for the redesign and the ergonomic optimization of an agricultural tractor’s driver cab. The project development has been organized using a top–down approach in a collaborative environment. At first, a manual measurement with gauges allowed to realize a technical draft of the whole agricultural tractor and of each component part of the driver cab. Then a main skeleton has been created in Catia V 5 environment in order to specify all the datum elements necessary to model each sub-assembly of the tractor. Cabin, platform, engine, tires, seat, dashboard and controls have been organized separately and modeled considering the details related to the manual measurements and to the technical standards. Once obtained the 3 D CAD model of the tractor, an opportune questionnaire was prepared and a test campaign was carried out with real operators in order to define the more critical control devices within the driver cab, as regards to usability and ergonomic issues. An “Ergonomics’ Evaluation Index” (EEI) was defined taking into account the posture angles of the operator and the Rapid Upper <b>Limb</b> Assessment analysis <b>tool</b> available in the “Ergonomics Design & Analysis” module of Catia V 5 based on the use of a digital human model. The index was validated comparing the results of tests carried out using virtual manikins of different percentiles performing a specific driving task, with the results of tests carried out by real operators, of the same percentiles, performing the same driving task. Critical values of the EEI obtained during some driving tasks in virtual environment, suggested to modify the shape and the position of some control devices in order to optimize the ergonomics of the driver cab. The adoption of the top-down modeling based approach allowed each change on a singular component part to be automatically propagated on the whole assembly, making easy the changes on the virtual prototype...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} 8 - 12 pieces of printed fabric, which are {{cut to the}} exact size of yoga mats, are {{arranged}} on a large open area of floor. The mats suggest possible use (i. e. exercise) {{while at the same}} time functioning as platforms for small collections of purpose-made objects which resemble body parts and yoga/exercise paraphernalia. These collections of parts resemble <b>tools,</b> <b>limbs</b> and artifacts. They might appear to enable certain types of activity, in the way that a yoga block might invite a certain type of yoga position, but they are also of course simply discrete sculptural objects. These units, i. e. the ‘mats’ and the other elements that they display, are both objects and subjects. The mats allude to human bodies and serve as supports for non-human bodies. The series of mats and accompanying objects will be placed and removed according to the availability of the space (sometimes occupied by chairs/church service). The work will act as a temporal event. It’s this durational aspect that pushes them more towards the space of performance and event, liveness. The work will appear and disappear, ebb/flow in sync with the day-to-day use of the shared multifunctional space. As such the work makes use of gaps in time and space, and while there’s a sinister aspect to this sort of occupying of seemingly empty time/space with productivity (especially productivity which relates in part to the optimized performance of the body), there’s also an element of gymnastic adaptation, a pragmatic and nomadic approach to inhabiting space and through this there’s a desire to find spaces within existing structures where one can exist, where one can do as one pleases. The mats might collectively allude to a social group, a body, individual bodies and the group’s body – a body that will be taken care of by Matthew Wang. Matthew will place and clear away the mats at regular intervals, with direction from myself. Some of the objects will need to be fabricated on site, and their fragile nature will determine the necessarily delicate and deliberate movements of the person who’s responsible for handling them during the period of the exhibition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{the common}} use of lower <b>limb</b> {{movement}} screening <b>tools,</b> the limitations {{for clinical use}} are not well understood. In a movement screening context, there are two sources of variation associated with reliability measurements. These are: (1) the athlete's performance of the test; and (2) the observational ratings of the test movements made by the rater. The Triple Joint Flexion Test (TJFT) is a new movement screening tool based on work by Tainhague, (2015) with development level adolescent court and field athletes. To date, one previous study has reported objective data of intra-athlete within- and between-session variability of the TripleJoint Flexion Test (TJFT). To date, no objective data of observational ratings of the TJFT sub-test scores has been reported. This thesis is divided into 3 sections: (1) A {{review of the literature}} (2) A study of the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the Triple Joint Flexion Test reported {{in the form of a}} journal manuscript; and (3) supplementary material. DESIGN: Video based, repeated measures. AIMS: To establish the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the Triple Joint Flexion Test on screening adolescent male court and field athletes. METHOD: Seven trained novice raters rated TJFT sub tests on two occasions using real time video. The TJFT was performed by 17 adolescent court and field athletes and 182 ratings were made on each occasion. RESULTS: Inter-rater weighted agreement of the six TJFT sub tests by 7 raters on Day 1 and 6 raters on Day 2 demonstrated ‘moderate’ (AC 2 > 0. 41) to ‘substantial’ inter-rater agreement (AC 2 > 0. 61). Intra-rater weighted agreement of the six TJFT sub-tests by 6 raters was mostly ‘moderate’ (AC 2 > 0. 41) and ranged from ‘fair’ (AC 2 > 0. 21) to ‘near perfect’ (AC 2 > 0. 81). CONCLUSION: The inter-rater and intra-rater agreement of TJFT sub-test scores have now been investigated, and found to sufficiently reliable. It is un-common for both athlete and rater sources of variability to be identified for a lower limb movement screen. As such, clinicians may use the TJFT with a greater understanding of the expected variability from both the rater and the athlete. In the wider movement screening literature, reports of rater-reliability for trained novices scoring multisegmental movements in real time is unique. This is also the first scoring protocol to have reported acceptable levels of inter and intra-rater agreement for a higher threshold movement task under these scoring conditions...|$|R

Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should include strength training, {{in particular to}} lower <b>limbs.</b> Furthermore, simple <b>tools</b> {{for the assessment of}} peripheral muscle performance are required. Objectives: To assess the peripheral muscle performance of COPD patients by the sit-to-stand test (STST), as compared to the one-repetition maximum (1 -RM), considered as the gold standard for assessing muscle strength in non-laboratory situations, and to evaluate the responsiveness of STST to a PR program. Methods: Sixty moderate-to-severe COPD inpatients were randomly included into either the specific strength training group or into the usual PR program group. Patients were assessed on a 30 -second STST and 1 -minute STST, 1 -RM, and 6 -minute walking test (6 MWT), before and after PR. Bland–Altman plots were used to evaluate the agreement between 1 -RM and STST. Results: The two groups were not different at baseline. In all patients, 1 -RM was significantly related to the 30 -second STST (r= 0. 48, P< 0. 001) and to 1 -minute STST (r= 0. 36, P= 0. 005). The 30 -second STST was better tolerated in terms of the perceived fatigue (P= 0. 002) and less time consuming (P< 0. 001) test. In the specific strength training group significant improvements were observed in the 30 -second STST (P< 0. 001), 1 -minute STST (P= 0. 005), 1 -RM (P< 0. 001), and in the 6 MWT (P= 0. 001). In the usual PR program group, significant improvement was observed in the 30 -second STST (P= 0. 042) and in the 6 MWT (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: Our study shows that in stable moderate-to-severe inpatients with COPD, STST is a valid and reliable tool to assess peripheral muscle performance of lower limbs, and is sensitive to a specific PR program.

40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA Exploration Technology Development Program, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is {{developing}} a vehicle called ATHLETE: the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer. Each vehicle is based on six wheels {{at the ends of}} six multi-degree-of-freedom limbs. Because each limb has enough degrees of freedom for use as a general-purpose leg, the wheels can be locked and used as feet to walk out of excessively soft or other extreme terrain. Since the vehicle has this alternative mode of traversing through or at least out of extreme terrain, the wheels and wheel actuators can be sized for nominal terrain. There are substantial mass savings in the wheel and wheel actuators associated with designing for nominal instead of extreme terrain. These mass savings are comparable-to or larger-than the extra mass associated with the articulated limbs. As a result, the entire mobility system, including wheels and limbs, can be about 25 % lighter than a conventional mobility chassis. A side benefit of this approach is that each limb has sufficient degrees-of-freedom to use as a general-purpose manipulator (hence the name "limb" instead of "leg"). Our prototype ATHLETE vehicles have quick-disconnect tool adapters on the <b>limbs</b> that allow <b>tools</b> to be drawn out of a "tool belt" and maneuvered by the limb. A power-take-off from the wheel actuates the tools, so that they {{can take advantage of the}} 1 + horsepower motor in each wheel to enable drilling, gripping or other power-tool functions. Architectural studies have indicated that one useful role for ATHLETE in planetary (moon or Mars) exploration is to "walk" cargo off the payload deck of a lander and transport it across the surface. Recent architectural approaches are focused on the concept that the lander descent stage will use liquid hydrogen as a propellant. This is the highest performance chemical fuel, but it requires very large tanks. A natural geometry for the lander is to have a single throttleable rocket engine on the centerline at the bottom, and to have the propellant tanks arranged as compactly as possible around and above that engine, with nearly-straight structural load paths that carry the heavy LO 2 tanks as well as the ascent stage or cargo on a top deck. (The requirement for exactly one descent engine stems from the need to avoid symmetry planes in the exhaust plume that can entrain surface particles and loft them up into the system at hypervelocity.) This geometry is especially attractive since abort considerations drive the ascent stage to have as much open space around it as possible, in case the ascent stage needs to fire away from an out-of-control descent stage. These considerations lead to a configuration where the cargo deck of the lander is relatively high off the ground (over 6 meters in current concepts, using a 10 -meter diameter launch shroud). These considerations have led some observers to presume that there is a "lander offloading problem". ATHLETE has been demonstrated as a solution to this problem, walking cargo off the high deck. This paper describes the applicability of the ATHLETE concept to exploration of the moon, Mars and even to Near- Earth Objects. Recent field test results for long-range traverse are described, along with plans for testing in the simulated microgravity environment of a NEO...|$|R
