40|$|The {{focus of}} modern {{applications}} of economic reasoning to antitrust concerns {{has been on}} the more subtle efficiency or procompetitive dimensions of the scrutinized conduct. When any of these characteristics are discovered, the courts tend to find no antitrust violation. Two major difficulties arise with this approach. First, efficiency or procompetitive aspects can almost always be uncovered in any corporate enterprise, creating the potential for legitimizing almost all business behavior. Second, the legal conclusions courts reach are typically couched in terms of the business practice itself; therefore, once upheld, that practice is implicitly validated for other unrelated marketplace scenarios. Indiscriminate validations {{of a wide variety of}} business practices coupled with an excessively broad range of contexts could prove to have serious anticompetitive ramifications when assessed by more refined economic standards. In this Article, I propose a new analytic framework, one that emphasizes context rather than conduct, thereby avoiding the danger of upholding business practices in dubious circumstances. I demonstrate the efficacy of this model through an antitrust theory of countervailing power, a theory that can be gleaned from five Supreme Court cases that span the history of antitrust law since the passage of the Sherman Act. Countervailing power analysis focuses on an economic phenomenon in which parties combine in response to a <b>legal</b> <b>concentration</b> of market power that adversely affects them. The antitrust question raised is whether the countervailing combination should be considered an illegal restraint of trade. The Court typically evaluates the restraint on its own terms, looking only to whether there are competitive dimensions to it, assessing it by the extent to which the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s conduct emulates the atomistic model. Regardless of its philosophical approach, the Court does not frame its ruling in terms of how the market interacts with the restraint and whether the <b>legal</b> <b>concentration</b> or other market forces can keep in check any anticompetitive dimensions held by the countervailing combination. Countervailing power analysis offers one way to assess the restraint 2 ̆ 7 s interaction with the marketplace so as to determine whether there are dynamics that will keep the restraint competitive. If those dynamics are discovered, then countervailing power analysis suggests that the practice should be upheld, independent of whether the practice mirrors atomistic behavior. If those dynamics are not found, and the practice is sufficiently anticompetitive by traditional standards, then countervailing power analysis supports its condemnation...|$|E

40|$|International audience[Technical Session 7 – Food Processing Technologies]Introduction: The {{high demand}} for {{minimally}} processed food makes high pressure processing (HPP) {{one of the}} most promising non-thermal technologies for food application. While HPP efficiently inactivates vegetative bacteria, bacterial spores show strong resistance, especially at mild temperatures. To ensure spore inactivation in food matrices, the addition of other hurdle(s), such as mild heat or antimicrobial agents, is necessary. Purpose: HPP in combination with nisin was investigated as a non-thermal method for the inactivation of pathogenic and thermoresistant bacterial spores in food matrices. Methods: Six bacterial strains were studied with regard to the diversity of their origins and properties: Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus sporothermodurans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus weihenstephanensis, Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium sp. (botulinum type E-like). Spores were treated in a buffer, skim milk or a liquid medium simulating cooked ham. Pressure levels ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa were applied for 10 min at 20 °C or 50 °C. Nisin was added during and/or after HPP to a final concentrations of 50 or 20 UI/mL. Results: While no significant reduction of spore cultivability was observed at any pressure at 20 °C, the addition of nisin at low concentration (ten times lower than the <b>legal</b> <b>concentration)</b> during and after HPP treatment induced a highly synergistic effect on Bacillus spp. inactivation, with spore count below the detection limit (inactivation > 6 log/mL). Moreover, spores remained sensitive to nisin up to 6 h after HPP. Significance: The food industry usually pressurizes foods at room temperature, resulting in, only, inactivation of vegetative cells. The present work shows that combining HPP with nisin can lead to a synergistic Bacillus spp. spore inactivation, even after treatments at 20 °C. The addition of nisin in foods before their pressurization can, therefore, be an efficient way to ensure the inactivation of bacterial spores...|$|E

In order to obtain a representative environmental characterization, two deposits showing different mineralogies, physico-chemical parameters, chemical compositions of tailings and pond conditions were selected. Monte Romero mine tailings showed an upper level mainly composed of silicates and a deeper level mainly composed of sulfides and barite. The toxic metal content was different in both levels but high enough to exceed the regional <b>legal</b> <b>concentration</b> limits for agricultural soils. An electrical resistivity tomography survey revealed a homogeneous upper unit (3 m thickness), which displayed low resistivity values, corresponding to water-saturated silt and clay materials with an abundance of sulfides which was interpreted as the pond infilling. The La Naya mine pond presented a homogeneous mineralogical composition made up of quartz as the main mineral and chlorite-smectite and jarosite as accessory phases. The absence of sulfide phases and the low contents of metal elements are directly related to the reworking processes of the sludge dumped in this pond. The geophysical survey revealed that the pond infilling did not have a constant thickness, but ranged between 15 and 20 m. An inner groundwater flow in the infilling was recognized. The low resistivity values allowed the presence of acid waters and related subsurface flows to be identified in both mine ponds, but no acid water drainage occurred across their vessels. When compared to the Aznalcóllar tailings spill, the La Naya pond is large enough to release a similar amount of sludge, but of a very low metal content. The Monte Romero sludge displays a similar, potentially toxic metal content to the Aznalcóllar sludge, but its size is significantly smaller...|$|E

This work {{has been carried out}} to evaluate the tritium retention for graphite tiles inside the vacuum vessel and tritium release characteristics in the tritium cleanup operations. JT- 60 U has carried out D-D experiments since July 1991. In the deuterium operations during the first two years, about 1. 7 x 1019 D-D fusion neutrons were produced by D(d,p) T reactions in plasma, which are expected to produce ～ 31 GBq of tritium. The tritium produced is evacuated by a pumping system. A part of tritium is, however, trapped in the graphite tiles. Several sample tiles were removed from the vessel and the retained tritium distribution in the tiles was measured using a liquid scintillator. The results of poloidal distribution showed that the tritium concentration in the divertor tiles was higher than that in the first wall tiles and it peaked in the tiles between two strike points of divertor magnetic lines. Tritium concentration in the exhaust gas from the vessel have also been measured with an ion chamber during the tritium cleanup operations with hydrogen divertor discharges and He-GDC. Total of recovered tritium during the cleanup operations was ～ 7 % of that generated. The results of these measurements showed that the tritium of 16 - 23 GBq still remained in the graphite tiles, which corresponded to about 50 - 70 % of the tritium generated in plasma.

40|$|The {{validity}} of a quality standard for cadmium (Cd) in representative agricultural Mediterranean soils under an accumulator crop (Lactuca sativa L.) is evaluated {{in this work}} considering both {{its effect on the}} crop growth (biomass production) and the metal accumulation in the edible part of the plant. Four soils with different properties relevant to regulate the behaviour of heavy metals were selected from the Valencian Region, a representative area of the European Mediterranean Region. For all soils, the effective concentration of added Cd causing 50 % inhibition (EC 50) on the biomass production was much higher than the minimum <b>legal</b> <b>concentration</b> used to declare soils as contaminated by cadmium, i. e. 100 times the baseline value for Cd, in Spain (Spanish Royal Decree 9 / 2005). As expected, Cd toxicity in the crop was higher in the soils having less carbonate content. On the other hand, for all soils, from the second dose on, which represents 10 -times the baseline value for Cd, the metal content in crops exceeded the maximum level established for leaf crops by the European legislation (Regulation EC no. 466 / 2001). Soil salinity and coarse textures make the accumulation of Cd in the edible part of the plant easier. Therefore, the legal baseline soil cadmium content established by the Spanish legislation seems not valid neither {{from the point of view}} of the effect on the crop growth nor from the point of view of the metal accumulation in the edible part of the plant. In order to realistically declare contaminated soils by heavy metals, soil quality standards should be proposed taking into account the soil properties.

40|$|CO 2 {{capture and}} storage is {{recognized}} as a promising solution to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. Containment effectiveness of the reservoir is required to ensure harmlessness to humans and to the environment. However, leakage may occur via existing faults, an abandoned well or a sealing deficiency of the cap rock, and impact surface elements. This paper focuses on the assessment of these impacts on surface targets, especially on humans. Our objective is to provide an efficient tool for decision support based on simple modeling, which enables to assess the most critical and plausible scenarios concerning human exposure to leaking CO 2. We choose a reference scenario corresponding to a leakage through a fault or a well just a few meters below an occupied building. This scenario can be divided in different steps that correspond to different spatial zones. Since each of these steps has its own physical properties and consequently its own models, we offer an adequate and relevant modular approach to constitute a global tool: * Module 1 : Leakage from the reservoir and migration in the saturated zone through a fault or a well. This module delivers the leakage rate {{at the bottom of}} the vadose zone with an analytical model. * Module 2 : Migration in the vadose zone and the basements of the building. Through a literature review and sensitivity analyses on numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the vadose zone plays a substantial role of attenuation on the intrusion rate in the building and we highlight the most influential parameters. This module delivers the leakage rate in the building. * Module 3 : Accumulation in the building. The leakage rate is translated into a CO 2 concentration exposure through an analytical model of mass balance in the building. The concentration exposure is directly comparable to maximum <b>legal</b> <b>concentration.</b> * Module 4 : Exposure to impurities, based on a basic model of dilution rate. We propose a first version of a global, efficient, quick and easy-to-use tool for decision support, which enables to assess the impact of CO 2 leakage on human health.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of road runoff management, based on diffuse {{infiltration}} over the shoulder, was {{tested in a}} real-scale experimentation site located near Grandson, Switzerland. This new concept consists in diffusely infiltrating the road runoff in the infiltration slope adjoining the road shoulder; where road contaminants are retained. This presupposed that the road shoulder was as tightened as possible to effectively drive the road runoff to the slope, and that the infiltration slope effectively retains all road pollutants. Those two main postulates needed strong scientific verification. For this purpose, five different shoulder designs were tested in Grandson to assess which one presented the best hydraulic performance, i. e. which shoulder was the most impervious. Those designs were made of gravel mixed with humus (SGL), gravel mixed with clay (SGC), gravel seeded with lawn (SGL), a prolonged HMF road base (SH), and a bentonitic geotextile tightening (SB). Also, to verify the retention of pollutant, two infiltration slopes adjoining SGL (LW) and SH (LH) were set as lysimeter (basal geomembrane collecting road effluents); the third infiltration slope (LB) had a direct connection with the aquifer which was closely monitored (6 piezometers located up- and downstream from the road; influence of the road runoff was thus emphasized). Finally, {{to ensure that this}} new concept do not lower the road bearing capacity, deflectometers were placed in the road structure; 3 campaigns of leveling assessed the road settlement. Hydraulic assessment of the shoulders, based on 112 natural precipitation as well as 3 artificial watering tests, showed strong discrepancies between all shoulders behaviours. They had to deal with potentially high amount of water. Lag times ranged from a few minutes to several hours. Results showed that lag times were only function of the precipitation mean intensity. The infiltration process could be assessed by a modified Green & Ampt equation. The moisturizing front was frank and linearly progressed downward. Shoulders vertical hydraulic conductivities ranged from 4. 6 · 10 - 6 (SGC) to 2. 2 · 10 - 5 m·s- 1 (SGL). The exfiltration volume is function of the water volume available at the shoulder surface. The drought preceding the rain event has no influence on the stock variation or the exfiltration volume. Road runoff used two different infiltration paths: the macroporosity drives the water efficiently and rapidly, while the microporosity is less efficient and retains the moisture longer. Tracer tests (Brine) proved that the contamination first flush passed over the shoulders. This is also confirmed by the flux calculation. Runoff coefficients CR ranged from 0. 3 (SGL) to 0. 9 (SB). This coefficient decreased rapidly once the shoulder is wet. Only SB really fulfilled its task, letting water through only in harsh hydraulic conditions (100 mm; 40 mm/h). It is highly recommended for further road development: for new roads as well as old roads being refurbished. The shoulder SH proved to be inefficient for structural and material reasons. Other shoulders are comparatively ineffective. SGC must be enhanced; in that case it could offer a valuable alternative. The bearing capacity of the road was very good. The road lifetime was evaluated to more than 20 years (1 · 109 residual standard axle load). The Grandson experimental site could not conclusively demonstrate a worsening of the geotechnical behaviour of the road. This is due to the particularly good material and road pavement thickness used for this road. Infiltrations in shoulders are high enough and would have doubtless caused a loss of bearing capacity in case the road would have been more modestly dimensioned. It is therefore clear that the shoulder must be tightened. Geochemical results concerned six families of contaminant: MTE, PAH, Cx, BTEX, MTBE, and PCB. Batch and column tests allowed calculating MTE and PAH distribution coefficient Kd in the Grandson soils, as well as in other typical Swiss soils. Results showed that mobile elements are B, Br, Mo, Ba, Sb, Zn, and V (0 175). Comparisons with other typical soils enlightened the predominant influence of the pH. Batch test performed with acidic soils (pH = 5. 5) confirmed lower MTE Kd. MTE are thus more mobile in acidic soils. Other physicochemical parameters have a smaller influence. The column test performed with a synthetically loaded solution (MTE and PAH) infiltrating the Grandson soils showed that MTE are more mobile in dynamic conditions. This is easily explained by the reduced contact time between the contaminant and the soil aggregates. PAH were not detected at the column outlet, thus showing a very good retention in the column soil. Soil layers analyses demonstrated that PAH were mostly retained in the surface layers. Also, MTE with low mobility show the same behaviour. Mobile elements showed no preferential retention layer. Concerning the infiltration slope, lag times were usually greater than those encountered for the shoulders. Lag time were function of the rain mean intensity. The influence of the preceding drought was significant. Exfiltration volumes EL were high in case of large event; it could be approximated by a simple equation function of the API and surface available water. Moisture redistribution processes occurred in the soils {{as long as there is}} a volumetric water content θ gradient. Fluxes strongly varied in magnitude and direction during a precipitation event: usually from about 1 · 10 - 8 to 1 · 10 - 5 m·s- 1 and from up- to downward (evaporation to infiltration). The first flush effect was poor to medium. NaCl signal was highly buffered. The pH was also completely buffered by the soil high carbonate content. It thus shifted from 6. 5 in the rainwater to 8 in the LW exfiltration water. To especially emphasize the geochemical behaviour, an artificial precipitation test was created to control every aspect of the rainfall. It was judged very representative of a natural storm. MTE and PAH contaminants had two different behaviours: mobile elements moved mainly in solute and have concentration correlated with EC. Elements with low mobility had higher concentrations correlated with the turbidity peaks. They were transported sorbed to particles. Comparison between the particular and solute form concentrations confirmed that mobile elements are measured in similar concentrations whether the sample was filtered at 0. 45 µm, at 1 µm, or not filtered at all prior to acidification. On the contrary, less mobile elements are easily sorbed to particles. The MTE concentrations under sorbed form range from 5 % (Rb, Sb) to 98 % (Pb) of the total concentration. They had strong first flush effects. B, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, CU, Zn, Br, Mo, Cd, Sb, and Pb were identified as road tracers. Fe and Al represented 80 % of the road runoff. Overall, the total MTE concentration in the lysimeter first water collected decreased to 1 / 30 th of the road runoff first flush concentration. Mobile elements were less retained. The PAH total concentration in the lysimeter first collected water was about 1 ' 000 times lower than in the road runoff first flush. The PAH concentration was mainly constituted by mobile PAH naphthalene and phenanthrene. Cx were well represented in the road runoff. However, only heavy species were commonly found. C 32 was the most common specie. The triplet C 16 -C 18 -C 20 was always present in high concentration in the lysimeter exfiltration water. This triple is a great road tracer. BTEX, while present in the road runoff, were not detected in the lysimeter exfiltration water. The alluvial aquifer was also monitored. It is confined between the Arnon (north) and a basement till which shallows up southward. Eastern and western limit are less known but might coincide with the river. The aquifer is clearly linked to the river. This is proved by the piezometric level, EC and T follow-up. EC and temperature also emphasized the higher activity in downstream piezometer. The road runoff infiltration could not be emphasized by the NaCl tracer test. The infiltrated water concentration was possibly buffered by the aquifer volume. Also, the brine was heavier than the aquifer water: it could have plunged to the bottom of the aquifer. All families of contaminant are presented in the aquifer. However, the provenance of those contaminants remains uncertain. The groundwater was indeed as concentrated upstream as downstream. Moreover, the river concentrations had similar, or even higher, values. The contamination provenance is thus either the aerial deposition (equally distributed up- and downstream), either the Arnon River infiltrating the aquifer. The contaminant behaviours in the aquifer could be described. It confirmed the contaminant mobility previously noted during the batch, column and test precipitation experiments. Mobile substances are seen in higher concentrations, whereas substances with low mobility are sparsely found. This project thus demonstrated that the new "over the shoulder diffuse infiltration" concept is clearly implementable. Aquifer concentrations were compared to Swiss <b>legal</b> <b>concentration</b> limits. Except for Cr, the aquifer water was of drinkable quality. This proved that the concept is robust, environmental-friendly and conclusive...|$|E

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} is {{a normal}} inhabitant of the human and mammalian intestine, and is also distributed in sewage and soil. Consequently, {{many different kinds of}} foods may be contaminated with the microorganisms. Welchii food poisoning is mainly caused by Type A heat-resistant (Hobbs' Type) strains of Cl. perfringens. In England and Wales, the media of infection on the food poisoning are almost invariably meat dishes made from heated meat. In Japan, about a half of the media are fish dishes made from heated fish and processed fish products. Detection of Cl. perfringens in raw fishes, which are the main material of fish dishes and of processed fish produts, had been made only by Nakagawa et al. and Zen-yoji et al. Toxicological Types, Hobbs' Serological Types and other characteristics of the strains isolated from fishes are not yet revealed. In this paper, therefore, detection of Cl. perfringens in raw fishes was undertaken for the period from June to October 1966, and the incidence of contamination with the microorganisms was made clear. At the same time, the isolates were typed toxicologically, and were tested for serological relationships to Hobbs' Types. Moreover, heat resistance and biochemical properties of the isolates were also tested and were discussed. In the first place on the investigations, a new differential enrichment-medium (LAS medium) was prepared, and detection of Cl. perfringens became easy and accurate by using the medium. Identification of isolates as Cl. perfringens also became easy and exact by applying a new sporulation medium (AGACo medium) which was prepared by the author. In addition, it was made clear that a Hobbs' Type strain forms both heat-resistant and heat-sensitive spores. Observations of dormancy were made on the spores which were synchronously formed. On the other hand, detection of Cl. perfringens in processed fish products and in ground fish meat was also made. Then minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of furylfuramide (FF), tetracycline (TC) and tylosin (TT) for the growth of many Hobbs' Type strains were determined as an aid of preventing food poisoning by Cl. perfringens. Besides, the inhibitory effect of FF and the influence of storage temperatures on the growth of inoculated Cl. perfringens (a Hobbs' Type strain) were tested on Kamaboko (fish cake) and fish sausage. 1) In order to enhance selectively the growth of Cl. perfringens, a new differential enrichment-medium (LAS medium) was prepared by modifying the TSN agar for estimation of Cl. perfringens. The TSN agar was modified by additon of lactose and sodium ascorbate and by decrement of agar concentration. The LAS medium was used as an enrichment medium, and was simultaneously applied as a differential medium, that is, in the selective emrichment-culture of Cl. perfringens with the LAS medium, the presence of the microorganisms was judged by both blackening the medium and producing gas in the medium. Then the differentiation with the LAS medium was more accurate than that with TSN agar medium in which the presence of the microorganisms was judged only by blackening the medium (Table 2 - 1). When identified by the criteria of Benoki, in Bergey's manual (key to the species of genus Clostridium) and of Strong et al., the rate of isolation of Cl. perfringens from the 213 LAS-positive (differentiation of Cl. perfringens : positive) enrichment cultures inoculated by the body surface and alimentary canal specimens of fishes, showed the high percentages of 93, 83 and 67 respectively (Table 2 - 2). There was a little difference (in selecting Cl. perfringens in the LAS 46 ℃-cultures) between the heated and unheated specimens when the isolates from the cultures were identified by Benoki's criterion (Table 2 - 3), 2) A new sporulation medium (AGACo medium) was prepered by modifying Ellner's medium. The modification was made by adding ammonium ac etate and sodium ascorbate, substituting starch with glycerol, decrementing phosphate concentration and adding cobalt ion (Tables 3 - 1 ～ 3 - 5, Fig. 3 - 1). Spores were produced in the parcentages of sporulation above from 40 to 80 by use of the AGACo medium from all tested 230 strains, regardless of Hobbs' standard strains and of Toxicological Types of test strains (Table 3 - 6). However, the spores formed in the AGACo medium were relatively unstable. It seemed that those spores proceeded gradually to the stage of germination during the incubation period because resistance of the spores to staining was observed to decrease along with the incubation time after the sporulation. The heat resistance of spores of Hobbs' standard 13 strains formed in the AGA medium was weak. The AGA medium appeared to be inferior to the cooked meat medium as a sporulation medium for the test of heat resistance (Table 3 - 7). 3) Though Cl. perfringens Hobbs' Type s train 8238 (Type 2) is a heatresistant strain, a far greater number of spors formed in the AGA, LGA or cooked meat medium were heat-sensitive (80 ℃, 20 min), and only {{a very small number of}} those spores were heat-resistant (Table 4 - 1). In the synchronized cultures with the LGA medium prepared by modifying the AGACo medium, the heat-sensitive spors rapidly proceeded from the stages of spore-formtion to the stages of germination almost without taking dormancy (Fig. 4 - 1 and Table 4 - 2). The rapidity decreased at a low temperature (3 ℃) or under aerobic condi tions (Tables 4 - 3 and 4 - 4). The formation process was delayed by adding sodium chloride at a concentration of 10 per cent, and both the formation process and the germination process were delayed by adding calcium chloride at a concentration of 0. 95 per cent (Table 4 - 4). In putting together the results of those experiments and the results of the preceding observation on the spores of all tested Cl. perfringens strains including Hobbs' Type strains when the spores were form ed with the AGACo medium, it was presumed that the spores of Cl. perfringens are relatively active, and in general they have little or no significance in the dormant stage. 4) Every one of Cl. perfringens 198 strains (Benoki's criterion) isolated from fishes was Type A. For the period from June to September, Cl. perfringens was detected in the high percentages (68 ～ 88 %) in the unheated specimens of the bodysurface of fishes, but the microorganisms were not detected in the specimens in October when it became cool. The rate of detection of Cl. perfringens in the alimentary canal of fishes was generally low except a few kinds of fishes (Tables 5 - 3 and 5 - 4). Though the detection rate decreased, heat-resistant (100 ℃, 60 min) strains were isolated selectively by applying heat-treatment (80 ℃, 20 min) to the specimens. And the majority of the strains isolated from the heated specimens did not agree with the identification-criterion of Strong et al. (S criterion), especially in the case of heat-resistant strains (Table 5 - 5). The thirty-two strains (16 %) out of isolated Cl. per fringens 198 strains were in agreement with Hobbs' Types in agglutination test, that is, the 32 Hobbs' Type strains belonging to the Types 2 ～ 6, 8, 9, 12 and 13 were detected (Table 5 - 6). In the Hobbs' Type strains isolated from the heated specimens, the 6 strains out of 11 strains were heat-resistant. It is noticeable that heat-resistant Hobbs' Type strains were isolated thus (Tables 5 - 6 and 5 - 7). In unheated specimens, Hobbs' Type strains were detected through the period from June to September, though the detection rate showed a low percentage (Table 5 - 8). However, every one of the 21 strains detected as Hobbs' Type strain did not possess heat resistance (Tables 5 - 6 and 5 - 7). The above facts on the unheated specimens may be not neglected from the standpoint of food hygiene because it has been recognized that heat-resistant Cl. perfringens is not always heat-resistant in the case of cultures after the isolation, and it has been reported recently that food poisoning is caused by secondary contamination after cooking with heat-sensitive Cl. peifringens. About a quarter (48 strains) of the isolated Cl. perfringens 198 strains were salicin-fermentative (acid, or acid and gas). In heat-resistant strains, the 11 strains out of the 15 strains isolated were salicin-fermentative (Table 5 - 9). Then the detection rate of salicin-fermenters in the isolates from heated specimens showed a relatively high percentage of 65, but that in the isolates from unheated specimens was no more than 16 per cent (Table 5 - 10). Though the agreement rate of the salicin-fermenters with Hobbs' Serological Types was no more than 25 per cent, it was higher in comparison with that (13 %) of the salicinunfermenters (Table 5 - 11). That is, there were the tendencies that the salicinfermenters agree with Hobbs' Types at higher rate than the salicin-unfermenters, and are heat-resistant. On the other hand, Cl. perfringens has been regarded as a salicin-unfermenter in the S criterion. Therefore, in the detection of Cl. perfringens in fishes as a causative agent of food poisoning, it is considered th at the identification of isolated strains by the S criterion is improper, and that the salicin-fermenters among the isolates which were in disagreement with the S criterion are especially important. Besides, there was no correlation between each of the Serological Types of Hobbs' Type strains and the salicin-fermentability (Table 5 - 12). 5) The detection rate of Cl. perfringens in Agekamaboko, Chikuwa and Mushikamaboko (July) was 11 ～ 27 per cent in the unheated specimens, and was 3. 8 ～ 17 per cent in the heated (80 ℃, 20 min) specimens. The detection rate in dried fish products (July) was 27 per cent in the unheated specimens, and was 31 per cent in the heated specimens (Table 6 - 1). In the case of ground fish meat, the detection rate in average from June to October was 42 per cent in the unheated specimens, and was 5. 1 per cent in the heated specimens (Table 6 - 2). Every one of the isolated Cl. perfringens 103 strains (Benoki' s criterion) was Type A. Fourteen strains (14 %) out of those isolated 103 strains agreed with Hobbs' Types in agglutination test, that is, 14 strains belonging to the Type 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 11 and 12 were detected (Table 6 - 4). The MIC of FF, TC and TT for the grow th of Hobbs' standard strains (13 strains) and of Hobbs' Type strains (32 strains) isolated from fishes were 7. 5 ppm and less, 2. 5 ppm and less and 1. 0 ppm and less respectively. There was the tendency that the MIC of those antiseptics are higher in the strains isolated from fishes than in the standard strains (Table 6 - 6). The relationships between the <b>legal</b> <b>concentration</b> of FF in Japan and the MIC of FF are as follows. At the FF concentration of 2. 5 ppm permitted in Kamaboko products, 92 per cent of the standard strains and 72 per cent of the isolated strains could not grow. At the FF concentration of 5. 0 ppm permitted in sausage and ham, all the standard strains and 94 per cent of the isolated strains could not grow. In the case of fish sausage and fish ham, the inhibitory effect of FF on the growth of the test strains may be expected because the addition of 20 ppm of FF is legally permitted, and it has been estimated that the remaining activity of FF after processing is about a half or at least 30 per cent of the initial activity (Table 6 - 6) Besides, the MIC of FF and TT decreased in the medium with 3 per cent sodium chloride, but increased in the medium with 1. 0 or 0. 2 per cent glucose in some test strains. The MIC of TC was not influenced by the addition of those substances (Table 6 - 8). In the cased Kam aboko and fish sausage which were processed after inoculating the Hobbs' standard strain 8238, the heat-resistant spores of the inoculum survived even after the processing (treated for 55 min at 75 ℃ or 80 ℃). In the cased Kamaboko without FF, the viable count of Cl. perfringens reached 1. 2 x 107 / g and more after the storage for 2 days at 30 ℃, and the count increased to 1. 3 x 105 / g after the storage for 8 days at 20 ℃. In the storage at 5 ℃, the numbe r of the viable cells of Cl. perfringens did not increase, but the microorganisms survived also after 24 days (Table 6 - 10). Also in the fish sausage without FF, the viable count of Cl, perfringens came to 1. 2 x 107 / g and more after the storage for 2 days at 30 ℃ (Table 6 - 11). In the cased Kamaboko with 2. 5, 5. 0 and 20 ppm of FF, and in the fish sausage with 20 ppm of FF, the inoculated strain could not grow even at 30 ℃ (Tables 6 - 10 and 6 - 11). When the standard strain 8238 was secondarily inoculated before or after cooking (boiled for 10 min) into Agekamaboko, the viable count of Cl. peyfringens in the cooked Agekamaboko reached 1. 2 x 107 / g and more after one day at 30 ℃ without an anaerobic treatment. At 5 ° and 20 ℃, however, the growth of the inoculated strain was not recognized (Table 6 - 12). 6) An investigation was made on whether the strains, which were isolated from fishes and from processed fish products by using the LAS medium, agree with Benoki's criterion. As a result of the investigation, a new scheme which was illustrated in Fig. 7 - 1 for detection of Cl. perfringens in sea-foods by using the LAS medium has been proposed...|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{literature}} and related <b>legal</b> practice using <b>concentration</b> {{as a proxy}} for competition measurement are prone to a fallacy of division, as concentration measures are appropriate for perfect competition and perfect collusion but not intermediate levels of competition. Extending the classic Cournot-type competition model of Cowling and Waterson (1976) and Cowling (1976) used to derive the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI) of market concentration, we propose an adaptation of this model that allows collusive rents for all, none, or some of the firms in a market. Application of our model and new critical mass measures to data for U. S. commercial banks in the period 1984 - 2004 confirms that concentration measures are unreliable competition metrics.
