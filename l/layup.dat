5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, {{drove to the}} basket and faked a <b>layup.</b> Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy <b>layup.</b>|$|E
5|$|After a one-minute {{break between}} periods, the third {{overtime}} began with another jump ball that was won by Chamberlain. After King missed the opening {{shot of the}} period, Carolina's Kearns made a right handed <b>layup</b> to bring the score to 50–48. Kansas failed to score again, and this time Kearns missed his shot after being fouled, but then made both free throws. Off of a pass from Loneski, Chamberlain made a shot, was fouled, and made the ensuing free throw to complete the three-point play and bring the Jayhawks within one point. Cunningham was fouled after being trapped in a double team and then missed the first shot of the one-and-one. The Jayhawks' Loneski missed a contested, close <b>layup,</b> but King got the offensive rebound and was fouled on a put back shot. King made one of the free throws and tied the score at 5252.|$|E

5|$|In {{his sophomore}} season, Moore played 34games, {{starting}} five, and averaged 7.6points and 3.0rebounds per game. In the November17 game against Georgetown, with Temple maintaining a one point lead with 23seconds left, Moore missed {{the front end}} of a one-and-one foul shot. Afterwards, Greg Monroe of Georgetown hit a <b>layup</b> to give the Hoyas a 46–45 victory. The following game against Siena, Moore was at the foul line with a one-point lead and, with 22seconds left, hit both free throws to hand Temple a 73–69 victory. He increased his scoring average to 9.8points per game in conference play, receiving more minutes due to a head injury to teammate Juan Fernandez. On February20,2010, he scored a season-high 24points in an overtime victory over city rival Saint Joseph's, and made a critical fullcourt <b>layup</b> with 1.5seconds left to send the game into overtime. Moore helped Temple to a 29–5 record and a third consecutive Atlantic 10 conference tournament title and an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. He was named Atlantic 10 Sixth Man of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Temple Owls missed 16 {{of their}} first 18 shots against George Washington, {{trailing}} by 20–8. Lavoy Allen then {{took control of the}} team, scoring 10 consecutive points; at halftime the core was 26–23. In the second half, the Temple Owls defense held the Colonials to two points over the last 11:22, and Temple Owls won 57–41. Allen contributed 19 points and 16 rebounds, while Khalif Wyatt scored 14 points. Juan Fernandez's 19 points helped Temple Owls defeat UMass 73–67, in the Owls' first overtime game. Down four at halftime, Temple Owls tied the game at 65 with 48 seconds left off a free throw by Ramone Moore. Fernandez had a chance to win the game in regulation, but his <b>layup</b> with 1 second left was blocked by UMass's Sampson Carter. In overtime, T. J.

5|$|Anchored by {{defensive}} stalwart Russell, {{the tough}} Celtics forced their opponents to take low-percentage shots from farther distances (there was no three-point arc at the time); misses were then often grabbed by perennial rebounding champion Russell, who then either {{passed it on}} to elite fast-break distributor Cousy or made the outlet pass himself, providing their sprinting colleagues opportunities for an easy slam dunk or <b>layup.</b> Auerbach also emphasized the need for role players like Frank Ramsey and John Havlicek, who became two of the first legitimate sixth men in NBA history, a role later succeeded in by Don Nelson. Auerbach's recipe proved devastating to the opposition. From 1957 to 1966, the Celtics won nine of ten NBA championships. This included eight consecutive championships—which is the longest championship streak in North American sports—and six victories over the Los Angeles Lakers of Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West in the NBA Finals. The streak also denied perennial scoring and rebounding champion Wilt Chamberlain a title during Auerbach's coaching reign.|$|E

40|$|Multi-Directional hybrid {{composites}} {{can suffer}} from free-edge delamination, a damage mode that doesn't exist in Uni-Directional hybrid composites and can hinder the pseudo-ductility {{that can be}} achieved with thin-ply hybrids. This paper presents a new lay-up concept called ‘orientation-dispersed’ laminates to avoid this mode of damage in quasi-isotropic hybrids. It is shown that the energy release rates at the free-edges of orientation-dispersed <b>layups</b> are significantly lower than those in ‘orientation-blocked’ laminates. Finally, the experimental results from two quasi-isotropic <b>layups</b> with π/ 3 and π/ 4 intervals are presented showing a good pseudo-ductility with no free-edge delamination...|$|R

The Pistons opened the third quarter with a 9–2 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a <b>layup</b> from Jamaal Tinsley heading into the fourth quarter. Richard Hamilton and Lindsey Hunter started the last quarter with consecutive three-point field goals, as the Pistons cut into the lead again. But Stephen Jackson's back-to-back field goals pushed the lead back to 93–79 with 3:52 remaining, essentially putting the Pistons away. Despite the lopsided score {{near the end of the}} game, most key players on both teams remained in the game.|$|E

40|$|Material {{degradation}} of composite materials {{is a major}} concern in maritime applications. In this experimental investigation, effects of moisture-induced degradation, using two different salt solutions with concentrations of 1. 8 % and 3. 7 %, on reinforced epoxy composites were studied by means of designed experiments. ^ Two different <b>layups</b> were compared, namely the simple cross ply construction [0 °: 90 °] 2 s and a balanced symmetric bi-axial construction [± 45 °] 2 s. The composite laminate specimens manufactured by vacuum infusion process under laboratory conditions were immersed in the two salt solutions, representing salinity levels of oceans and seas, e. g. Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, Baltic Sea and Black Sea, at accelerated weathering conditions of 65 °C. The comparative study comprised three weathering stages, specimens in the non-weathered stage in a desiccated condition, specimens subject to weathering for 15 days and 30 days, respectively. Drop-weight impact tests were performed on all specimens to obtain the maximum load of this sensitive out-of-plane impact stress state. ^ A diffusion study was performed for all <b>layups</b> and solutions at two temperatures, 65 °C and 25 °C. Thus, the diffusion was described quantitatively to derive damage state predictions. ^ Diffusion curves and diffusion coefficients of both <b>layups</b> [0 °: 90 °] 2 s and [± 45 °] 2 s did not differ significantly. This is, seemingly, because both laminate constructions possessed the same fiber volume fraction f= 55 %. Different salt concentrations did not penetrate the composite material with different rates. ^ Peak loads through drop-weight testing were significantly decreased by means of the weathering treatment. Once, the composite material was saturated, no significant change of properties occurred for the 30 days period at the accelerated diffusion rate. ^ Comparing both <b>layups,</b> the angle ply laminate significantly bore a higher amount of out-of-plane load in both cases, the non-weathered and weathered specimens in the lower salt concentration. Exceeding certain salinity, in this study reached through the higher salt concentration of 3. 7 %, the peak loads through impact testing became alike for both <b>layups.</b> ...|$|R
