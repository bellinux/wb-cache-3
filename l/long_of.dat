5|$|Epstein {{was drafted}} by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2002 NFL Draft and played in six games with the Jaguars in the 2002 NFL season before being picked up off waivers by the Minnesota Vikings on October 23, 2002, {{where he was a}} kickoff {{specialist}} {{for the remainder of the}} season. Epstein tore his anterior cruciate ligament with one week remaining in the 2002 season and had offseason surgery. Despite being reactivated during the 2003 preseason, he was released before the 2003 season. 43-year-old Gary Anderson performed the PATs and field goals for the 2002 Vikings. Anderson, had been brought out of retirement during the season to contribute to the Vikings' special teams efforts as Doug Brien faltered. Epstein replaced Brien. As a Jaguar, Epstein made 5 out of 9 field goals (with a <b>long</b> <b>of</b> 34 yards) and 13 PATs. He was 0–4 on field goals of 39 yards or longer. Of his 72 career kickoffs, 10 of them were touchbacks and his average distance was 61.7 yards. After Epstein was released, the Jaguars continued to have troubles as his successor Tim Seder was cut five games later. 8 of Epstein's 28 career points came in a 28–25 October 6, 2002 Jacksonville victory over Philadelphia. He was 2-for-2 on both field goals and PATs.|$|E
5|$|For {{his second}} season, Munnerlyn {{moved up to}} {{starting}} right cornerback after Richard Marshall was not re-signed. In Week 3 against the Cincinnati Bengals, he snagged his first career interception against Carson Palmer. In his first {{start of the season}} in Week 12 against the Cleveland Browns, Munnerlyn stepped in front of a pass from Jake Delhomme intended for Mohamed Massaquoi to pick it off and return it 37 yards for the touchdown. He went on to start five of the last six games of the season for the Panthers. Playing in 16 games with five starts, Munnerlyn recorded 47 tackles and one forced fumble, tied for second on the team with three interceptions (including one returned for a touchdown) and ranked first with 10 passes defensed, contributing to a Panthers defense that ranked seventh in the NFL in average yards per play. He also led the Panthers with a 10.9-yard punt return average on 30 returns for 327 yards with a <b>long</b> <b>of</b> 37 yards and returned two kickoffs for 87 yards.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009 preseason, Munnerlyn was {{competing}} with wide receiver Ryne Robinson for the punt returner job. In the Panthers second preseason {{game against the}} Miami Dolphins, Munnerlyn returned a punt 58yards and also fumbled one but recovered it, while Robinson fumbled a punt which the Dolphins recovered. He eventually won the punt return job {{as well as the}} primary nickel cornerback spot beating out C. J. Wilson and Sherrod Martin (who was drafted 157 picks before Munnerlyn) by the end of September. On November 29, Munnerlyn suffered a concussion against the New York Jets but said days later that he planned on playing in the next game despite the NFL's changing of the concussion policy. Munnerlyn did not play the following week's game against the Buccaneers as he was inactive but returned the next week to play against the 8-5 New England Patriots; in the game, he recovered a fumble by running back Sammy Morris. In a Week 16 game at the New York Giants, he forced a fumble by quarterback Eli Manning on the last play of the first half. Munnerlyn completed his first season as a Panther playing in 15 games total with four starts, posting 43 tackles, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery and two passes defensed as the Panthers defense finished fourth in the NFL in pass defense, eighth in total defense and ninth in scoring defense and recorded 18 takeaways in the final six games of the season.

On special teams, Munnerlyn also averaged 9.0 yards on 31 punt returns with a <b>long</b> <b>of</b> 37 yards, returned one kickoff for 15 yards and was credited with four special teams tackles.|$|E

5|$|Lee Chong Wei {{started the}} 2009 season with his fifth Malaysia Open title. He failed to secure his first Korea Open and All England Open title despite marching into the final. However, he secured his second {{title of the}} year in the Swiss Open which was held in Basel, {{defeating}} Lin Dan in straight sets and marking his first win in the finals against the Chinese opponent outside home turf. Next, Lee was surprisingly defeated by Chen <b>Long</b> <b>of</b> China in the India Open.

In May, Lee helped Malaysia reach the semi-finals of the Sudirman Cup, the first in national history, despite his unbeaten record in the tournament being blown out by Lin Dan. He won another two titles in June, the Indonesia Open and the Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold, despite failing to defend his Singapore Open title when he was taken by Nguyen Tien Minh in the second round.|$|E
5|$|Munnerlyn {{played in}} 16 games with 11 starts for Carolina in the 2012 season.

As a punt returner, he averaged 5.1 yards on a team-high 14 punt returns with a <b>long</b> <b>of</b> 20 yards.

5|$|Vikings placekicker Gary Anderson {{had joined}} the team that {{off-season}} after playing for three different teams in his 16-year NFL career.
