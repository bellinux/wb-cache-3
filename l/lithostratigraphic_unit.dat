40|$|Much of Minnesota {{is covered}} by {{sediment}} of Quaternary age that was deposited during numerous glaciations by ice, wind, and water. In this report, we follow guidelines of the North American Stratigraphic Code (North American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature, 2005) to create a framework for establishing formal <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> in Minnesota. We evaluate over 100 <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> that {{have been identified in}} Minnesota. Eighty (80) units are considered to be useful <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> of formation and member rank, and these are formally accepted in this report or are recommended to be so in future publications. These 80 units include previously named formal <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> that are recognized and accepted as originally defined, but also formally defined units that we have revised or redefined to better fit into our stratigraphic framework. The remaining <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> have been used informally in earlier reports or are newly named in this report. Additional units that are no longer considered necessary as <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> are abandoned in this report. These units include previously used units of both formal and informal status. Of the 80 <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> recommended to be retained, 47 are formally defined, revised, or redefined in this report. The remaining 33 units are recommended to be formally named in a future Minnesota Geological Survey Report of Investigations...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{the rapid}} {{development}} occurring in coastal Delaware {{and the importance of}} ground water to the economy of the area, definition of formal <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> hosting aquifers and confining beds serves a useful purpose for resource managers, researchers, and consultants working in the area. The Pocomoke and Manokin are artesian aquifers pumped by hundreds of domestic and dozens of public wells along the Atlantic coast in Delaware and Maryland. These aquifers are being increasingly used for public water supply. Two formal <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units,</b> the Cat Hill Formation and Bethany Formation, are established to supercede the Manokin formation and Bethany formation, respectively. In Delaware, these <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> host important aquifers—the Manokin, which occurs in the Cat Hill Formation, and the Pocomoke, which occurs in the Bethany Formation. Composite stratotypes of these units are identified in five drillholes located near Bethany Beach, Delaware...|$|R

50|$|Three {{large-scale}} <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> {{within the}} Tertiary have formed {{as the result}} of long-term progradation onto the Atlantic Ocean passive margin. They are distinguished from one another {{on the basis of their}} sand-to-shale ratios.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the sources}} of the dust that forms the {{extensive}} loess deposits on the Chinese Loess Plateau is crucial for reconstructing atmospheric circulation patterns and dust pathways. Dust sources are however highly debated, mainly due to the low resolution of many records and the often ambiguous nature of geochemical proxies. The widely used concept of elemental ratios as provenance indicators is {{based on the idea that}} the relative abundance of immobile elements remains unaffected by chemical weathering, thereby preserving source signals. High-resolution spatial and temporal records of loess composition were determined for two study sites and three <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> using bulk X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, and independently dated using Optically Stimulated (OSL) and post-IR Infrared Stimulated (pIR-IRSL) Luminescence dating. Four elemental ratios were chosen based on element properties of mobility and grain size, linear correlation strength and the existence of lithostratigraphic trends: Ti/Al, Si/Al, K/Al and Fe/Ti. Potential source signals were detected at both sites, at glacial-interglacial transitions as well as within <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units.</b> Source changes detected within <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> show millennial-scale variability, indicating that abrupt shifts in dust provenance are possible. This implies that millennial-scale variability of the East Asian Monsoon may be related to changes in atmospheric dust content...|$|R

The area is also marked by two significant angular unconformities; one interformational between the Asu River Group and Ezeaku Formation, and the other intraformational within the Ezeaku Formation. Mineral assemblages, poor to moderate sorting and angular to subrounded shapes of the minerals suggest a possible model in which sedimentary materials {{of northeast}} Afikpo basin were derived from proximal basement granites probably the Oban Massif and deposited in shallow to deep marine environments under fluctuating energy levels, with two major breaks in deposition in the Cenomanian and Turonian times.
