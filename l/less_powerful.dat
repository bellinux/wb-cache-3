5|$|Calabria was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc {{to protect it from}} fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being <b>less</b> <b>powerful,</b> allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} organisational accountability to <b>less</b> economically <b>powerful</b> stakeholders in the absence of formal corporate social reporting (CSR) guidelines. In addition, this study emphasises the role of administrative and institutional reforms in empowering stakeholders in a developing country context, namely, Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach - Consistent with prior literature, this qualitative study collected data through semi-structured interviews with 23 representatives from NGOs, media, civil society, customers, regulators, trade union leaders and employees who are considered as <b>less</b> economically <b>powerful</b> stakeholders. This paper draws on the demand for administrative reforms along with an institutional support structure (Owen et al., 1997) to enhance CSR and corporate accountability. Findings - The empirical evidence shows that there is a need for a stand-alone mandatory CSR to achieve stakeholder accountability. It also shows that there are demands from "stakeholders to right to know" about the company's social and environmental performance along with stakeholder engagements. There is a perceived demand for administrative reform along with institutional supports that can contribute to the CSR development in Bangladesh. These administrative reforms would encourage transparent corporate social and environmental practices. Given the socio-economic and vulnerable environmental conditions of Bangladesh, stakeholders in this study suggested contextually relevant CSR guidelines towards greater accountability. Research limitations/implications - This paper is one of the few engagement-based studies which explore the perceptions of <b>less</b> economically <b>powerful</b> stakeholders towards CSR developments in an emerging economy - Bangladesh. The findings of this study using the theoretical lens of accountability with administrative and institutional reforms lead us to conclude that companies in Bangladesh have low level of CSR towards stakeholder accountability and stakeholder engagements. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the CSR literature by highlighting the needs of CSR from the stakeholder's accountability perspective...|$|R
5|$|Critics {{found the}} Game Gear port {{to be well}} done given the system's <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> technology. Electronic Gaming Monthly staff called {{it one of the}} best {{portable}} action games. Richard Leadbetter of Sega Magazine believed that since much of the Genesis verions's playability came from the system's technical capabilities, the Game Gear version suffers in that sense; however, he still believed Treasure was able to create a fun 8-bit port.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E
5|$|If the {{variance}} in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the Wright–Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic drift ({{the variance}} effective population size), genetic drift is a <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> force compared to selection. Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of genetic drift is substantially weakened.|$|E
50|$|Craxi was {{involved}} in investigations conducted by Mani Pulite judges in Milan, eventually being convicted for corruption and illicit financing of the Socialist Party. He always rejected the charges of corruption, while admitting to the illegal funding which permitted costly political activity, the PSI being <b>less</b> financially <b>powerful</b> than the two larger parties, Christian Democracy and the Communists. Craxi's government and party were also supported by future Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a media magnate and personal friend of Craxi.|$|R
40|$|As the Asian Century {{gets under}} way, the {{question}} is not how giants like India and China will achieve prosperity for their peoples, but how the smaller, <b>less</b> economically <b>powerful</b> countries will be able to experience the ‘warmth’ of the wealth of nations. 2 ̆ 2 Sustainable growth and shared prosperity’ is one way to close the gap, 2 ̆ 2 says Suvit Maesincee, director of the Sasin Institute for Global Affairs (SIGA) at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok...|$|R
5000|$|Another, <b>less</b> advantageous, <b>powerful</b> {{determinant}} of clique formation is socioeconomic class. This trend {{was first published}} in the famous [...] "Elmtown's Youth Study", which found that [...] "almost never did adolescents from one social class associate with students from a class that was two ranks higher or lower". A diverse array of follow-up studies have confirmed that class-consciousness steadily increases throughout adolescence, so that by mid-adolescence clique membership across significantly different social backgrounds is highly anomalous.|$|R
5|$|<b>Less</b> <b>powerful</b> {{woodland}} owls such as {{the little}} owl and the long-eared owl cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} tawny owl allowed the long-eared owl to become the dominant owl. Similarly, where the tawny owl has moved into built-up areas, it tends to displace barn owls from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.|$|E
5|$|The BT19 was {{initially}} {{fitted with a}} Hewland HD (Heavy Duty) gearbox, originally designed for use with <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> 2-litre engines. The greater power of the 3-litre Repco engine {{was more than the}} gearbox could reliably transmit when accelerating at full power from rest, with the result that Brabham normally made very gentle starts to avoid gearbox breakages. The HD was later replaced with the sturdier DG (Different Gearbox) design, produced at the request of both Brabham and Dan Gurney's Anglo American Racers team. It later became a popular choice for other constructors.|$|E
5|$|The {{pilot and}} gunner/radio {{operator}} sat in tandem, {{back to back}} in a single pressurized cockpit, protected by armour plates to their front and rear, {{as well as by}} a bulletproof windscreen, seated on ejection seats. The aircraft was intended to use Klimov VK-1 engines, a derivative of the Rolls-Royce Nene II, but the engine was still under development, so <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> Kuznetsov RD-45s were substituted instead. The aircraft carried a Toryii-1 radar for use by the gunner/radio operator.|$|E
5000|$|All genestealer-infected humans produce {{what are}} known as [...] "genestealer hybrids." [...] Hybrids {{reproduce}} like the host species and produce more hybrids. With each subsequent generation, the hybrids become less and less like purestrain genestealers in appearance. The first generation is depicted as slightly more intelligent than purestrain genestealers and only slightly <b>less</b> physically <b>powerful.</b> A 4th generation hybrid is nearly human in appearance and intelligence. Unfortunately, when 4th generation hybrids reproduce, they produce only purestrain genestealers. These genestealers can continue the process by infecting non-infected humans.|$|R
50|$|Balancing {{encompasses}} {{the actions that}} a particular state or group of states take in order to equalise the odds against more powerful states; that {{is to make it}} more difficult and hence <b>less</b> likely for <b>powerful</b> states to exert their military advantage over the weaker ones.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{selected}} {{as one of the}} top ten films of 1981 by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.

5|$|The {{position}} of governor has {{developed over the}} course of two centuries. It has become considerably more powerful since the mid-20th century after decades of struggle with the Indiana General Assembly and Indiana Supreme Court to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government. Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> than their counterparts in most other states.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 31 May 1809 was a naval {{skirmish}} in the Bay of Bengal {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars. During the action, an Honourable East India Company convoy carrying goods worth over £500,000 was attacked and partially {{captured by the}} French frigate Caroline. The three East Indiamen {{that made up the}} convoy fought against their opponent with their own batteries of cannon but ultimately were <b>less</b> <b>powerful,</b> less manoeuvrable and less trained than their opponent and were defeated one by one; only the smallest of the three escaped. The action was the first in a string of attacks on important convoys in the Indian Ocean by French cruisers operating from Île de France and Île Bonaparte during a concerted campaign against British shipping in the region.|$|E
50|$|This album {{continues}} a stylistic {{change from}} power metal {{into a more}} progressive sound, with multiple overlaid vocals, choirs, orchestral keys and guitar leads and <b>less</b> emphasis on <b>powerful</b> guitar riffs and heavy rhythms. As a result, drummer Thomas Stauch would leave the group, citing dissatisfaction with the direction the group was going in.|$|R
50|$|The Sindar {{were happy}} in Middle-earth, {{but once the}} desire for the Sea was aroused in them, {{they could not be}} content until they sailed to Eldamar.

60|$|Then gradually, as {{the minutes}} sped on, {{she saw the}} strong soul within him make a sudden fight against the {{darkness}} of his despair: {{the movement of the}} fingers became <b>less</b> listless; the <b>powerful,</b> energetic figure straightened itself out; remembrance of other matters, other interests than his own began to lift the overwhelming burden of his grief.|$|R
5|$|The Excellency of Works, {{also known}} as the Minister of Works, was <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> than his {{previous}} counterpart, the Imperial Counselor. This official's advisory and censorial responsibilities coincided with those of two other Excellencies, forming a tripartite cabinet arrangement. Unlike the abolished Imperial Counselor, he was given the specialized role of overseeing public works projects throughout the empire. The Excellency of Works was responsible for the construction of city walls, towns, canals, irrigation ditches, dykes and dams, and other structural engineering projects. The Court Architect supervised only imperial building projects. The Excellency of Works made annual reports to the throne about the progress of local administrations' conduct of construction projects. He was given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister of the Imperial Clan, Minister of Finance, and Minister Steward.|$|E
5|$|As the Mary Rose {{was built}} and served {{during a period}} of rapid {{development}} of heavy artillery, her armament was a mix of old designs and innovations. The heavy armament was a mix of older-type wrought iron and cast bronze guns, which differed considerably in size, range and design. The large iron guns were made up of staves or bars welded into cylinders and then reinforced by shrinking iron hoops and breech loaded, from the back, and equipped with simpler gun-carriages made from hollowed-out elm logs with only one pair of wheels, or without wheels entirely. The bronze guns were cast in one piece and rested on four-wheel carriages which were essentially the same as those used until the 19th century. The breech-loaders were cheaper to produce and both easier and faster to reload, but could take <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> charges than cast bronze guns. Generally, the bronze guns used cast iron shot and were more suited to penetrate hull sides while the iron guns used stone shot that would shatter on impact and leave large, jagged holes, but both could also fire a variety of ammunition intended to destroy rigging and light structure or injure enemy personnel.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, two <b>less</b> <b>powerful</b> T single-car {{units were}} built, {{designed}} to be prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, they were put into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E
50|$|Berger founded The Institute on Culture, Religion, and World Affairs at Boston University in 1985. It is a world-center for research, education, {{and public}} {{scholarship}} {{on religion and}} world affairs. Some of the questions it attempts to answer are: How do religion and values affect political, economic, and public ethical developments around the world? Defying earlier forecasts, why have religious actors and ideas become more rather than <b>less</b> globally <b>powerful</b> in recent years? and In a world of increasing religious and ethical diversity, {{what are the implications}} of the revival of public religion for citizenship, democracy, and civil coexistence?

50|$|Particularly in the {{developing}} world, conflict over land rights due {{to the effects of}} globalization has led to <b>less</b> politically <b>powerful</b> groups, such as farmers, losing or forfeiting their land, resulting in obligatory migration into cities. In China, where land acquisition measures are forceful, there has been far more extensive and rapid urbanization (54%) than in India (36%), where peasants form militant groups (e.g. Naxalites) to oppose such efforts. Obligatory and unplanned migration often results in rapid growth of slums. This is also similar to areas of violent conflict, where people are driven off their land due to violence. Bogota, Colombia is one example of this.|$|R
