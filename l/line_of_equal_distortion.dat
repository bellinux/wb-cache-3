50|$|Aerography is the {{production}} of weather charts. The information is supplied by radiosonde observations, principally. Constant-pressure charts are routinely constructed at standard air pressures. Standard air pressures are 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, and 200 millibars (hectopascals) (hPa) (SI). Weather charts are sometimes drawn at lower air pressures that occur above 40,000 feet (12 km). The <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> air pressure are called isobars. Isotherms are the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> air temperature.|$|R
500|$|When {{analyzing}} {{a weather}} map, a station model is plotted at each point of observation. Within the station model, the temperature, dewpoint, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, pressure tendency, and ongoing weather are plotted. The {{circle in the}} middle represents cloud cover; fraction it is filled in represents the degree of overcast. Outside the United States, temperature and dewpoint are plotted in degrees Celsius. The wind barb points in the direction from which the wind is coming. Each full flag on the wind barb represents [...] of wind, each half flag represents [...] When winds reach , a filled in triangle is used for each [...] of wind. In the United States, rainfall plotted {{in the corner of}} the station model are in [...] inches. The international standard rainfall measurement unit is the millimeter. Once a map has a field of station models plotted, the analyzing isobars (<b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> pressure), isallobars (<b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> pressure change), isotherms (<b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> temperature), and isotachs (<b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> wind speed) are drawn. The abstract weather symbols were devised to take up the least room possible on weather maps.|$|R
