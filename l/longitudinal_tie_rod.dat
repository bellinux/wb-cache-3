50|$|<b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> style {{hydraulic}} cylinders use high strength threaded steel rods {{to hold the}} two end caps to the cylinder barrel. They are most often seen in industrial factory applications. Small bore cylinders usually have 4 <b>tie</b> <b>rods,</b> and large bore cylinders may require as many as 16 or 20 <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> in order to retain the end caps under the tremendous forces produced. <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> style cylinders can be completely disassembled for service and repair, {{and they are not}} always customizable.|$|R
40|$|The <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> of an {{aircraft}} towing tractor failed during trial runs. The <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> had been circumferentially welded on to a bracket. Microscopic examination {{confirmed that the}} failure was brittle in nature and due to poor quality weld. With a modification of the weld design, the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> has withstood proof loading {{and there was no}} cracking after proof loading...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> in the Duomo are {{structural}} elements, {{subject to}} monotonic loading and cyclic loading. Non-destructive testing {{is used to}} find cracks and determine their geometry. Lamb waves are applied to determine the presence of cracks in the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> and to estimate their positions. The cracks are located using eddy current testing. Finally the geometries of the cracks are determined using active infrared thermography. Experimental testing {{in the field of}} fracture mechanics is done to determine the fracture toughness of wrought iron. Combining the geometry of the crack with the fracture toughness of the material, leads to an estimation of the critical crack size. The <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are made of wrought iron. The material properties are very heterogeneous. A <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is made out of multiple wrought iron bars of 1 - 1. 5 meters. These bars are welded together under an angle of 27 °. Cracks of two damaged <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are found to be under such an angle. The search for cracks will be concentrated on inclined cracks with a repetition of 1 - 1. 5 meters. Lamb waves is the first technique applied. An ultrasonic tomograph A 1040 MIRA is used for testing. The modelling of Lamb waves travelling in <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and the signal processing are based on the possibilities of the MIRA. The dispersion behaviour of Lamb waves is modelled to understand the wave propagation in <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and the influence it has on the testing done with the MIRA. Using this knowledge, proper testing settings are found. Subsequently, signal processing is considered. The main objective of this part {{is to be able to}} identify cracks present in the <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> The position of the cracks in the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is determined using eddy current testing. Commercial eddy current probes are too sensitive to discontinuities to be applied to <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> Therefore, new probes are developed to overcome this drawback. Two probes are designed, both for the horizontal face and for the vertical face of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> The vertical face of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are best accessible. Therefore, on-site testing is done with the probe specially designed for that face. Active infrared thermography is implemented to establish the geometry of the crack. A finite element analysis has been performed to model the propagation of heat through a <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> This is followed by experimental testing in the laboratory carried out on a broken <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> Finally, the results of the modelling and of the experimental testing are compared. The last part has a fracture mechanical nature. The fracture toughness of the material is determined assuming both linear-elastic and elastic-plastic material behaviour. Also the fatigue behaviour is evaluated. The values obtained from experimental testing have been applied to a simplified model of the crack geometry to determine the critical crack size of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod,</b> for monotonic loading, and the threshold crack size, for cyclic loading. Fatigue life is predicted taking the threshold crack size as the initial crack size and the critical crack size as the final crack size. <br/...|$|R
5000|$|In automobiles, the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> {{are part}} of the {{steering}} mechanism. They differ from the archetypal <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> by both pushing and pulling (operating in both tension and compression). In the UK, these items are generally referred to as track rods.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tie</b> <b>rods</b> or Track rods are an {{integral}} part of vehicle’s steering system. Just as its name suggests a <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> <b>ties</b> vehicle’s steering rack to the steering arm. <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> may get fail due to varying forces and bumping of vehicle during steering. The forces from the steering are also considered during the static condition of car. Vibration and buckling of <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> has been continuously a concern which may lead to structural failure if the resulting vibration and stresses are undesirable and excessive. So research work is aimed to assess buckling strength and compare buckling performance of <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> for different materials. Finite element models of the <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> also analyzed to obtain stiffness and stress distributions in each component. Based on the experimental test results, theoretical calculation results and finite element analysis with NASTRAN results, stiffness values are validated. The mode shape and natural frequency results for different materials obtained in the normal modal analysis are compared. In buckling analysis, the load factor obtained for different materials were compared and critical buckling load is calculated and is validated by theoretical calculations...|$|R
50|$|Bump steer can be {{adjusted}} by moving any of the front suspension components pickup points Up, down, in or out. For example: Say the inner <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> mounting point is moved up either by moving the rack or modifying the pitman arm mounting point or arm drop. The result is the <b>tie</b> <b>rod's</b> arc will change. It will then require {{a change in the}} <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> length to be in proper alignment so the radius of the arc will change as well. If the radius arc of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is longer than stock on a front steer setup then the car will have more toe understeer. If the same scenario was applied to a rear steering design, then the car would exhibit less toe understeer. This is because the effective length of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> is affected by its static length/arc radius, its pickup points and the angle of its arc during each phase of suspension travel in relation to the control arms.|$|R

The support structure for the cold mass is composed of eight longitudinal and four radial <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
50|$|In general, {{because the}} ratio of the typical <b>tie</b> <b>rod's</b> length to its cross section is usually very large, it would buckle under the action of {{compressive}} forces. The working strength of a <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is the product of the allowable working stress and the rod's minimum cross-sectional area.|$|R

In these other applications, they are typically called <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> ends or, when they are an inner <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> end on a rack-and-pinion steering system, they are called inner socket assemblies.

40|$|The ATLAS Barrel Toroid (BT) {{consists}} of 8 superconducting coils of 25 m length and 5 m width. Each coil {{is equipped with}} eight titanium alloy <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> acting as support for the magnetic forces, the intensity {{of which will be}} up to 180 t for the most loaded one. The B 0 model coil is about 1 / 3 length scale of the BT, equipped with three <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> In order to simulate the behavior of the coil supports, a test facility has been built to test individual <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> at cryogenic temperature. The initial aim was to verify the amount of stick and slip, the possibility of it occurring during the excitation and the flexion of the support at the anchoring point on the magnet. This was achieved by inducing in the support the same movements foreseen during the cool-down and the excitation of the magnet and loading with the same forces. Following the evolution of the project it was decided to test the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> simply in traction at 250 tons, without displacements.

The technology would have been available {{at the time of the}} initial construction, but the extra support might not have been considered necessary until after the collapse in 1284, or even later. In the 1960s, the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were removed; the thinking was that they were ungraceful and unnecessary. However, the oscillations created by the wind became amplified, and the choir partially disassociated itself from the transept. Subsequently, the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were reinstalled, but this time with rods made of steel. Since steel is less ductile than iron, the structure became more rigid, possibly causing additional fissures.|$|R

The classical preload design {{method of}} prestressed frame of hydraulic presses {{is based on}} the assumption that the beams of the frame are rigid, which is not agree with practice. In order to eliminate the unbalance load of the frame of a 100 MN hydraulic press due to improper prestressing, <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> preload distribution in prestressing of the frame is researched with respectively mechanics of materials and the finite element methods.

50|$|The {{longitudinal}} baulks, {{and therefore}} the rails, were kept to gauge by 'transoms' - transverse timber spacers - and iron tie-bars. The transom kept the longitudinals from getting too close together; the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> stopped them spreading too far apart.

50|$|Most {{prevalent}} work {{principle for}} CSH is Bell Crank Mechanism. The Bell crank lever rotates around the Fulcrum point.

When the pipe moves up the bell crank lever will rotate (in the clock wise direction) & the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> connected to spring will be pushed out thus allowing the spring to expand or relax.|$|R
