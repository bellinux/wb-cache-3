25|$|Spoon bits are the {{traditional}} boring tools {{used with a}} brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their key advantage over regular brace bits and power drill bits is that {{the angle of the}} hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is {{that they do not have}} a <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> peek out the other side.|$|E
2500|$|Another problem arises {{because of}} the {{geometry}} of the tonearm. Master recordings are cut on a recording lathe where a sapphire stylus [...] moves radially across the blank, suspended on a straight track and driven by a <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> Most turntables use a pivoting tonearm, introducing side forces and pitch and azimuth errors, and thus distortion in the playback signal. Various mechanisms were devised in attempts to compensate, {{with varying degrees of}} success. See more at phonograph.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Maudslay, {{who trained}} {{a school of}} machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a {{mechanic}} with superior ability who had been employed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of Jan Verbruggen. In 1774 Jan Verbruggen had installed a horizontal boring machine in Woolwich {{which was the first}} industrial size Lathe in the UK. He was hired away by Joseph Bramah for the production of high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship. [...] Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe. [...] Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> [...] Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template. [...] The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions, although not entirely Maudslay's idea, he {{was the first person to}} build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> slide rest and change gears.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOur {{purpose is}} to derive {{equations}} for variable pitch helix and helicoids, based on screw matrix transformations. Also mathematical models for the surface geometry of single, double, and Archimedean double trapezoidal threaded variable pitch <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> are presented. Ther result of this work {{is important in the}} computer-aided design and manufacturing of trapezoidal threaded variable pitch <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> for industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Three <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> are {{provided}} for adjusting {{the position of}} a traversing plate. Each of the three <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> is threaded through a collar that is press fitted through the center of one of three pinion gears. A sun gear meshes with all three pinion gears and transversely moves the three <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> upon actuation of a drive gear. The drive gear meshes with the sun gear and is driven by a handle or servomotor. When the handle or servomotor rotates the drive gear, the sun gear rotates causing the three pinion gears to rotate, thus, causing transverse movement of the three <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> and, accordingly, transverse movement of the transversing plate. When the drive gear rotates, the traversing plate is driven {{in and out of a}} microwave cavity. Thus, the length or size of the cavity can be tuned while maintaining the traversing plate in an exact parallel relationship with an opposing plate on another end of the cavity...|$|R
5000|$|In machine {{linkages}} such as <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> or jackscrews, in contrast, friction must be minimized. [...] Therefore threads {{with smaller}} angles are used: ...|$|R
50|$|A traveling-nut linear {{actuator}} has a motor that stays attached to {{one end of}} the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> (perhaps indirectly through a gear box), the motor spins the <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> and the lead nut is restrained from spinning so it travels up and down the <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|E
50|$|Example: A CNC {{vertical}} mill has {{a vertical}} <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> on the Z-axis. A low <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch (i.e. 5 {{turns per inch}} or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, {{the weight of the}} spindle will cause the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> to rotate as the spindle motor falls down. Obviously this is a bad thing. The solution to prevent back-driving is to use a finer (higher) <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch (i.e. 10tpi or greater) or have a locking mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> A <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> has a continuous helical thread machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is a lead nut or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|E
50|$|In early days, before {{televisions}} came standard with 75Ω {{coaxial antenna}} connectors, cable boxes came with adapters {{that would allow}} the coaxial cable to connect to the 300Ω twin <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> used with traditional antennas.|$|R
50|$|Some {{mechanical}} {{linear actuators}} only pull, such as hoists, chain drive and belt drives. Others only push (such as a cam actuator). Pneumatic and hydraulic cylinders, or <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> {{can be designed}} to generate force in both directions.|$|R
5000|$|... (e) Acme thread - With its 30° {{thread angle}} this has higher {{friction}} than the square thread, but {{is easier to}} manufacture {{and can be used}} with a split nut to adjust for wear. [...] It is widely used in vises, C-clamps, valves, scissor jacks and <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> in machines like lathes.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{miniature}} electro-mechanical {{linear actuator}} where the lead nut {{is part of}} the motor. The <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> does not rotate, so as the lead nut is rotated by the motor, the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is extended or retracted.|$|E
5000|$|A traveling-screw linear {{actuator}} has a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> that passes entirely through the motor.In a traveling-screw {{linear actuator}}, the motor [...] "crawls" [...] {{up and down}} a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> that is restrained from spinning. The only spinning parts are inside the motor, and may not be visible from the outside.|$|E
50|$|In manual linear stages, {{a control}} knob {{attached}} to a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is typically used. The knob may be indexed to indicate its angular position. The linear displacement of the stage {{is related to the}} angular displacement of the knob by the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch. For example if the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch is 0.5 mm then one full revolution of the knob will move the stage platform 0.5 mm relative to the stage base. If the knob has 50 index marks around its circumference, then each index division is equivalent to 0.01 mm of linear motion of the stage platform.|$|E

Drive unit contains three parallel subunits. Rotations of <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> in three subunits coordinated to obtain desired motions in three degrees of freedom. Suitable for both variable-polarity plasma arc welding and gas/tungsten arc welding...|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> have {{multiple}} [...] "starts". This means they {{have multiple}} threads alternating {{on the same}} shaft. One way of visualizing this is {{in comparison to the}} multiple color stripes on a candy cane. This allows for more adjustment between thread pitch and nut/screw thread contact area, which determines the extension speed and load carrying capacity (of the threads), respectively.|$|R
5000|$|The {{amount of}} {{rotation}} of an accurately made screw {{can be directly}} and precisely correlated to {{a certain amount of}} axial movement (and vice versa), through the constant known as the <b>screw's</b> <b>lead</b> (...) [...] A <b>screw's</b> <b>lead</b> is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete turn (360°). (In most threads is, in all single-start threads, lead and pitch refer to essentially the same concept.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of the moving platform relative to the fixed base is typically controlled by a linear actuator of some form, whether manual, motorized, or hydraulic/pneumatic. The most common method is to incorporate a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> passing through a lead nut in the platform. The rotation of such a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> may be controlled either manually or by a motor.|$|E
50|$|Maudslay did not {{invent the}} slide-rest (as others such as James Nasmyth have claimed), {{and may not}} have been the first to combine a <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> slide-rest, and set of change gears all on one lathe (Jesse Ramsden may have done that in 1775; {{evidence}} is scant), but he did introduce the three-part combination of <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> slide rest, and change gears, sparking a great advance in machine tools and in the engineering use of screw threads.|$|E
50|$|For the X and Y-axis {{drive systems}} most PCB milling {{machines}} use stepper motors that drive a precision <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> The <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is in turn {{linked to the}} gantry or milling head by a special precision machined connection assembly. To maintain correct alignment during milling, the gantry or milling head's direction of travel is guided along using linear or dovetailed bearing(s). Most X/Y drive systems provide user control, via software, of the milling speed, which determines how fast the stepper motors drive their respective axes.|$|E
50|$|In May 2016 the Prusa i3 MK2 was released, it is {{the first}} printer with {{automatic}} geometry skew correction for all three axes and includes a larger build volume, custom stepper motors with integrated <b>lead</b> <b>screws,</b> mesh bed levelling using a non-contact inductance sensor and a rewritten version of the Marlin firmware. Other new features include a polyetherimide print surface, Rambo controller board and an E3D V6 Full hotend. The Prusa MK2 became the first RepRap printer to be supported by Windows Plug-and-Play USB ID.|$|R
5000|$|... (d) Square thread - This is {{the strongest}} and lowest {{friction}} thread, with a 0° thread angle, and doesn't apply bursting force to the nut. However {{it is difficult to}} fabricate, requiring a single point cutting tool due to the need to undercut the edges. [...] It is used in high-load applications such as jackscrews and <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> but has been mostly replaced by the Acme thread. A modified square thread with a small 5° thread angle is sometimes used instead, which is cheaper to manufacture.|$|R
40|$|POWER SCREW is an {{important}} machine tool for the following three reasons :It provides high mechanical advantage {{in order to move}} large loads with minimum effort(e. g. Screw Jack),. It generates large forces (e. g. a compactor presses) and obtains precise axial movements e. g. a machine tool <b>leads</b> <b>screw.</b> Our aim is to explore different power screw-properties, various types of power screws, designing procedure of a power screw (*we will be considering designing of a SCREW-JACK),CAD (CATIA V 5) model, computer program (MATLAB) to reduce the calculation time in designing considering all the design constraints and factors...|$|R

Realizations that encompass combined torsional and tension loading will be incorporated. Specific, integrated, distributed-lumped machine tool configurations will be derived and described in block diagram form. Simulation studies illustrating the dynamic signature of a machine tool axis drive, when operated at various feed rates, together with the measured results will be presented. The effect of changes in the effective lead-screw length on the workpiece surface finish will be commented on...|$|R
50|$|Titan was {{fabricated}} in the United Kingdom during World War I by Cowans, Sheldon & Company of Carlisle, then {{transported to}} Australia in parts for assembly at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney. Ordered on 5 October 1916, construction at Cockatoo commenced on 7 March 1917. The crane was launched on 5 December 1917. However, during construction, the 40-ton <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> for the crane's jib arm were lost when the merchant ship Afric was torpedoed. The crane {{could be used}} in a limited capability, although it was not until 1919 that replacement screws of sufficient quality were acquired. Titan was completed on 3 December 1919. On completion, the crane was handed over to the RAN.|$|R

5000|$|Allowable play varies greatly {{depending}} on the use. As example, a wheelbarrow wheel supports radial and axial loads. Axial loads may be hundreds of newtons force left or right, and it is typically acceptable for the wheel to wobble {{by as much as}} 10 mm under the varying load. In contrast, a lathe may position a cutting tool to ±0.02 mm using a ball <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> held by rotating bearings. The bearings support axial loads of thousands of newtons in either direction, and must hold the ball <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> to ±0.002 mm across that range of loads ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used with a}} split nut also called half nut which allows the nut to be disengaged from the threads and moved axially, independently of the screw's rotation, when needed (such as in single-point threading on a manual lathe).|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{to the concept of}} lunar mining and the use of in situ oxygen, metallics, and ceramics is presented. The EVA time required to set up, relocate, and maintain equipment, as well as the cost per pound of shipping the mining and processing equipment to the moon are considered. The proposed soil fracturing/loading mechanisms are all based loosely on using the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) Frame. All use motor driven tracks for mobility in the forward/reverse and left/right direction. All mechanisms employ the concept of rototillers which are attached to a gantry which, through the use of motor-driven <b>lead</b> <b>screws,</b> provide the rototillers with an up/down capability.
