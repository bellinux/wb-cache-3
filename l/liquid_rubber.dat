5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a <b>liquid</b> <b>rubber</b> solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E

Morris moved to Prestwick in 1851, on the west coast of Scotland, to build a new golf course, where he served as professional and greenkeeper.

No open flames or other heat sources are needed and the glass fiber reinforced systems provide seamless waterproofing around roof protrusions and details. Systems are based on flexible thermoset resin systems such as polyester and polyurethane, and poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA).

40|$|Blocked {{isocyanate}} functional oligomers and <b>liquid</b> <b>rubbers</b> {{are prepared}} by a novel, solvent-free carbonylbiscaprolactam (CBC) mediated end group conversion reaction of amine-terminated oligodimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) and oligopropyleneoxides (PPO), with molar masses varying between 400 and 3140 g/mol, and of hydroxy-terminated oligoethylene oxide (PEG), oligopropyleneoxide (PPO) and oligotetrahydrofuran (PTHF), with molar masses of around 1000 g/mol. The key reaction is the carbonylbiscaprolactam (CBC) mediated amino or hydroxy end group conversion yielding carbamoyl caprolactam functional polymers, without requiring addition of either phosgene or isocyanates. The quantitative CBC conversion of amine end groups occurred in bulk at 100 °C {{in the absence}} of catalysts, yielding N-carbamoyl caprolactam terminated oligomers and caprolactam (ring elimination, pathway RE). The reaction of hydroxy end groups at 100 to 150 °C in the presence of catalysts such as zirconium alcoholates, magnesium bromide or dibutyltindilaurate (DBTDL) produced N-carbamoyl caprolactam end groups via nucleophilic attack of the hydroxy group at one of the CBC caprolactam rings and subsequent ring opening (ring opening, pathway RO). The CBC reactions were monitored by means of ReactIR, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectroscopy.

50|$|Latex moulded {{clothing}} {{is produced by}} dipping a mould into a vat of <b>liquid</b> <b>rubber.</b> Dealing with raw liquid latex is more difficult because of the extra effort that must be put in to keep {{the thickness of the}} latex itself consistent. Because of this, improper molding techniques can lead to inconsistent thickness in the latex, causing it to fail at the weak points faster than items made from sheet latex. This has led to a major stigma against molded latex garments, in favor of sheet latex versions. Unfortunately, this stigma has been detrimental to those few latex providers who have proper mold-making techniques. When done properly, a molded latex garment is just as durable as sheet latex, and it is a preferred method for skilled individuals making items with heavy contours like hoods or gloves. Despite any attempt to use sheet latex to make hoods and gloves, it is impossible to get solid sheets to fit complex contours as well as a molded latex item can. The belief that all sheet latex is superior to all molded latex is completely false, and ultimately it depends on the abilities of the creator, as even poorly made sheet latex can fall apart easily. Sheet latex is the preferred method for items like catsuits, that do not need such perfect form fitting, and are easier to create with sheets compared to the large molds required for body suits.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the end groups of two <b>liquid</b> <b>rubbers</b> on curing kinetics, morphology, and hardness behavior of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A based epoxy resin (DGEBA) has been studied. The rubbers are silyl-dihydroxy terminated (PDMS-co-DPS-OH) and silyl-diglycidyl ether terminated (PDMS-DGE). Crosslinking reactions, investigated by shear rheometry, ranged 90 - 110 °C, using a constant concentration (5 phr) of <b>liquid</b> <b>rubbers</b> and 1, 2 -Diamino cyclohexane (1, 2 -DCH) as hardener agent. The gel time, t gel, of the neat epoxy significantly decreased when adding the elastomers, more so for the silyl-dihydroxy terminated elastomer; at 110 °C the reaction was nearly complete before rheological test started. The {{results suggest that the}} elastomers induced a catalytic effect on the curing reaction. Scanning electron microscopy revealed phase separation of the elastomer during the curing reaction with rubber domains about 5 μm size. However, the DGEBA/dihydroxy terminated elastomer composite cured at 110 °C exhibited a homogenous morphology, that is, the rapid reaction time would not allow for phase separation. Water contact angle tests evidenced either more hydrophilic (silyl-diglycidyl ether terminated rubber) or more hydrophobic (silyl-dihydroxy terminated rubber) behavior than the neat epoxy. The latter effect is attributed to the presence of aromatic rings in the backbone structure of PDMS-co-DPS-OH. Microindentation measurements show that the elastomers significantly reduced the hardness of the epoxy resin, the DGEBA/ether terminated composite exhibiting the lowest hardness values. Moreover, hardness increased as reaction temperature did, correlating with a reduction of microdomains size thus enabling the tuning of mechanical properties with reaction temperature. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
