5|$|In 1928, Sverdrup {{joined with}} his former University of Minnesota {{engineering}} professor John Ira Parcel {{in the formation of}} Sverdrup & Parcel, a civil engineering firm with a speciality field of bridges. Parcel had tenure at Minnesota {{for a long time and}} was reluctant to sever his ties completely, but eventually he decided to join the new company, taking an unpaid Sabbatical from the university for one year. Sverdrup owned 60% and Parcel 40%of the new firm, which opened its doors on 1 April 1928. The company's headquarters was located in St. Louis, Missouri. Sverdrup & Parcel's first contract was for the design of a bridge over the Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri, for which it received a fee of $33,000. While at the Missouri State Highway Department Sverdrup met D. C. Wolfe and E. R. Grant, and he asked them if they would join the company. Sverdrup subsequently hired design engineer Brice R. Smith from Missouri's <b>leading</b> <b>supplier</b> of bridge components. By 1936, all three would become partners in the firm.|$|E

25|$|Parson Levett {{had taken}} to his new sideline. Apparently he was a natural, so {{efficient}} that the Privy Council appointed him in 1546 to oversee the Sussex iron mines {{that had belonged to}} the attainted Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk and were confiscated by the Crown. Levett employed master gun founders Charles Garrete and Pierre Baude at his Buxted furnace, as well as five other aliens (probably Frenchmen) in 1543, and six in 1550. By 1543 Levett was the <b>leading</b> <b>supplier</b> of cast-iron muzzle-loading cannons to the English forces. The discovery of one of Levett's two-pound cannons marked with the monogram of King Henry VIII and dated 1543 – seized by the Spanish in Oudewater in the Netherlands in 1575 – proved that Levett succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1977, Jimmy Carter's {{administration}} had announced a new military export policy that limited sales of front line designs to countries within NATO, along with Australia and Japan.
