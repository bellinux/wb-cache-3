40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the ongoing {{development}} of the TapTiles system, a low-cost, floor-interaction technology that overcomes problems found in previous overhead projector-based floor-interaction systems by using Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) embedded into a carpet tile. Despite many advantages compared to projector-based floor interaction systems, LED-based systems could be criticized for lacking the resolution for a worthwhile interactive experience. User studies of both simulated and real hardware are reported on. This includes a comparison of tiles of different resolution that suggests that pixel density, over the range of tests, {{is less important than}} visual artifacts introduced by carpet tile edges. Contrary to initial expectations, denser <b>LED</b> <b>spacing</b> did not improve legibility or raise user preferences. Overall our studies suggest that LED-based floor interaction can be legible and effective in a walk-up and use situation...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} generalized spatial modulation (GSM) in indoor wireless visible light communication (VLC) systems. GSM uses $N_t$ light emitting diodes (LED), but activates only $N_a$ of them at a given time. Spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing are special cases of GSM with $N_{a}= 1 $ and $N_{a}=N_t$, respectively. We first derive an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) for maximum likelihood (ML) detection of GSM in VLC systems. Analysis and simulation {{results show that the}} derived upper bound is very tight at medium to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The channel gains and channel correlations influence the GSM performance such that the best BER is achieved at an optimum <b>LED</b> <b>spacing.</b> Also, for a fixed transmission efficiency, the performance of GSM in VLC improves as the half-power semi-angle of the LEDs is decreased. We then compare the performance of GSM in VLC systems with those of other MIMO schemes such as spatial multiplexing (SMP), space shift keying (SSK), generalized space shift keying (GSSK), and spatial modulation (SM). Analysis and simulation results show that GSM in VLC outperforms the other considered MIMO schemes at moderate to high SNRs; for example, for 8 bits per channel use, GSM outperforms SMP and GSSK by about 21 dB, and SM by about 10 dB at $ 10 ^{- 4 }$ BER...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the optical}} characteristics, thermal characteristics, {{electrical}} {{characteristics of the}} LED device are studied. After analysis {{of the significance of}} the optical model, we establish the model of the LED light source using optical simulation software to analyze the impact of modeling four factors and law, based on ray tracing model intensity distribution with the manufacturers. On this basis, we expand the LED secondary optical design, namely, increasing of LDE method to the light level. After comparing different forms of non-imaging optical components, combined with the actual situation, the final choice is the system composed of rotating parabolic reflector with LDE. Besides, the reflected changing the relative position of the body and LDE space lead to the normal light intensity of the entire system appearing two peaks, but their causes are different. In addition, the method of combining theoretical analysis and computer simulations to study the distribution of LDE array illumination is utilized. Formula on the illumination distribution in the LDB array to a plane parallel thereto is deduced, which is verified by computer simulation and agrees well with it. A quantitative study of the factors affecting the road surface illuminance distribution is {{made on the basis of}} previous study, combined with the actual road lighting works. These factors are: LDE array form, the number of <b>LED,</b> <b>spacing</b> between LDE, LDE interval between the street lamps. The derived entire road illumination distribution formula and the corresponding curve gives a basic method for the analysis of such practical problems related outcomes for the LDE illumination optical system design and research basis...|$|E

40|$|The NASA <b>led</b> <b>Space</b> Launch Initiative (SLI) {{program has}} {{established}} key requirements related to safety, reliability, launch availability and operations cost {{to be met}} by {{the next generation of}} reusable launch vehicles. Key to meeting these requirements will be an integrated vehicle health management (M) system that includes sensors, harnesses, software, memory, and processors.

The purpose of this activity is to evolve techniques for defining critical flight engine system measurements-early within the definition of an engine health management system (EHMS). Two approaches, performance-based and failure mode-based, are integrated to provide a proposed set of measurements to be collected. This integrated approach is applied to MSFC s MC- 1 engine. Early identification of measurements supports early identification of candidate sensor systems whose design and impacts to the engine components must be considered in engine design...|$|R
40|$|Studying {{transversal}} {{structure in}} extragalactic jets {{is crucial for}} understanding their physics. The Japanese <b>led</b> <b>space</b> VLBI project VSOP has offered arguably the best opportunity for such studies, by reaching baseline lengths of up to 36, 000 km and resolving structures down to an angular size of 0. 3 mas at 5 GHz. VSOP observations of the jet in 0836 + 710 at 1. 6 and 5 GHz have enabled tracing the radial structure of the flow on scales from 2 mas to 200 mas and determining the wavelengths of individual oscillatory modes responsible {{for the formation of}} the structure observed. We conclude that these modes are produced by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a sheared relativistic flow. Our results point towards the stratification of the jet and the growth of different modes at different jet radii. We also discuss the implications of the driving frequency on the physics of the active nucleus of the quasar.

This paper will given an executive summary of the technology area 07 (TA 07) Human Exploration Destination Systems (HEDS). These are draft roadmaps being reviewed and updated by the National Research Council. Deep-space human exploration missions will require many “game changing ” technologies to enable safe missions, become more independent, and enable intelligent autonomous operations and take advantage of the local resources to become self-sufficient thereby meeting the goal of sustained human presence in space. Taking advantage of in-situ resources enhances and enables revolutionary robotic and human missions beyond the traditional mission architectures and launch vehicle capabilities. Mobility systems will include in-space flying, surface roving, and Extra-vehicular Activity/Extravehicular Robotics (EVA/EVR) mobility. These “push ” missions will take advantage of sustainability and supportability technologies that will allow mission independence to conduct human mission operations either on or near the Earth, in deep space, in the vicinity of Mars, or on the Martian surface while opening up commercialization opportunities in low Earth orbit (LEO) for research, industrial development, academia, and entertainment space industries...|$|R

Similarly, the tension between open, experimental learning approaches and the standardisation and assessed outcomes of a curriculum remain relevant.
