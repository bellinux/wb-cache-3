50|$|The {{thinnest}} part thickness {{determines the}} maximum stress {{that can be}} transferred to the deformation zone. Due to material volume constancy, the flange thickens and results in blank holder contact at the outer boundary rather than on the entire surface. The maximum stress that can be safely transferred from the punch to the blank sets a limit on the maximum blank size (initial blank diameter in the case of rotationally symmetrical blanks). An indicator of material formability is the <b>limiting</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> (LDR), defined as the ratio of the maximum blank diameter that can be safely drawn into a cup without flange to the punch diameter.
