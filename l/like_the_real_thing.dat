500|$|The year 1904 saw {{the passage}} of the Shop Hours Act, which made some {{provision}} for limiting shop opening hours. In 1907 the first steps were taken to end the Victorian [...] "living-in" [...] practice, which at the time still affected two-thirds of Britain's 750,000 shopworkers. Initially, living-out privileges were only given to male employees; Bondfield campaigned for equivalent rights for women shop workers, arguing that if they were to become [...] "useful, healthy... wives and mothers", they needed to live [...] "rational lives". As part of her campaign, Bondfield advised the playwright Cicely Hamilton, whose shop-based drama Diana of Dobsons appeared that year. Bondfield described the opening scene, set in a dreary, comfortless women's dormitory over a shop, as very <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

25|$|Promotional makers like AMT {{worked very}} closely with styling {{departments}} of American automobile manufacturers (Anderson 2003). One fascinating article appearing in Ford Times (1961) chronicled the manufacturing process of AMT models. Intricate drawings and styling models, just <b>like</b> with <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> were first constructed. Larger 1:10 or 1:12 scale clay models would be crafted to perfect details. Accurate dies in 1:25 scale, which was the most common, would be made from these for plastic injection. Bumpers and hood ornaments were chrome-plated and bodies were painted, often in factory colors. Painted bodies were baked in ovens, then the models were assembled and packaged.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 August 2007, Russian {{authorities}} {{arrested a}} student for allegedly posting a video on the Internet {{which appears to}} show two migrant workers being beheaded {{in front of a}} red and black swastika flag. Alexander Verkhovsky, the head of a Moscow-based center that monitors hate crime in Russia, said, [...] "It looks <b>like</b> this is <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>The</b> killing is genuine ... There are similar videos from the Chechen war. But {{this is the first time}} the killing appears to have been done intentionally." ...|$|R
5000|$|Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post {{praised the}} film as [...] "a riveting, even {{inspirational}} account of an American feat of arms about which few know but about which many more should." [...] He said the film was made more {{in the style of}} movies from the 1940s, with the hero being the unit involved in the action instead of individuals, a technique which is rarely used today and explains the [...] "essentially starless" [...] cast drawing mainly from television or film supporting roles. He praised its accuracy, saying, [...] "The war stuff is first-rate all the way through. A great deal of effort has been made to achieve a level of anthropological correctness: The weapons are right, the uniforms are right, the equipment is right...The raid itself is a dynamo of action filmmaking, exactly <b>like</b> what <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> must have been -- swift and brutal, with a lot of shooting and no prisoner-taking." ...|$|R
500|$|Bond {{wrote of}} her next role, [...] "It {{was like a}} dream come true when I saw my own name in the title role" [...] of Iolanthe (1882–84). Bond's first {{entrance}} as Iolanthe was across a [...] "stream". [...] She wrote in her memoirs about a performance of Iolanthe: [...] "Realism can be carried too far, as it was when one night a zealous property man said to me: 'It'll be just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> to-night, Miss Bond. I've put some frogs into the water!' [...] 'Then you'll just have to fish them out again,' I retorted, 'and the curtain won't go up until you do.' [...] They had to catch those frogs in an inverted umbrella. [...] Everybody got splashed and agitated, and the performance was delayed for some time." [...] The critics praised Bond's portrayal of the title character: [...] "Miss Jessie Bond... may be credited with all the grace, delicacy, and fascination we should expect from a fairy mother, and her singing of the really exquisite melody in the last scene {{was one of the most}} successful items in the entire opera." ...|$|E

2500|$|Manhunt 2 was {{met with}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews. Positive reception came from the game's presentation of graphic violence and its psychological horror-based storyline. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd said the game was [...] "not as shocking as you'd expect, but Manhunt 2 still satisfies your primal instincts", and that the game was better {{to play on the}} PSP platform. Mikel Reparaz from GamesRadar stated that [...] "if you're in the mood for something creepy and horrific that'll leave you feeling a little dirty, Manhunt 2s still-shocking murders and eerie, is-it-real-or-am-I-just-insane storyline won't disappoint." [...] Game Informer gave the Wii version of the game 7.75/10, saying [...] "Manhunt 2 is every bit as grim and brutal as the first [...] the writing, as is typical of Rockstar's games, is top-notch, and Daniel {{and the rest of the}} characters do come off the screen as very real and human [...] It's a testament to this quality that I was really driven to see the tale out to its end." [...] Similarly, Nintendo Power gave the Wii version 7.5/10, stating that while the game does deliver for the most part, they were disappointed by the way external influences led Rockstar to change the game, and that the story, while interesting, is [...] "highly predictable". [...] Yahoo! reviewed the PSP version, stating [...] "there's simply never been a game quite as squeamishly immersive as this [...] it's even more terrifying for seeming <b>like</b> <b>the</b> most <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> in a game this year." ...|$|R

60|$|You {{turn to the}} {{thoroughly}} well-read man. You ask him a question, say, in English history (he {{is understood}} to have just finished reading Macaulay). He smiles good-naturedly, tries {{to look as if}} he knew all about it, and proceeds to dive into his mind for the answer. Up comes a handful of very promising facts, but on examination they turn out to belong to the wrong century, and are pitched in again. A second haul brings up a fact much more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> but, unfortunately, along with it comes a tangle of other things--a fact in political economy, a rule in arithmetic, the ages of his brother's children, and a stanza of Gray's 'Elegy,' and among all these, the fact he wants has got hopelessly twisted up and entangled. Meanwhile, every one is waiting for his reply, and, as the silence is getting more and more awkward, our well-read friend has to stammer out some half-answer at last, not nearly so clear or so satisfactory as an ordinary schoolboy would have given. And all this for want of making up his knowledge into proper bundles and ticketing them.|$|E
