5|$|Kauffman and Crane began {{developing}} Friends {{under the}} title Insomnia Cafe between November and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including a title change to Six of One and Friends <b>Like</b> <b>Us,</b> the series was finally named Friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} pitched to the Nine Network through Harris and Graeme-Evans' joint {{independent}} production company, Kids <b>Like</b> <b>Us.</b> A pilot was filmed in mid-1998, which {{was shown to}} a test audience. No changes to the format were made after this test. After being commissioned, the first full series began production in October. The Nine Network initially signed a co-venture with Kids <b>Like</b> <b>Us</b> to produce two 45-episode series of the show and the first went to air on Nine in April 1999. Hi-5 was granted a P classification, deeming it specifically {{designed to meet the}} needs and interests of pre-schoolers, allowing it to be broadcast on the Nine Network with a 30-minute runtime commercial-free. The first series was produced for US$20,000 to US$30,000 for each episode.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would <b>like</b> <b>us</b> to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, Girtonians {{have become}} {{known for their}} chant of We are Girton – super Girton! No one <b>likes</b> <b>us,</b> but we don't care!, in {{imitation}} of the Millwall fans' famous song: No one <b>likes</b> <b>us,</b> we don't care. The reference to no one <b>likes</b> <b>us</b> is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison {{to many of the}} other colleges. The college song I love to go a-bicycling, sung with the tune of I love to go a-wandering also alludes to Girton's 2.5 miles distance from the town centre. It has been sung since the 1960s. For example, the second stanza reads: ...|$|R

5|$|In 2012, Love Productions {{approached}} the BBC {{with the idea}} for a programme that would feature a prominent member of the business community working with unemployed people, but the show did not come to fruition after the unnamed individual had to withdraw from it because of other commitments. The format for the series that would later become Benefits Street was then suggested, but the BBC declined to commission the series because it was producing a number of other programmes concerning similar issues, such as People <b>Like</b> <b>Us</b> and Nick and Margaret: We All Pay Your Benefits. Love Productions then suggested the format to Channel 4, who agreed to commission the programme.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, {{being sent}} {{far from the}} Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental {{decision}} much influenced by “the prospects of deracinated people, <b>like</b> <b>us</b> the Palestinians, being so uncertain {{that it would be}} best to send me as far away as possible.” The realities of peripatetic life—of interwoven cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much <b>like</b> <b>US</b> manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E

5|$|Harrison and Hancock {{counties}} {{were generally}} not affected quite as severely as communities {{closer to the}} Alabama border, but the entire area still suffered extensively. In sections of Gulfport, large fires were sparked by downed power lines and fed by broken natural gas pipes. Debris on roadways prevented firefighters from reaching the fires, allowing them to spread. Similar destruction was seen to the east at Biloxi, where the hurricane's winds tore the roofs off many buildings. Beachfront communities were {{in a state of}} disarray, with large trees uprooted, debris littering the ground, and accumulations of sand on parts of roads <b>like</b> <b>U.S.</b> 90. Damage to schools in Harrison County—particularly in Gulfport and Biloxi—was extensive. Most homes in the area survived the storm, which was locally estimated to have been a once-in-50-year event, with relatively little damage. Several buildings along the coast in the Biloxi area sustained severe damage, but many of the older houses near the Gulf of Mexico there fared remarkably well. Winds brought down large highway signs, in some cases striking nearby buildings. Along the coast, Elena caused beach erosion, damaged coastal structures and recreational beach facilities, and dislocated navigational buoys and markers in various ports, several of which were closed pending Coast Guard inspection. Winds over inland Pearl River County damaged 350 permanent and mobile homes, and as in Alabama, the hurricane took a large toll on pecan and soybean crops and farms.|$|E
