40|$|This is a doctrinal and {{comparative}} research between the traditional {{law and the}} Shariah with regard to issues of protection against creditors, indemnity and no claim benefits (NCB) under life insurance and family takaful. The aim is to find similarities and dissimilarities between life insurance and family takaful vis-à-vis the issues based on Maqasid al-Shariah. It is found that both the traditional law and the Shariah assert that creditors have priority over the life policy and family takaful benefits even if the beneficiaries will get nothing from it. Again, under both systems, it is submitted that although ‘Indemnity’ and ‘No claim benefits’ are paid but the Shariah does not allow forfeiture of the indemnity because <b>of</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> utmost <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> (uberimae fidei) or discontinuing payment of the premiums/contributions by the policyholder or participant.

In Griggs v Duke Power Co, a power {{company on the}} Dan River, North Carolina, required {{a high school diploma}} for staff to transfer to higher paying non-manual jobs. Because of racial segregation in states like North Carolina, fewer black employees than white employees had diplomas. The Court found a diploma was wholly unnecessary to perform the tasks in higher paying non-manual jobs. Burger CJ, for a unanimous Supreme Court, held the [...] "Act proscribes not only overt discrimination, but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation." [...] An employer could show that a practice with disparate impact followed [...] "business necessity" [...] that was [...] "related to job performance" [...] but otherwise such practices would be prohibited. It is not necessary to show any intention to discriminate, just a discriminatory effect. Since amendments by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, if disparate impact is shown the law requires employers [...] "to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity" [...] and that any non-discriminatory [...] "alternative employment practice" [...] is not feasible. On the other hand, in Ricci v DeStefano five Supreme Court judges held the City of New Haven had acted unlawfully by discarding test results for firefighters, which it concluded could have had an unjustified disparate impact by race.

[Extract] Du Pont and Lubesky observed in 2013 in relation to the Canada Revenue Authority that: "Even though the majority of tax officials are conscientious and {{play a vital role in}} the administration of the tax system, abusive audits can and do occur for a variety of reasons. Some cases have involved personally motivated malevolence toward a taxpayer, some [...] .

" So it is with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) — and most large bureaucracies. The ATO has a proud record of service to the Australian community. Nevertheless, over the years, a number of taxpayers have felt that they have been unfairly treated by the ATO, and have taken action to attack the ATO's alleged <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> bona fides (<b>good</b> <b>faith)</b> in making assessments, or otherwise dealing with taxpayer's affairs. As noted above and discussed later in this article, similar concerns have been raised in other jurisdictions. Despite some extreme situations, until 2015 taxpayers had invariably failed in such actions. For example, in Marijancevic v DCF of T, the court found that the ATO had acted 'too hastily in issuing a garnishee notice, too carelessly in addressing the garnishee notice letter, and too slowly subsequently in issuing default assessments'. Nevertheless, the court held that the taxpayer had failed to establish that the ATO had acted in bad faith...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as one <b>of</b> {{the most controversial}} concepts in the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> (CISG). While some CISG scholars argue that the role <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> {{is limited to the}} interpretation of the CISG, others view <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG as a general principle which governs the conduct of the contracting parties. This thesis argues that the nature of the concept, its implicit manifestations in the CISG and the understanding of the transnational case law prove that there are good reasons to consider a broader approach <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG. The thesis tries to explore the concept <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> by critically analysing its connection with other contractual rules, the implication <b>of</b> applying <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in contractual agreement and its role in national legal systems and international legal instruments. Following the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> insight, the author explores the vague structure of Article 7 CISG which caused an element of confusion over the role <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> The authentic texts and the draft history of Article 7 critically analysed to show that a wider application <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG is possible. In addition, the general role <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is enhanced by classifying and elaborating some of the functions <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as it is implicitly manifest in the CISG. A list of CISG transnational cases which referred to the concept <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> are critically reviewed to establish that the actual jurisprudence is going to adopt <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as a general principle in the CISG. The conclusion raises important issues related to the need to adopt a general role for <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> and methods to improve our understanding <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG...|$|R
50|$|The employer's steadfast {{refusal to}} discuss {{grievance}} arbitration for {{these and other}} dismissed employees constituted the single largest sticking-point in the negotiations. The Canada Labour Relations Board intervened {{several times during the}} bargaining process and eventually forced Royal Oak Mines to return to the negotiation table with a previously withdrawn proposal. Royal Oak Mines sought judicial review of this order, with the dispute winding its way through the court system {{during the first half of}} the 1990s. This set the stage for significant changes in Canadian labour law as evident in the Supreme Court's 1996 decision in Royal Oak Mines v. Canada (Labour Relations Board), 1996 1 S.C.R. 369. In his majority decision Mister Justice Peter Cory formulated a distinction between the subjective and objective aspects of the duty to bargain. A 'good faith' requirement forms the subjective aspect of this duty, while a requirement to 'make every reasonable effort' to conclude a collective agreement injects an objective standard into the analysis. In this decision Royal Oak Mines was compelled to return to the bargaining table on the basis that its refusal to discuss grievance arbitration with the Canadian Association of Smelter and Allied Workers, Local No. 4, constituted an unreasonable limitation on the bargaining process and thereby represented a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> In coming to this conclusion the Court observed that grievance arbitration for dismissed employees was a nearly universal characteristic of collective agreements in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Rix LJ {{draws the}} {{conclusion}} from these three cases, and the authorities {{cited by the}} trial judges in their judgments, that although the general equitable principle which places an embargo on conflicts of duty is beyond doubt, the extent of a director's duty may depend upon the particular circumstances of the case. Furthermore, drawing on Lawrence Collins J's reasoning in CMS Dolphin Ltd v Simonet, where the claimant company successfully claimed that Simonet, its former managing director, was in breach of fiduciary duty by diverting a maturing business opportunity to a new company established by him following his resignation, Rix LJ stressed {{that there should be}} “some relevant connection or link between the resignation and the obtaining of the business”. In so doing, he placed emphasis upon the need to demonstrate both <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> with which the future exploitation was planned while still a director, and the need to show that the resignation {{was an integral part of}} the dishonest plan. Thus, in cases where liability for post-resignation breach of duty had been found, there was a causal connection between the resignation and the subsequent diversion of the opportunity to the director's new enterprise. That said, Rix LJ recognised the difficulty of accurately summarising the circumstances in which retiring directors may or may not be held to have breached their fiduciary duties given that the issue is “fact sensitive”. It was clear, however, that the defendant's resignation was innocent of any disloyalty or conflict of interest.|$|E

In this they show no courage, he says, {{and goes on to}} show from historical examples that in the past they have been cowardly or heroic as their circumstances changed. At present they excel at guerrilla warfare, but in a pitched battle they flee if their first attack fails. They are greedy for land, and their princely families are often divided between warring brothers, though foster-brothers are much closer. They are greedy also for food. Gerald complains that the Welsh marry within the degrees of consanguinity prohibited by the Church, and that they pass on church benefices from father to son. He denounces a tendency toward homosexuality among the luxurious ancient Britons, but admits that in modern times hardship has eradicated this practice. They were beaten down by successive Anglo-Saxon assaults, but have had a little more success against the Normans. Gerald goes on to give detailed strategic advice on how to conquer and rule Wales, laying especial stress on the leading part that the Marcher lords, with their local knowledge, should play in the attack and in the garrisoning and administering of conquered territory. The Welsh are to be turned against each other wherever possible, and once defeated they are to be treated firmly but with respect. Finally, he advises the Welsh that they can best resist attack by adopting Norman methods of warfare, by unity, and by holding firm to their love of freedom. He sums up their patriotism by quoting the words of an old man of Pencader who once told Henry II: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of established legal systems are predisposed to the express recognition of good faith in contract. The apparent pressure for harmonisation of contract law arising from globalisation and political union will necessitate the Anglo-Commonwealth common law countries addressing their historical {{resistance to the}} observance of a general obligation of good faith. Accordingly this thesis appraises {{whether there is a}} requirement for a universal doctrine of good faith in New Zealand contractual relationships. The manuscript focuses on a prospective common law doctrine operating primarily as a rule of construction. It identifies the limits of such a judicial doctrine including its probable lack of application to non-contractual dealings and the likely need for a legislative duty if contracting parties are to be precluded from excluding the obligation. The characteristics of the subject doctrine are explored including the potential definition and uses of good faith. Whilst it is shown that good faith serves an important role in contract law, the analysis reveals that there is no current requirement for an express doctrine within New Zealand. The entrenched ‘piecemeal’ approach synonymous with Anglo-New Zealand contract law is not demonstrably deficient when gauged against the reasonable expectations of contracting parties. The current methodology is preferred to a general, unfamiliar and uncertain good faith principle which is likely to be reduced to equate with the existing New Zealand law in any event. Further, duties consonant with good faith may enhance economic efficiency but not in some instances. Good faith is therefore best imposed in specific circumstances rather than as a universal doctrine. Likewise, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that New Zealand is impaired in the international arena due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> despite pressure for New Zealand to accord with widespread overseas practice. The principle is of minimal utility in international trade where commercial certitude is paramount. Although an imperfect exemplar, the unresolved issues pertaining to contractual good faith in domestic American law confirms the identified reservations associated with the subject doctrine...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{study of the}} {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in contract law. In {{the last fifteen years}} enormous attempts have been made by contract lawyers, especially those in common law systems, to consider the question <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in contracts. But the approach that has been taken by those lawyers in dealing with this important question is unsatisfactory and incapable of producing a coherent understanding of the role <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in contracts. Instead of considering the essential question <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in contracts, especially commercial contracts, the debate has turned out into a battle between common law and civil law. This approach creates a polarized debate. This study will concentrate on the applications <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in arm 's length contractual relationships. This will no doubt concentrate the analysis on its operation in contracts generally, without involving other theories that may explain the courts' concern over the problems of bad <b>faith</b> conducts. Examining <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as a general requirement in contracts is vitally important in order to reach a coherent understanding of its implications for contracting parties. This study will examine in depth the most important issues regarding the operation <b>of</b> the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> principle in contract law. I will examine the rationality of this principle in pre-contractual negotiations. This area of contract raises difficult questions in many common law legal systems. The Introduction of the principle <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> at the stage of negotiation under the PECL and the UNIDROIT Principles has strengthened the role of that principle at the formation of contracts. The interaction between the principle <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> and express terms in contracts will also be examined in an attempt to identify the limits of the parties' freedom in the enforcement of contract terms. In addition to dealing with the operation of the principle <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> throughout the life of the contract, it is also vitally important to analyse the general provisions <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the PECL, CISG, UCC and the UNIDROIT Principles.

40|$|LL. M. (Banking Law) It {{has long}} been the vogue that the {{traditional}} fraud exception is the only exception capable of defeating the doctrine of independence in documentary-credit and performance-guarantee practice. The reason for this is self-explanatory, for it has been stated authoritatively that fraud unravels all. And on construction, this must be the correct legal position. Even then however, the fraud exception is not in itself unassailable. Given the nature and exigency of the contractual relationships peculiar to documentary credits and performance guarantees, it is indubitable for their success that these unique contractual relationships be independent of one another. The latter argument is well established in the law and practice of many jurisdictions. Commercial comity, aspirations, expediency, fair trading and a measure of certainty, inter alia, dictate the necessity for the sanctity and preservation of the doctrine of independence. Without such certainty, international commercial enterprise and entrepreneurship will be the victims. Nevertheless, it would still be fair to state that there is a broad consensus within various jurisdictions regarding the application of a fraud exception to the doctrine of independence, which simply cannot be said for an exception based on unconscionability. There are cogent reasons for this disparity, some in favour of and some against an unconscionability exception. The question which begs an answer is whether the recognition of such an exception would erode the certainty and cash characteristics, inherent and integral to documentary credit and performance guarantee practice. These instruments were, after all, designed and predicated upon tenets of certainty and considered as immediately redeemable cash. Ultimately, this debate involves a choice between embracing commercial certainty on the one hand, and fairness on the other hand. In South Africa however, unconscionability does not exist as a specific concept of law with wide and uncertain parameters. But, the concept of good faith, equally confusing, awkwardly finds its place in the South African general law of contract, but in an informative capacity to the substantive requirements of the law, and not as an independent general defence. A defence in the general law of contract in South Africa, premised on the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is bad in law, given the established brocards such as inter alia, caveat subscriptor, caveat emptor, pacta sunt servanda, 5 and the contra proferentem rule. South African legal heritage and precedent have jettisoned the exceptio doli generalis, and this precedent is peculiarly protected by the judiciary at the highest level. Good faith, in the South African context, is not the equivalent of the so called doctrine of unconscionability analysed and discussed in the academic literature and court decisions of certain common-law jurisdictions, but the exceptio doli generalis may have been, or rather, if properly developed, could have been. And so, from a South African perspective, there is the added difficulty of considering the introduction of a foreign broad-based, uncertain and undefinable doctrine grounded in equity, when the narrowly defined concept of good faith, only informative of the substantive law, finds no general application in the law of contract in South Africa. Regard will thus be had to inter alia: the nature, scope and elements (facta probanda) of this exception; certain arguments for and against its recognition; its inability to be defined with the necessary precision required for legal efficacy and practice; its lack of certainty being in essence descriptive of a host of other conduct short of fraud and inclusive of fraud; and whether the case for its recognition might perhaps have merit and applicability in relation to performance guarantees, separate and distinct from documentary credits...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{both the}} {{interpretation}} <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> and its implementation by the Court {{in terms of}} life insurance contracts. The principle <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in life insurance contracts was under the provision of the Article 251 Wet Boek van Kophandel which assigned the obligation <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> on the insured. Based on the context of its historical and systematical interpretation, the obligation <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> should be on both sides, the insurer and the insured. The insured {{had an obligation to}} inform any material facts and the insurer had to investigate those all facts. Until recent days, however, judges in all levels of Court did not have any shared and full understanding on the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in life insurance contracts. As the result, many Courts were frequently inconsistent with each other. Hence, the sense of fairness the people perceived from the court verdict was not achieved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> cannot be defined and {{furthermore}} {{that there is}} no need to define <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as it takes on meaning when applied to facts. Hence an explanation or application <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is defined by its function namely to enforce the expected performance of both parties. It is further argued that the function <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> will determine which fact pattern has to be found by a court in order to determine the expected performance of the contractual parties. It follows that <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is the legal concept which allows courts to do justice and do it according to law. As <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> takes on meaning only when applied to contractual terms, Peden is correct to argue that “... the widespread use of ‘good faith’ in legislation is... completely unhelpful in the development <b>of</b> contractual <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> ” An interesting way to juxtaposition this point transnationally is to look at international and US theories <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the light of the development <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in a jurisdiction which has struck a civil law/common law compromise about the use of the concept. Australia presents itself as a fledgling nation in the development <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith,</b> while simultaneously being a CISG state subject to the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> Art. 7. The paper will therefore examine the following: The theoretical base on which a definition or explanation of the function <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is based is very divergent and will be discussed in part one. The conclusion which can be drawn from part one will be applied in part two to the most important available judicial decisions in determining whether there is consistency in the application of the concept. Part three will discuss whether the CISG and the domestic interpretative methods will influence the applications <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} guide to the current interpretation of the principle <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the lex mercatoria. It sets out the full background to this interpretation, exploring the development <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in major legal cultures in the Western world and in arbitral practice. Modern lex mercatoria {{is one of the}} most conspicuous manifestations of globalization in the field of law. Previous examples of global law are the Roman ius gentium and the medieval law merchant. The principle <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> has been fundamental in all these manifestations. The thrust of this thesis represents an investigation of the reasons for the essential role <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in universal contexts, and in particular, its meaning in the lex mercatoria. It is argued here that national laws have been influential on the meaning <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the current lex mercatoria. Hence, four major legal systems in the civil and the common law areas are studied: German, French, US and English. Nonetheless, other national systems are also mentioned throughout the thesis. This analysis will reveal the fundamental dynamism of the concept <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> This thesis challenges the traditional view <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as a moral and subjective concept, impractical and difficult to assess. It will show that an objective notion <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is vigorous in international commerce nowadays. This thesis explains that <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the lex mercatoria is interpreted as cooperation of the parties to a commercial contract. This notion fits the experience of global trade today. This theory will be verified through an analysis of: comparative legal history, sociological, philosophical and political theories, international instruments embracing the lex mercatoria and also through cases from national courts and international arbitration. This comprehensive study will serve as a context for future investigations on ancillary duties that emanate from <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> and on the principle <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in specific stages of the contractual iter, such as re-negotiation of the agreement. It will contribute to the harmonization and unification of law in different regions of the world and also to global projects containing the language <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> Likewise, it will be useful for traders and practitioners, especially arbitrators dealing with <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in international disputes between merchants.
