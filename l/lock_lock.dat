25|$|High Commissioner. Southland <b>Lock</b> (<b>lock</b> 7) {{required}} significant rebuilding, {{as many of}} {{the original}} bricks were removed in the 1930s, to be re-used by a local religious order. The lock was reopened on 21 June 2014 by Simon Carter, a local landowner with land adjoining this section of the canal. Working parties have since concentrated on the building of Gennets Bridge <b>Lock</b> (<b>lock</b> 8), a major exercise requiring {{the construction of a new}} concrete shell, faced with locally made bricks, and a bridge for a bridleway as nothing was left of the original lock structure.|$|E
25|$|The Fox River Navigational System Authority is rehabilitating and {{operating}} {{the system of}} Lower Fox River locks between Lake Winnebago and Green Bay, including the Locks at Little Chute in Doyle Park. Repairs to the Little Chute guard <b>lock,</b> <b>lock</b> and combined locks {{are scheduled to be}} completed by 2009. Funding for the bridge at the Little Chute Lock and additional repairs on the Fox River Locks appear to be in question.|$|E
25|$|Locks were {{typically}} 100 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep, and the lifts averaged about 8 feet (between 6 and 10). Inside {{dimensions of the}} lock, for the boat, are over 90', for instance Lock 28 (Point of Rocks) is 90' 9", whereas typical freight boats were 92' long (including the rudder), making it necessary to turn the rudder to the side to fit in the <b>lock.</b> <b>Lock</b> 36, however, was known among boatmen for being troublesome, since it had a usable length of 89 feet 11 inches, being the only lock less than 90 feet in length. Locks were often whitewashed to facilitate low light (i.e., at dawn or dusk) visibility.|$|E

25|$|From the Thames Lock, {{the canal}} and the River Brent {{are one and}} the same, and the {{waterway}} is semi-tidal until the double Gauging <b>Lock</b> (<b>lock</b> 100) at Brentford is reached. Just upstream of the Gauging Lock was a large canal basin, now known as Brentford Lock, from which the canal continues to follow the course of the River Brent through two more locks. The river and canal part company {{at the base of the}} Hanwell flight of locks (92–97), before two more locks take the canal to Norwood Green. It then heads westward over level ground through Southall, Hayes and West Drayton until it reaches the valley of the River Colne where it swings northward to Cowley through Uxbridge.|$|E

Locks 8-27 and their {{accompanying}} lock houses were made from Seneca red sandstone, quarried from the Seneca Quarry, as was Aqueduct No. 1, better known as Seneca Aqueduct. This unique structure is the only aqueduct made from Seneca red sandstone and is doubly unique for being the only aqueduct on the C that is also a <b>lock</b> (<b>Lock</b> 24, Riley's Lock).|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{function}} is to determine loop dynamics, also called stability. [...] This is how the loop responds to disturbances, such as changes in the reference frequency, changes of the feedback divider, or at startup. [...] Common considerations are the range over which the loop can achieve lock (pull-in range, lock range or capture range), how fast the loop achieves <b>lock</b> (<b>lock</b> time, lock-up time or settling time) and damping behavior. [...] Depending on the application, this may require {{one or more of}} the following: a simple proportion (gain or attenuation), an integral (low pass filter) and/or derivative (high pass filter). [...] Loop parameters commonly examined for this are the loop's gain margin and phase margin. [...] Common concepts in control theory including the PID controller are used to design this function.|$|E
