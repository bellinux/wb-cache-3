50|$|This large {{milkweed}} bug is a hemimetabolous insect, {{meaning it}} grows in stages called instars and goes through incomplete metamorphisis exhibiting small changes throughout development such as coloration changes, development of wings and genitalia. O. fasciatus begins as an egg and experiences 4 nymphal stages over 28-30 days before moulting to adulthood. Females become sexually receptive {{within a few}} days of adulthood. Geographic location has a large effect on egg production rate and clutch size, although the intrinsic increase in reproduction depends on what the individual is acclimated to. For example, two close populations (60 km apart) residing on a sharp incline have differing optimal reproduction temperatures where the cooler (higher) adapted populations is at 23 °C and the warmer (lower) population is adapted to 27 °C. Highest clutch size occurs in Puerto Rico, Florida and Texas populations at 30-50 eggs per <b>clutch.</b> <b>Lowest</b> <b>clutch</b> size was found in California at 25-30 eggs per clutch. Iowa and Maryland (northern populations) exhibited a clutch size in between the two extremes from 25-35 eggs per clutch. In favourable conditions (tropics) reproduction occurs continuously all year round, in less-favourable conditions (temperate zones) reproduction occurs during the warmer months. Reproducing when migrants arrive introduces gene flow between northern and southern populations, this provides an advantage to the mid-range populations (variable climates) because females then can ensure genetic variability.The milkweed bug can produce anywhere from 1-3 generations per year depending on climate and geographic location. O. fasciatus exhibits strong selection for survival and will halt reproduction as a trade-off if conditions are not ideal.|$|R
50|$|Cockatiels are {{a popular}} choice for amateur parrot breeders along with budgerigars. Compared to other parrot species they are {{relatively}} easy to breed and the costs for equipment are also quite <b>low.</b> A <b>clutch</b> can consist of four to seven eggs, each approximately the size of one's thumbnail. Eggs are laid once every two days and incubated for 18-22 days. Hatchlings fledge when between 4 and 5 weeks old and wean between 8 and 10 weeks old. Babies may often be gently handled while in the nest or removed for hand-feeding at 2 or 3 weeks old to help them become more tame and trusting. Puberty (adolescence) is reached around 9 months of age while adulthood is reached around 21 months in males and 15-18 months in females.|$|R

40|$|The optimal {{division}} of resources into offspring size vs. number {{is one of}} the classic problems in life-history evolution. Importantly, models that take into account the discrete nature of resource division at <b>low</b> <b>clutch</b> sizes suggest that the variance in offspring size should decline with increasing clutch size according to an invariant relationship. We tested this prediction in 12 species of lizard with small clutch sizes. Contrary to expectations, not all species showed a negative relationship between variance in offspring size and clutch size, and the pattern significantly deviated from quantitative predictions in five of the 12 species. We suggest that the main limitation of current size–number models for small clutch sizes is that they rely on assumptions of hierarchical allocation strategies with independence between allocation decisions. Indeed, selection may favour alternative mechanisms of reproductive allocation that avoid suboptimal allocation imposed by the indivisible fraction at <b>low</b> <b>clutch</b> sizes. T. Uller, G. M.

40|$|Catastrophic declines of {{amphibian}} {{populations have}} been reported from upland areas around the world, yet within regions not all species have been affected. Herein, we examine the relationships between conservation status and ecological traits for over 60 amphibian species from upland areas of eastern Australia. Among the 24 phylogenetic groups examined, eight groups contained only declining species, eight groups contained both declining and non-declining species and eight groups had no declining species, suggesting species declines are influenced by their evolutionary history. Declines {{have been reported}} for only one species (Philoria frosti) of 20 species (i. e. from genera Assa, Cophixalus, Austrochaperina and remaining Philoria/Kyaranus) with direct development in the terrestrial environment. Of the remaining 40 species that include an aquatic stage in the life history, species-specific traits associated with declines suggest species with stream-dwelling tadpoles {{are more likely to}} be declining than species that breed in ephemeral and isolated ponds. However, <b>low</b> ovarian <b>clutch</b> size is the most important ecological trait significantly associated with the tendency for a species to be declining (independent of phylogeny). Species with restricted geographic ranges are also more likely to be declining than widespread species (independent of phylogeny). While ovarian clutch size and geographic range are correlated they are both good predictors for the likelihood of decline for upland species independent of their phylogenetic history. We propose that <b>low</b> ovarian <b>clutch</b> size is an index of low fecundity, and indicates a reduction in population resilience, making those species more susceptible to population declines and extinction than highly fecund species. This provides the first ecological explanation for why some species are declining while other sympatric species are not. Geographic range provides an easily applied tool that can be used to predict the likelihood of species decline in other regions. These results support the hypothesis that a causal factor may be affecting all species of frogs, yet only those species with naturally low population resilience are susceptible to declines.

We found that, in males, asymmetry was associated with <b>low</b> <b>clutch</b> size and brood size but was independent of fledging success, which suggests that wingtip symmetry may reflect fertility in males.

40|$|Reproduction {{involves}} {{costs and}} benefits, whereby increased expenditure into current reproduction can reduce future reproductive success. Costs of reproduction, often assessed using {{the reduction in}} locomotor speed, have become well established in temperate-zone lizard species.

Counter to predictions and despite a <b>low</b> relative <b>clutch</b> mass (RCM), gravid and post-oviposition females experienced a reduction in locomotor speed with a physiological basis that was unrelated to the level of reproductive investment. In addition, gravid and postoviposition females exhibited locomotor speeds that were inversely related to the timing of oviposition and approached the speed of non-reproductive females after 3 weeks of oviposition. These results suggest that in addition to RCM, selection may act to reduce the period of recovery in species with extended reproductive seasons and which make numerous bouts of reproduction, such as C. rubrigularis.

Eggs and hatchlings of Pacific leatherbacks contained detectable concentrations of a suite of essential and nonessential metals including Cu, Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn, but variables that likely reflect a female’s degree of temporal exposure to contaminants (relative age of female, body size, and remigration interval) explained little {{of the variation in}} egg metal concentrations.

The study was carried out from 2009 through 2012 on four pairs of budgerigars kept in year-round outdoor aviaries in a private farm in Masovian voivodeship, Poland. The analysis of hatching was based on the following indicators: the number of eggs laid by four females in the system of three clutches per year, the percentage of fertilization and the hatchability ratio. Within four subsequent breeding seasons, the highest number of eggs laid by females altogether was in Clutch 2 (92) and the <b>lowest</b> in <b>Clutch</b> 3 (79). Some variability occured between the females: the poorest results were attained by Pair I, which raised 57 chicks of 64 laid eggs over the 4 subsequent years.

Nests were located during three field seasons from the arrival (December) to the dispersal {{of the birds}} (June) and collected data on various breeding parameters, availability of fruits and weather conditions. All nests were found in mid-elevation evergreen forests ranging from 900 to 1, 400 m elevation. Breeding occurred in the drier months (January-May), which coincides with high fruit availability. Nest building lasted 3 - 8 days. Majority of the nests (72 %; n = 39) were built on two plant species (Ochlandra travancorica and saplings of Syzygium sp.) and the mean nest height was 1. 52 plus or minus 0. 80 m (n = 52). Nests were randomly oriented around the nesting plants with a mean vector of orientation equaling 160. 450. The clutch size averaged 1. 53 plus or minus 0. 50 eggs (range = 1 - 2; n = 47).

40|$|The {{breeding}} {{success of}} the Lapwing at the ICI Brinefields, Teesside, was studied in comparison to three other species - the Ringed Plover, Redshank and Skylark. Environmental data was recorded and pitfall traps were set up to study the available food. Clutch losses were low in comparison with other studies for all four species, there being {{no significant difference between}} species. Predation accounted for most losses. Growth rates of chicks varied widely between species. Lapwing chicks grew slowly - at a rate significantly lower than a study in Teesdale this year. Ringed Plover chicks grew slowly too, though at a slightly faster and more steady rate. The growth of the Skylark chicks was quick and unrestricted. Differences in growth rates were probably attributable to differences in the availability of food to the species. Many Lapwing chicks grew up by channel edges where their food was, although relatively easy to find, not very abundant. Dry weather and saline water may have caused the chicks to dehydrate. Brooding of Lapwing chicks was shown to decrease with age and be extremely rare in direct sunlight. Lapwing chick mortality was very high - there being a calculated zero survival rate. Ringed Plovers faired much better, (54 % of chicks fledging); Skylark chicks had even better survival rates. Predation was not thought to be the major cause of the Lapwing's low survival rate - partially because of the high survival of other species and partially because of the <b>low</b> <b>clutch</b> predation rate. The mortality of Lapwing chicks was positively correlated to their growth rates and this suggested that poor growth and the problems of dehydration were probably the major causes of mortality...|$|E
40|$|Polyembryony, {{referring}} here {{to situations}} where a nucellar embryo is formed {{along with the}} zygotic embryo, has different consequences for the fitness of the maternal parent and offspring. We have developed genetic and inclusive fitness models to derive the conditions that permit the evolution of polyembryony under maternal and offspring control. We have also derived expressions for the optimal allocation (evolutionarily stable strategy, ESS) of resources between zygotic and nucellar embryos. It is seen that (i) Polyembryony can evolve more easily under maternal control than under that of either the offspring or the ‘selfish’ endosperm. Under maternal regulation, evolution of polyembryony can occur for any clutch size. Under offspring control polyembryony {{is more likely to}} evolve for high clutch sizes, and is unlikely for <b>low</b> <b>clutch</b> sizes (< 3). This conflict between mother and offspring decreases with increase in clutch size and favours the evolution of polyembryony at high clutch sizes, (ii) Polyembryony can evolve for values of “x” (the power of the function relating fitness to seed resource) greater than 0. 5758; the possibility of its occurrence increases with “x”, indicating that a more efficient conversion of resource into fitness favours polyembryony. (iii) Under both maternal parent and offspring control, the evolution of polyembryony becomes increasingly unlikely as the level of inbreeding increases, (iv) The proportion of resources allocated to the nucellar embryo at ESS is always higher than that which maximizes the rate of spread of the allele against a non-polyembryonic allele. Finally we argue that polyembryony is a maternal counter strategy to compensate for the loss in her fitness due to brood reduction caused by sibling rivalry. We support this assertion by two empirical evidences: (a) the extent of polyembryony is positively correlated with brood reduction inCitrus, and (b) species exhibiting polyembryony are more often those that frequently exhibit brood reduction. ...|$|E

D. stevensoni is an eurythermal and euryhaline species with low variability in size and shape (both of the carapace and the soft parts). Its genetic variability has also {{been found to be}} very <b>low.</b> Survival, <b>clutch</b> size, deposition timing and hatching were evaluated in acclimated and non-acclimated females from seven populations: six from Northern Italy and one from Spain. The samples were collected from three different habitats: four lakes, two streams and one spring. A genetic survey using starch gel electrophoresis had previously revealed that only Glucose phosphate isomerase (Gpi) locus was polymorphic. A clone, homozygous at Gpi locus, is the most common in lacustrine and spring habitats in the whole biogeographic range. Surprisingly, two heterozygous clones dominate in Northern Italian lotic environments. Enzymatic activity of heterozygous and homozygous genotypes at Gpi locus was assayed in order to evaluate the relationship between Gpi activity and fitness. Survival and developmental time were not affected by acclimation, while reproductive potential decreased in acclimated females. In females from running waters, reproduction started later and lasted for a shorter time, clutch size was smaller, and hatching percentage lower than females from lakes. These differences are not directly correlated with differences in enzymatic activities at Gpi locus. This does not rule out an overall genetic control of these characteristics since, in a parthenogenetic species, the whole genome is transmitted without recombination.

40|$|Presented Ph. D. thesis {{contains}} an introduction and four chapters concerning reproductive strategies in geckos. The chapters include four peer-reviewed papers and a submitted manuscript. All geckos share rather exceptional reproductive trait known as invariant clutch size, which is characterised by <b>low</b> and invariable <b>clutch</b> size. The first chapter demonstrates that invariant clutch size probably evolved in geckos under selection for enlargement of investment per offspring. On the other hand, in anoles (a group {{not related to}} geckos possessing the same mode of reproduction) invariant clutch size allowed considerable decrease of female reproductive burden. Moreover, the interspecific allometries of egg mass and clutch mass in anoles and geckos are informative for understanding of reproductive allometries in a broader context of squamate reptiles.

40|$|Abstract Background Maternal effects {{mediated}} by egg size and quality may profoundly affect offspring development and performance, and mothers may adjust egg traits according to environmental or social influences. In avian species, context-dependency of maternal effects {{may result in}} variation in egg composition, {{as well as in}} differential patterns of covariation among selected egg components, according to, for example, position in the laying sequence or offspring sex. We investigated variation in major classes of egg yolk components (carotenoids, vitamins and steroid hormones) in relation to egg size, position in the laying sequence and embryo sex in clutches of the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis). We also investigated their covariation, to highlight mutual adjustments, maternal constraints or trade-offs in egg allocation. Results Laying sequence-specific patterns of allocation emerged: concentration of carotenoids and vitamin E decreased, while concentrations of androgens increased. Vitamin A, estradiol and corticosterone did not show any change. There was no evidence of sex-specific allocation or covariation of yolk components. Concentrations of carotenoids and vitamins were positively correlated. Egg mass decreased along the laying sequence, and this decrease was negatively correlated with the mean concentrations of carotenoids in clutches, suggesting that nutritionally constrained females lay <b>low</b> quality <b>clutches</b> in terms of carotenoid content. Finally, clutches with smaller decline in antioxidants between first- and last-laid eggs had a larger increase in yolk corticosterone, suggesting that a smaller antioxidant depletion along the laying sequence may entail a cost for laying females in terms of increased stress levels. Conclusions Since some of the analyzed yolk components (e. g. testosterone and lutein) are known to exert sex-specific phenotypic effects on the progeny in this species, the lack of sex-specific egg allocation by mothers may either result from trade-offs between contrasting effects of different egg components on male and female offspring, or indicate that sex-specific traits are controlled primarily by mechanisms of sexual differentiation, including endogenous hormone production or metabolism of exogenous antioxidants, during embryonic development. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of rainforest ecosystems for multi-species conservation must assess {{the impacts of}} habitat degradation at different spatial scales as well as determine which species are vulnerable to landscape change. Our research objectives were to (1) evaluate the effects of life history traits on the patch occupancy and vulnerability of rainforest birds, (2) determine the relative effects of stand, landscape and patch structure on species richness, and (3) evaluate the relative contributions of deforestation and fragmentation to species richness. We collected presence-absence data for 29 bird species in 46 rainforest patches in South East Queensland, Australia. We used a multi-species occupancy model that accounted for incomplete detection to evaluate hypotheses for occupancy and species richness. Avian occupancy was strongly influenced by life history traits, including population density, foraging behavior, dispersal strategy, clutch size, body mass and diet. Sedentary species with low population sizes, <b>low</b> <b>clutch</b> sizes, large body sizes and insectivorous diets, such as the ground-dwelling Albert 2 ̆ 7 s Lyrebird (Menura alberti) and canopy-dwelling Paradise Riflebird (Ptiloris paradiseus), were the most vulnerable to landscape change. After accounting for life history, {{the positive effect of}} stand basal area was the best predictor of species richness followed by the positive effects of rainforest and dry eucalypt forest in the landscape, with less support for the positive effect of patch size and negative effect of patch isolation. Deforestation was more detrimental to the bird community than rainforest fragmentation. Conservation actions that retain high stand basal area, promote unmodified landscape mosaics and maintain moderate patch sizes near large rainforest tracts are expected to be effective strategies for managing the rainforest bird community. Landscape conservation strategies to minimize habitat loss are expected to be more effective than managing the configuration of rainforest patches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{timing of}} {{breeding}} is a life-history trait that can greatly affect fitness, because successful reproduction {{depends on the}} match between the food requirements for raising young and the seasonal peak in food availability. We analysed phenology (hatch dates) in relation to climate change for 2 seabird species breeding in the high-Arctic, little auks Alle alle and black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, for the periods 1963 – 2008 and 1970 – 2008, respectively. We show that spring climate has changed during the study period, with a strong increase in both air temperature (TEMP) and sea surface temperature (SST) {{and a decrease in}} sea ice concentration. Little auks showed a trend for earlier breeding over the study period, while kittiwakes showed a non-significant trend for later breeding, demonstrating different phenological responses in these 2 species. Little auks and kittiwakes adjusted their timing of breeding to different environmental signals. Spring TEMP was the best predictor of little auk phenology, with a significant negative effect. Spring SST was the strongest predictor of kittiwake phenology, with a non-significant negative effect. Spring sea ice concentration and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) winter index had a low relative variable importance. Furthermore, in kittiwakes, years with late breeding were associated with <b>low</b> <b>clutch</b> size and mean annual breeding success, indicating poor investment and food availability. This study identifies some spring environmental factors important for regulating the timing of breeding in the high-Arctic, most likely through effects on snow cover limiting access to nest sites and the development of the polar marine food web. It remains to be investigated whether environmental factors are reliable predictors of marine prey phenology, and whether the decision to start breeding is constrained by food availability...|$|E
40|$|I {{conducted}} {{a series of}} studies which looked at influences on avian clutch size. Firstly I examined the traditional view that the demands of rearing chicks create a bottleneck at which clutch size is shaped by natural selection. I considered whether instead other stages such as incubation might also be important. I proposed that reproductive demands at each stage of the breeding season may be interdependent, and by developing a mathematical model, I formalised the argument and showed that data on the relationship between the number of offspring and the expenditure of resources at many stages of the season could reveal the importance of natural selection on clutch size at each stage. I then reviewed the literature on the importance of incubation for clutch size determination. Results indicated that metabolic demands of incubation were appreciable and that the incubation of enlarged clutches imposed penalties on the adults. In a field study of kittiwakes I found that breeding success was depressed during incubation and chick rearing by enlargement of clutches and broods respectively. I measured metabolic rates of kittiwakes during incubation and found them to be comparable with those during chick-rearing. Secondly, I examined whether individual adults within populations differed in their reproductive capacities (i. e. whether there was a range of 'adult quality') and whether this could then affect clutch size. In a study of kittiwakes I found clusters of birds with similar breeding performance, but found that these clusters did not persist between years. In a study of swifts, I found that some individuals were consistently good breeders but that this had negligible effects on the distribution of lifetime reproductive success between individuals. I then examined whether the <b>low</b> <b>clutch</b> sizes and high survival of swifts might reflect a bet-hedging strategy in a fluctuating environment, but found little evidence of this. I looked at whether differences in the amount of space available at the nest site could account for differences in clutch sizes of kittiwakes, but could find no such evidence. Lastly I developed a theoretical model to look at how clutch size might be affected by changes in reproductive effort with age. I examined whether the predictions of optimality models were borne out by the more appropriate population genetics approach and found that in birds the optimality models are robust...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhile {{the populations}} of the copepod Eurytemora affinis are often morphologically (i. e. taxonomy) indistinguishable, the species complex is {{composed}} of genetically distinct clades, representing divergent evolutionary histories. The most distant clades, genetically and morphologically (i. e. phylogeny), are transatlantic clades: North American and European (Lee, 2000). The study {{of the life cycle}} strategies of two populations from St. Lawrence salt-marshes (Canada) and from the Seine estuary (France) at three salinities (5, 15 and 25) revealed differences in their salinity tolerance. Individuals from the Seine exhibited high mortality under the highest salinity suggesting that the St. Lawrence population tolerated a wider salinity range. At the lowest salinity, the development time of St. Lawrence individuals was longer than that of individuals from the Seine suggesting that the Seine population was more adapted to <b>low</b> salinity. The <b>clutch</b> size and the longevity of St. Lawrence adults were on average two times higher compared to Seine adults. Thus, the St. Lawrence population exhibited a higher fitness relative to the Seine population. Such differences could be due to genetic differences resulting from divergent evolutionary history, to phenotypic plasticity and/or to the acclimation to culture conditions. We confirmed that a gamma density function is an appropriate fitting function for copepod development time, based on a large data set on development time. It can therefore be integrated into individual-based models of copepod population dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Summary: New Zealand’s {{avifauna}} is characterised by {{a variety}} of endemic, often flightless, birds most of which are critically endangered. One of these, the takahe, is a large flightless rail which has been reduced to one population of 115 birds in its natural alpine habitat plus 52 others introduced on four small offshore islands. By contrast the takahe’s closest extant relative, the pukeko, has been highly successful since its invasion of New Zealand within the past 800 years. This paper summarises results of a pilot study in which takahe eggs were cross-fostered to pukeko nests on Mana Island in order {{to increase the number of}} juveniles produced by each pair of takahe. Over two seasons, 67 % (8 / 12) of the cross-fostered eggs hatched successfully with 25 % (2 / 8) of the resulting young surviving to one year of age. These results were not significantly different from 42 % (5 / 12) and 40 % (2 / 5) hatching and fledging success of takahe-reared eggs from the same <b>clutches.</b> <b>Low</b> fledging success of cross-fostered chicks may reflect poor quality of takahe eggs per chicks rather than poor parental care by the pukeko foster parents, as hatching success of all parent-reared takahe eggs on Mana Island was only 22 % (5 / 23) over the course of this research...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} {{stiffness of}} a cell’s environment exerts a strong, but variable, influence on cell behavior and fate. For example, different cell types cultured on compliant substrates have opposite trends of cell migration and traction {{as a function}} of substrate stiffness. Here, we describe how a motor-clutch model of cell traction, which exhibits a maximum in traction force with respect to substrate stiffness, may provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how cells are tuned to sense the stiffness of specific microenvironments. We find that the optimal stiffness is generally more sensitive to clutch parameters than to motor parameters, but that single parameter changes are generally only effective over a small range of values. By contrast, dual parameter changes, such as coordinately increasing the numbers of both motors and clutches offer a larger dynamic range for tuning the optimum. The model exhibits distinct regimes: at high substrate stiffness, clutches quickly build force and fail (so-called frictional slippage), whereas at <b>low</b> substrate stiffness, <b>clutches</b> fail spontaneously before the motors can load the substrate appreciably (a second regime of frictional slippage). Between the two extremes, we find the maximum traction force, which occurs when the substrate load-and-fail cycle time equals the expected time for all clutches to bind. At this stiffness, clutches are used to their fullest extent, and motors are therefore resisted to their fullest extent. The analysis suggests that coordinate parameter shifts, such as increasing the numbers of motors and clutches, could underlie tumor progression and collective cell migration...|$|R
