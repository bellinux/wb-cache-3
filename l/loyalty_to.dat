5|$|The Imperial {{government}} {{wanted to}} reform the church and appointed a series of well educated, reforming bishops. Although these bishops agreed with the government {{on the need to}} reform, they did not share Pedro II's views on the subservience of the Church to government and tended to be influenced by Ultramontanism which emphasised <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the Papacy over <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the civil powers.|$|E
50|$|Stephen Nathanson, {{professor}} of Philosophy at Northeastern University, states that loyalty {{can be either}} exclusionary or non-exclusionary; and can be single or multiple. Exclusionary <b>loyalty</b> excludes <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> other people or groups; whereas non-exclusionary loyalty does not. People may have single <b>loyalties,</b> <b>to</b> just one person, group, or thing, or multiple <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> multiple objects. Multiple loyalties can constitute a disloyalty to an object if one of those loyalties is exclusionary, excluding one of the others. However, Nathanson observes, {{this is a special}} case. In the general case, the existence of multiple loyalties does not cause a disloyalty. One can, for example, be loyal to one's friends, or one's family, and still, without contradiction, be loyal to one's religion, or profession.|$|R

5|$|Béla was {{the oldest}} son of King Andrew II of Hungary by his first wife, Gertrude of Merania. He {{was born in the}} second half of 1206. Upon King Andrew's initiative, Pope Innocent III had already appealed to the Hungarian prelates and barons on 7 June to swear an oath of <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the King's future son.|$|E
5|$|Charlton was an {{immediate}} success with Andrew Fisher and was promoted to the temporary chairmanship of committees in the House in 1913, however Charlton threatened to resign in 1915 over a dispute in government delays in granting the committee increased powers. Fisher mollified him and in 1916 Charlton proved his <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the new Labor leader Billy Hughes by voting for Hughes' conscription referendum bill, {{even though he was}} vehemently opposed to conscription and fought hard against it. However, Charlton seemed to accept the affirmative result of the referendum and again proved his <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Hughes by defending him when he became the target of caucus criticism. Charlton attempted to deflect attacks made on Hughes to a party conference, but Hughes left the party before a decision could be made.|$|E
5|$|Communities with {{demonstrated}} <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Rome retained {{their own}} laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence were {{an incentive to}} remain in good standing with Rome. Roman government was thus limited, but efficient in its use of the resources available to it.|$|E

5|$|Edmund, Earl of Kent (1301 to 1330). Edmund's <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> his half-brother, Edward II, {{resulted}} in his execution {{by order of}} the rebel Mortimer and his lover, Edward's queen, Isabella. His daughter, Joan, inherited his estates and married her own cousin, Edward the Black Prince; together, they had Richard, who later became the English king.|$|E
5|$|However, Hanna biographer Clarence A. Stern {{suggested}} {{that while the}} industrialist admired McKinley's <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Sherman, the principal reason {{that he decided to}} promote McKinley's career was the congressman's advocacy of high tariffs, which he also favored.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} Hinduism, Ahalya is extolled as {{the first}} of the panchakanya ("five virgins"), archetypes of female chastity whose names are believed to dispel sin when recited.

50|$|To outsiders, the Chinese {{were just}} Chinese, but internally, <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> clan and village origins were strong, often taking {{precedence}} over <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> Chinese nationalism. The 1891 Royal Commission noted that leading stores often doubled as bases for clan tongs (societies) which developed {{to look after}} the interests of men from different localities in China. They provided letter writers, ferried money home through personal chains of contact rather than untrustworthy banks, gave legal support, adjudicated disputes and attended to burials and removal of bones to China. These clan societies still exist today, supporting new arrivals and the needy.|$|R

5|$|<b>Loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Loyalty {{received}} generally favorable reviews but music {{critics were}} {{divided by the}} band's musical departure and Nathan Willett's delivery in terms of performance and songwriting. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 66, based on 20 reviews.|$|E

5000|$|His {{demands for}} Catholics to remove {{themselves}} from politics, {{was because he}} saw Catholics as having dual <b>loyalties.</b> <b>To</b> Bowers {{they could not be}} both loyal to the United States and a pope in Rome.|$|R
50|$|The reforms {{also meant}} that legions were now more-or-less {{permanent}} formations, not just temporary armies deployed according to need (the Latin word 'legion' is actually their word for 'levy'). As enduring units, {{they were able to}} become more effective fighting forces; more importantly, they could form lasting <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> their commanders, rather than keeping <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> Rome. The 1-year consular system began to break down, and generals served for longer durations. This, in turn, meant that troops were more loyal to their commanders, which served as a catalyst for the oppressive and corrupt rule that the Roman military played in the later years under the Emperors.|$|R
5|$|Standish {{had failed}} to capture Corbitant, but the raid had the desired effect. On September 13, 1621, nine sachems came to Plymouth, {{including}} Corbitant, to sign a treaty of <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> King James.|$|E
5|$|The {{politics}} {{within the}} poem emphasizes the problems within British politics and expresses Coleridge's views that the conservatives were warmongering {{and that there}} was corruption within the government.

50|$|As such, {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the above-mentioned factors and conditions, by 1941, the morale of the Indian Army troops was very low and this set up the stage for many soldiers <b>to</b> switch <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> the Japanese in 1942.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the nearly}} {{contemporaneous}} chronicle of John of Küküllő, Louis launched his first campaign against {{a group of}} Transylvanian Saxons, who had refused to pay taxes, and forced them to yield {{in the summer of}} 1344. During his stay in Transylvania, Nicholas Alexanderwho was the son of Basarab, the ruling prince of Wallachiaswore <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Louis on his father's behalf in Brassó (now Brașov in Romania); thus the suzerainty of the Hungarian monarchs over Wallachia was, at least outwardly, restored.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War {{began in}} 1861, {{the demand for}} horses {{increased}} and Anderson transitioned from trading horses to stealing them, reselling them {{as far away as}} New Mexico. He worked with his brother Jim, their friend Lee Griffith and several accomplices strung along the Santa Fe Trail. In late 1861 Anderson traveled south with brother Jim and Judge Baker, in an apparent attempt to join the Confederate Army. Anderson had stated to a neighbor that he sought to fight for financial reasons, rather than <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the Confederacy. However, the group was attacked by the Union's 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry in Vernon County, Missouri; the cavalry likely assumed they were Confederate guerrillas. The Anderson brothers escaped, but Baker was captured and spent four months in prison before returning to Kansas, professing <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the Union. One way that he sought to prove that loyalty was by severing his ties with Anderson's sister Mary, his former lover.|$|E
5|$|Although Swift {{knew that}} the Duchess of Kendal was {{responsible}} for selling the patent to Wood, he rarely mentions this fact in the Letters.
