5|$|When Néstor Kirchner {{refused to}} run for {{re-election}} in 2007 and proposed Cristina Kirchner instead, it was rumored that the couple might attempt {{to run for}} the presidency in alternate elections, to circumvent the constitutional limit of a single re-election. The death of Néstor Kirchner in 2010 derailed such a plan. She had a low positive image, below 30%. On 21 June 2011, Cristina Kirchner announced she would run for a second term as president. A few days later, she announced that her economic minister Amado Boudou would run for vice-president on her ticket. This selection was an unexpected one, as Boudou usually acted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> star instead of a politician. She personally chose most of the candidates for deputy in the Congress, favoring members of the Cámpora.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, {{such as the}} horned lizards of North America, {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under {{the edge of the}} body. The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the roundtail horned lizard, which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood, Pararge aegeria, minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European nightjar select a resting position facing the sun. The elimination of shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.|$|E

500|$|In Whitehead's view, {{there are}} a number of {{problems}} with this notion of [...] "irreducible brute matter." [...] First, it obscures and minimizes the importance of change. [...] By thinking of any material thing (<b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock,</b> or a person) as being fundamentally the same thing throughout time, with any changes to it being secondary to its [...] "nature", scientific materialism hides the fact that nothing ever stays the same. [...] For Whitehead, change is fundamental and inescapable; he emphasizes that [...] "all things flow." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of FutureSex/LoveSounds, Timberlake was interested in rock music. This inspiration was used in his approach in recording the songs, rather than in composing them. Timberlake reveals, [...] "I wanted to sing the song <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> and roll singer, not an R singer." [...] On the influences he drew from, {{he said that if}} Justified was [...] "characterized" [...] by Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, FutureSex/LoveSounds is more like David Bowie and Prince. Other influences include late INXS-frontman Michael Hutchence, Arcade Fire, David Byrne, The Killers, The Strokes, and Radiohead.|$|E

And you know, just the way I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it. And I love the way it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E

Longstreet performed aggressively and well in his new, larger command, particularly at Gaines' Mill and Glendale. Lee's army in general suffered from weak performances by Longstreet's peers, including, uncharacteristically, Stonewall Jackson, {{and was unable to}} destroy the Union Army. Moxley Sorrel wrote of Longstreet's confidence and calmness in battle: [...] "He was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> in steadiness when sometimes in battle the world seemed flying to pieces." [...] Gen. Lee said, [...] "Longstreet was the staff in my right hand." [...] He had been established as Lee's principal lieutenant.|$|E
500|$|Bush was a {{participant}} in the 2006 midterm elections, beginning her campaigning in April. Though her poll numbers had decreased from an 80% approval rating, they still superseded that of President Bush, whose approval rating was only praised by a third of Americans. Ed Henry of CNN noted Bush's popularity, writing, [...] "The first lady is treated <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> star on the campaign trail– with local Republicans lining up for photographs and autographs– as she criss-crosses the country to help candidates." [...] Bush relied on a strategy of praising the Republican candidate for their achievements and attending events alongside them. In September 2008, Bush spoke during the first night of the 2008 Republican National Convention, her joint appearance with Cindy McCain geared toward raising hurricane relief funds for victims of Hurricane Gustav.|$|E
500|$|The Wailers' {{first album}} for Island, Catch a Fire, was {{released}} worldwide in April 1973, packaged <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> {{record with a}} unique Zippo lighter lift-top. Initially selling 14,000 units, it didn't make Marley a star, but received a positive critical reception. It was followed later that year by the album Burnin' which included the song [...] "I Shot the Sheriff". Eric Clapton was given the album by his guitarist George Terry {{in the hope that}} he would enjoy it. Clapton was suitably impressed and chose to record a cover version of [...] "I Shot the Sheriff" [...] which became his first US hit since [...] "Layla" [...] two years earlier and reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 14 September 1974. Many Jamaicans were not keen on the new reggae sound on Catch a Fire, but the Trenchtown style of Burnin found fans across both reggae and rock audiences.|$|E

500|$|... finally {{reveals a}} side of Mariah we don't see that often — her true self. The Mariah we usually see and hear is a glossy one. Psychologists might say her affect is 'off' — meaning her {{gestures}} and facial expressions don't match her mood. There's a reason for that, as she explains on 'Side Effects', which is the emotional abuse she says she suffered during her marriage to music mogul Tommy Mottola. Mariah, who is usually quite guarded, has alluded to the subject in songs like 'Petals', but never has she gone into such detail as she does on 'Side Effects', in which she refers to the marriage as a 'private hell that we built'. Even though it's been 11 years since they split up, she sings in a lower register that she's still 'wakin' up scared some nights ... dreaming about the violent times'. Her emotional scars left her 'a little protective ... a little defensive ... a little depressed', which makes her 'fake a smile' as she 'deal with the side effects'. Even though it features Young Jeezy, it sounds <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> power ballad.|$|E
500|$|Following rehearsals in a dance {{school in}} Shepherd's Bush, Genesis {{recorded}} Foxtrot at Island Studios between August and September 1972. During the initial sessions, disagreements among Charisma and Anthony {{contributed to the}} end of his association with Genesis. After two replacement engineers were tried out, the band settled with John Burns and a new producer, Dave Hitchcock. The album features the 23-minute track [...] "Supper's Ready", a suite of various musical segments. The track included an opening acoustic piece, a Gabriel-penned song called [...] "Willow Farm" [...] and a piece derived from a jam by Banks, Rutherford and Collins called [...] "Apocalypse in 9/8". Other songs were the science-fiction themed [...] "Watcher of the Skies" [...] and the property development-themed [...] "Get 'Em Out By Friday". Foxtrot was released in October 1972 and reached No. 12 in the UK. It fared even better in Italy, where it went to No. 1. Foxtrot was well received from critics. Chris Welch of Melody Maker thought Foxtrot was [...] "a milestone in the group's career", [...] "an important point of development in British group music", and that Genesis had reached [...] "a creative peak". Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought Foxtrot marked the first time [...] "Genesis attacked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> band, playing with a visceral power".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{has been}} positive towards the song. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic named it a [...] "track pick" [...] from the album. In {{a review of}} the album, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani hailed it as [...] "a joyous composition". Michael Hubbard of musicOMH called it [...] "pure pop genius," [...] saying the track [...] "steals the show". Gary Crossing from Dotmusic described the song as a [...] "Sexy, bass-heavy monster of a floor-filler with cheesy synths, robotic voices and whispers aplenty" [...] while complimenting the [...] "I like to singy singy singy". This view was shared by Victoria Segal from NME who complimented Ahmadzaï's production technique and blending disco sounds with vocoder effects. She added that the song is [...] "so heavily distorted, the macho disco bassline is so quick to get its shirt off and the baby oil on, it somehow sounds cool." [...] Barry Walters from Rolling Stone called the song [...] "improvisional", and described it as [...] " [...] <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> rocket ship, then [...] while a digitally tweaked [...] squeaks". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly called the verses of [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] as Madonna's [...] "dippiest lyrics in ages", and also complimented Ahmadzaï's fusion of hard disco beats and contorting Madonna's vocals.

500|$|With 2:12 left, Chamberlain had 94 points, and {{he scored}} on a fadeaway for his 96th point. His next basket at 1:19 came off a lob pass from York Larese for a {{powerful}} dunk that was rare for Chamberlain. Gary M. Pomerantz in his book Wilt, 1962: The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era wrote that Chamberlain's usual [...] "Dipper Dunk" [...] was [...] "a considerably less emphatic basket stuff, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> that barely ripples the pond." [...] With {{less than a minute}} left in the game, Chamberlain set up in the post. Ruklick passed to Rodgers, who passed to Chamberlain close to the basket, but he missed the shot. Ted Luckenbill rebounded and passed it back to Chamberlain, who missed again. Luckenbill again rebounded and this time passed to Ruklick, who eschewed an easy layup and instead lobbed a high pass to Chamberlain. With 46 seconds left, Chamberlain got free from the five Knicks, jumped high and put the ball into the basket to hit the century mark. [...] Eyewitness accounts of the historic basket differ as to whether Chamberlain merely laid the ball in or actually stuffed the ball through the hoop for an alley-oop slam dunk. In any event, the arena exploded in a frenzy and over 200 spectators stormed the floor, wanting to touch the hero of the night. Ruklick immediately ran to the scorer's table to ensure that he was officially credited with the assist.|$|E
500|$|The {{prospect}} of a Gore candidacy arose again between 2006 and early 2008 {{in light of the}} upcoming 2008 presidential election. Although Gore frequently stated that he had [...] "no plans to run", he did not reject the possibility of future involvement in politics which led to speculation that he might run. This was due in part to his increased popularity after the release of the 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. The director of the film, Davis Guggenheim, stated that after the release of the film, [...] "Everywhere I go with him, they treat him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> star." [...] After An Inconvenient Truth was nominated for an Academy Award, Donna Brazile (Gore's campaign chairwoman from his 2000 campaign) speculated that Gore might announce a possible presidential candidacy during the Oscars. During the 79th Academy Awards ceremony, Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio shared the stage to speak about the [...] "greening" [...] of the ceremony itself. Gore began to give a speech that appeared to be leading up to an announcement that he would run for president. However, background music drowned him out and he was escorted offstage, implying that it was a rehearsed gag, which he later acknowledged. After An Inconvenient Truth won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, speculation increased about a possible presidential run. Gore's popularity was indicated in polls which showed that even without running, he was coming in second or third among possible Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards. Grassroots draft campaigns also developed with the hope that they could encourage Gore to run. Gore, however, remained firm in his decision and declined to run for the presidency.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake {{described}} [...] "SexyBack" [...] as [...] "an experiment gone {{right from}} the sort of synthesizer influence to the distorted vocals", adding that it was [...] "one of the songs that the more you listen to it its just hook after hook after hook. Its {{just one of those}} 'flow off the top of your head' tracks, in terms of melody. We wanted to keep it loose and not too rehearsed, it's one of those very experimental records though." [...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. [...] "I wanted to sing the song <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> and roll singer, not an R singer. That's the approach." [...] The day before recording, Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie's [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and the Rapture's [...] "House of Jealous Lovers". Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs' [...] "raw energy". Timberlake said that he modeled himself on Bowie and Prince, and described the song as Bowie and David Byrne [...] "covering" [...] James Brown's 1970 song [...] "Sex Machine". Timberlake said that the song [...] "doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk" [...] and that he was happy with the description [...] "club funk". He was [...] "keen for a new musical direction" [...] following the release of his first album, Justified. [...] "I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All this sounds like shit, what do I want to hear?'. That's really all I did.

Later, it would become familiar to many Americans through its association with a long-running Chevrolet ad campaign (something Seger explicitly chose to do to support struggling American automobile workers in Detroit).
