[...] "Sir Arthur, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> the {{messenger}} of good luck, {{though he is}} but a lame one. You talked of the raven that scented out the slaughter from afar; but here's a blue pigeon (somewhat {{of the oldest and}} toughest, I grant) who smelled the good news six or seven miles off, flew thither in the taxed-cart, and returned with the olive branch." ...|$|E
5000|$|The President or CEO of Hasbro was at {{a charity}} event that Marvel’s President was also at. They {{ended up in the}} men’s room, {{standing}} next to each other peeing, and I think that’s how they met. They were talking about each other’s respective businesses, and it came up that Hasbro wanted to reactivate the trademark on G.I. Joe, but they were {{trying to come up with}} a new approach. guy was like ‘We have the best creative people in the world! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> this Editor-in-Chief of mine and we’ll fix it for you! ...|$|E
60|$|There, there, I am a fool! Tears! I have {{sometimes}} {{been moved to}} tears by a chapter of fine writing in a novel; but what have I to do with tears now? All depends on me--Father, this poor girl, the farm, everything; and they both love me--I am all in all to both; and he loves me too, I am quite sure of that. Courage, courage! and all will go well. (Goes to bedroom door; opens it.) How dark your room is! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> you <b>in</b> here where there is still full daylight. (Brings EVA forward.) Why, you look better.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A custom I devoutly hope King Harry will break!' exclaimed Ralf. 'If not, I'll {{some day}} find the way between those painted ribs of Monseigneur de la Mort, I can tell him! I had nearly {{given him a}} taste of my sword as it was, only some Gascon rogue caught my arm, and he was off ere I could get free. So I jumped off, that your poor corpse should not be trodden by French heels; and I hardly know how it was, but the Lady Esclairmonde was by my side as I dragged you out, and caused these good folks to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> you <b>in</b> behind their shop.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{ordered a}} carriage; shall I show him where it is? Perhaps you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{take you to}} it? They are so stupid here. They would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> it up." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY MARKBY. Good evening, dear Gertrude! So {{kind of you}} to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> my friend, Mrs. Cheveley. Two such charming {{women should}} know each other! ...|$|R
6000|$|ANDERSON. Well, {{perhaps you}} will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> you the news myself. Judith: {{will you give}} Mr. Dudgeon his tea, and keep him here until I return? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him to you. He did not know until this moment you were in town. I have not seen him since we met yesterday.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's {{not only}} because he's a genius that I ask you to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him here; it's because he's a human being, and he is ill and poor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, thanks most awfully," [...] {{interrupted}} Freddie. [...] "It's fearfully {{good of you}} to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him along. I must be staggering off now. Lot {{of things}} to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|Albert {{sprang up}} to help her put down the wood in her arms. [...] "I wish you'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> the wood," [...] he said pleadingly, as she refused his aid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you pardon me," [...] he said, [...] "if I {{remark that}} this {{conversation}} has no particular interest for <b>me?</b> Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> you any further {{out of your}} way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> my Uncle Joe to dinner tomorrow," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "The poor old fellow is {{stranded}} here for Thanksgiving, and he hates hotels. May I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Martha eagerly {{interrupted}} the hesitating voice,--and it was easily interrupted! [...] "Yes, yes, gran'father. They'll {{be sure to}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> home some for you. I'll be quite, quite sure to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's a scrape! Do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> that wicked boy over {{to explain}} and be lectured. I can't rest till I get hold of him." [...] And Jo made for the door again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Strickland is very ill. He may be dying. He {{is alone}} in a filthy attic, {{and there is not}} a soul to look after him. I want you to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> to a {{close the}} story of [...] "The Rover Boys on the River." [...] The trip had been full of adventures, but it now looked as if all would end happily.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, he's rich enough," [...] said Jimmy; {{getting up}} and {{reaching}} for his hat. [...] "In dollars, that is. Some ways he's poor enough. Well, I must be going. Thanks ever so much for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> Uncle Joe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{be seen by}} you--it {{comes to}} the same thing. She's really worth seeing; you must <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> her; you'll find her very suggestive. That idea that you should paint her--she appears to {{consider}} it a sort of bargain." ...|$|R
6000|$|Calib. I pr'ythee <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> thee where crabs grow; and I, with my long nails, will dig thee pig-nuts, shew thee a jay's nest, and {{instruct}} thee how to snare the marmozet: I'll bring thee to clustered filberts. Wilt thou go with me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is lying!" [...] Lenora insisted. [...] "I {{tell you}} there's another {{creature}} there, something we don't understand. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> the Electro-thought transference apparatus; let us read his mind.

6000|$|... 'You see,' {{said the}} young man,'the Marshal's family {{living in the}} country at present, the Marshal has given Miss Dorrit one of the rooms in his house to use when she likes. Don't you think you had better come up there, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> Miss Dorrit?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{cannot be}} sure of that," [...] he insisted.

6000|$|MRS DUBEDAT. He {{made those}} drawings; {{and they are}} not the best--nothing like the best; only I did not bring the really best: so few people like them. He is twenty-three: his whole life is before him. Wont you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him to you? wont you speak to him? wont you see for yourself? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] he replied; [...] "you can't {{afford to}} put off getting him much longer. I'm going back to-night, but I'll be over again to-morrow. Why don't you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him down? It will save you twelve dollars. And, by the way, suppose you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> take Lee Virginia home with me? She looks a bit depressed; an outing will do her good. She's taken hold here wonderfully." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not often, if {{you leave}} it to accident," [...] he replied with a smile. [...] "If you like to arrange the thing, there's a nice point of etiquette. You {{occupied}} your homestead before we came to ours, but you see {{we were on the}} prairie first. Anyhow, I'd be glad if you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> Sadie over." ...|$|R
6000|$|Stephen moved {{step by step}} as if he {{were being}} unwillingly dragged, until he had got round the open end of the stall, and was half hidden by a screen of draperies.

6000|$|... "And that’s why he wouldn’t <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> {{more than}} one box," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Stobell, with the air of one to whom all things had been suddenly revealed; [...] "and why he wouldn’t shut the house up. Oh, just fancy what a pickle I {{should have been in}} if I had! I must say it was thoughtful of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} that {{you expect me to}} reward you if you drug the dog," [...] said Sam, [...] "don't worry. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> this thing off, and you can have all I've got, and my cuff-links as well.

6000|$|... "No, that isn't {{the turn}} they take. They {{speak of the}} strong love {{interest}} involved in the problem. And the abundance of incident. I looked out to keep something happening, you know. I'm sorry I didn't ask Armiger to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> the notices home to you. I'm not sure that I did wisely not to subscribe to that press-clippings bureau." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my love, my precious, {{you don't}} mean that. I beseech you to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him here. We can make him comfortable. Perhaps {{we can save}} him.

In an interview with MTV News, Kid simply described his experience of working with Dr. Dre as [...] "amazing": [...] "He's {{one of my favorite}} producers of all time. Everybody knows how much of a perfectionist he is: He's been working on his album for 11 years. For him to <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>in,</b> trust me, not micro-manage <b>me,</b> and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> what I do to the table, I can't even describe how that makes me feel." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Of course. Do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him, Fee,' entreated Lance; 'he is {{no end of}} a chap--captain of our form almost always--and such a brick at cricket! I {{told him}} I'd show him the potteries, and your press, and our organ, and everything--and {{it is such a}} chance when we are all at home!
