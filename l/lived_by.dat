5|$|According {{to another}} legend, two Parmars from Malwa, named Govinddas and Madhavdas, took up their haunt among the rush grass {{that covered the}} {{neighbourhood}} of the Rudra Mahalaya, and <b>lived</b> <b>by</b> plunder. There they found the foundations of a temple and Shiva linga, and {{said that in the}} night they had seen heavenly beings. This was told to Siddharaj and led to the erection or completion of the temple.|$|E
5|$|After 4500 BCE the Ertebølle {{culture of}} northwestern origin entered a ceramic phase {{with its own}} forms of pottery (characteristic pointed bottoms). They <b>lived</b> <b>by</b> the Baltic Sea shores and were {{specialized}} in utilizing {{the resources of the}} sea, thus still representing the Mesolithic ways of life. At their settlement in Dąbki near Koszalin Stroke-ornamented pottery was found, obtained probably through trade with the Danubian people.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} have for centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They {{have been trained to}} dance, and were kept for baiting in Europe at least since the 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. Across Europe, nomadic Romani bear {{handlers}} called Ursari <b>lived</b> <b>by</b> busking with their bears from the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|Ritual bronzemaking: During the Shang dynasty, China {{became one}} of the most skilled bronze-working civilizations in the ancient world, as people heated, melted, and cast metal to making cooking utensils, tools, weapons, and other {{household}} items. Modern archaeologists see such preservation of how the ancient Chinese <b>lived</b> <b>by</b> interpreting from lacquer paintings on wood which helped preserve ancient Chinese bronze artifacts.|$|E
5|$|No prototypes for the {{painting}} are known in Sweden, and while {{the painting}} is occasionally associated with the Danube school, much about its stylistic and iconographic history remains to be investigated. A possible stylistic prototype is the illustrated Bible of Erhard Altdorfer (brother of the more famous Albrecht Altdorfer). Begun in 1530, it {{was inspired by the}} works of Cranach and Dürer, but also renewed the genre by combining commonplace details with an undertone of approaching disaster. In particular, Altdorfer's apocalyptic illustrations for the Revelation to John deliver an evangelic message {{similar to that of the}} Vädersolstavlan. Historical documents show that Olaus Petri, who commissioned the painting, combined biblical quotations related to the Apocalypse with the painting hanging in the church. Copies of Erhard Altdorfer's apocalyptic woodcuts may have been available in Stockholm through the German merchant Gorius Holste who <b>lived</b> <b>by</b> Järntorget square and who was a friend of both Petri and Martin Luther.|$|E
5|$|The Kafka {{family had}} a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment. Franz's room was often cold. In November 1913 the family moved into a bigger apartment, {{although}} Ellie and Valli had married and {{moved out of the}} first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli's former apartment, quiet by contrast, and <b>lived</b> <b>by</b> himself for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The short-tailed isopods {{have a short}} pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods {{and have}} a {{sedentary}} lifestyle on or under the sediment on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods {{which can be used}} in swimming. They are much more active and can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly endemic to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana soon after it broke away from Laurasia 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they <b>lived</b> <b>by</b> increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into refugia. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the deep sea, freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota are by far the most species-rich group of deep sea isopods.|$|E

6000|$|These words, 'the just shall <b>live</b> <b>by</b> faith,' {{are taken}} out of the Old Testament, and are thrice used by this apostle in the New. (1.) To show that nothing of the gospel can be apprehended but by faith: 'For therein is the righteousness of God {{revealed}} from faith to faith.' 'As it is written, The just shall <b>live</b> <b>by</b> faith' (Rom 1:17). (2.) To show that the way to have relief and succour under temptation is then to <b>live</b> <b>by</b> faith: 'Now the just shall <b>live</b> <b>by</b> faith' (Heb 10:38) (3.) But in this of the Galatians it is urged to show that how holy and just soever men be in themselves, yet as such they are dead, and condemned to death by the law before God. But that no man is justified by the law, in the sight of God, is evident; for, 'the just shall <b>live</b> <b>by</b> faith.' ...|$|R
