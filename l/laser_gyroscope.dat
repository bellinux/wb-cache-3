5|$|The F-20's {{avionics}} suite was all-new {{and greatly}} improved over the earlier designs. The General Electric AN/APG-67 multi-mode radar was {{the heart of}} the sensor suite, offering a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. The F-5's electro-mechanical navigation system was replaced with an all-electronic version based on a ring <b>laser</b> <b>gyroscope.</b> Time from power-on to being able to launch was greatly reduced as a result, to about 22 seconds, and Northrop boasted that the aircraft had the shortest scramble time of any contemporary aircraft. The cockpit of the F-5 was completely re-worked with a large head-up display (HUD) and two monochrome multi-function displays set high on the control panel, and the addition of a complete hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control system. Many of the avionics promised to have reliability beyond that of any competing aircraft then in service.|$|E

500|$|The RAAF's early model Hercules {{received}} several repairs and modifications during their service lives. During the early 1960s {{all of the}} C-130As were flown to the United States to receive new wing fuel tanks after the original tanks were affected by corrosion caused by tropical fungi and bacteria. Later that decade these aircraft received new panels on the upper surface of their wings after the original ones {{were found to be}} faulty. The C-130Es were also fitted with strengthened wing centre boxes in the early 1970s after equivalent USAF aircraft were found to be suffering from greater-than-expected wing stress during operations in Vietnam. During 1964 the C-130As received new doppler navigation systems, and the C-130Es and Hs were fitted with ring <b>laser</b> <b>gyroscope</b> inertial navigation systems from 1989. In 1994, four of No.36 Squadron's C-130Hs were equipped with Electronic Warfare Self Protection packs, including radar and missile warning systems, and counter measures such as chaff and flares. Later in the decade, one of the C-130Hs was fitted with extensive signals intelligence equipment under the classified [...] "Project Peacemate"; this aircraft was crewed by RAAF and Defence Signals Directorate personnel and its existence was never publicly confirmed by the Government. The modified C-130H was reported to still be active in the signals intelligence role in 2008. The C-130Hs were also among the first Australian military aircraft to be modified to allow aircrew to operate them while wearing night vision goggles.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new scheme for ultra-sensitive <b>laser</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> that {{utilizes}} {{the physics of}} exceptional points. By exploiting the properties of such non-Hermitian degeneracies, we show that the rotation-induced frequency splitting becomes proportional to the square root of the gyration speed- thus enhancing the sensitivity to low angular rotations by orders of magnitudes. In addition, at its maximum sensitivity limit, the measurable spectral splitting is independent of the radius of the rings involved.

[...] The low-altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night (LANTIRN) system is mounted externally under the engine intakes; it allows the aircraft to fly at low altitudes, at night and in any weather conditions, to attack ground targets {{with a variety of}} precision-guided and unguided weapons. The LANTIRN system gives the F-15E exceptional accuracy in weapons delivery day or night and in poor weather, and consists of two pods attached to the exterior of the aircraft. At night, the video picture from the LANTIRN can be projected on the HUD, producing an infrared image of the ground.|$|E
2500|$|A Honeywell ring <b>laser</b> <b>gyroscope</b> {{was used}} for spin rate {{determination}} and to obtain an inertial timing reference before the MHV separated from the second stage. [...] The infrared sensor was developed by Hughes Research Laboratories. The sensor utilized a strip detector where four strips of Indium Bismuth were arranged in a cross and four strips were arranged as logarithmic spirals. As the detector was spun, the infrared target's position could be measured as it crossed the strips in the sensor's field of view. The MHV infrared detector was cooled by liquid helium from a dewar installed {{in place of the}} F-15's gun ammunition drum and from a smaller dewar located in the second stage of the ASM-135. Cryogenic lines from the second stage were retracted prior to the spin up of the MHV.|$|E

2500|$|When the Boeing 757-200 entered {{service in}} 1983, it was {{equipped}} with the first suitable ring <b>laser</b> <b>gyroscope.</b> This gyroscope took many years to develop, and the experimental models went through many changes before it was deemed ready for production by the engineers and managers of Honeywell and Boeing. It was an outcome of the competition with mechanical gyroscopes, which kept improving. The reason Honeywell, of all companies, chose to develop the laser gyro {{was that they were}} the only one that didn't have a successful line of mechanical gyroscopes, so they wouldn't be competing against themselves. The first problem they had to solve was that with laser gyros rotations below a certain minimum could not be detected at all, due to a problem called [...] "lock-in", whereby the two beams act like coupled oscillators and pull each other's frequencies toward convergence and therefore zero output. The solution was to shake the gyro rapidly so that it never settled into lock-in. Paradoxically, too regular of a dithering motion produced an accumulation of short periods of lock-in when the device was at rest at the extremities of its shaking motion. This was cured by applying a random white noise to the vibration. The material of the block was also changed from quartz to a new glass ceramic Cer-Vit, made by Owens Corning, because of helium leaks.|$|E

30|$|A {{gyroscope}} is {{a sensor}} for measuring an angular rate or angle {{based on the}} principles of angular momentum. Early gyroscopes (e.g., ball electrostatic and ring <b>laser</b> <b>gyroscopes)</b> were generally large with poor portability. For several decades, micro-gyroscopes based on MEMS(Micro electro mechanical systems) technology have been studied, {{and there has been a}} steady improvement in their performance and in the technology used for their production. Recently, a number of outstanding micro-gyroscopes have demonstrated sufficient inertial grade performance to potentially replace fiber-optic and ring <b>laser</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> [1 - 4]. The micro-gyroscope has advantages such as a scale of a few millimeters, low-power consumption, scope for mass production, and it is low cost. However, currently available MEMS gyroscopes have suffered from a low mechanical Q-factor due to atmospheric viscosity, production difficulties due to the demand for a three-dimensional construction-suspended mechanical structure, and a large susceptibility to external shock and vibration.|$|R
