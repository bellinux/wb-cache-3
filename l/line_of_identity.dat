Recurrence plots are tools which visualise the recurrence behaviour of the phase space trajectory of dynamical systems. They mostly contain single dots and lines which are parallel to the mean diagonal (<b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity,</b> LOI) or which are vertical/horizontal. Lines parallel to the LOI {{are referred to as}} diagonal lines and the vertical structures as vertical lines. Because an RP is usually symmetric, horizontal and vertical lines correspond to each other, and, hence, only vertical lines are considered. The lines correspond to a typical behaviour of the phase space trajectory: whereas the diagonal lines represent such segments of the phase space trajectory which run parallel for some time, the vertical lines represent segments which remain in the same phase space region for some time.|$|E

30|$|Changes in EELV between {{consecutive}} {{measurements were}} computed for EELVWI-WO (ΔEELVWI-WO) and EELVCT (ΔEELVCT). Ability of the WI-WO technique to track changes in EELV was assessed using four-quadrant and polar plots. The four-quadrant plot relates ΔEELVWI-WO and ΔEELVCT, with upper right and lower left quadrants being quadrants of agreement (in which both EELVWI-WO and EELVCT have the same directional changes) and lower right and upper left quadrants being quadrants of disagreement (in which EELVWI-WO and EELVCT have opposite directional changes). Concordance rate {{was defined as the}} percentage of data points falling into one of the two quadrants of agreement, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total number of data points [21]. The main drawback of the four-quadrant plot is the lack of quantification of the distance between each data point and the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity,</b> leading to the development of polar plot analysis [21]. Polar plot is obtained by a 45 ° clockwise rotation of the four-quadrant plot, changing the dimensions of the radius to mean ΔEELV [22], lining up the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> along the horizontal axis. Data points with positive and negative directional changes are located on the right and the left side of the polar plot, respectively, and the polar angle represents the angle of each data point with <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> A 0 ° polar angle depicts a perfect agreement between ΔEELVWI-WO and ΔEELVCT, while polar angles in the range 45 ° to 135 ° and 225 ° to 315 ° depict disagreement between directional changes of EELVWI-WO and EELVCT. The following variables are computed from polar plots: (1) angular bias as the mean angle between all data points and polar axis [21], reflects the difference in calibration between the reference and test methods; (2) radial limits of agreement as the radial sector containing 95 % of the data points, after conversion of negative deflections to positive ones, is a polar version of the 95 % confidence limits and is similar to the limits of agreement in Bland and Altman analysis [21].|$|E

Thirteen well-trained competitive surfers performed a stepwise, incremental, prone arm-paddling exercise test to exhaustion. For each subject, data obtained {{at the end of each}} stage (i. e., HR and V˙O(2) values) were expressed as a percentage of HRR, V˙O(2 peak), and V˙O(2 R) respectively and used to determine the individual %HRR-%V˙O(2 peak) and %HRR-%V˙O(2 R) relationships.

Accuracy, precision, and bias were examined in ADP with HW serving as the criterion method. Lohman's equations that are child specific for age and gender were used to convert body density to % fat. Regression analysis determined the accuracy of ADP and potential bias between ADP and HW using Bland-Altman analysis. Results For the entire group (Y = 0. 835 x + 0. 171, R 2 = 0. 84, SEE = 0. 007 g/cm 3) and for the males (Y = 0. 837 x + 0. 174, R 2 = 0. 90, SEE = 0. 006 g/cm 3) the regression between total body density by HW and by ADP significantly deviated from the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> However in females, the regression between total body density by HW and ADP did not significantly deviate from the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> (Y = 0. 750 x + 0. 258, R 2 = 0. 55, SEE = 0. 008 g/cm 3).

Bland-Altman analysis revealed no bias between HW total body density and ADP total body density for the entire group (R = 0. - 22; P = 0. 08) or for females (R = 0. 02; P = 0. 92), however bias existed in males (R = - 0. 37; P ≤ 0. 05). Bland-Altman analysis revealed no bias between HW and ADP % fat for the entire group (R = 0. 21; P = 0. 10) or in females (R = 0. 10; P = 0. 57), however bias was indicated for males by a significant correlation (R = 0. 36; P ≤ 0. 05), with ADP underestimating % fat at lower fat values and overestimating at the higher % fat values.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{examined}} the relationship between peak-to-peak (common invasive measurement), peak instantaneous (common Doppler measurement), and mean pressure gradients in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and aortic stenosis (AS). BackgroundIn patients with AS, the peak-to-peak gradient and peak instantaneous gradient are discrepant, and the mean gradient best represents obstruction severity. The pathophysiology of outflow obstruction differs in HCM, with the maximum gradient occurring in late systole, thus the optimal method for quantifying gradient severity in HCM remains undefined. MethodsFifty patients with HCM and 50 patients with AS underwent gradient characterization at cardiac catheterization (age 55 ± 15 years vs. 72 ± 9 years; 48 % vs. 42 % male, respectively). All HCM patients were studied with high-fidelity, micromanometer-tip catheters and transseptal measurement of left ventricular inflow and central aortic pressures. In AS, simultaneous left ventricular and central aortic pressures were recorded. ResultsThe peak instantaneous gradient was linearly correlated with peak-to-peak gradient in HCM (R 2 = 0. 98, p < 0. 0001), with the relationship close to the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> In AS, more scatter and further deviation from the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> occurred when comparing the peak instantaneous gradient to the peak-to-peak gradient (R 2 = 0. 70, p < 0. 0001).

Thus, we evaluated beat-to-beat measurements in HRV in wild-type (WT) and KO mice, before and after CST replacement. HR dynamics were evaluated by bipolar Einthoven electrocardiogram, with deconvolution into time and frequency domains, as well as Lorenz nonlinear return analyses. At baseline, HR was higher [444 ± 24 beats per minute (bpm) ] in KO compared with WT (330 ± 18 bpm) mice. The total power in the HRV spectra was substantially diminished in KO animals. CST increased total power but only in KO mice. Each time-domain parameter was substantially lower in KO compared with WT mice, and the CST in the KO group could reverse the differences. Lorenz analysis revealed reductions in S 1 (short axis perpendicular to the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> in the ellipse) and S 2 (long axis along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> in the ellipse) in KO animals, indicating that regulation of HRV is diminished in the parasympathetic and sympathetic domains. CST replacement caused restoration of both S 1 and S 2, in the KO group. These data suggest that Chga has {{a profound effect on}} autonomic tone to the heart and that its CST fragment is responsible for such actions. The results suggest future strategies for intervention in cardiovascular disorders accompanied by adverse HRV profiles...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to {{determine}} the relationships between %HRR vs. %VO 2 R and %HRR vs. %VO 2 max during maximal elliptical crosstrainer (ECT) exercise. A secondary aim was to compare the %HRR vs. %VO 2 R and %HRR vs. %VO 2 max relationships between maximal ECT and treadmill (TM) exercise. Adult subjects (n = 48) completed a maximal exercise test on the ECT, with a subgroup (N = 24) also performing a maximal exercise test on the TM. Continuous HR and VO 2 data were analyzed via linear regression to determine y-intercept and slope values for %HRR vs. %VO 2 R and %HRR vs. %VO 2 max. Student t-tests were used to determine whether the mean y-intercept and slope values differed from the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> (y-intercept = 0, slope = 1). For each group, both the y-intercept and slope for %HRR vs. %VO 2 R fit the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> Conversely, for all groups both the y-intercept and slope for %HRR vs. %VO 2 max were significantly different (p 0. 05) for either y-intercept (ECT = 0. 3 vs. TM = - 0. 3, p = 0. 435) or slope (ECT = 1. 01 vs. TM = 1. 00, p = 0. 079) values. In agreement with previous research on TM and cycle exercise, it was found that %HRR is more closely aligned with %VO 2 R, rather than %VO 2 max during ECT exercise. Additionally, it was found that the regressions of %HRR vs. %VO 2 R and %HRR vs. %VO 2 max were equivalent between the ECT and T...|$|E
40|$|Antisera against whole {{cells of}} each Peptostreptococcus species (P. anaerobius, P. micros, P. parvulus, and P. productus) were {{produced}} in rabbits. When these antisera were reacted against sonically disrupted cells and culture supernatant fluids in Ouchterlony tests, <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> were obtained among the antigens {{from all the}} species and uninoculated culture medium. When the antisera were subsequently absorbed with the dehydrated culture medium used to grow the peptostreptococci, all cross-reactions in heterologous antigen-antibody combinations were eliminated, leaving only species-specific precipitin arcs. These absorbed antisera, specific for each Peptostreptococcus species by Ouchterlony tests, were used for rapid identification studies. Staphylococcus aureus-bearing protein A was sensitized with each absorbed antiserum. These reagents produced specific coagglutination reactions with suspensions of each Peptostreptococcus reference strain and with 16 clinical isolates. No cross-reactions occurred with the Streptococcus intermedius, Peptococcus magnus, or Peptococcus asaccharolyticus strains tested...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that ECGs exhibiting a predominant spectral peak reflect temporal regularity, and that waves that maintain their shape between axes reflect spatial regularity, in cardiac activation. We analyzed ECGs of 38 patients at electrophysiologic study (EPS). Atrial or ventricular activity was {{depicted as a}} series of correlation values of a template to the ECG over time. In regular supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias at invasive EPS, temporal phase was maintained since ECG spectra showed peaks> 6 dB magnitude, and spatial phase was maintained between axes since correlation time-series, plotted for lead V 5 vs aVF (XY), V 5 /V 1 (XZ) and aVF/V 1 (YZ), resulted in reproducible loops parallel to the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> Supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias with non-uniform intracardiac spatial or temporal activation did not maintain temporal or spatial phase. Analysis was insensitive to the effects of simulated noise, baseline wander, altered gain and template selection...|$|R
40|$|Anti-Ro (or SSA) is a {{clinically}} important autoantibody that {{is found}} in 25 – 40 % of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus {{as well as an}} even greater proportion of patients with Sjögren's syndrome or subacute cutaneous lupus. We have studied the binding of anti-Ro sera to multiple antigenic peptides constructed from the sequence of the 60 -kD Ro molecule. The results demonstrate that sera bind these peptides in solid-phase assay. Surprisingly, some of these peptides also form a precipitin line in double immunodiffusion with anti-Ro sera. Formation <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> in double immunodiffusion as well as absorption studies indicate that peptides distant in the primary amino acid sequence and without shared sequence are bound by the same antibody. In addition, data from surface plasmon resonance demonstrate that peptides identified in this manner have protein–protein interactions. Thus, these techniques may identify the components of conformational epitopes...|$|R
