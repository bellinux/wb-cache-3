In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|R

5000|$|Nicolas Van de Walle {{argues that}} neopatrimonialism is very {{prevalent}} in Africa.

As Joel Migdal puts it, the state in African countries seems omnipresent {{in all aspects of}} people’s lives, from the very local to the central government levels.Van de Walle introduces the notion that in Africa, states are hybrid regimes where patrimonial practices and bureaucracies coexist to a higher or <b>lesser</b> degree. <b>African</b> states have laws and constitutional order and in parallel are ruled by patrimonial logic in which political authority is based on clientelism and office holders constantly appropriate public resources for their own benefit. The dual nature of African regimes means that clientelism is not incidental and cannot be easily corrected with capacity building policies {{and at the same time}} formal structures play an important role, even in the least-institutionalized states.|$|R

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta) {{growing in}} Uganda during 2001 – 2002 has been {{screened}} {{for the presence}} of begomoviruses using PCR-RFLP, cloning full-length genomic components and nucleotide sequence analysis. In contrast with a recent survey in neighbouring Kenya, which identified three distinct strains of East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV, EACMV-UG and EACMV-KE 2) as well as East African cassava mosaic Zanzibar virus and the new species East African cassava mosaic Kenya virus, only EACMV-UG and, to a <b>lesser</b> extent, <b>African</b> cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) were found associated with cassava in Uganda. The integrity of the cloned genomic components of representative virus isolates was confirmed by demonstrating their infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and cassava using biolistic inoculation, providing a convenient means to screen cassava varieties for disease resistance. Both EACMV-UG and ACMV were also associated with Manihot glaziovii. Infectivity studies using cloned components confirmed that viruses from one host could infect the other, suggesting that this wild relative of cassava might be a reservoir host for the disease. The relatively low level of diversity of begomoviruses associated with cassava mosaic disease in Uganda is consistent with reports that EACMV-UG has displaced other begomovirus species and strains during the recent epidemic that swept through the country.

40|$|Scope: The growing world {{population}} {{is a key}} driver for the exploration of sustainable protein sources to ensure food security. Mealworm and other insects are promising candidates. Previously we found that shrimp allergic patients {{are at risk for}} mealworm allergy, and that mealworm can induce a primary allergy. This study set out to investigate the allergenic potential of edible insects, suggested for human consumption by agencies such as WHO/FAO, in both the shrimp (potentially cross-reactive) and primary mealworm allergic population. The following insects were studied: mealworm, house cricket, giant mealworm, <b>lesser</b> mealworm, <b>African</b> grasshopper, large wax moth, and black soldier fly. Methods and results: Fifteen shrimp (mealworm sensitized or allergic) patients and four primary mealworm allergic subjects, who participated in previous studies, were included. All shrimp allergic patients were sensitized to multiple insects with similar response profiles for all insects tested. Primary mealworm allergic patients, showed IgE binding to proteins from only a few insects on immunoblot, although basophil activation test was positive for all tested insects. Conclusion: Shrimp allergic patients are most likely at risk of food allergy to mealworm and other insects. Primary mealworm allergy does not mean subjects are likely to react to all insects. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinhei...|$|R

40|$|Mexican mestizos are a {{recently}} admixed popula-tion composed of Amerindian, European, and, to a <b>lesser</b> extent, <b>African</b> ancestry. Before the Spanish arrived in 1519, Mexico {{was occupied by}} {{a large number of}} Indian groups with different social and economic systems. There was greater diversity and more indigenous Amerindian groups lived in Central and Southern Mexico compared to the northern regions. Between 1545 and 1548, the Amerindian population notably decreased, due to catastrophic epidemics that killed an estimated 80 % of the native population [1]. African slaves were brought into the regions soon after due to the labor shortage, and subsequent admixture processes in geographically distant regions have been affected by different demographic and historical conditions, shaping the modern genomic structure of Mexicans. These factors initially generated considerable genetic heterogeneity between subpopulations from different regions throughout Mexico [2]. However, with subsequent generations and the practice of consanguineous marriages, which is still common in several communities, the genetic variation in these isolated popu-lations decreases, thus increasing the chances of recessive disease. For example, when a rare disease arises frequently in a population where there is consanguinity, the disease is more likely to arise due to a mutation derived from a common ancestor and is identical-by-descent (IBD), when compared to a population where there is no obvious consanguinity [3].

30|$|Parasitic diseases, such as malaria {{and to a}} <b>lesser</b> extent human <b>African</b> trypanosomiasis (HAT, {{sleeping}} sickness) and leishmaniasis, pose {{an increasing}} threat to human health and welfare, especially in developing countries [1]. Although effective treatments exist for the clinical management of these diseases, such treatments are costly, marginally effective, and sometimes have unacceptable levels of toxicity. Additionally, there is a steady increase in the resistance of parasites to these drugs. For example, the clinical management of malaria has become more challenging, due to resistance of parasites to drugs such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine–pyremethamine, which were once regarded as the mainstay of malaria chemotherapy [2] and reports of artemisinin resistance of Plasmodium falciparum around western Cambodia [3]. Melarsoprol, the only drug that treats Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense infections is extremely toxic [4]. The major liability of antimonials, pentamidine and amphotericin B {{in the treatment of}} leishmaniasis resides in their safety and cost that takes them out of reach of the local poor.|$|R

40|$|In {{view of the}} low pasture {{productivity}} in the Central American humid tropics where cattle rearing is a major land-use activity, {{it is important to}} examine the potential of alternate feed sources for ruminant feeding. Erythrina berteroana Uban, locally known as poro, and green banana (Musa AAA) fruits have been identified as two such potential sources. The effects of feeding poro as a grazing supplement and diet supplementation with green banana fruits on cattle productivity were evaluated in a long-term trial in Costa Rica. Daily liveweight (LW) gains were measured and samples of all feed material were analyzed for crude protein and in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility. Pasture availability was high, averaging 0. 17 t DM ha day– 1 over the grazing period. The main grass species were Paspalum fasciculatium Poiret, Axonopus compressus Swartz and to a <b>lesser</b> extent <b>African</b> star grass (Cynodon nlemfluensis Vanderyst). DM yields of poro declined significantly with time (> 50 %) when it was managed with a two-month resting period but remained higher when subsequently managed with a three-month resting period. Average daily LW gain of animals was 21 % to 26 % higher with two hours daily browsing of poro than for animals only grazing pasture. Highest liveweight gain was achieved when diets were supplemented with banana and there was no additional benefit when poro was fed in addition to banana. This suggests that fodder banks of poro or supplements with green banana can improve cattle nutrition in the humid tropics...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{of ethnic}} disparities in the {{conversion}} of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes is scarce. We studied the association of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) with the 10 -year cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes in three ethnic groups. We analyzed data for 90 South-Asian Surinamese, 190 African-Surinamese, and 176 ethnic Dutch that were collected in the periods 2001 - 2003 and 2011 - 2012. We excluded those with type 2 diabetes or missing FPG data. We defined baseline IFG as FPG of 5. 7 - 6. 9 mmol/L. We defined type 2 diabetes at follow-up as FPG ≥ 7. 0 mmol/L, HbA 1 c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (6. 5 %), or self-reported type 2 diabetes. 10 -Year cumulative incidences of type 2 diabetes were: South-Asian Surinamese, 18. 9 %; African-Surinamese, 13. 7 %; ethnic Dutch, 4. 5 % (p < 0. 05). The adjusted association of baseline IFG and FPG with the 10 -year cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes was stronger for South-Asian Surinamese than for African-Surinamese and ethnic Dutch. The IFG (compared to normoglycaemia) ORs were 11. 1 [3. 0 - 40. 8] for South-Asian Surinamese, 5. 1 [2. 0 - 13. 3] for African-Surinamese, and 2. 2 [0. 5 - 10. 1] for ethnic Dutch. The 10 -year cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes was higher and associations with baseline IFG and FPG were stronger among South-Asian Surinamese and African-Surinamese than among ethnic Dutch.

5000|$|Mexico {{has seen}} a variety of {{cultural}} influences over the years, and in its history has adopted a mixed assimilationist/multiculturalist policy. Mexico, beginning with the conquest of the Aztecs, had entered a new global empire based on trade and immigration. In the 16th and 17th centuries, waves of Spanish, and to a <b>lesser</b> extent, <b>African</b> and Filipino culture became embedded {{into the fabric of}} Mexican culture. It is important to note, however, that from a Mexican standpoint, the immigrants and their culture were no longer considered foreign, but Mexican in their entirety. The food, art, and even heritage were assimilated into a Mexican identity. Upon the independence of Mexico, Mexico began receiving immigrants from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again, bringing many cultural influences but being quickly labeled as Mexican, unlike in the United States, where other culture is considered foreign. This assimilation is very evident, even in Mexican society today: for example, banda, a style of music originating in northern Mexico, is simply a Mexican take on Central European music brought by immigrants in the 18th century. Mexico's thriving beer industry was also the result of German brewers finding refuge in Mexico. Many famous Mexicans are actually of Arab descent; Salma Hayek and Carlos Slim. The coastal states of Guerrero and Veracruz are inhabited by citizens of African descent. Mexico's national policy is based on the concept of mestizaje, a word meaning [...] "to mix". The immigrants are socially under pressure to adopt a Mexican nationality and become part of the broader culture (speaking Spanish, respect the Catholic heritage, help the society), while contributing useful cultural traits foreign to Mexican society.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the status of artisanal fisheries in the lower Phongolo River floodplain in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A cross-sectional quantitative survey design was used that included the development of a questionnaire and a systematic survey among the five villages bordering the Ndumo Game Reserve. Data were collected over a 5 -day period by a group of 16 fieldworkers and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 21. The results revealed that fish was the third most consumed protein in the area, that people consumed fish on average twice a week, that at least six fish species (and one recently introduced crayfish species) were consumed regularly, and that most fish were obtained from local vendors, who in turn bought it from local fishermen and -women. Fishing activities also appeared to occur predominantly along the river system and targeted mainly red-breasted tilapia (Tilapia rendalli) and Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) and, to a slightly <b>lesser</b> extent, <b>African</b> sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus) and brown squeaker (Synodontis zambezensis). Conservation implications: Given that Ndumo residents predominantly catch fish by means of non-commercial methods, that they do so for reasons of personal consumption and subsistence, and that they mostly target rivers and dams rather than the ecologically sensitive pans in the region, it would seem likely that fishing in the region might be sustainable for the moment. However, it is recommended that studies on the local fish populations and their reproductive rates be conducted so that the actual impact on local fish populations can be determined more accurately. This study serves to provide the necessary baseline data on fish utilisation in the region, which would enable the impact of artisanal fishing on fish reserves in the Ndumo region to be determined once population studies have been completed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} public health problem that has affected 3. 9 million Americans and 170 million people worldwide and is currently the most common indication for orthotopic liver transplantation.

40|$|The {{observation}} of dental non-metric characters {{used in the}} Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System (among others) is of major interest {{in the study of}} past populations. Dental morphological traits are genetically determined, and dependent of a small and stable part of the genome; their development seems unaffected by the uterine environment and their evolution is slow, probably independent of natural selection. The relative frequency of dental traits is a testimony to the biological distances between populations. The study of the inferior dentition in a late XIXth/early XXth century sample deceased in Oporto, Portugal, is the example of a statistically simple approach to the biological comparison between populations, using the ASUDAS (Turner et al. 1991), mainly, but also a trait proposed by Weets (2009). The comparisons with international samples denoted biological relatedness with European and, to a <b>lesser</b> extent, North <b>African</b> populations. The Iberian samples also suggest a close relationship with those populations. The use of the ASUDAS to the study of teeth from archaeological contexts is important.

40|$|The {{importance}} of sleep on health {{has only been}} recently recognized, {{and the general public}} and the medical community are not yet fully knowledgeable about this issue. The great majority of sleep research has been performed in whites of European descent and to a <b>lesser</b> extent in <b>African</b> Americans, making generalization of the findings to other ethnic and racial groups difficult. Very little sleep research has been done in U. S. Hispanics. However, based on the available literature and the high prevalence of risk factors in Hispanics, such as obesity, diabetes, living in the inner city, and use of alcohol, the prevalence of such important sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and sleep habits such as poor sleep hygiene are suspected to be high. There is also some evidence that acculturation to the U. S. life style may lead to worse sleep habits in Hispanics, including fewer hours of sleep. Two current large NIH sponsored studies of sleep in U. S.

40|$|AbstractFalls {{in older}} adults are a {{significant}} public health issue and a particularly significant health risk in Minnesota. With accumulating research evidence suggesting that falls can be prevented through exercise, there is an increased public health effort among organizations serving older adults to translate and disseminate evidence-based programs into the community. Such efforts, however, face additional challenges if they are implemented in communities with older adults from different cultural backgrounds and languages. This paper briefly describes a pilot community-based dissemination project, including the initiation, implementation, process, and outcomes, of an evidence-based fall prevention (Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance formerly known as Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance) through a local Area Agency on Aging in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota (USA).

40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>lesser</b> bushbaby, Galago moholi, is {{currently}} {{described as a}} food specialist, feeding exclusively on small arthropods and gum primarily from Acacia karroo trees. We studied a population of G. moholi in a highly-fragmented habitat in the southernmost part of its natural distributional range in South Africa. In this habitat we opportunistically observed bushbabies feeding on fruits of the winter fruiting tree, Pappea capensis. Plot counts of tree composition revealed that although the dominant tree species in the area belonged to the genus Acacia, A. karroo trees were widely absent and gum could only be found in small quantities on other Acacia species. The analysis of P. capensis fruits showed high levels of protein, fat and energy content, making the fruits a potentially important food source for G. moholi during winter when insect availability is low. Our observation is the first documented case of fruit-feeding in G. moholi, suggesting that the species is not a food specialist as previously reported, but can opportunistically supplement its diet with fruit when available.
