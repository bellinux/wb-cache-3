50|$|Major {{airlines}} dominated their routes through aggressive {{pricing and}} additional capacity offerings, often swamping new start-ups. In {{the place of}} high barriers to entry imposed by regulation, the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> <b>pricing.</b> In this strategy an already established and dominant airline stomps out its competition by lowering airfares on specific routes, below the cost of operating on it, choking out any chance a start-up airline may have. The industry side effect is an overall drop in revenue and service quality. Since deregulation in 1978 the average domestic ticket price has dropped by 40%. So has airline employee pay. By incurring massive losses, the airlines of the USA now rely upon a scourge of cyclical Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to continue doing business. America West Airlines (which has since merged with US Airways) remained a significant survivor from this new entrant era, as dozens, even hundreds, have gone under.|$|E

Borrowing design cues from the 1956 Clipper (visual in the grille and dash), with wheel covers, tail lamps, and dials from 1956 along with the Packard cormorant hood mascot and trunk chrome trim from 1955 senior Packards, the 1957 Packard Clipper {{was more than a}} badge-engineered Studebaker—but also far from a Patrician.

The framework is ex- tended by allowing �rms to use bundling strategies.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} pricing of malls in an {{environment}} where shoppers choose between a car and public transportation in getting to a suburban mall. The mall implicitly engages in mixed bundling; it sells goods bundled with parking to shoppers who come by car, and only goods to shoppers who come by public transportation. There are external costs of discomfort in public transportation due to crowdedness. Thus, shoppers using public transportation deter each other. The mall internalizes these external costs, much like a policy maker. To do so, it raises the sales price of the good and sets a parking fee less than parking’s marginal cost. Hence, parking is always a <b>loss</b> <b>leader.</b> Surprisingly, this <b>pricing</b> scheme is not necessarily distortionary...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a model of}} <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> <b>pricing</b> and quantity restrictions for a competitive multiproduct industry when individual consumers have continuous (and independent) demands for the set of available goods. Utilizing a generalization of the model proposed by Bliss [1988], we demonstrate the importance of consumer heterogeneity {{for the existence of}} cross subsidies when there is complete information and individual consumers have smooth, downward sloping demands. Continuous cross subsidies arising from consumer heterogeneity are also shown to exist in Hotelling models. Our use of continuous rather than 'unit' demands allows us to analyze issues related to welfare, which in turn exposes a strong incentive for the firm to place binding quantity restrictions on consumers. We also show how the presence of quantity restrictions can be used to distinguish between continuous cross subsidies arising from heterogeneous consumers versus those arising from classic demand complementarity with homogeneous agents.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a {{closed-loop}} supply chain (CLSC) {{consisting of a}} manufacturer and a retailer of a single product with numerous end product customers. The key feature differentiating this paper from the extant literature in CLSC is that our model is retailer-driven while the traditional CLSC models have been manufacturer-driven. This study is motivated {{by the emergence of}} super retailers such as Wal-Mart. Under these circumstances, we show how the retailer leads and the manufacturer follows in determining the wholesale and retail prices in the forward flow and the used product collecting and return prices in the reverse flow. In particular, we show via numerical examples a <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> <b>pricing</b> behavior of the retailer who intentionally loses money for each unit returned in the reverse flow so as to make the maximum total profit considering both forward and reverse flows. Next, we investigate a centrally coordinated CLSC of the retailer and the manufacturer as well as the manufacturer-driven model, and compare the price and profit implications with the retailer-driven model. Also, we examine various ramifications of the retailer-driven model with respect to the coordination mechanisms, policy implications, and third-party logistics...|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} add-on or “drip ” pricing {{behavior}} of {{firms in the}} Portuguese market for driving instruction. We present a model in which consumers purchase a base and, with some probability, an add-on product from the same firm, but are not always aware of the possible need for the add-on product. We show that a <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> <b>pricing</b> strategy emerges whereby firms price the upfront product below single-product pricing levels, but the add-on at monopoly levels. We then test {{the implications of the}} model using a detailed snapshot of industry data on student characteristics and preferences, school attributes including prices and costs, and market demographics for a cross-section of local markets with differing numbers of school competitors. We find evidence in support of the model predictions, including that firms have a profit motive in the add-on market. Prices for the base product, but not the add-on products, {{decline in the number of}} competitors a firm faces. Estimates of an empirical version of the model suggest that approximately one-quarter of students are inattentive to the add-on when making their school choice, closely matching the share of students who are uninformed about the add-ons ’ prices in a survey.

40|$|When some {{customers}} are more profitable to serve than others, {{one might expect}} sellers to compete more vigorously for the more profitable customers. One way sellers might {{do this is to}} sell goods that are purchased primarily by the most profitable customers using a lower mark-up than on other goods. This allows the firms to give discounts to more profitable customers without offering them to less profitable customers. This paper presents a model in which competing multi-product firms facing customers that purchase different quantities of goods, set prices in this manner. This model suggests a theory of multi-product pricing in which the markup on any particular product is inversely related to the average profitability of the customer that purchases the good. One interesting implication of this paper is that <b>loss</b> <b>leader</b> <b>pricing</b> might be viewed as a way for firms to compete more vigorously for more profitable customers. Such an explanation offers another characteristic of products that should be used as loss leaders. This explanation provides potentially testable implications about the types of goods that can (or ought to) be used as loss leaders and can explain why grocery stores sell turkeys as loss leaders at Thanksgiving and lower the price of eggs at Easter, but not flowers on Mother's Day, or candy on Valentines Day.
