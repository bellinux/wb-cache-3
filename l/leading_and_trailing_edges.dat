5|$|The He 111 design quickly {{ran through}} a series of minor design revisions. One of the more obvious changes started with the He 111F models, which moved from the {{elliptical}} wing to one with straight <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges,</b> which could be manufactured more efficiently. The dimensions of the new design had a wing span of 22.6m (74ft 1¾in) and an area of 87.60m² (942.90ft).|$|E
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is bluish-grey to green above, {{changing}} to a silvery white on its sides and belly. The dorsal and anal fins are pale to yellow, becoming dusky at the outer edges. The pectoral and pelvic fins are also pale with dusky upper halves, while the caudal fin is dark, {{particularly on the}} <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges.</b> A large black spot is present on the operculum.|$|E

5000|$|Wing {{roots are}} often faired to reduce {{interference}} drag between the wing and the fuselage. On top {{and below the}} wing it consists of small rounded edge to reduce the surface and such friction drag.

40|$|An {{analytical}} and mechanization {{study was conducted}} for two flutter stability augmentation systems. One concept uses only the wing <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> control surface. Another concept uses <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> control surfaces operating simultaneously. The combined use of <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> control surfaces should improve the surface coupling (controllability) with vertical bending and torsional structural modes and decrease the coupling between bending and torsional modes. The study was directed toward stability augmentation systems characteristics for the supersonic transport aircraft...|$|R
25|$|Cantilever three-spar {{structure}} of modified trapezoid planform. Centre section integral with fuselage. Inboard sections, outboard sections and detachable <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges.</b> High-lift devices comprise full-span six-segment {{leading edge slats}} (contiguous at engine pylons) at up to 17.5% of chord (drooping to 35°), two-segment fixed-vane double-slotted trailing edge flaps occupying some 75% of the span (deploying to 40°) and five-segment spoilers (outboards used as spoilerons at high speeds, inboards used as lift dumpers on the ground). Two-segment outboard ailerons for low speed roll control. Boundary layer fences over pylons. Engines suspended from the wing on pylons act as anti-flutter weights. Trim range is 16–33% of mean aerodynamic chord.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 V5g: (große Fläche — large surface) In August 1940 a {{collision}} with a ground vehicle damaged the V5 and it {{was sent back to}} the factory for major repairs. This was an opportune time to rebuild it with a new wing which was less tapered in plan than the original design, extending the <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> outward to increase the area. The new wing had an area of 18.30m² (197ft²), and now spanned 10.506m (34ft 5in). After conversion, the aircraft was called the V5g for große Fläche (large surface). Although it was 10km/h (6mph) slower than when fitted with the small wing, V5g was much more manoeuvrable and had a faster climb rate. This new wing platform was to be used for all major production versions of the Fw 190.|$|E
25|$|Lozenge {{camouflage}} came {{in varying}} widths, sometimes in 4.5-foot-wide (1.4 m) bolts of fabric, and pieces were cut to fit between the <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of the wing. Fabric sections laid chordwise {{were lined up}} {{next to each other}} so that the pattern repeated itself regularly across the wing, except for the ailerons which were covered in fabric laid sparwise, perpendicular to the wing pattern. Some aircraft had the fabric applied diagonally. As a part of field repairs, regularly laid fabric patterns from the factory might be overlaid with the same pattern but at a different angle, or with fabric from a different camouflage design. Later in the war, some patterns were applied more quickly with fabric laid sparwise along the full wingspan. Hasty factory work began to resemble the rushed field repairs.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the subsonic longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of a modified arrow-wing model was conducted in the Langley 4 - by 7 -Meter Tunnel. This investigation addressed {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flap deflections of this model. The arrow wing was tested at a Mach number of 0. 02 and at an angle-of-attack range from - 4 deg to 24 deg. The results of the investigation showed that deflecting the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> in combination could promote an attached-flow condition at the wing leading edge. Also, the leading edge suction could be maximized over the complete lift-coefficient range by scheduling a combination of <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> flap deflections...|$|R
40|$|A {{conventional}} and a tandem bladed stage {{were designed for}} a comparative experimental evaluation in a 0. 8 hub/tip ratio single-stage compressor.

25|$|The Su-57 will be {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft in Russian Air Force service to use stealth technology. Similar to other stealth fighters such as the F-22, the airframe incorporates planform edge alignment to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS); the <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> of the wings and control surfaces and the serrated edges of skin panels are carefully aligned at several specific angles {{in order to reduce the}} number of directions the radar waves can be reflected. Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe, and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft's stealthy shape. The IRST housing is turned backwards when not in use, and its rear is treated with radar-absorbent material (RAM) to reduce its radar return. To mask the significant RCS contribution of the engine face, the partial serpentine inlet obscures most, but not all, of the engine's fan and inlet guide-vanes (IGV). The production aircraft incorporates radar blockers similar in principle to those used on the F/A-18E/F in front of the engine fan to hide it from all angles. The aircraft uses RAM to absorb radar emissions and reduce their reflection back to the source, and the canopy is treated with a coating to minimize the radar return of the cockpit and pilot.|$|E
500|$|The second {{prototype}} had a redesigned single vertical stabiliser and a 610PS (...) Junkers Jumo 210 A engine installed, {{and later}} the Jumo 210 Da. The first A series variant, the A-0, was of all-metal construction, with an enclosed cockpit under a [...] "greenhouse" [...] well-framed canopy; bearing twin radio masts on its aft sections, diagonally mounted {{to either side of}} the airframe's planform centreline and unique to the -A version. To ease the difficulty of mass production, {{the leading edge of the}} wing was straightened out and the ailerons' two aerofoil sections had smooth <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges.</b> The pilot could adjust the elevator and rudder trim tabs in flight, and the tail was connected to the landing flaps, which were positioned in two parts between the ailerons and fuselage. The A-0 also had a flatter engine cowling, which gave the pilot a much better field of vision. In order for the engine cowling to be flattened, the engine was set down nearly [...] The fuselage was also lowered along with the gunner's position, allowing the gunner a better field of fire.|$|E

40|$|The {{contamination}} monitors on the M 0003 experiment {{consisted of}} passive sample collectors to measure molecular and particulate deposition. The collectors {{were placed in}} the <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> trays of M 0003. The objective was to quantify the contaminants and determine how contamination affected the other materials in the trays. Duplicate collectors were placed inside the vacuum canisters that provided protection from the launch, ascent, deployment, and recovery environments. Analyses of the samples show small quantities of molecular deposition on both the <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> trays. Silicone deposits are negligible. The aluminized fused silica, second surface mirrors showed small changes in solar absorptances. This is consistent with the small quantities of molecular deposits deduced from the FTIR measurements.

Torsion and bending motions are sensed and converted by the stability augmentation system into <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> control surface deflections which produce lift forces and pitching moments to suppress flutter...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{remarkable}} feature {{was that}} its wingspan {{was less than}} the overall length. The wings were cambered on the <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> with a flat middle section. This wing design proved to be very inefficient. Power was provided by a [...] Clerget 9Z nine-cylinder air cooled rotary engine and {{it was to be}} armed with two [...] Vickers machine guns.|$|E
2500|$|The aircraft's {{elliptical}} wing {{was built}} using a unique stressed-skin structure, designed by Barnes Wallis for lightness. The {{top and bottom}} were manufactured separately, and then clamped together at the <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges,</b> this being named [...] "peapod" [...] or [...] "lobster-claw" [...] structure. This allowed a large internal space unobstructed by ribs, hence capable of housing large fuel tanks (similar to Wallis's geodetic designs).|$|E
2500|$|As {{the speed}} {{increases}}, {{the zone of}} M > 1 flow increases towards both <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges.</b> As M = 1 is reached and passed, the normal shock reaches the trailing edge and becomes a weak oblique shock: the flow decelerates over the shock, but remains supersonic. A normal shock is created ahead of the object, and the only subsonic zone in the flow field is a small area around the object's leading edge. (Fig.1b) ...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results of}} flow over a generic &# 039;open&# 039; {{rectangular}} cavity having lengths of 200 and 250 mm and a depth and width of 50 mm at Mach numbers ranging between 0. 3 to 1. 3 {{was reported in}} Part 1 [1]. In this paper, Part 2, the effect of yawing these rectangular cavities is investigated, {{as well as how}} the yawing resonant behaviour changes when the shorter cavity is transformed to a range of parallelograms by changing the <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> angles while keeping the length to depth and width ratios fixed. The results show that small <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> angles changes of up to 15 degrees have a small influence on resonance behaviour and for the two largest angles, 30 degrees and 45 degrees, the magnitude of resonances are suppressed at a zero yaw...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{results by}} the authors have derived constructions of Lie {{algebraic}} partial feedback linearizing control methods for pitch and plunge primary control utilizing a single <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> actuator. In addition, a globally stable nonlinear adaptive control method was derived for a structurally nonlinear wing section with both a <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> actuator. However, the global stability result described in a previous paper {{by the authors}}, while highly desirable, relied {{on the fact that}} the <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> actuators rendered the system exactly feedback linearizable via Lie algebraic methods. In this paper, the authors derive an adaptive, nonlinear feedback control methodology for a structurally nonlinear typical wing section.

2500|$|The E-4 {{included}} numerous innovations, {{including its}} all-metal monocoque construction, onboard facilities such as lavatory, kitchen and radio communications, {{as well as}} its notable and sturdy monoplane load-bearing box-girder wing constructed of dural metal which formed both the wing's main girder and the structure of the wing itself. [...] Skinned with thin sheets of dural metal to give the aerofoil shape necessary for a wing, the girder section wing had fabric covered <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> attached to it. This superb and innovative wing was robust and self-supporting.|$|E
2500|$|The wing was of NACA 23018 {{section at}} the root, {{and was a}} five-piece, all-metal, {{twin-spar}} structure. The untapered centre section carried the inboard engines and main undercarriage, while {{the inner and outer}} sections were tapered on their <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges,</b> with the inner sections carrying the outboard engines. The ailerons were fitted with trim and balance tabs, and there were hydraulically operated split flaps in three sections {{on each side of the}} trailing edges of the centre section and inner wings. A [...] fuel capacity was given by eight bag tanks, one on either side of the fuselage in the centre section and three in both inner wings.|$|E
2500|$|The M.15 was {{powered by}} a 200hp (149kW) Gipsy Six 6-cylinder engine, much more {{powerful}} than the Magister's 130hp (97kW) Gipsy Major. Partly as a result, the M.15 was about 4ft 10 in (1.4 m) longer than the Magister. The vertical stabiliser had straight <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges,</b> giving it a triangular look compared with the rather pointed Magister surface. Both elevators and the horn-balanced rudder carried trim tabs. [...] The wingspan of the M.15 was slightly less than that of the Magister, but the planform was more curved along the trailing edge and the total wing area greater. Both types carried mild dihedral outboard of the centre section. A small fairing behind the rear cockpit was another new feature of the M.15.|$|E

2500|$|During 1943, {{a single}} Miles M.3B Falcon Six light aircraft, {{which had been}} {{previously}} used for wing tests by the RAE, was provided to Miles for purpose of performing low-speed flight testing work on the project. A full size wooden model of the M.52 wing, test instrumentation, and a different undercarriage were fitted to this aircraft. Owing to the wing's thinness and sharp <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> somewhat resembling a razor blade, the aircraft was nicknamed the [...] "Gillette Falcon". On 11 August 1944, this low-speed demonstrator performed its maiden flight.

2500|$|By 8 September, {{the first}} of {{thirteen}} complete JB-2s, reverse engineered from the material received at Wright Field in July was assembled at Republic Aviation. [...] The United States JB-2 {{was different from the}} German V-1 in only the smallest of dimensions. [...] The wing span was only 2½inches wider and the length was extended less than [...] [...] The difference gave the JB-2 60.7 square feet of wing area versus 55 for the V-1. One of the few visible differences between the JB-2 and the V-1 was the shape of the forward pulsejet support pylon — the original V-1 had its support pylon slightly swept back at nearly the same angle on both its <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges,</b> while the JB-2's pylon had a vertical leading edge and sharply swept-forward trailing edge. A similar, completely coincidental re-shaping, but with a much broader chord, was used for the same airframe component of the manned Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg, original V-1 ordnance development.|$|E
2500|$|The Whitley {{featured}} a large rectangular-shaped wing; its appearance {{led to the}} aircraft receiving the nickname [...] "the flying barn door". Like the fuselage, the wings were formed from three sections, being built up around a single box spar with the <b>leading</b> <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>edges</b> being fixed onto the spar at each rib point. The surfaces of the wings were mainly composed of flush-riveted smooth metal sheeting, which did not {{make use of the}} stress-skin approach, while the trailing edge and ailerons had a fabric covering. The split trailing edge flaps were composed of duralumin and ran between the ailerons and the fuselage, being set at a 15-20 degree position for taking off and at a 60 degree position during landing. The tail planes employed a similar construction to that of the wings, the fins being braced to the fuselage using metal struts.
