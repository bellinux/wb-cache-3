40|$|The {{means of}} {{information}} streams controlling in multiservice communication networks are investigated. The commutation center operating {{based on the}} developed method of information streams distribution between output channels is improved. This increases the transmitting efficiency of combined information streams in the commutation center on the boundary of both mobile operator network and <b>leased</b> <b>network</b> with packet commutation. Therefore {{the support of the}} required transmitting quality is ensured for video and Internet traffics. The weighting round service method of subscriber requests queues is improved. This allows effective analyzing of the unforeseen loading peaks which are typical for the self-similar traffic. Using the results obtained allows {{to solve the problem of}} multiservice traffic processing comprehensively taking into account the type of traffic and loading of output channels as well as it allows to decrease packets loss...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Due to its portability, reliability, flexibility, {{real time}} and {{rich set of}} QoS support, Data Distribution Service (DDs) {{middleware}} {{became one of the}} best solutions for real time distributed manufacturing systems. Most of these systems are composed of heterogeneous networked devices where network bandwidth represents a very important resource. Those devices include limited-resources devices, such as sensors, actuators and controllers. Thus, controlling such resource will significantly enhance the overall performance of the network in terms of resource utilization, delay, and throughput; moreover, it reduces the cost of using <b>leased</b> <b>network</b> bandwidth by limiting the amount of bandwidth as much as needed. In this paper we propose a solution for controlling the limited-bandwidth networked manufacturing systems by using DDS; and we describe the DDS QoS polices that support manufacturing systems to control network bandwidth. Furthermore, we evaluate DDS middleware performance over Bluetooth channel by measuring latency, throughput and jitter; and examining different QoS parameters to show their effect on improving the existing limited-bandwidth networks...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{several new}} mobile virtual network {{operators}} (MVNOs) {{have entered the}} European mobile telecommunications markets. These service providers do not own a mobile network, but instead they buy capacity from other companies. Because these virtual operators do not possess an infrastructure of their own, they have signed contracts with incumbent mobile operators with a network. The growth of these MVNOs which use <b>leased</b> <b>network</b> capacity from existing carriers, presents the incumbent mobile operators with a strategic dilemma. Network-based mobile operators have almost full control over their infrastructure {{but they may not}} know their customers well enough to fill the demand for cheaper and/or innovative services. New service-based operators may create affinity with the customer and introduce quickly all kinds of innovations and/or price discounts, but they still have to negotiate access terms and conditions with one of the domestic network-based operators. It has become important, and in some countries even urgent, to introduce regulatory measures concerning non-discriminatory access to the mobile telecommunications sector. This paper looks furthermore deeper into the entry and innovation strategies by MVNOs on the mobile market in the Netherlands, and its impact on competition.

30|$|Recently, {{interest}} for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) to provide applications with stringent delay constraints has increased [1 – 5]. Nonetheless, providing {{this type of}} services is challenging due to the unpredictable nature of channel availability [3]. Several mechanisms have been proposed to reduce service interruption and/or to provide quality of service (QoS) provisioning in CRNs [3, 4, 6]. Among the most relevant of these mechanisms are spectrum handoff, call buffering, preemptive priority, channel reservation, spectrum adaptation, and spectrum leasing [4, 7 – 9]. Several research {{studies have shown that}} enabling leasing mechanisms allows to achieve a better QoS related to the secondary users (SUs) in coordinated cognitive radio networks (CCRNs) [9 – 19]. A CCRN is formed by primary, secondary, and leasing sub-networks [5]. In the literature, the primary and <b>leasing</b> <b>networks</b> are fused in the same network [9]. The spectrum leasing mechanism means that the leasing sub-network rents to the secondary network part of its spectrum in exchange of some incentive (e.g., monetary rewards as leasing payments) [11]. The leased spectrum band could be purchased, or it could be leased as requested by the administrator of the secondary network. Under dynamic spectrum leasing regime, whenever the secondary network needs to rent more resources, it sends a request to the <b>leasing</b> <b>network.</b> The <b>leasing</b> <b>network</b> accepts or rejects such requests according to the availability of the resources in its network. To reduce the economic cost of renting resources through spectrum leasing, channels should be rented only when needed and should be released as soon as they are no longer needed. However, thanks to the random nature of channel occupancy, the resources to be leased cannot be guaranteed. To avoid this problem, in this paper, an anticipated leasing mechanism is proposed to increase the probability to find available channels to lease when needed.|$|R

40|$|Facility-based {{competition}} (FBC) in {{the telecommunications}} market {{is considered to}} have lower static efficiency {{in the short term}} and higher dynamic efficiency in the long term. Under service-based competition (SBC), the entrant can reduce its setup costs by <b>leasing</b> <b>network</b> facilities from the incumbent, which makes the entrant viable, pushes the market price down and promotes static efficiency. This paper attempts to measure static efficiency by comparing the profits of the incumbent and entrant in terms of consumer surplus and social welfare under each competition type by extending the Stackelberg model. The results, assuming a linear demand function and variation in regulatory level, show that FBC results in higher social welfare than SBC on the whole. However, SBC accompanied by strong regulation is also shown to have the potential to be superior over FBC. It is also revealed that FBC exhibits a higher producer surplus (particularly, the incumbent’s producer surplus) and is, therefore, more desirable in terms of dynamic efficiency. When the entrant’s cost is high in FBC, social welfare is shown to be lowered, implying that cost competitiveness is a necessary condition for social welfare...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{model and}} solve profit {{maximization}} {{problem of a}} telecommunications Bandwidth Broker (BB) under uncertain market and network infrastructure conditions. The BB may <b>lease</b> <b>network</b> capacity from a set of Backbone Providers (BPs) or from other BBs {{in order to gain}} profit by selling already purchased capacity to end-users. However, BB’s problem becomes harder to deal with when bandwidth requests of end-users, profit and cost margins are not known in advance. The fuzzy set theory and stochastic programming techniques are employed in this article due to the presence of vagueness and randomness in mentioned parameters. In addition, this study not only considers uncertainties in market but also takes into account uncertainties arising because of infrastructure conditions of networks. Therefore not only cost but also Quality of Service (QoS) offered by BPs has to be investigated by BB before acquisition of capacity. The proposed novel model is formulated {{in such a way that}} it simultaneously considers the randomness in demands and prices then selects BPs and determines the allocation scheme of end-users’ bandwidth requests into purchased capacity. Finally, the efficiency and superiority of methodology compared to deterministic approach are demonstrated by running several randomly generated test instances...|$|R
