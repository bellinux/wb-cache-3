5|$|Ward helps Quatermass and Fowler gain {{entry to}} the plant and they find that Dillon has been {{discharged}} from the infirmary and has left. They then <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> discover that gases are pumped to the giant pressure domes from the pilot plant: ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen and methane, as opposed to oxygen as in Quatermass' moonbase pressure dome idea. Meanwhile, the guards intimidate and then murder a family who were having a picnic nearby. Back at the plant, Ward slips away to look inside a dome, and Quatermass and Fowler find him stumbling out of it dying and covered in black slime, which before his death Ward reveals was inside the dome instead of food. Fowler and Quatermass escape back to the Rocket Group and analyse Ward's tie with Leo and Paula, finding that the slime is a corrosive, poisonous substance, fatal to all forms of life on Earth. Meanwhile, the asteroid is approaching its near point.|$|E

If I can, I want to be a one-club player too. Playing footy is not just about 80 minutes out on the field every week. For me it is a career and I want to be happy where I am, satisfied that my game is progressing and that I am learning all the time to be a better player." ...|$|E
500|$|As an {{improvement}} over the prerendered technology present in Myst, Riven, and Exile, Revelation uses its [...] "ALIVE" [...] engine to animate nearly everything in the game. The water animations, for example, are fully rendered for each location. The trees sway in the breeze, and the sky has moving clouds. Wildlife includes creatures that walk through the environment and occasionally interact with the player. The game also features a number of effects applied in real time, such as lens flares, dynamic lighting, and an optional focal blur. In a trend started by the original Myst, the game uses live actors to play the game's roles in live-action video sequences. There are more than 70 minutes of video, and the game allows players to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> interact with the video while it is playing.|$|E

The singer professes his love: [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> everything I see is beautiful, because all I see is you." [...] According to The Huffington Posts Dean, Timberlake is in happier state of mind than on his 2002 song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] or his 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". However, his lyrics have an obsessive quality: [...] "A million people in a crowded room, but my camera lens is only set to zoom and it all becomes so clear." [...] Mellisa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that on [...] "Tunnel Vision", Timberlake is lyrically [...] "playing the rom-com director": [...] "Just like a movie shoot, I’m zoomin’ in on you as we ride off into the sun." [...] According to Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times, Timberlake uses references to [...] "cameras and reflective surfaces" [...] {{to reflect on the}} [...] "changing nature of celebrity".|$|E

500|$|The Martian was {{directed}} by Scott and based on a screenplay by Drew Goddard that was adapted from Weir's 2011 novel of same name. 20th Century Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, and producer Simon Kinberg was attached to develop the novel into a film. The following May, Goddard entered negotiations with the studio to write and direct The Martian. Goddard wrote a screenplay for the film, and Matt Damon expressed interest in starring under Goddard's direction. Goddard then pursued an opportunity to direct Sinister Six, a comic book film about a team of supervillains. Kinberg then brought the book to Scott's attention. In May 2014, Scott entered negotiations with the studio to direct the film with Damon cast as the film's stranded astronaut. Scott said he was attracted by the emphasis on science and thought a balance could be struck between entertainment and learning. Damon said he was attracted by the novel, the screenplay {{and the opportunity to}} work with Scott. Following Scott's commitment, the project picked up the pace and was quickly approved. Goddard has since expressed that he felt Scott made a much better film than he could have directed, telling Creative Screenwriting, [...] "When it's Scott, collaboration is easy because I just revere him. Every day I would just <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> think, 'Is that really Ridley Scott sitting there at the table? This is exciting! ...|$|E
500|$|No. 80 Wing {{had begun}} {{transferring}} to the Dutch East Indies in December 1944, {{and the main}} body followed in January 1945. Gibbes' injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on Morotai, where it came {{under the control of}} the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), until 9March. Once there, he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to Manila. In April, Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots, including Caldwell and fellow aces Wilf Arthur and John Waddy, who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground-attack missions. The incident became known as the [...] "Morotai Mutiny". Gibbes later declared that [...] "...after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> seen the futility of the operations which had been given, I could not see any point in carrying on. I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service." [...] As a former jackaroo, he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle: [...] "I felt horrible about it, being an ex bushy...at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn't have to turn butcher. And Heavens, it was butchering too, in every sense of the word. No—not the Japs. Cattle...If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives, starvation will be our main weapon...God, I hated doing it but could do nothing else. Felt as sick as hell." [...] No action was taken against the [...] "mutineers" [...] for their attempted resignations; a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified. In the meantime, Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai. Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant; the Air Officer Commanding No.1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, himself shortly to be dismissed over the [...] "mutiny", restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective [...] 23April.|$|E
2500|$|The first novelty stores, which {{carried a}} wide variety of goods, {{appeared}} in the late 1840s. They had larger, glass windows, made possible by the new use of cast iron in architecture.

These shops were relatively small, and catered only to a single area, since it was difficult for Parisians to get easily across the city through the narrow streets.|$|E

[...] Canadian actor Tom McCamus originally auditioned for the part of Old Nick before being cast as Leo.

At the age of 19, while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, Ellison converted from Catholicism to Islam, later giving the following explanation: [...] "I can't claim that I was the most observant Catholic at the time [...] I had begun to really <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> ask myself about the social circumstances of the country, issues of justice, issues of change. When I looked at my spiritual life, and I looked at what might inform social change, justice in society... I found Islam." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{historical}} Algonquin society was largely hunting- and fishing-based, some Algonquin practiced agriculture and cultivated corn, beans and squash, the famous [...] "Three Sisters" [...] of indigenous horticulture. Being primarily a hunting nation, the people emphasized mobility. [...] They used materials that were light [...] {{and easy to}} transport. Canoes were made of birch bark, sewed with spruce roots and rendered waterproof by the application of heated spruce resin and bear grease. [...] During winter, toboggans were used to transport material, and people used snowshoes to get around. [...] The women used tikinaagan (cradleboards) to carry their babies. [...] It was built with wood and covered with an envelope made of leather or material. The baby was standing up with his feet resting on a small board. The mother would then put the tikinàgan on her back. This allowed the infant to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> observe his surroundings. [...] The child was kept close to the mother but also had much stimulation.|$|E
2500|$|Louis Armstrong thought {{enough of}} Miller {{to carry around}} his recordings, {{transferred}} to seven-inch tape reels when he went on tour. [...] " [...] liked musicians who prized melody, and his selections ranged from Glenn Miller to Jelly Roll Morton to Tchaikovsky." [...] Jazz pianist George Shearing's quintet of the 1950s and 1960s was influenced by Miller: [...] "with Shearing's locked hands style piano (influenced by the voicing of Miller's saxophone section) in the middle [...] ". Frank Sinatra and Mel Tormé held the orchestra in high regard. Tormé credited Miller with giving him helpful advice when he first started his singing and song-writing career in the 1940s. Mel Tormé met Glenn Miller in 1942, the meeting facilitated by Tormé's father and Ben Pollack. Tormé and Miller discussed [...] "That Old Black Magic", which was just emerging as a new song by Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen. Miller told Tormé to pick up every song by Mercer and study it and to become a voracious reader of anything he could find, because [...] "all good lyric writers are great readers." [...] In an interview with George T. Simon in 1948, Sinatra lamented the inferior quality of music he was recording in the late forties, in comparison with [...] "those great Glenn Miller things" [...] from eight years earlier. Frank Sinatra's recording sessions from the late forties and early fifties use some Miller musicians. Trigger Alpert, a bassist from the civilian band, Zeke Zarchy for the Army Air Forces Band and Willie Schwartz, the lead clarinetist from the civilian band back up Frank Sinatra on many recordings. With opposite opinion, fellow bandleader Artie Shaw frequently disparaged the band after Miller's death: [...] "All I {{can say is that}} Glenn should have lived, and 'Chattanooga Choo Choo' should have died." [...] Clarinetist Buddy DeFranco surprised many people when he led the Glenn Miller Orchestra in the late sixties and early seventies. De Franco was already a veteran of bands like Gene Krupa and Tommy Dorsey in the 1940s. He was also a major exponent of modern jazz in the 1950s. He never saw Miller as leading a swinging jazz band, but DeFranco is extremely fond of certain aspects of the Glenn Miller style. [...] "I found that when I opened with the sound of 'Moonlight Serenade', I could <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> see men and women weeping as the music carried them back to years gone by." [...] De Franco says, [...] "the beauty of Glenn Miller's ballads [...] caused people to dance together." ...|$|E
