5|$|Unlike the Big Three {{television}} networks, the <b>local</b> <b>stations</b> in the NTA Film Network {{were not}} connected via coaxial cable or microwave relay. Instead, NTA Film Network programs were filmed and then mailed to each {{station in the}} network, a method used by television syndicators in the 1950s and 1960s. However, many <b>local</b> <b>stations</b> agreed to broadcast NTA Film Network programs in pattern (simultaneously). Landau's claim to network status {{was based on the}} simultaneous airing of the programs.|$|E
5|$|Aside from NBC, The Office {{has gone}} into off-network {{syndication}} in the United States. It has reruns on <b>local</b> <b>stations</b> and TBS.

5|$|In 2001, Millionaire {{producers}} {{began work}} on a half-hour daily syndicated version of the show, with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production. ABC's cancellation of the network Millionaire ended that idea; however, the syndicated Millionaire still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to <b>local</b> <b>stations</b> for the 2002–03 season. The syndicated series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor, however, {{due in part to}} worries that stemmed from a decision made by one of its affiliates.|$|E

5|$|The 1970s and 1980s saw {{a wave of}} landbased pirate radio, {{broadcasting}} {{mostly in}} big cities. These included community-focused <b>local</b> <b>stations</b> such as Sunshine Radio in Shropshire and Radio Jackie in south west London. In London pirate stations emerged that, {{for the first time}} in UK radio broadcasting, focused on particular music genres such as Radio Invicta (92.4 FM) Europe's first soul station, started in 1970. Kiss FM (dance), Solar Radio (soul), Raiders FM, Radio Amanda and Radio Floss (rock) and Dread Broadcasting Corporation (reggae).|$|E

5|$|Based on the study, Governor William O'Neill ordered ConnDOT in October 1986 to {{initiate}} rail {{service on the}} corridor. It was established as a temporary service to newly reopened <b>local</b> <b>stations</b> between Union Station in New Haven and Old Saybrook, to alleviate traffic congestion that arose from scheduled construction work on I-95. O'Neill introduced a $50 million transportation program that included $900,000 (later reduced to $500,000) for basic stations and $4 million to refurbish 12 Budd Rail Diesel Cars for rolling stock. The RDCs {{were found to be}} insufficient and two diesel trainsets were purchased from the defunct PATrain service in 1989 instead. Testing of the equipment on the Northeast Corridor began on December 2, 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} of a similar design to other local power {{stations}} at Carville and Lemington, and was a large triple-gabled brick building. However Dunston A was built several years after the other <b>local</b> <b>stations,</b> and so because of advances in power station design, was larger {{and was able to}} produce more electricity than the others. The station was originally equipped with two turbo-alternators rated at 7.2megawatts (MW), made by AEG of Germany, and two turbo alternators rated at 6.25MW and 13.2MW, made by Brown Boveri of Switzerland, for a total generating capacity of 33.85MW. The turbo alternators were supplied with steam from 24coal burning Babcock & Wilcox marine water-tube boilers.|$|E
5|$|On November 26, 1967, the Chrystie Street Connection {{opened and}} D trains were rerouted via the Manhattan Bridge and the BMT Brighton Line to Coney Island. F trains were {{extended}} once again via the Culver Line. From June 1968 to 1987, the Culver Line featured express service during rush hours. F trains ran express {{in both directions}} between Bergen Street and Church Avenue, while G trains were extended from Smith–Ninth Streets to Church Avenue to provide local service. Express service on the elevated portion of the line to Kings Highway operated in the peak direction (to Manhattan AM; to Brooklyn PM), with some F trains running local and some running express. Express service between Bergen and Church ended in 1976, and between Church and Kings Highway in 1987, largely due to budget constraints and complaints from passengers at <b>local</b> <b>stations.</b> Express service on the elevated Culver Line was ended due to necessary structural work, but never restored. With the end of express service, Bergen Street's lower level {{was taken out of}} service. Following renovations to the station in the 1990s, the lower level was converted into storage space and is not usable for passenger service in its current state.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, some rush-hour peak-direction F trains started {{skipping}} local stops between Jay Street and Fourth Avenue, and the MTA {{is planning}} to use expanded rush-hour express service (from Jay Street to Church Avenue) in both directions in the summers of 2016 and 2017. In May 2016, the MTA announced that half of all rush-hour F trains may start running express in both directions in fall 2017; however, because of rolling stock and track capacity limitations, the train frequency {{on the rest of}} the F route would remain the same. However, with the introduction of the R179s, one more train per hour could be run on the F. The operation of half of the F trains as express would result in operational improvements, with faster service, as southbound F trains would no longer be delayed by terminating G trains discharging at Church Avenue. Overall, the F express will result in an overall reduction of 27,000 minutes during the AM rush hour and 13,000 minutes during the PM rush hour. The change in service will decrease service at <b>local</b> <b>stations,</b> reducing in longer wait times, but it will help riders in South Brooklyn with the longest commutes. F express trains would be slightly more crowded than current F trains, but the F locals would be less crowded. PM rush hour express service would lead to much larger exit surges from less frequent F local trains at Bergen Street and Carroll Street, leading to significant congestion at one staircase at Bergen Street, and moderate congestion at one staircase at Carroll St. Relieving the congestion, would entail widening the staircases and installing ADA-required elevators that would cost approximately $10 million per station.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} major networks, some media {{conglomerates}} also run second-tier television systems (e.g., Rogers Media's Omni Television and Bell Media's CTV Two). These systems share the same parent companies as most of their <b>local</b> <b>stations,</b> and such stations can be considered O as well. For example, all of CTV Two's <b>local</b> <b>stations</b> are owned by Bell Media. On the other hand, Canwest's E! added a few private affiliates not owned by Canwest in Western Canada prior to its demise in 2009; those affiliates have since joined Rogers' City network.|$|E
