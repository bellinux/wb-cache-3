40|$|The paper empirically {{analyses}} {{the impact}} on individual municipalities of replacing the German local business tax by a <b>local</b> <b>surcharge</b> on income and corporation tax. The microsimulation models used for this and refined for the present paper originate in calculations carried out for the Federal Ministry of Finance in cooperation between the Federal Statistical Office and the Humboldt University in Berlin. The data basis is formed by the roughly 30 million individual data sets of the most up-to-date income and local business tax statistics provided by the Federal Statistical Office. A <b>local</b> <b>surcharge</b> tax which, like the BDI/VCI model analysed, assigns tax revenue incurred on profits to the municipality of permanent establishment and that on other income to the domicile municipality, affects the revenue situtation of the municipalities in highly differing ways. The losers in such a local tax reform include those municipalities in which an above-average number of industrial and commercial enterprises are resident. These are the "core towns" of the Old Federal Laender in particular. By contrast, the revenue situtation of the surrounding municipalities and of the municipalities with a rural character would considerably improve on average. However, the core towns in the New Federal Laender which are currently tax-weak because they have little industry would also improve their revenue situation in most cases by applying a sucharge tax. In {{order to maintain the}} financial status quo, the core towns in the Old Federal Laender in particular would have to levy relatively high local tax rates, whilst the surrounding municipalities would be able to become more attractive by applying tax rates which as a rule would be much lower. The consequence of this would be that high-income earners in the core towns would have a not inconsiderable incentive to change their place to residence for tax purposes, which would further worsen the financial situation of the core towns.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pertinent}} reform discussions in Germany {{is found in the}} debate on the local business tax. During the last year, two basic reform proposals, a ‚revitalisation‘ of the current local business tax and its replacement by a surcharge on personal and corporate income taxes, intensively competed. Finally, none of these alternatives was realised. The federal parliament and government could only agree to introduce temporary financial relieves for local jurisdictions. In this paper, the continuous need for a fundamental reform of local government finances is emphasised. After a discussion of the basic alternative reform models against the background of characteristics of economically reasonable local government finances, the simulated impact of a <b>local</b> <b>surcharge</b> on income taxes is compared to the tax rate differences at the local level in Switzerland. The surcharge model would lead to smaller tax rate differentials than currently exist at the Swiss local level. The resistance against such a reform is {{explained by the fact that}} political actors at the local level oppose the implied higher political responsibility when citizens face local income tax rates as prices for local public services. ...|$|E

In 1953, following changes to and {{the abolition of the}} organs of the Greater Administrative Regions, the state budgetary system changed to a three-tier system involving the center, provinces, municipalities, and counties.

40|$|Belgium is {{a federal}} state where {{regional}} fiscal competences have been increasing. In particular, the regions {{are now able to}} increase or to lower the personal income tax burden of their residents via positive and negative surcharges. Should the regions adopt the possibilities opened by the Law, would it influence interregional mobility? It is not possible to assert directly this question. However, indirect evidence of the impact of fiscal disparities on mobility can be found by analysing the mobility between municipalities. Indeed, for long, the real estate income tax and the <b>local</b> <b>surcharges</b> on the federal personal income tax have not been uniform on the Belgian territory. We tried to quantify whether those tax differences generated population moves from the more expensive municipalities to the less expensive ones. The attractiveness of the municipalities measured by means of their intra Belgium migration balance has been explained by local wealth, employment rate, quality of the local administration, proximity to the coast, three indexes constructed by a factor analysis based on a satisfaction survey, housing prices and local taxation. Our estimations showed that local tax level has no significant impact on the local migration balance. Is this observation transposable at the regional level? On one side, {{the answer to this question}} depends on the level of disparities in tax rates that such a practice would introduce. On the other side, if disparities in regional tax were to appear, interregional mobility would be slowed down by the impact of the interregional cultural differences. ...|$|R

These differences go away, however, if we focus only on respondents who perceived their survey vote to be consequential. Negative hypothetical bias among inconsequential survey respondents is also evident in the estimation of willingness to pay, and controlling for consequentiality increases construct validity. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of coastal resources in South Africa {{has come under}} review {{as a result of}} the degradation of environmental resources along the coast. The challenge being faced by resource managers is to achieve economic growth while sustaining South Africa’s coastal resource base (Nobel, 2000). The South African government (RSA, 2000) has developed a coastal management strategy to meet this challenge: The strategy involves the inclusion of all stakeholders in the formation of policy regarding the {{management of}} coastal resources, in a more integrated approach to coastal management. To effectively achieve this stakeholder inclusion, it has become necessary to decentralize the political, administrative and fiscal authority to conduct coastal management functions. With regard to the need for fiscal decentralisation this thesis considers the possibility of implementing localised environmental surcharges to finance coastal management initiatives. The ability of the White Paper for Sustainable Coastal Development (RSA, 2000) to provide theformal institutional structure necessary for the introduction of environmental surcharges is firstconsidered. It is shown that the decentralised management strategy has the potential to create a management style that is transparent and accountability orientated. In addition to this the style is capable of adapting to dynamic local coastal conditions and is therefore an appropriate direction in which to steer coastal management in South Africa. The effectiveness of coastal co-management as an informal institutional arrangement is then examined. Provided that local Coastal Management Fora are created to include all relevant stakeholders and that a source of long term financing is secured co-management has the potential to create the conditions necessary for effective coastal management. With regard to a source of long term financing, <b>local</b> environmental <b>surcharges</b> to finance coastal management initiatives are considered. The public’s willingness to contribute to such a surcharge is analysed in the context of Plettenberg Bay by probing their willingness to pay (WTP) for a Bay Management Plan. A survey instrument is developed to measure the public’s WTP. The design of the instrument is based on the Contingent Valuation (CV) method that is used to analyse the nonmarket benefits that environmental resources (such as Plettenberg Bay) provide the public. It is found that the resident population is willing to pay R 15 per month toward a Bay Management Plan whilst domestic and foreign tourists respectively are willing to pay R 6 and R 22 daily. The aggregation of these WTP estimates yields a total passive use value of between R 15 397 900 – R 20330 500 annually. This nuclear value of the Bay should be included in the formation of local coastal management policy and provides guidance for the introduction of a <b>local</b> environmental <b>surcharge.</b> A budget for a Bay Management Plan is proposed and a progressive surcharge based on municipal property value is set. To finance the local residents’ share of the budget, a monthly surcharge of R 1 would be required of the average valued property. To calculate the domestic and foreign tourist contribution to the budget a schedule of accommodation offering property will be required. However, to finance the entire budget a residential surcharge of approximately R 10 would be required of the average valued property. This figure is well below the average resident population WTP of R 15, highlighting the fact that an environmental surcharge in Plettenberg Bay is indeed feasible. The difference in reported WTP and the contribution required to finance the Bay Management Plan also highlights that there is scope for experimentation in the introduction of such a surcharge. ...|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{intervened in}} Cuba in 1898. One of the {{interesting}} and rare series of stamps occurred as a result. This was the provisional issues known as [...] "Puerto Príncipe" [...] (now Camagüey) named after the town where they were printed. [...] The supplies of stamps in the town included stamps imprinted with the likeness of Alfonso XIII of Spain, but the United States in December, 1898, was now in control. A peace protocol had been entered into between U.S. and Spain on August 12, 1898, and the Treaty of Paris of December 10, 1898, ceded control to the United States. On December 19, 1898 the U.S. supplied stamps were still a month away from delivery. The local authorities solved that problem by obtaining permission from the provisional U.S. military government to contract a <b>local</b> printer to <b>surcharge</b> existing supplies of Spanish Cuban stamps with a surcharge of initially four different denominations. Eventually {{a total of five}} different printings were made that resulted in a total of five different denominations. These surcharged issues are scarce. As a result, forgeries are numerous. A Puerto Príncipe stamp should be authenticated to have maximum value to a collector. By using vertical verification lines, one can get a good idea of whether on not a surcharge is original or forged.|$|R
5000|$|Property in California, when sold, is {{assessed}} at 100% of full cash value. Under Proposition 13, {{the maximum}} amount of tax on real estate in California is limited to 1.0% plus <b>local</b> voter approved <b>surcharges</b> for [...] "extras". Revenue from these [...] "extra" [...] taxes are used primarily to repay general obligation bonds issued for local infrastructure projects such as school district surcharges for rehabilitation of school facilities or building new buildings. These extras may also include: water districts, sidewalk maintenance, flood control, street lighting, etc.. The state also has statewide property taxes collected and used by the state on privately owned railroad cars and timber. The statewide average property tax is about 1.26% of assessed value but can range from about 1.03% to nearly 2.0% in some cities and counties. Proposition 13 limits property tax assessment increases to 2.0% of previously assessed value or the inflation rate over the previous year, whichever is lower. Because property prices have increased in California faster than 2.0%, on average, older properties are taxed at lower [...] "effective" [...] rates then newly sold properties. This feature was part in the Proposition 13 language to encourage people to stay put in their residences longer—they do. Property taxes were allocated as follows: counties 17%, cities 10%, schools (school districts and community colleges) 54%, and special districts 19%. In 2013 the state legislature abolished special districts. Intangible personal property, personal effects, business inventory property held for resale are exempt from property taxes. A principal residence qualifies for a $7,000 homestead reduction in the taxable value of their property. Property owned by governments, non-profit hospitals, religious institutions, and charitable organizations—are exempt from the 1.0% property tax rate.|$|R
40|$|Future-proof {{design of}} quay walls is an {{interesting}} issue in civil Engineering, because of the dynamic environment in which quay walls are operating. Designers are confronted with time-changing requirements such as larger retaining heights and heavier loads. However, a technical and financial analysis has revealed that the design of new quay structures can, under certain conditions, be made future-proof by standardization. By standardizing the design, this may achieve {{a certain degree of}} flexibility. This means that a quay wall can be converted for multiple types of vessels or multiple types of cargo and therefore becomes future-proof. Various standard principle solutions are applicable. However, {{it should be noted that}} the exact dimensions of quay wall components, for instance the substructure (the front wall) and the superstructure (the capping beam or relieving platform), can in principle not be standardized. The dimensions depend namely on major factors such as <b>local</b> geotechnical conditions, <b>surcharges,</b> retaining height and the presence of a relieving platform. Nevertheless, standardization is possible in two ways. Firstly, by driving the front wall to a deeper layer than it is necessary in the first instance and dredging the front side of the quay wall at a later stage. This can be done by constructing all quay walls at equal depth, by area. This is a decision based on the local depth of the navigation channels and the expected business activity in the different areas. Secondly, by making a strategic choice for a particular quay component or a particular port area. Both ways lead to higher initial investment costs but results in a quay wall which is significantly more future-proof. From a technical and financial assessment it can be concluded that when heavy loads and large retaining heights are involved, a combined steel quay wall with a concrete relieving platform (often used by deep-seagoing vessels) is suitable and for inland barges an anchored combined wall should be applied. In case of a relieving platform, the floor should be located at NAP- 2 m with a length of 15 m. Quay walls used by inland barges should consist of a capping beam and a combined wall. This rather conventional cross-sections are the most economical ones. Hydraulic StructuresHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
5000|$|Around 1900 {{a request}} {{was made for}} the Isar valley Railway to be {{extended}} to Innsbruck and {{for it to be}} nationalised. The Royal Bavarian State Railways carried out the initial planning in 1904 and determined an approximate route. In addition, the configuration work began on a curve connecting the line to the state railway in Pullach. On 1 January 1908, the plan for an extension to Innsbruck was abandoned because it had been decided to extend the line from Munich to Garmisch-Partenkirchen to Innsbruck as the Mittenwald Railway. The population, however, was still not satisfied. The high ticket prices charged by the LAG as a condition of the extension to Bichl could be avoided with nationalisation. A trip on the 50.5 km Isar Valley Railway in first class with a 20% <b>local</b> railway <b>surcharge</b> cost 5.30 gold marks (RM), while the 66.5 km route via Tutzing cost only RM 5.10. For travelling in second class the LAG charged 3.40 RM, while on the State Railway via Tutzing 3.30 RM was required. In class IIIa it cost RM 2.20 on both routes and in class IIIb it cost 1.40 RM. For hikers, there was a so-called round-trip ticket. It cost 0.50 RM and included a tram ride from any stop in Munich to Grünwald, the reduction of the toll on the Großhesselohe bridge from 0.10 RM to 0.05 RM, the return from Höllriegelskreuth to Isartalbahnhof with the Isar Valley Railway and a return trip to any Munich tram stop. The LAG struggled initially in its negotiations with the state. From 1911, they were not taken over because of the strong opposition of the population. After the outbreak of the First World War, plans for nationalisation were rejected. Freight traffic remained relatively constant in the coming years; in 1910 the number of wagon loads was around 10,500. They usually carried wood or other agricultural products. [...] During World War I, the number of passengers carried fell again. From August to September 1914 the LAG had to borrow 100 carriages for the transport of soldiers for the state. In 1915 another 65 cars were acquired. On 16 January 1915, the LAG abolished first class on its trains. In the following years, the LAG made ever more losses on the Isar Valley Railway. Information about the performance of the line during the war years is limited because the LAG had to save the cost of paper. After the war, the carriages were in a very bad state because they were no longer waterproof. This also affected ridership. The Isar Valley Railway carried 2.3 million passengers in 1923. In 1926, passenger numbers dropped to 1.8 million people annually. Second class was operated in 1926 only on trains to Bichl. Parallel to the Isar Valley Railway, the German Post Office operated a post bus (Kraftpost, buses that also carried mail) service in 1929. In 1931, the number of trains was reduced. Passenger numbers fell further to 1.4 million passengers annually. In the LAG’s annual report for 1932, the LAG wondered whether the operation on the Isar Valley Railway could continue because the line always recorded major losses. The State had rejected nationalisation. It was possible that the LAG would {{no longer be able to}} continue operations and that the Isar Valley Railway would have to be shut down. From 1 December 1932, only four pairs of trains ran daily between Munich and Wolfratshausen. In 1932, the loss was 375,816 Reichsmarks. In 1933, the requirement to seek higher fares was abolished by the State Railway due to the poor financial condition of the LAG. The municipalities along the Isar Valley Railway undertook to pay about 20,000 Reichsmarks for the maintenance of the Isar Valley Railway. The German Post Office additionally reduced the number of postal bus route running parallel. At the end of 1933, the Isar Valley Railway could operate eleven pairs of trains between Munich and Wolfratshausen again. Passenger traffic increased in the following years, but freight was affected by the increasing private transport.|$|R
40|$|Many {{households}} have spanning livelihoods that draw on {{rural and urban}} resource opportunities. Urban and rural areas are closely linked, each contributing to the other, they therefore {{need to be considered}} jointly in development planning. The absence of rural development policies that recognise and seek to take advantage of positive aspects of rural-urban linkages in the impact regions of many cities in Developing Countries is a constraint to both rural and urban development. This policy vacuum requires a study to unveil how such deficiencies have affected rural-urban linkages and in turn livelihoods in both rural and urban areas. The impact region of Dar es Salaam is very conspicuous. The impact region surrounds Dar es Salaam city, which is the country's main point of entry and exit for goods and people and has always had an important role to play in the national development. Poor provision of socio-economic and physical infrastructure is evident in the impact region of Dar es Salaam. The poor development of infrastructure in the impact region dates back to the purpose of establishing Dar es Salaam city. There is a common agreement that the city was established as a port to receive agricultural produce and minerals from the hinterland to be exported to Europe. Consequently, the first objective of this research was to identify the types of rural-urban linkages in the impact region, describe the level of development of the impact region and the extent of rural-urban linkages. The second objective of the research was to evaluate the strength and weaknesses of rural-urban linkages in the impact region, analyse rural-urban linkages with specific focus to the city and the settlements in the impact region, and appraise its role in enhancing livelihoods in urban and rural areas as well. The third objective was to formulate a policy framework for effective rural-urban linkages and enhanced livelihoods. These issues have been investigated empirically. The research addresses the question of urban-rural linkages first from a theoretical standpoint, and thereafter illustrates it with some concrete cases at two different geographical locations. Besides, it takes a dynamic approach to rural-urban linkages by looking more closely at changes affecting the impact region livelihoods rather than merely describing the linkages between urban and rural areas. The study adopted participatory methodology tools such as focus group discussions, mobility matrix, Venn diagrams, and small-scale household surveys. These tools were put to practice in the commodity chain analysis from the production stage in the villages to the consumption stage in urban areas. This research unveils the latent potentials of rural-urban linkages in livelihood enhancement in both rural and urban areas. The observed weak rural-urban linkages and livelihoods development {{can be attributed to the}} limited local institutional development and its interplay, inadequate provision of social, physical and economic infrastructure and ineffective regional planning machinery in the impact region. Main findings in the study were: locally designed institutions are fundamental safety nets; affordable transport complements other factors; and that migration is a survival strategy in rural-urban linkages. Based on these findings, the study recommendations include: Firstly, institute planning teams to deal with the urban problems that cut across local authorities boundaries consisting of core city and the adjacent district authorities. Secondly, involve <b>local</b> communities to <b>surcharge</b> new development in the impact region for the provision of line infrastructural facilities, such as roads, electricity and water. Thirdly, support locally designed institutions and private small-scale processing industries by formulating a policy that allows governments non-governmental organisations and donors to invest in institutions, either directly or indirectly by creating an environment friendly to the emergence of local institutions. Lastly, as regards migration of people, it is at the heart of development. Policies need to support migration by creating socio-infrastructure facilities such as schools, water, and value added processing and employment opportunities to the new areas.
