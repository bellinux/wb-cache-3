50|$|The {{southern}} facade {{facing the}} city has three tall narrow openings, symmetrically arranged. The outer two are a pair of timber <b>louvre</b> <b>shutters,</b> with corrugated iron hoods over. The central opening has similar shutters and a fixed panel of louvres above, plus a more ornate gabled hood.|$|R
50|$|Oakwal, a {{single-storeyed}} sandstone residence on {{the crest}} of a hill just north of Breakfast Creek at Windsor, is encircled by Bush Street. The building exhibits a Georgian influence in its design, such as the symmetrical east elevation with portico, hammered stone walls, paired square timber verandah posts and <b>louvred</b> <b>shutters</b> to French doors.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} {{gives the}} appearance of masonry, but it is actually a highly insulated timber frame. The units all have generous balconies, framed in wind-toppled French oak, with sliding <b>louvred</b> <b>shutters</b> to control privacy and sunlight, which look out on to the parkland across the road. This is quite a busy thoroughfare, particularly at peak hours, but the flats are remarkably quiet.|$|R
5000|$|On the exterior, {{the main}} bedroom {{projects}} slightly and {{is supported by}} corbels. On the northern wall, multi-paned French doors open out to a small semi-circular [...] "Juliet" [...] balcony. These doors are surrounded with raised rendered decoration similar to that around the front entry door. Windows throughout the house are generally multi-paned timber sash and casement windows and most have external timber <b>louvre</b> <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{section of}} Lota House {{is important in}} exhibiting a number of aesthetic features: the simple rectilinear form punctuated by the colonnaded verandah retains the elegant symmetry and proportion of the Georgian influence; the retention of the internal proportions and planning; the substantial amount of original fabric remaining intact, particularly the cedar joinery which includes doors, skirtings, architraves and staircases; and the sliding <b>louvred</b> <b>shutters</b> to the upper windows and French doors which are also rare and innovative.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the narrow}} cedar {{staircase}} has shaped handrails and stick-balusters (replacements), the vestibule features an ornate plaster ceiling, and {{the dining room}} has an early 20th century pressed metal ceiling. The first floor, with narrow stick-balustraded verandahs on three sides, originally accommodated bedrooms. These verandahs are accessed by French doors, though the <b>louvred</b> <b>shutters</b> have not been reinstated. Fireplaces remain in the ground floor rooms but have been enclosed upstairs. They lead to dominant chimney-stacks which are set diagonally to the ridge of the wide hipped roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{gingerbread}} {{house by}} design combines architectural knowledge that stemmed abroad, into {{an understanding of}} the Caribbean climate and its living conditions. They were constructed with tall doors, high ceilings, with steep turret roofs to redirect hot air above its inhabitable rooms, along with a cross-breeze of <b>louvred</b> <b>shutter</b> windows on all sides instead of glass to offset the most scorching of days, and flexible timber frames with the innate ability to weather some of the toughest storms and tremors, built with wrap-around verandas. The houses are usually constructed out of wood, masonry, or stone and clay.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floor}} of the Station Building {{contains}} currently disused offices, while the ground floor contains station operations rooms, offices and store areas. Timber stairs with cast-iron balusters are located on the western side. The first floor interiors retain some vertically-jointed timber-lined walls and a small timber service window. The ground floor interiors retain some masonry arches and timber columns with decorative timber capitals. The annex to the southern end contains store-rooms and toilets, including a Ladies Waiting Room of generous proportions. A small timber-lined kiosk (1936) with timber roll-down <b>louvred</b> <b>shutters</b> opening out onto the platform {{is located at the}} northern end.|$|R
50|$|The facade, {{consisting}} of verandahs to both floors, {{is divided into}} three bays. The ground floor features Tuscan Order columns supporting an entablature with cornice, and the first floor features paired Egyptian inspired, Lotus Bud capital, cast iron columns supporting a corrugated iron awning. The arched centre entrance bay projects on both floors, and is surmounted by a gable and both floors have cast iron balustrade, but of a different design. The ground floor has a timber framed glass entrance door with an arched fanlight, with a large sash window on the west and a casement on the east. The first floor has french doors with timber <b>louvred</b> <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Billiard Room adjoins {{the main}} {{building}} via a (now enclosed) walkway covered with a corrugated iron roof barrel vault with a pressed metal ceiling, which links to an ogee shaped awning supported on decorative fretted brackets to the northern face of the Billiard Room. The building has a simple rectangular form with a pitched roof, with a raised curved portion, and a chimney to the southern end. It has rectangular timber windows with timber <b>louvred</b> <b>shutters,</b> scalloped barge boards to the gable ends, and a scalloped timber trim to the awning. The northern gable is further embellished with projecting brick patterns which trace {{the outline of the}} gable, and form three central diamond patterns.|$|R
5000|$|The {{verandah}} has paired timber posts {{with square}} capitals and decorative timber valances. It {{is covered by}} a curved corrugated iron roof, and has a wrought iron balustrade. The northern Roderick St elevation has a small front yard and a modest entrance (currently not used) consisting of rendered masonry stairs and a timber arch spanning between posts which has the words [...] "The Manse" [...] are inscribed upon it. This northern elevation has timber <b>louvred</b> <b>shutters,</b> while the west and east elevations have glazed timber doors with glazed fanlights above. The building sits on a brick screen base. Two tall rendered masonry chimneys and a metal ventilator rise above the ridge of the roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} is clad with weatherboards which infill the balustrading to {{the west}} and south verandahs. Part of the south verandah is protected by <b>louvred</b> timber <b>shutters</b> and timber blinds. Verandah ceilings are unlined to the open verandahs and battened and sheeted in the enclosed areas.|$|R
2500|$|The club {{offered to}} meet the cost of any {{property}} damage (£400), and suggested further countermeasures, such as <b>louvred</b> window <b>shutters,</b> and a net over the Millers' garden. [...] The Millers were not content and sued for damages and an injunction to prevent cricket being played on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Oogarding {{demonstrates}} the principal {{characteristic of a}} substantial, interwar Mediterranean Style residence with important style indicators such as asymmetrical massing, cement rendered masonry construction and Marseilles tiled roof, strongly expressed main entry door, round arched and arcaded loggia, [...] "Juliet" [...] balcony and multi-paned, double hung windows with <b>louvred</b> timber <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{contains some}} fine detailing. It has cedar and hoop pine joinery throughout. The centrally located entrance hall has cedar stairs with a finely turned and carved balustrade. An ogee-shaped archway decorates {{the foot of}} the stairs. The Dining Room has a deep plaster cornice, and a fireplace with a finely carved mantelpiece, and tiled and cast iron surrounds. It also contains a bay window which sits in an arched recess. The bay window has sliding internal timber shutters which are encased in timber panels under the window sill. The Drawing Room has a cornice with a deep shadow line, a deep three- piece pine and cedar skirting, and a cast iron and tiled fireplace with a marble mantelpiece. It has timber <b>louvred</b> <b>shutters</b> and timber double doors set in deep timber reveals opening onto the verandahs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main house}} is a two-room high-set {{timber-frame}} building clad with corrugated galvanised iron. The building is elevated on bush timber stumps of a local ironwood. Two upstairs bedrooms form a central core with enclosed verandahs on three sides. The upstairs floor is of pit-sawn boards on a pit-sawn frame. Upstairs rooms are externally clad with wide horizontal chamferboards, beaded on the inside at joints to give a narrow pattern on the interior. The rooms are internally clad with narrower horizontal boards that also form the ceiling. Internal cross-wall partitions are clad in corrugated iron on sawn timber studs. Bays of timber <b>louvre</b> <b>shutters</b> enclose the front and sides of the upstairs verandah area above the former handrail. Corrugated iron cladding has been added below the handrail. The verandah area also contains corrugated iron push-out shutters. A gable hip roof clad with corrugated iron covers the central core of the building. Roof rafters are of sapling bush timber. Original purlins are pit sawn, with some milled timber purlins introduced [...] and in 1986.|$|R
50|$|The building's {{original}} neoclassical aspect, {{as well as}} its stone construction, {{was directly}} influenced by the arrival of Loyalists from the southern United States in the 1780s. Previously most Bahamian buildings had been built of painted wood. Typically Bahamian elements, however, include <b>louvred</b> wood <b>shutters</b> and brightly painted exterior, in this case a brilliant shade of conch-pink. The primary façade, centred on a pedimented entrance supported by four stout Ionic columns, dates from the 1930s, when the building was remodelled following the hurricane of 1929.|$|R
50|$|The deck has {{cross-braced}} timber balustrades and {{a decorative}} porch/aedicule forming {{the entrance to}} the first floor. The porch/aedicule has paired timber posts with cross-bracing, latticed timber valance, <b>louvred</b> timber <b>shutters</b> above balustrade height, and decorative timber gable with battens and curved timber elements. The decorative southern gable of the first floor is located above the porch/aedicule, and has a battened timber screen with an arched central section and curved timber trim. A sash window with corrugated iron sunhood is located adjacent to the porch/aedicule.|$|R
50|$|Toronto is a two storeyed, {{timber house}} {{designed}} in the Carpenter Gothic style of architecture. The building is dominated by its roof that is basically two large intersecting gables. Beneath the corrugated iron roof cladding is the original roof clad with wooden shingles. Each gable features decorative scalloped bargeboards. A single brick chimney with a simple brick moulding protrudes above the roofline and is capped with two decorative terracotta pots. The external walls of the main house are hand-planed pine chamferboards which are approximately 300mm wide. Internal walls and ceilings throughout the house are vertically lined with tongue and groove boards. The house contains seven main rooms, four at ground level with three upstairs. The ground level central hallway is decorated with an intricate fretted semicircular timber panel positioned overhead midway down the hall. A steep and narrow, stained timber staircase connects the two floor levels towards {{the rear of the}} house. Most windows in the house are multi-paned double-hung sashes, except at the front where French door with <b>louvred</b> <b>shutters</b> have been installed on both the upper and lower levels. Concave metal hoods with decorative timber fretwork brackets are fitted to windows on both side elevations. Original timber joinery such as fireplace surrounds, doors, architraves and skirtings remain throughout the house.|$|R
50|$|The building, {{over the}} central section and north eastern wing, has a hipped slate roof, and spaced {{regularly}} along the roof {{line of the}} north-east and south-east facades are decorative Anglo-Dutch gables. Roof vents line the ridge. The central section and north-eastern wing are surrounded by two storeys of verandahs, on the lower and first floors of the building. Supporting the corrugated iron verandah awning are cast iron columns, occasionally paired. The verandah features cast iron balustrading with the intertwined letters AHC within the pattern, cast iron frieze panels and column brackets. The window openings which line the principal facade have fixed <b>louvre</b> timber <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Endcliffe Hall {{is built}} in the Italianate style from ashlar {{stonework}} and has a hipped slate roof. There are two storeys with plain sash windows, the main front of the building, which faces west, has a three storey square Belvedere tower. The hall {{was designed to be}} fireproof with concrete floors and iron joists with a large cistern in the tower for domestic use and fire fighting. The ground floor windows were made burglar proof with the use of retractable Belgian made <b>louvred</b> iron <b>shutters.</b> Large mirrors masked the shutters on the interior when closed and threw light back into the room. The former entrance and lodge stand at the south east corner of the grounds; they have been converted into a private house and named 61 Endcliffe Vale Road.|$|R
5000|$|Letters {{written by}} Walter and George during 1846 and 1847 {{indicate}} that {{improvements to the}} value of £1200-£1500 were planned and these were to include the construction of a [...] "good house". In early December 1848, George married Emmeline Macarthur, who was another of the daughters of Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur, father of Patrick's wife. From Emmeline's memoirs it seems that the house in which she lived at Canning Downs upon her arrival after the wedding was a [...] "cottage ...built of wood, painted white and lined with canvas, and pretty room papers, thoroughly and prettily furnished and surrounded by a white verandah". She continues on to say that a church service was held in a small hall of the house every Sunday at 11.00am for [...] "several of our neighbours...employees and friends which produced quite a congregation". Emmeline suggests that their accommodation at Canning Downs was unusual,"the cottage only afforded two spare rooms and with the chance of six friends suddenly appearing such accommodation was impossible. At the end of our cottage and parallel to our own, and divided by a covered way, the sides and verandah covered with vines, was a long building devoted to servants, storeroom and offices. We had one very large room and six folding beds made on (the) principal of a long camp stool, called a stretcher. They were seldom all unoccupied and not infrequently all were in request."She also talks of French windows opening onto the verandah from both the hall and her bedroom. This description of the 1848 residence at Canning Downs suggests that the house into which Emmeline and George moved was, indeed, the timber slab house still today used as the residence. The long building referred to in the above description would then be the kitchen wing of the present structure. A sketch by Conrad Martens done in March 1852 provides further evidence of this. This shows the residence as a house with hipped roof, verandahs and shuttered French windows with a kitchen wing at the rear. Notes {{at the top of the}} sketch suggest that the building was white with [...] "green venetians", presumably a reference to the fixed <b>louvre</b> <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} opening off Denham Street, accessed {{through the}} loggia within the projecting portico {{is a substantial}} double timber panelled and moulded door, with semi circular fanlight above, leading into a small entrance vestibule from which double timber framed and glazed doors, also with semi circular fanlight above, give access to the former banking chamber. Surrounding the double timber doors on the external wall is a plaster moulded architrave with prominent keystone. Flanking the doorway are two groups of three round arched window openings fitted with vertical sash windows and fixed <b>louvre</b> timber <b>shutters.</b> The moulded sills of these openings, and {{of those on the}} Quay Street facade of the building are integrated into a continuous string moulding at this level. At the northern end of the Quay Street facade is another entrance, comprising a single six panelled door flanked by sidelights, with a semi circular fanlight above. The first floor level features French door openings that correspond to the openings on the ground floor and also have round arched heads.|$|R
