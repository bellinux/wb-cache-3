40|$|The rough-rice-drying {{process in}} a mixing <b>type</b> <b>dryer</b> was {{analysed}} by the theory of thin layer drying. The drying period of rough rice in the dryer {{is assumed to be}} a pre-heating period, and a heat balance equation is introduced as one of the basic equations. The Becker 2 ̆ 7 s equation of moisture content, the Henderson 2 ̆ 7 s equation of equilibrium moisture content, and the equations of air and vapour characteristics are used for the analysis with a slight modification. The drying process in mixing <b>type</b> <b>dryer</b> is assumed to be as folloes; 1 ） Drying air increase its humidity and reduces its temperature by absorbing the moisture of the products through the mixing layer from the inlet to the outlet. This means that the state of air changes with drying time and grain position as in deep stationary bed. 2) The state of grains is independent of their position, but dependent on drying time. This is due to constant mixing. 3) The drying rate of grains, averaged by constant mixing, is independent of their position although the local drying rate varies with their position. 4 ） The heating rate of grains is also independent of their position. This is the same situation as in the drying rate. The equations on the misture content, the temperature of grains, the absolute humidity, and the enthalpy of drying air are being derived. The numerical method of solving these equations is given together with its computer program. Results computed with this theory agree well with the measured values with the practical apparatus, L. S.

40|$|Tethered {{particle}} motion (TPM) experiments {{can be used}} {{to detect}} time-resolved loop formation in a single DNA molecule by measuring changes in the length of a DNA tether. Interpretation of such experiments is greatly aided by computer simulations of DNA looping which allow one to analyze the structure of the looped DNA and estimate DNA-protein binding constants specific for the loop formation process. We here present a new Monte Carlo scheme for accurate simulation of DNA configurations subject to geometric constraints and apply this method to Lac repressor mediated DNA looping, comparing the simulation results with new experimental data obtained by the TPM technique. Our simulations, taking into account the details of attachment of DNA ends and fluctuations of the looped subsegment of the DNA, reveal the origin of the double-peaked distribution of RMS values observed by TPM experiments by showing that the average RMS value for anti-parallel <b>loop</b> <b>types</b> is smaller than that of parallel <b>loop</b> <b>types.</b> The simulations also reveal that the looping probabilities for the anti-parallel <b>loop</b> <b>types</b> are significantly higher than those of the parallel <b>loop</b> <b>types,</b> even for <b>loops</b> of length 600 and 900 base pairs, and that the correct proportion between the heights of the peaks in the distribution can only be attained when loops with flexible Lac repressor conformation are taken into account.

40|$|AbstractIn Japan, net Zero Energy Buildings {{are crucial}} for {{reducing}} energy use and environmental load to realize a sustainable society. Ground-source heat pump systems {{are a key}} technology for reducing energy consumption by air conditioning systems. There {{are two types of}} ground-source heat pump systems: “closed loop type” and “open loop type”. In general, open <b>loop</b> <b>type</b> ground-source heat pump systems have better relative performance than closed <b>loop</b> <b>type</b> systems. However, pumping up underground water is prohibited in urban areas of Japan to prevent the ground surface level from sinking. Therefore, closed <b>loop</b> <b>type</b> systems are used more extensively in Japan. The typical and conventional heat exchangers used for closed <b>loop</b> <b>type</b> heat pump systems are of the “U tube” or “double U tube” types. However, neither type has a high heat exchange capacity per unit length. Thus, in this study, a spiral-type heat exchanger for a ground-source heat pump system is developed. The aim of the heat exchanger is to perform intensive heat-exchange in the aquifer layer near the ground surface (ten to twenty meters in depth). To use the underground water flow in order to facilitate intensive heat exchange, the length of the heat exchanger is planned to be inserted between ten and twenty meters below the surface into {{the upper part of the}} aquifer. The diameter of the spiral-type heat exchanger is determined such that a borehole machine for piles can be used for settlement of heat exchangers to reduce the construction cost. The performance of the heat exchanger is simulated under various flow rates and soil conditions using the numerical simulator “TOUGH 2 /EOS 1. ” Based on the simulation and construction cost study, the cost-effectiveness of the spiral-type exchanger is made clear...|$|R

Both <b>dryer</b> <b>types</b> were compared explicitely by evaluating optimum configurations {{for a wide range of}} production capacity values.
