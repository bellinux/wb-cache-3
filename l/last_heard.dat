5|$|In America Widmerpool becomes {{something}} of a figurehead among youth protest movements; there are suggestions that his earlier problems may have resulted from a CIA plot. He returns to England in the late 1960s and is installed as Chancellor of a new university. During the ceremony he is pelted with red paint but immediately identifies with the demonstrators and becomes a central figure in the counter-culture movement. He resigns the chancellorship after a year, to run a commune for dissident youth. By late 1969, he has been drawn into a more sinister cult, led by the young mystic Scorpio Murtlock, which gradually overwhelms his life and independence. He is <b>last</b> <b>heard</b> of late in 1971, when during a ritual dawn run through the woods he collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} Gui's disappearance, four men came to search his {{apartment}} – ostensibly for his computer – but left without it. A manager from the estate where Gui lived attempted to contact Gui {{on the number}} of the person who called her last regarding Gui. A taxi driver answered, saying that four men had left the telephone in the taxi, and that they had wanted to go to Poipet, a border town in Cambodia. Gui was <b>last</b> <b>heard</b> from on 6 November when he called his wife to tell her that he was safe but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts. The Thai authorities have no record of Gui leaving the country. Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol. The Guardian observed that the Thai government had done little to advance the case, noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands.|$|E
5|$|Gui Minhai (桂民海, age 51) is a Swedish {{national}} {{and one of}} the three shareholders of Mighty Current. He was taken away from his home in Pattaya, Thailand by an unknown man on 17 October 2015. Gui had written some 200 books during his ten years as author/publisher. He kept his movements to himself and his communications routed, and his work projects would also be shrouded in secrecy. Gui has not set foot inside the PRC for a long period – he never attended to his father when he was ill, and did not return upon his death. It is known that his home in Thailand was later searched by four Chinese men, who attempted to seize Gui's computer. A manager from the estate where Gui lived, in an effort to contact Gui, dialled the number that last called her regarding Gui, to be told by a taxi driver that the four men, who had left the telephone in the taxi, wanted to go to a border town in Cambodia. He was <b>last</b> <b>heard</b> from on 6 November when he called his wife to tell her that he was safe but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts. Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol, but the Guardian, noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands, observed that the Thais had done little to advance the case. The Thai authorities have no record of him leaving the country.|$|E

5|$|The saga then relates how the Earl Maddaðr gave Sveinn guides, and how Sveinn {{travelled}} {{through the}} interior of the country—over mountains, and through woods, away from inhabited areas—until he came upon Strath Helmsdale, near where Ölvir and Frakökk lived. Williams stated that since the saga records that Sveinn approached the area by land, the site of Ölvir and Frakökk's estate was probably located somewhere in the dale of Helmsdale—not where the modern village is situated on the coast. Williams also noted that this area was quite remote from Orkney, and that it may have been outside of the control of the earldom. The saga states that Ölvir and Frakökk had spies on the lookout; however, because of the route taken by Sveinn, they were unaware of his presence until Svienn occupied a certain slope behind their homestead. The saga states that Ölvir and sixty of his men confronted Sveinn, although Þormóður Torfason's account of the incident gives forty. After a short clash, the saga states that, Ölvir's men soon gave way, and many were killed in the ensuing rout. Ölvir survived the clash, and fled up Helmsdale river. Meanwhile, Sveinn and his men continued on towards the houses. The area was plundered, and the houses were burnt to the ground with their inmates still inside—and in this way Frakökk perished. The saga states that Sveinn and his men committed many ravages in Sutherland before returning home. Upon reaching the river, Ölvir fled through the mountains, and is <b>last</b> <b>heard</b> making for the Suðreyjar; he is not mentioned again within the Orkneyinga saga. Later on within the saga, another of Frakökk's grandsons, Þórbjörn 'Clerk', who is a brother-in-law and close friend of Sveinn, has two of Sveinn's men killed for their part in the burning.|$|E
25|$|After Cameo-Parkway folded, Seger and Punch {{began searching}} for a new label. In the spring of 1968, Bob Seger & the <b>Last</b> <b>Heard</b> signed with major label Capitol Records, turning down Motown Records, who offered more money than Capitol. Seger felt that Capitol was more {{appropriate}} for his genre than Motown.|$|E

25|$|The {{alliance}} between Ealdgyth's father and husband was of great significance in resisting the growing {{power of the}} Godwinesons. On the death of Earl Ralph in 1057, Hereford was added to Harold's earldom. The following year, Ælfgar was outlawed for a second time, but he was restored to office before long. Ælfgar is <b>last</b> <b>heard</b> of in 1062 and seems to have died by 1063, when Harold Godwineson invaded Wales. Gruffudd {{was killed in the}} event.|$|E

25|$|Three Ba.88s were {{modified}} by the Agusta plant in late 1942 {{to serve as}} ground-attack aircraft. The Ba.88M had the wingspan increased by 2 meters (6ft 6½ in) to alleviate wing-loading problems, and featured dive brakes, Fiat A.74 RC.38 engines, and a nose armament increased to four 12,7mm (0,5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns. Evaluated at Guidonia, they were delivered to the 103° Gruppo Autonomo Tuffatori at Lonate Pozzolo on 7 September 1943, the day before Italian Armistice. Later they were evaluated by Luftwaffe pilots {{and that was the}} <b>last</b> <b>heard</b> of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|To {{restore the}} composer's reputation, The Rutland Boughton Music Trust was {{established}} in 1978, {{the year of the}} composer's Centenary, to encourage performances and sponsor recordings of his works. Many of these, including some world premieres, now appear on disc with the Hyperion Records label. The Oliver Cromwell symphony - first heard in 2005 - and three of the Songs of the English (<b>last</b> <b>heard</b> around 1904/5) have been released by Dutton, as well as a selection of Songs for mezzo and pianoforte on the British Music Society's own label.

25|$|Two {{victims were}} {{identified}} {{because of their}} known connection to Gacy through PDM Contractors; most identifications were facilitated {{with the assistance of}} X-ray charts. These identifications were also supported via personal artifacts being found at 8213 Summerdale: one victim, 19-year-old David Talsma, was identified via comparison of radiology records of a healed fracture of the left scapula matching distress evident upon the 17th skeleton recovered from Gacy's crawl space; another youth, Timothy O'Rourke, was <b>last</b> <b>heard</b> mentioning that a contractor had offered him a job. Of Gacy's identified victims, the youngest were Samuel Dodd Stapleton and Michael Marino, both 14 years old; the oldest was Russell Nelson, who was 21 years old.

500|$|U-69 {{was laid}} down on 7 February 1914 (yard number 206) by Germaniawerft at Kiel and {{launched}} on 24 June 1915. She was commissioned on 4 September 1915 {{under the command}} of Kapitänleutnant Ernst Wilhelms. During her service career, U-69 sank 31 ships with a combined gross register tonnage of 102,875, the largest among them, the 13,441-ton armed merchant cruiser [...] U-69 was <b>last</b> <b>heard</b> from on 11 July 1917 when she reported being off the coast of Norway. Her fate is officially unknown, even though British reports credit her sinking to destroyer [...] The dates in German records, however, do not support this claim.|$|E

500|$|An {{inquiry into}} the {{destruction}} of camp Smith is held at Centralville. In addition to the personnel of the colony, two emissaries from the planets of Hain and Tau Ceti also participate. Lyubov states that the colony's mistreatment and enslavement of the Athsheans led to the attack. Colonel Dongh, {{the commander of the}} colony, blames Lyubov's assessment of the Athsheans as non-aggressive. The emissaries state that the rules of Terra's colonial administration have changed since the colony <b>last</b> <b>heard</b> from it; they present the colony with an ansible, which can communicate instantly with Terra and the colonial administration (communication which would otherwise take 27 years in one direction). They also state that Terra is now a member of the [...] "League of Worlds", of which they are emissaries. The colony is forced to release all its Athshean slaves, and minimize contact with them. Davidson is transferred to a different camp under a higher-ranking commander, as punishment for a retaliatory raid that he carried out. However, Davidson violates his orders and leads further attacks against Athshean towns, without the knowledge of his superiors.|$|E
500|$|His colleagues <b>last</b> <b>heard</b> from Gui Minhai on 15 October 2015. Gui was {{captured}} on closed circuit TV leaving {{his apartment in}} Pattaya, Thailand on 17 October 2015, apparently taken away by an unknown man. He was the second bookseller associated with Causeway Bay Books to apparently vanish without trace: Lui Bo had last been seen {{near his home in}} Shenzhen on 14 October 2015; three others would also disappear in the weeks that followed. The three were reported missing in November. Lee Bo (sometimes, Paul Lee, also, Lee Po) had been informing the media of the disappearances of his other four colleagues when he himself vanished from Hong Kong on 30 December. Lee's disappearance, due to the improbability that Lee had gone to Shenzhen while his mainland travel permit was left at home, crystallised a great deal of anxiety about the pattern of bookshop disappearances and of the possibility of cross-border renditions. Lee Bo's disappearance prompted Hong Kong Chief Executive CY Leung to hold a press conference on 4 January 2016 in which he stated that it would be [...] "unacceptable" [...] and a breach of the Basic Law if mainland Chinese law officials were operating in Hong Kong.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Ann [...] "Peggy" [...] Mitchell (also Butcher) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders.
