40|$|We {{studied the}} {{morphology}} and histology of the oviducal gland (OG) {{in the brown}} ray (Raja miraletus) and the <b>long-nosed</b> <b>skate</b> (Dipturus oxyrinchus) to understand its functional role in the reproductive strategy of these species. The external morphology of the gland was similar in both species, with lateral extensions like those found in {{other members of the}} Rajidae. Microscopic analysis showed a similar internal organization in both species. Immature and developing glands did not react to histochemical techniques. On reaching maturity, the OG had the largest width due to an increase in the production of secretory materials. In both species, the club zone of the gland showed a strong reaction to Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and alcian blue (AB) stains, indicating production of neutral and sulfated acid mucins. The secretory material produced by the papillary zone varied greatly between the two species. Both displayed tubular glands similar to those observed in the club zone, but in D. oxyrinchus the region near the lumen was intensely PAS+, whereas the last row of tubules of the brown ray stained intensely for a mixture of neutral and sulfated mucins. The baffle zone was the most conspicuous and extensive segment of all OGs, and it did not react to PAS/AB. The terminal zone, which is responsible for production of hair filaments, differed between the two species in terms of composition and organization of serous and mucous glands. This difference probably is related to the different substrates in which they release the egg capsules. Individual sperm detected in the brown ray baffle lamellae could be the result of a recent mating, whereas their presence in the deep recesses of the baffle and in the terminal zone of the <b>long-nosed</b> <b>skate</b> might indicate sperm storag...|$|E
40|$|This work investigates life-history {{traits of}} the <b>long-nosed</b> <b>skate</b> Dipturus oxyrinchus, {{which is a}} common {{by-catch}} in Sardinian waters. The reproductive variables were analysed from 979 specimens sampled during scientific and commercial hauls. Females (10 · 4 – 117 · 5 [*]cm total length, LT) attained larger sizes than males (14 · 5 – 99 · 5 [*]cm LT). To evaluate age and growth, a sub-sample of 130 individuals (76 females and 54 males) were used. The age was estimated by annuli counts of sectioned vertebral centra. Four models {{were used for the}} length-at-age data: the von Bertalanffy, the exponential, the Gompertz and the logistic functions. According to the Akaike's information criterion, the Gompertz model seemed to provide the best fitting curve (L∞ mean[*]±[*]s. e. : 127 · 55 [*]±[*] 4 · 90 [*]cm, k: 0 · 14 [*]±[*] 0 · 09, IP: 3 · 97 [*]±[*] 0 · 90 [*]years). The oldest female and male were aged 17 (115 · 5 [*]cm LT) and 15 [*]years (96 · 0 [*]cm LT), respectively. Lengths at maturity were 103 · 5 [*]cm for females and 91 · 0 [*]cm for males, corresponding to 90 % of the maximum observed length in both sexes. The monthly distribution of maturity stages highlighted an extended reproductive cycle, with spawning females and active males being present almost throughout the year, as confirmed by the gonado-somatic index.

40|$|Skates {{are often}} {{considered}} vulnerable to overfishing {{because of their}} peculiar life cycle characteristics rendering them susceptible to overexploitation. In this regard, life-history traits of a by-catch species, the <b>long-nosed</b> <b>skate</b> Dipturus oxyrinchus (Linnaeus, 1758) from Sardinian waters, were investigated. The age, growth and reproduction were studied using 706 specimens sampled during experimental and commercial hauls (depths 76 - 671 metres). Females (10. 4 - 117. 5 cm in total length, TL) attained larger sizes than males (14. 5 - 99. 5 cm TL). To evaluate the growth, a subsample of 130 individuals (76 females and 54 males) was employed. The age was estimated through the annuli counts on sectioned vertebral centra. A high ageing reproducibility and precision was obtained (Index of Average Percent Error= 6. 56; %CV= 8. 9). Four models were applied on length at age data: the von Bertalanffy (VBGF), the Exponential, the Gompertz and the Logistic functions. According to the Akaike’s Information Criterion, the Gompertz model (L∞= 127. 5 ± 4. 9 cm; k= 0. 14 ± 0. 009; inflection point= 3. 97 y- 1 ± 0. 9) provided the best fitting curve, showing a higher growth rate and a lower L∞ than what obtained with the VBGF (L∞= 144. 4 ± 11. 5 cm; k= 0. 08 ± 0. 001; t 0 =- 1. 09 ± 0. 23). The oldest female and male were 17 (115. 5 cm TL) and 15 years (96 cm TL), respectively. Lengths at maturity were 103. 5 cm (14 years) for females and 91 cm (12. 1 years) for males corresponding to 88 and 91. 5 % of the maximum observed length, respectively. The monthly evolution of maturity stages highlighted an extended reproductive cycle with spawning females and active males almost over the year, as confirmed by the Gonado-somatic Index. Ovarian fecundity reached a maximum of 26 yolked follicles. Given the relative abundance in Sardinian seas, we hope that these results will prove useful {{for the implementation of}} basic management measures in order to ensure the sustainability of catches of this species, particularly sensitive to fishing pressure, in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E
