500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston. The episode was inspired by an event that happened when Shiban and his future wife were visiting her father in the hospital. According to Shiban, he was very near death and kept <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people were in the room. When his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he kept <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might be able to look through the cracks [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it just seemed right".|$|E
500|$|The ride {{experience}} was different in its earlier years. Passengers would enter under {{the middle of}} the coaster's lift. After entering an eerie space soundtrack played. The first room was [...] "Mission Control". Black lights lit the room. Travel posters and a rocket diagram were on the side walls. Two airport loading gates were seen next to two TV monitors (showing the head of the company [...] "The Dispatch Master" [...] or random space pilots) and were on either side of a desk in the middle. An employee sitting at the desk would say to the riders that the loading gates on were both malfunctioning and the riders had to be rerouted through the [...] "service rooms" [...] of the hangar. Walking into the next room deemed [...] "Rocket Recovery", guests would see a [...] "rocket locator" [...] robot named [...] "Dave" [...] working up on a platform at a terminal trying to contact the companies rockets (one according to him crashed outside of Akron). Walking down another hallway, guests could glance at crates inside of a warehouse within the building. After the short hallway, guests entered the [...] "Repair Bay". A room showcasing a [...] "binocular security camera" [...] robot named [...] "Franc" [...] <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> (he was later removed). There were also suspended conveyor baskets carrying various items, a high voltage generator, pneumatic robotic arms [...] "repairing" [...] a rocket, and a security scanner that flashed [...] "REJECT" [...] after scanning guests.A small room outside the Repair Bay had the company's logo subtlety broken to reveal the ride's true name. Entering the [...] "Launch Area" [...] rockets moved from behind a curtain without passengers. After ten people loaded on a rocket the ride began. The rocket moved out on a block section where an [...] "on-board computer" [...] welcomed you and started the [...] "automatic launch sequence". Two spinning laser light spheres projected a star field around the rocket as it climbed the lift. Upon reaching the top your computer takes notice of nearby [...] "space pirates" [...] and begins to perform abrasive maneuvers. As riders went through the coaster, they would see exploding rockets, meteors, laser projections, and a satellite that shot lasers. Your on-board computer shouts [...] "I'm losing control, I'm losing control!" [...] before an Alaskan landscape came into view and the rockets entered the brake run. Riders entered the unloading station where they were greeted by an employee that yells [...] "WELCOME TO ALASKA!" [...] The riders disembarked their vehicle and exited on the left.|$|E
60|$|She laughed softly, {{leaning back}} amongst the {{cushions}} {{of the chair}} and <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> her kindly eyes filled with interest.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> man <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> {{door behind}} {{had been left}} ajar. He stepped {{backward}} and closed it.|$|R
60|$|Hamel <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Already {{his heart}} was {{beginning}} to sink.|$|R
60|$|The costermonger was next. Brooks <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and at <b>the</b> clock.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{find this}} uncivilised," [...] she replied, with fierce intensity, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Then, on the impulse, she added: [...] "I can't stand it! I {{came here to}} live with my mother, but this is too--too horrible!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{where is}} Mr. Van Teyl?" [...] she asked, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "I have been ringing {{up for the}} last ten minutes and couldn't get any answer. I did not realise that it was the next suite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely--but, just now, don't {{you think}} we've had enough {{financial}} talk?" [...] said Uncle Sylvester, with a bored contraction of his eyebrows. [...] "Come," [...] <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> [...] "you've changed {{the interior of}} the old house." ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{and drew}} {{him a little}} closer to her.|$|R
60|$|He {{breathed a}} deep breath and <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> before his gaze fixed again on Duane.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{drew back}} and <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and <b>the</b> {{sight of the}} {{assembled}} company quite amazed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Zo!" [...] said karl. [...] "Dese town--dose Schlachtstadt--is fine town, eh? Fine vomens. Goot men. Und beer und sausage. Blenty {{to eat and}} drink, eh? Und," [...] <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> [...] "you and te poys haf a gay times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Every {{one down}} for luncheon!" [...] Jeanne declared. [...] "What energy! Where is Lord Ronald, by the by?" [...] she added, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "He {{promised to take}} me out sailing this morning. I wonder if I missed him on the marshes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You want a keepsake, of course," [...] Philippa declared, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "You {{can have}} my photograph--the one over there. Helen {{will give you}} one of hers, too, I am sure, if you ask her. She is just as {{grateful}} to you about Richard as I am." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with <b>the</b> light yet cheerful curiosity of the pleasure-seeker. Then {{he leaned}} over towards Julien.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and {{recognised}} {{some of her}} friends. For {{some reason}} or other she felt remarkably light-hearted.|$|R
60|$|The officer glanced another <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> more, however, through {{habitual}} caution {{than any}} other reason, bowed, and departed.|$|R
6000|$|... "A thief!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "Just an {{ordinary}} self-convicted thief! That's what I call her, and nothing else. And here we all stood {{like a lot}} of ninnies. Why, if I'd done my duty I'd have locked the door and sent for a policeman." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{there came}} a curious and wholly {{unexpected}} interruption. A man in dark, plain clothes, still wearing his overcoat, and carrying a bowler hat, had been standing in {{the entrance of the}} restaurant for a moment or two, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> as though in search of some one. At last he caught the eye of the Baron de Grost and came quickly toward him.|$|E
60|$|She {{was in bed}} now, and lay <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with {{speculative}} gaze. Beside her stood her wheeled chair, {{with its}} cushion of dark Spanish leather. The girl smiled and, reaching for her work-basket, which was on a stand {{at the head of}} the bed, she drew out a pair of scissors and cut some of the stitches of the leathern cushion. Then she tucked the letter carefully inside and with a needle and some black linen thread sewed up the place she had ripped open.|$|E
60|$|Conger <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> He saw {{books and}} papers, holy signs and images. A strange low shiver went through him.|$|R
60|$|The {{door opened}} slowly. It was the French maid who stood there. She <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and beckoned to the dog.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned the}} lamp {{a little higher}} and <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> <b>room</b> was quite a small one and plainly {{furnished}} as a waiting-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I had a {{block of}} stone, I'd show you," [...] said the Czarover, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "Ah, here is my throne. The back is too high, anyhow, so I'll just break {{off a piece of}} that." [...] He rose to his feet and tottered in an {{uncertain}} way around the throne. Then he took hold of the back and broke off a piece of marble over a foot thick. [...] "This," [...] said he, coming back to his seat, [...] "is very solid marble and much harder than ordinary stone. Yet I can crumble it easily with my fingers, a proof that I am very strong." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a dull evening, {{and many}} of the tables {{remained}} unoccupied--save for the one waiting figure. The women, tired of looking towards the door, were smoking cigarettes, twirling their bracelets, yawning, and <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Many a mute invitation reached the two young men, but Holderness seemed to have lost his sociability. His face had grown harder and he seemed glad when their meal was over and they were free to depart. In the hall below they had to wait for their overcoats. Macheson strolled idly towards the entrance of another supper room on the ground floor, and looked in. An exclamation broke from his lips. He turned towards Holderness.|$|E
60|$|Lutchester did not for {{a moment}} reply. He had {{closed the door behind}} him carefully, and was <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> now with evident interest. Its bareness of {{furniture}} and decoration were noteworthy, but on the top of the ugly chest of drawers was a great bowl of roses, a queer little ivory figure set in an arched frame of copper--a figure almost sacerdotal, with its face turned towards the east--and a little shower of rose leaves, which could scarcely have fallen there by accident, at the foot of the pedestal. Lutchester inclined his head gravely, as he looked towards it, a gesture entirely reverential, almost an obeisance. Nikasti's eyes were clouded with curiosity. He slipped down to the ground.|$|E
60|$|Greenbrier <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> waiter brought {{things and}} took dishes away. He was observing. He saw a New York {{restaurant}} crowd enjoying itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't buy any carpets or wallpaper, Rosie; I thought you'd {{like to do}} that yourself," [...] John {{explained}} as she <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Hooker <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with {{a certain}} dark suspiciousness, and then, in an {{affected}} lower voice, which his theatrical experience made perfectly audible, went on:-- ...|$|R
60|$|While {{the waiter}} was gone {{to get the}} soup, Rollo and Jane had an {{opportunity}} of <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and observing how very different it was in its fixtures and furniture from a dining room on land. Instead of windows, there were only round holes in {{the sides of the}} ship, about a foot in diameter. For a sash, there was only one round and exceedingly thick and strong pane of glass, set in an iron frame, and opening inwards, on massive hinges. On the side of this frame, opposite the hinges, was a strong clamp and screw, by means of which the frame could be screwed up very tight, in order to exclude the water in case of heavy seas. The tables were fitted with a ledge all around the outside, to keep the dishes from sliding off. Above each table, and suspended from the ceiling, was a long shelf of beautiful wood, with racks and sockets in it of every kind, for containing wineglasses, tumblers, decanters, and such other things as would be wanted from time to time upon the table. Every one of these glasses was in a place upon the shelf expressly fitted to receive and retain it; so that it might be held securely, and not allowed to fall, however great might be the motion of the ship.|$|E

5000|$|Apparently {{marriage}} did {{not change}} Antoine's womanizing ways. Rebecca West (with whom he had a short affair in 1927) called him [...] "a boudoir athlete". While attending {{a party at the}} French embassy in London and <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> West realized that every woman in attendance had been his mistress at one time or another.|$|E
60|$|From {{that moment}} {{he felt that he}} was gaining ground. She <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> It was still filled, but in their corner they were almost unobserved.|$|R
6000|$|They all <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> but {{of course}} did not see her. [...] "In what part of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is she?" [...] was the Wizard's next question.|$|R
60|$|Trent woke {{from his}} day-dream into <b>the</b> present. He <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{and saw that}} no papers had been omitted. Then he glanced keenly into his clerk's face.|$|R
