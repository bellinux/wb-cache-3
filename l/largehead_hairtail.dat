5000|$|In Korea, the <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> {{is called}} galchi (...) , in which gal (...) came from Middle Korean galh (...) meaning [...] "sword" [...] and -chi (...) is a suffix for [...] "fish". It is popular for frying or grilling. In Japan, {{where it is}} known as tachiuo ("太刀(tachi)":sword, [...] "魚(uo)":fish), they are fished for food and eaten grilled or raw, as sashimi. They are also called [...] "sword-fish" [...] in Portugal and Brazil (peixe-espada), where they are eaten grilled or fried. Its flesh is firm yet tender when cooked, with a {{moderate}} level of [...] "fishiness" [...] to the smell and {{a low level of}} oiliness. The <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> is also notable for being fairly easy to debone.|$|E
50|$|The <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> (also beltfish, Trichiurus lepturus) is {{a member}} of the {{cutlassfish}} family, Trichiuridae. It is a long, slender fish found throughout the tropical and temperate oceans of the world. The Atlantic, East Pacific and Northwest Pacific populations are also known as Atlantic cutlassfish, Pacific cutlassfish and Japanese cutlassfish, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Largehead</b> <b>hairtails</b> {{can grow}} to 2.34 m in length, {{although}} most only are 1 m. The largest recorded weight is 5 kg {{and the oldest}} recorded age is 15 years. They prefer coastal regions and sometimes enter estuaries. They are found at depths of 0 to 589 m with most records between 100 and 350 m.|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{increasing}} population of giant jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai has negatively affected coastal fisheries in Korea. As a result, {{the fishing industry}} has begun developing devices to prevent jellyfish capture. In this study, we assessed {{the performance of a}} conical jellyfish exclusion device in the coastal areas of Yokji Island in southern Korea during 2009. After hauling, we measured the length, diameter, and weight of the jellyfish and fish that were captured by the cod end and cover net. We found that the captured species included N. nomurai, silver croakers Pennahia argentata, yellow croakers Larimichthys polyactics, shotted halibut Eopsetta grigorjewi, <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtails</b> Trichiurus lepturus, and melon seeds Psenopsis anomala. The catch ratios of the giant jellyfish that entered the cod end in terms of weight ranged from 0. 005 to 0. 027. In contrast, the catch ratios of total fish in terms of weight and number were 0. 793 and 0. 835, respectively. On selectivity analysis of a conical separator for individual fish species, their exclusion ratios were independent of their length, and were similar to their observed exclusion ratios in terms of number. These results indicated that the conical jellyfish exclusion device performs well; however, some improvements are needed to minimize the escape of fish from the net...|$|R
50|$|A flower {{festival is}} held at Yudal {{mountain}} every April and May. The festival of <b>Largehead</b> <b>Hairtail</b> (in Hangul:목포사랑은빛갈치축제) takes place around Yeongsan Lake every October. The festival is extremely popular among fishing fans and family tourists. A fishing contest is held, wherein great {{numbers of people}} take part, which {{is followed by a}} fireworks display.|$|E
50|$|<b>Largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> {{is a major}} {{commercial}} species. With reported landings of {{more than}} 1.3 million tonnes in 2009, it was the 6th most important capture fish species. By far the largest catches were reported by China (1.2 million tonnes) from the NW Pacific (FAO Fishing Area 61); other countries reporting significant catches were South Korea, Japan, and Pakistan.|$|E
5000|$|The Seto area {{produces}} vegetables {{such as the}} bright-purple kintarō potato, {{and also}} catches baby sardines called chirimen (ちりめん). Misaki has a strong fishing tradition, producing lots of horse mackerel (aji) and mackerel (saba). Four Misaki Fishing Co-op products {{are part of the}} Ehime [...] "With Love" [...] ("Ai" [...] aru) brand: [...] Horse mackerel, mackerel, <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> (tachiuo), and abalone (awabi).|$|E
50|$|Água de Pau's {{principal}} festival {{occurs on}} the assumption day of Nossa Senhora dos Anjos aos Céus, on August 15: the second oldest religious festival {{on the island of}} São Miguel. Locals and tourists participate in the event, that includes promessas, petitions to the Virgin Mary and prayers of thanksgiving. A traditional procession runs through the streets of the villa, showing the devotion and faith of the local community. In the following weekend, the traditional Festa do Pescador (Fisherman's Festival) in the seaside resort of Caloura is celebrated. In addition to music and traditional choruses, the popular local cuisine is celebrated with fried <b>Largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> and mackerel, washed-down with local red wine and accompanied with corn bread. The feast day of Nossa Senhora das Dores is also widely celebrated, on the second or third Sunday in September.|$|E
5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10700000 t. [...] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, <b>Largehead</b> <b>hairtail,</b> and Yellowfin tuna. [...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|E
50|$|In {{coastal waters}} along the North American eastern seaboard, little tunny are carnivorous, and {{primarily}} feed on small fish and invertebrates {{that occur in}} schools. Its diet consists mostly of fish; it particularly likes the Atlantic bigeye and <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail.</b> Second to fish, the little tunny consumes crustaceans, and lastly cephalopods and gastropods make up {{a small part of}} its diet. Sardines, scad, and anchovies are common in the diet along with squid, stomatopods, and organisms from the Diogenidae family. The diet of the fish is also relative to its size. A smaller fish's diet typically consists of clupeiforms, and larvae, while the larger fish mostly eat Maurolicus muelleri. The typical diet is very {{similar to that of the}} king mackerel because the fish are of a similar size and live in the same area of the water column. It mostly feeds on pelagic fish. The little tunny is an opportunistic predator, feeding on crustaceans, clupeid fishes, squids, and tunicates. Its diet also responds to seasonal changes in food availability. It has nocturnal feeding habits, and is a specialist feeder. It often feeds on herring and sardines in inshore waters near the surface of the water. The little tunny commonly feeds in large schools because their primary food sources (small fish and the larval forms of crustaceans) are typically in schools, as well.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{nematode}} species {{belonging to}} genus Anisakis occur at their third larval stage in numerous marine teleost fish species worldwide and {{known to cause}} accidental human infection through the ingestion of raw or undercooked fish or squids. They may also draw the attention of consumers because of the visual impact of both alive and dead worms. Therefore, the information on their geographical distribution and clear species identification is important for epidemiological survey and further prevention of human infection. Results For identification of anisakid nematodes species isolated from <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> (Trichiurus japonicus), polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of internal transcribed spacers of ribosomal DNA were conducted. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 gene was also sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was conducted. From the <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> (n[*]=[*] 9), 1259 nematodes were isolated in total. Most of the nematodes were found encapsulated throughout the viscera (56. 2  %, 708 / 1259) or moving freely in the body cavity (41. 5  %, 523 / 1259), and only 0. 3  % (4 / 1259) {{was found in the}} muscles. By PCR-RFLP, three different nematode species were identified. Anisakis pegreffii was the most dominantly found (98. 7  %, 1243 / 1259) from the <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail,</b> occupying 98. 7  % (699 / 708) of the nematodes in the mesenteries and 98. 1  % (513 / 523) in the body cavity. Hybrid genotype (Anisakis simplex × A. pegreffii) occupied 0. 5  %, and Hysterothylacium sp. occupied 0. 2  % of the nematodes isolated in this study. Conclusions The <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> may not significantly contribute accidental human infection of anisakid nematode third stage larvae because most of the nematodes were found from the viscera or body cavity, which are not consumed raw. But, a high prevalence of anisakid nematode larvae in the <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> is still in concern because they may raise food safety problems to consumers. Immediate evisceration or freezing of fish after catch will be necessary before consumption...|$|E
40|$|The ribbonfishes {{belonging}} to the family Trichiuridae is a major fishery resource of India. Three species under the genus Trichiurus namely T. lepturus, T. auriga and T. gangeticus are reported from India. Of these, the <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> T. lepturus commonly grows to 100 cm in size and has high market demand. T. auriga (Pearly hairtail) is a small sized species (maximum size < 40 cm) and reported to occur in huge shoals in the upper slope regions. With little market demand for consumption due to its small size, whenever caught they {{are most likely to}} be diverted to fish meal plants. There is wide spread concern on the large scale capture of juvenile fishes which adversely affects the resources...|$|E
40|$|Researchers at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) have {{identified}} a species of ribbonfish, which grows only up to 35 cm, as the ones being mistaken for fish juveniles by conservation activists and fishermen for the commercially important trichiurus lepturus, commonly called the <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail,</b> which can grow up to a size of 235 cm. The large volume of the catch of the smaller ribbon fish trichiurus auriga, called pearly hairtail, was reported {{off the coast of}} Thiruvananthapuram at a depth of 285 metres, the CMFRI report said. Around 10 tonnes of the smaller ribbon fish variety was caught in an expedition by ‗Sagar Sampada‘ of the CMFRI in early December 2014...|$|E
40|$|Ribbonfish fishery along Karnataka Coast is {{supported}} by a single species, the <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> Trichiurus lepturus. The species is exploited mainly by trawls and gillnets and during 2007 - 2012, production from Karnataka fluctuated between 11090 and 28845 t. The asymptotic length (L∞), growth coefficient (K) and age at zero length (t 0) for T. lepturus were estimated as 116. 75, 0. 65 yr- 1 and - 0. 171 respectively. Recruitment showed a bimodal pattern with peaks during March to June and August to December. Total mortality, fishing mortality and natural mortality were estimated at 3. 32 yr- 1, 2. 41 yr- 1 and 0. 91 yr- 1 respectively.

30|$|The main {{marine species}} in {{worldwide}} capture over years were {{the families of}} Gardidae (Alaska Pollock, Atlantic Cod, Blue Whiting, Pacific Cod), Engraulidae (Anchoveta, Japaneese Anchovy), Scombridae (Skipjack Tuna, Chub Mackerel, Yellowfish Tuna, Atlantic Mackerel, Seerfishes Nei), Clupeidae (Sardinellas Nei, Atlantic Herring, European Pilchard, Araucanian Herring, European Sprat, Pacific Herring), Carangidae (Scads Nei), Trichiuridae (<b>Largehead</b> <b>Hairtail),</b> Ommastrephidae (Humboldt Squid, Argentine Shortfin Squid), Nemipteridae (Threadfin Breams Nei), Scomberesocidae (Pacific Saury), Portunidae (Gazami Crab), Akiami Paste Shrimp (FAO 2016). Worldwide, the most important fish families farmed in aquaculture are Cyprinidae (Carp), Salmonidae (Salmon, Trout), Serranidae (Seabass), Acipenseridae (Sturgeon), Scophthalmidae (Turbot), Sparidae (Sea Bream), Mytilidae (Mussels), Ostreidae (Oysters) and some families of clams (European Comission 2012). Thus, due to the abundance of aforeisaid species in worldwide fishing production, an attention must be paid on better utilization of a big amount of by-products rested after their processing.|$|E
40|$|In {{the period}} 2001 - 2004 four bottom trawl surveys {{were carried out}} in the Gulf of Tonkin to {{investigate}} the aquatic stocks in the Vietnamese sector (67, 370 km 2). The Gulf has tropical characteristics and great diversity of commercial species, but lately fishing pressure seems to have grown excessively. The swept-area cruises followed a stratified random design, with a fixed station grid imposed on four depth intervals between 0 and 100 m, and internationally accepted survey protocols. Three commercially important indicator species which differ in life-history and habit were selected for appraisal using commonly accepted single-species metrics. The methodology for data treatment included spatial statistics (kriging) to describe seasonal trends in distribution, and non-parametric re-sampling (bootstrapping) of station data combined with maximum likelihood analysis of maturation curves to estimate both total and spawning standing biomass. Chinese squid (Loligo chinensis Gray 1849), a small pelagic resource with very high turnover rate, showed a marked decline in standing biomass, from 16, 000 tones in 2001 to 3, 000 tones in 2004 (CV 27 - 14 %). Remarkably, spawning biomass remained at stable 1, 000 tones, and large squid (13 cm ML and above) dominate the population. The Greater lizardfish (Saurida tumbil (Bloch, 1795)), a very valuable, and slow growing, demersal species, showed stable levels of total biomass, at around 3, 000 to 5, 000 tones (CV 13 - 25 %). However, spawning biomass showed a marked 22 % decline to 732 tones in 2004, despite a decrease in the maturation size, which might be a compensatory mechanism. Simultaneously, most of the stock was comprised of fish in the 11 - 24 cm range, and this is a marked constriction from the original 5 - 35 cm range. The <b>Largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> (Trichiurus lepturus Linaeus, 1785), a large pelagic, has become the major commercial pelagic species in the South China Sea. In the Gulf the total biomass declined from 3, 600 to 2, 600 tones (CV 24 - 29 %), but a highly unreliable estimate (CV 50 %) raises it to 15000 tones in 2004. The estimates of spawning biomass showed equal development, varying from 2, 500 tones in 2001 to 1, 500 tones in 2003, and raising to 4, 000 tones in 2004. <b>Largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> also shows a marked constriction of sizes in 2004, and the largest sizes are now about 1 / 3 of L∞. Although the squid showed a permanent coastal affinity (20 - 30 m deep) and is exposed to the extremely large and un-controlled coastal fleet year round, it seems to have the best potential for recovery. The <b>Largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> and the Greater lizardfish showed coastal affinity during the NE monsoon but moved to offshore grounds in the SW monsoon. Management of these transboundary populations is not sole responsibility of Vietnam and requires co-ordination with China in the South China Sea...|$|E
40|$|We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the genetic variability of <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail</b> (Trichiurus japonicus) in the western North Pacific {{for the purpose of}} determining natural management units applicable to the fisheries regulation and ecological conservation. To achieve this, we analyzed two homologous segments in each fish's mitochondrial DNA using the AMOVA statistical model. In total, 180 DNA samples were collected from the continental shelves of Japan, the Yellow Sea (YS), the East China Seas (ECS), the Taiwan Strait (TS), and the South China Sea (SCS). In general, the haplotype diversity in the Cyt-b gene and D-loop region was high (> 0. 92), while the nucleotide diversity was moderate (< 0. 011). Our AMOVA model showed statistically significant genetic difference between the SCS and pan-ECS (Japan+YS+ECS+TS) populations. These subpopulations likely diverged {{as a result of the}} last geological sea-level recession event that created an outcrop within the Taiwan Strait, closing the waterway and gene flows between the ECS and SCS populations. Currently, sedentary life, limited dispersal ability, and modern monsoon-influenced marine flow patterns are the major forces that maintain the separation of these two hairtail populations. Our results support the creation of two independent management units for Trichiurus japonicus in the East China Sea and the South China Sea to protect the diversity of this species...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in three communities of artisanal fishermen from Ilhabela, located on the northern coast of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The objective was to analyze the preferences, taboos and medicinal indications of fish and thus representing one of the interactions of fishermen with fish stocks. Data collection was conducted through interviews with the aid of semi-structured questionnaires. We interviewed 25 families, 29 residents in three communities studied during our fieldwork for data collection. Five interviews were done in Jabaquara Beach, 6 in Fome Beach and 14 Serraria Beach. During the interviews, 18 species were cited as preferred for consumption, 11 species considered to be taboo (food prohibited), 5 species were cited as avoided as food, and 4 species indicated in case of illness. The families of fishermen prefer to consume finfish and do not consume puffer fish, the latter probably due to its toxic characteristic. Fish such as little tunny, <b>largehead</b> <b>hairtail,</b> shark, serra mackerel and king mackerel are avoided by unhealthy people and in cases of wounds, inflammation, pregnancy and postpartum. Other fish, such as sea chubs, silver porgy, bluefish and grouper are reported as medicinal in these situations. Aspects related to fish consumption are part of the knowledge of fishermen and their families and provide a wealth of information that combined to biological information is useful for the conservation of fishery resources. Data such as those presented in this study, regarding the use of aquatic animals for treatment of diseases, could serve as a basis for future studies on substances that contain active elements in curing diseases...|$|E
