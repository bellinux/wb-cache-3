40|$|Secret {{evidence}} is evidence introduced in closed proceedings {{to which the}} individual (and the public) is denied access. In its first Charkaoui decision, in 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada confronted a number of dilemmas arising from the employment of secret {{evidence to support the}} executive’s claims against an individual in security certificate proceedings. It is argued here that, although the Court’s reasons recognized and sought to address major limitations arising from the absence of the individual from closed proceedings, they do not adequately address other weaknesses of adjudication in the face of secret evidence. In particular, the Court’s reasons do not convey sufficient concern for (1) the dependency of the judge and special advocates on the executive for access to the underlying record of the investigation; and (2) the pre-eminence of the executive’s institutionalized expertise in matters of national security confidentiality. This argument is presented by way of an examination <b>of</b> broader <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> at which secret {{evidence is}} used. The Court’s second Charkaoui decision, in 2008, is examined in a postscript to the paper. It is argued that in that decision the Court acknowledges much more clearly, and take steps to address, adjudicative limitations arising from the court’s dependency on the executive in closed proceedings involving secret evidence that originates in the investigative activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service...|$|R

In Moise I, the court had confirmed the declaration of invalidity by a High Court of section 2(1)(a) <b>of</b> the <b>Limitation</b> <b>of</b> Legal <b>Proceedings</b> (Provincial and Local Authorities) Act. The point made by the applicants in Moise II was that the Limitation Act was pre-constitutional legislation. It was found by the High Court to be a violation of the right of access to court in s 34 of the 1996 Constitution. Section 22 of the interim Constitution also contained a right of access to court in all relevant respects identical to the one in s 34: “One would therefore have expected, in the light of the Prince decision, that the subsection had become invalid at the moment of commencement of the interim Constitution.” ...|$|R

To this end, this study investigates and analyses the impact that the evidential <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> atrocity crimes cases have on the roles of the participants in criminal proceedings in ensuring accuracy of fact-finding and fairness <b>of</b> <b>proceedings.</b> It also looks into whether there is a recurrent theme underlying the changes that the practice of Dutch criminal procedure has undergone in the course of adjudicating atrocity crimes. Moreover, this study assesses whether the adjustments that were made {{to the practice of}} Dutch criminal procedure have enabled trial courts to ensure fairness <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> and conduct accurate fact-finding in atrocity crimes cases. The central research question is: Which adjustments have Dutch courts made to national criminal procedure in order to overcome the evidential limitations, and have they thereby succeeded in ensuring fairness <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> and conducting accurate fact-finding in atrocity crimes cases? This study is divided into two parts. Part I addresses the relevance of the case law of the ECtHR with respect to the right to confrontation for the evaluation of witness evidence in criminal proceedings, analyses the way in which Dutch courts have gone about guaranteeing the right to confrontation in the Dutch legal order and examines the approach to evaluating witness evidence in atrocity crimes cases in light of the right to confrontation.

40|$|RÉSUMÉ IN ENGLISH The {{topic of}} this master thesis is the {{principle}} of promptness in the criminal proceedings because this question is nowadays the subject-matter of numerous discussions, {{in which it is}} spoken about overloaded Czech justice system, about delays in court proceedings and about options, how to relieve the system of Czech criminal justice system. The aim of the submitted thesis is to evaluate critically the current legal institutes helping to make the criminal proceedings faster, mainly the investigation of crimes, and to contemplate its potential extension, without having caused any more significant <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> the right of the accused to defence. Among other principles, which stay often contrary to the principle of promptness and which the legislators always must bear in mind, are the principle of material truth and the principle of contradiction. The thesis is divided into seven basic chapters. The first chapter is the introduction. The second chapter deals with the meaning of promptness <b>of</b> criminal <b>proceedings</b> for each particular subject <b>of</b> the criminal <b>proceedings,</b> mainly for the accused and the injured party.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with "concentration of proceedings" and its limits. Concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{is a means of}} ensuring expeditious, economical and effective civil process. In Czech law, it applies in particular in the contentious <b>proceedings.</b> Concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> is closely related to the principle of concentration which one of the general principles of civil law procedure, and is opposed to the principle of unitary process. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> may take place at several points in time in the process in connection {{with the end of the}} preparatory meeting, of the first hearing and the announcement of the first instance judicial ruling. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> is necessarily interconnected with the "principle of partial appelation" which applies in appeal proceedings against first instance judicial rulings under the Act. No. 99 / 1963 Coll., civil procedure act, as amended. The application of the concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> also relates to the concept of "qualified call for response". In fact, it is not uncommon that the functioning <b>of</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> is misunderstood, including by the courts themselves who often misapply the relevant provisions of the civil procedure act with the view of avoiding concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings.</b> In my practical [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In past {{writings}} {{and in an}} upcoming article by Professor Bryan Camp, The Problem of Adversarial Process in the Administrative State, 83 IND. L. J. ### (2008), Professor Camp criticizes the procedural protections Congress added in the tax collection process, noting the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> adversary <b>proceedings</b> in the IRS’s tax collection process. In particular, Professor Camp strongly criticizes the collection due process (CDP) rights {{that were part of}} the landmark IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. Given the size of the tax gap, and likely increasing calls for the IRS {{to do a better job}} in reducing that tax gap in light of budget deficits, the question of considering the appropriate use of agency resources is particularly relevant. While much of Professor Camp’s argument is persuasive, it comes up short both as a descriptive and prescriptive model. Unquestionably, the IRS’s collection process borrows heavily from inquisitorial models of agency action, and given the information asymmetry between the IRS and taxpayers themselves, the agency faces heavy obstacles to consider whether delinquent taxpayers are shirking their responsibilities or are genuinely facing financial hardship and are unable to pay what is due and assessed. But those insights are not sufficient to explain the dynamics of the entire collection process, which is best thought of as involving a range of interests meriting differing levels of procedural protection and personal IRS intervention. In this response, I situate IRS collection determinations within the broader landscape of administrative law, highlight the principles that administrative law scholars have emphasized in considering what is fair agency practice, and apply those principles to the collection context. I conclude that Professor Camp rightfully highlights some of CDP’s problems, but misses its benefits and thus fails in prescribing the repeal of CDP. Yet, Professor Camp’s article is a significant achievement for those considering tax collection. Its targeting of CDP’s shortfalls highlights some of the problems of the legislative process, and allows us to consider how Congress and the IRS can improve collection rights and protect individual interests without sacrificing essential efficiency concerns associated with collecting taxes...|$|R
