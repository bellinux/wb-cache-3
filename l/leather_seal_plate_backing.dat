50|$|However Brunel was {{concerned}} about the efficiency of available steam locomotives, and he had been interested in the 1840 demonstration of the atmospheric system at Wormwood Scrubs. The system is fully described in the article Atmospheric railway and in the technical section below. Briefly, it involves a pipe laid between the running rails, and stationary steam engines located at intervals of a few miles along the line; they exhaust air from the pipe, forming a partial vacuum. A piston carriage is placed at the head of each train, and it carries a piston which travels in the tube. The tube is slotted at the top to enable the piston bracket to pass, and a continuous <b>leather</b> <b>seal</b> prevents unwanted admission of air. With a partial vacuum in the pipe ahead of the piston, the pressure of the atmosphere behind it drives it forward, drawing the train. The <b>leather</b> <b>seal</b> is opened by rollers immediately ahead of the bracket carrying the piston, and closed immediately behind it.|$|R

40|$|The {{narrow channel}} (NC) {{facility}} design {{is based on}} the GALCIT Detonation Tube (GDT) test section design of Mike Kaneshige [3]. The main differences are 1) the design of the longitudinal bolted joint was simplified and 2) the keys for the flanges are not designed to assist with shear loading. The GDT side windows and PLIF window may be used in the NC facility. 304 SS was chosen for its excellent corrosion resistance. The yield strength is 275 MPa. 304 SS is non-magnetic and is therefore more difficult to grind on a table with magnetic locking. All four plates were blanchard ground (using mechanical locking to the table through some of the bolt holes which were drilled before grinding) by a subcontractor for Hales. All pieces were machined by Hales except the initiator, window <b>sealing</b> <b>plates,</b> end flange <b>sealing</b> <b>plates</b> which were made by the Aeroshop. Hales also supplied the material and checked the assembly of the pieces. After delivery from Hales, the internal surfaces of the four channel plates were hand-sanded to a mirror finish...|$|R
