The answers from this study are as follows: as an industry, managers failed to achieve returns proportionate to the market portfolio for the period 1991 through 1999 on a risk-adjusted basis.

50|$|The Bormina is an {{indigenous}} breed of domestic goat from the Valtellina, {{in the northern}} part of the province of Sondrio, in Lombardy in northern Italy. It is particularly associated with the area of the comune of Bormio, from which its name derives. Because of the reddish colour of its coat and its clear Swiss markings (frisature, white stripes on the face, white legs, belly and peri-anal area), it may also be call the Frisa Rossa. It is raised mainly in the Valtellina but is also reported from the Lario and from the area of Varese.

Autonomous groups functioning at the <b>lowest</b> <b>management</b> levels in companies and characterized with a big independence in their activity are a good example of properly understood humanization of work. Their activity counteracts negative socio-psychological effects resulting from excessive atomization of labour division. Autonomous groups are an example of expanding, enriching, and thus Improving quaiity of work. The author formulates the concept of autonomous group, characterizes factors in favour of group organization of work, and points at a relationship between the type of technical-organizational system and a possibility of establishing autonomous working teams. The article ends with presentation of a model group accompanied by discussion of the scope of its independence and responsibility.
