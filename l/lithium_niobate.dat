5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E

The preferential Li+-ion diffusion along the b-direction is assisted by line-defects, which are observed to be higher in concentration along the b-direction compared to the a-and c-directions, as revealed by high resolution electron microscopy. The Li-Ti niobate can be cycled to low voltages (approximate to 0. 2 V) and show stable and satisfactory battery performance over 100 cycles.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the one-step hydrothermal crystallisation of <b>lithium</b> <b>niobates</b> reveals that reaction between Nb 2 O 5 and aqueous LiOH at 240 degrees C yields materials with a disordered rock-salt structure where the metals are statistically distributed over the cation sites. This contrasts with the well-studied reaction between Nb 2 O 5 and NaOH or KOH that produces ANbO(3) (A = Na, K) perovskites. Powder neutron diffraction shows that materials prepared at short reaction times and lower LiOH concentration (2. 5 M) are lithium deficient and have a slight excess of niobium, but that at longer periods of reaction in 5 M LiOH, close to the ideal, stoichiometric Li 0. 75 Nb 0. 25 O composition is produced. Upon annealing this phase cleanly transforms into the known ordered rock-salt material Li 3 NbO 4, a process we have followed using thermodiffractometry, which indicates that transformation begins at similar to 700 degrees C. Solid-state Nb- 93 and Li- 7 NMR of the disordered and ordered rock-salt phases shows that both contain single metal sites but there is clear evidence for local disorder in the disordered samples.

Lead-free {{piezoelectric}} ceramics <b>lithium</b> sodium potassium <b>niobate</b> (LixNayK 1 -x-y) NbO 3 (LNKN 100 x/ 100 y) {{have been}} synthesized by a conventional solid state process. The effects of MnO 2 addition on {{the properties of}} (LixNayK 1 -x-y) NbO 3 (x= 0. 06, y= 0. 5) (LNKN 6 / 50) ceramics were investigated.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the physical and}} photorefractive properties of potassium <b>lithium</b> tantalate <b>niobate</b> (KLTN) single crystal material. The top seeded solution growth method is reviewed. The phase transition temperatures and dielectric properties {{are related to the}} compositions of the KLTN crystals. A liquid/solid interface dynamics model is introduced to explain the experimental results which is that hydrogen ion concentration in KLTN crystals can be reduced dramatically by doping copper in the absence of titanium. Dark conductivity of KLTN crystals are contributed by two species when the temperature is in the range of 250 K and 350 K. Two species are hydrogen ions and shallow trapped electrons (holes). These results have been confirmed by direct dc conductivity measurements and holograms fixing experiments. Hydrogen ion has two types of motion in the crystals: O-H vibration and O-H libration. We established a model to describe hydrogen ions motions and hopping in KLTN crystals. The theoretical prediction is in agreement with experimental results. Hologram thermal fixing for optical data storage is discussed. Hydrogen ions are identified as the mobile ion which is responsible for thermal fixing. In ferroelectric phase KLTN crystals, spontaneous polarization of individual microdomains can be aligned throughout the entire crystal by the poling process. Photorefractive space charge fields play a role deploing the microdomains wherever space charge field opposing to spontaneous polarization. This may cause microdomain switching and lead to the generation of index grating. Experimental observation of Barkhausen current jumps is the signature of domain inversion. Holograms thermal fixing in potassium niobate crystals are also investigated. Because potassium niobate crystal has an orthognal structure with space group mm 2, 3 D polarization dependence of OH bands are observed. A special cut of iron doped potassium niobate crystal was designed to achieve the maximum exponential gain coefficient for thermal fixing of volume holograms. A significant enhancement of diffraction efficiency of the fixed grating 43 % is measured. The last part of this thesis discussed topological distribution of phase matching of three-wave mixing in biaxial crystals. Thirty possible distributions are illustrated. The optimum operating directions under phase matching condition in biaxial crystal can be obtained from the calculation of the effective nonlinear coefficients. A set of analytical expressions of effective nonlinear optical coefficient for the crystals with mm 2 point group is given. The phase matching directions are in either x, y, or z plane in order to obtain maximum coefficient...|$|R
