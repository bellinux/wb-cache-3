50|$|Like its predecessor, the Caux Grand Hotel, the Caux Palace Hotel {{was blessed}} with instant success. Visitors {{included}} celebrities such as Sacha Guitry, Paul Morand, Romain Rolland, Edgar Wallace, prince Ibn Saud, future king of Saudi Arabia, John D. Rockefeller and the maharajah of Baroda. The latter stayed frequently in Caux, using {{most of the}} fourth floor. His personal room at the south-west angle of the building enjoyed an outstanding view and was furbished in <b>lemon-tree</b> wood furniture, especially designed for the maharajah. This exceptional furniture and the initial decoration of this room have been preserved to this day.|$|E
40|$|Module network {{inference}} is {{an established}} statistical method to reconstruct co-expression modules and their upstream regulatory programs from integrated multi-omics datasets mea-suring the activity levels of various cellular components across different individuals, experi-mental conditions or time points of a dynamic process. We have developed <b>Lemon-Tree,</b> an open-source, platform-independent, modular, extensible software package implement-ing state-of-the-art ensemble methods for module network inference. We benchmarked <b>Lemon-Tree</b> using large-scale tumor datasets {{and showed that}} <b>Lemon-Tree</b> algorithms compare favorably with state-of-the-art module network inference software. We also ana-lyzed a large dataset of somatic copy-number alterations and gene expression levels mea-sured in glioblastoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and found that <b>Lemon-Tree</b> correctly identifies known glioblastoma oncogenes and tumor suppressors as master regu-lators in the inferred module network.

60|$|Having {{reached the}} open country outside the walls, they walked along a {{beautiful}} road, from which were obtained {{here and there}} splendid views of the surrounding country. On one side lay the blue Mediterranean, with its picturesque boats and shipping, and the white city descending to {{the very edge of}} the sea; on the other side rose the wooded slopes of a suburb named Mustapha, with numerous white Moorish houses in the midst of luxuriant gardens, where palms, bananas, cypresses, aloes, <b>lemon-trees,</b> and orange groves perfumed the balmy air, and afforded grateful shade from the glare of the African sun.|$|R
60|$|The air was exquisitely {{soft and}} warm, and sweet with the perfume {{of the orange}} bowers. I passed through the marble portal, adorned with some florid yet skilful sculptures, and found myself in a verdant {{wilderness}} of fruit-trees, rising in rich confusion from the turf, through which not a single path seemed to wander. There were vast groups of orange and <b>lemon-trees,</b> varied occasionally with the huge offspring of the citron-tree, and the glowing produce of the pomegranate; while, ever and anon, the tall banana raised its head aloft with its green or golden clusters, and sometimes the graceful and languid crest of the date-bearing palm.|$|R

And, for a lighter pastime, it shall be a duty and a pleasing sport to wander with Momus beneath the tropic stars where Melpomene once stalked austere. Now to cause laughter to echo from those lavish jungles and frowning crags where formerly rang the cries of pirates' victims; to lay aside pike and cutlass and attack with quip and jollity; to draw one saving titter of mirth from the rusty casque of Romance--this were pleasant {{to do in the}} shade of the <b>lemon-trees</b> on that coast that is curved like lips set for smiling.|$|R

40|$|Background: Obesity is {{a complex}} {{metabolic}} condition in strong association with various diseases, like type 2 diabetes, resulting in major public health and economic implications. Obesity {{is the result of}} environmental and genetic factors and their interactions, including genome-wide genetic interactions. Identification of co-expressed and regulatory genes in RNA extracted from relevant tissues representing lean and obese individuals provides an entry point for the identification of genes and pathways of importance to the development of obesity. The pig, an omnivorous animal, is an excellent model for human obesity, offering the possibility to study in-depth organ-level transcriptomic regulations of obesity, unfeasible in humans. Our aim was to reveal adipose tissue co-expression networks, pathways and transcriptional regulations of obesity using RNA Sequencing based systems biology approaches in a porcine model. Methods: We selected 36 animals for RNA Sequencing from a previously created F 2 pig population representing three extreme groups based on their predicted genetic risks for obesity. We applied Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to detect clusters of highly co-expressed genes (modules). Additionally, regulator genes were detected using <b>Lemon-Tree</b> algorithms. Results: WGCNA revealed five modules which were strongly correlated with at least one obesity-related phenotype (correlations ranging from - 0. 54 to 0. 72, P < 0. 001). Functional annotation identified pathways enlightening the association between obesity and other diseases, like osteoporosis (osteoclast differentiation, P = 1. 4 E(- 7)), and immune-related complications (e. g. Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxity, P = 3. 8 E(- 5); B cell receptor signaling pathway, P = 7. 2 E(- 5)). <b>Lemon-Tree</b> identified three potential regulator genes, using confident scores, for the WGCNA module which was associated with osteoclast differentiation: CCR 1, MSR 1 and SI 1 (probability scores respectively 95. 30, 62. 28, and 34. 58). Moreover, detection of differentially connected genes identified various genes previously identified to be associated with obesity in humans and rodents, e. g. CSF 1 R and MARC 2. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply systems biology approaches using porcine adipose tissue RNA-Sequencing data in a genetically characterized porcine model for obesity. We revealed complex networks, pathways, candidate and regulatory genes related to obesity, confirming the complexity of obesity and its association with immune-related disorders and osteoporosis...|$|E

"During {{our stay}} at Athens," [...] writes Hobhouse ('Travels in Albania, [...] etc.', vol. i. pp. 242, 243), [...] "we {{occupied}} two houses separated from [...] each other {{only by a}} single wall, through which we opened a doorway. [...] One of them belongs to a Greek lady, whose name is Theodora Macri, the [...] daughter of the late English Vice-Consul, and who has to show many [...] letters of recommendation left in her hands by several English [...] travellers. Her lodgings consisted of a sitting-room and two bedrooms, [...] opening into a court-yard where there were five or six <b>lemon-trees,</b> [...] from which, during our residence in the place, was plucked the fruit [...] that seasoned the pilaf and other national dishes served up at our [...] frugal table." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{stands on}} a height {{within the walls of}} Genoa, but aloof from the town: {{surrounded}} by beautiful gardens of its own, adorned with statues, vases, fountains, marble basins, terraces, walks of orange-trees and <b>lemon-trees,</b> groves of roses and camellias. All its apartments are beautiful in their proportions and decorations; but the great hall, some fifty feet in height, with three large windows at the end, overlooking the whole town of Genoa, the harbour, and the neighbouring sea, affords one of the most fascinating and delightful prospects in the world. Any house more cheerful and habitable than the great rooms are, within, {{it would be difficult to}} conceive; and certainly nothing more delicious than the scene without, in sunshine or in moonlight, could be imagined. It is more like an enchanted place in an Eastern story than a grave and sober lodging.|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} of a few hours great numbers of wounded persons, young and old, were laid under the <b>lemon-trees</b> by the banks of the little stream that traversed the town. Some were {{slightly}} hurt, but by far the greater number were terribly crushed and lacerated--many of them past all hope of recovery. To these sufferers Will Osten now gave his undivided attention, washing and bandaging wounds, amputating limbs, and endeavouring by every means to relieve them, and save their lives, while to the dying he tried, in the little Spanish he knew, to convey words of spiritual comfort, sometimes finding it impossible to do more than whisper the name of Jesus in a dying ear, while hurriedly passing from one to another. If earnest heart-expressive glances from eyes that were slowly fading conveyed any evidence of good having been done, Will's labour of love was not spent in vain.|$|R
60|$|The gabion was ours. After two hours' {{fighting}} we were {{in possession}} of the first embrasure, and made ourselves as comfortable as circumstances would admit. Jack Delamere, Tom Delancy, Jerry Blake, the Doctor, and myself, sat down under a pontoon, and our servants laid out a hasty supper on a tumbrel. Though Cambaceres had escaped me so provokingly after I cut him down, his spoils were mine; a cold fowl and a Bologna sausage {{were found in the}} Marshal's holsters; and in the haversack of a French private who lay a corpse on the glacis, we found a loaf of bread, his three days' ration. Instead of salt, we had gunpowder; and you may be sure, wherever the Doctor was, a flask of good brandy was behind him in his instrument-case. We sat down and made a soldier's supper. The Doctor pulled a few of the delicious fruit from the <b>lemon-trees</b> growing near (and round which the Carabineers and the 24th Leger had made a desperate rally), and punch was brewed in Jack Delamere's helmet.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} two hours were whiled away the consul tired of reading. The papers lay {{scattered}} about {{him on the}} gallery. Reclining there, he gazed dreamily out upon an Eden. A clump of banana plants interposed their broad shields {{between him and the}} sun. The gentle slope from the consulate to the sea was covered with the dark-green foliage of <b>lemon-trees</b> and orange-trees just bursting into bloom. A lagoon pierced the land like a dark, jagged crystal, and above it a pale ceiba-tree rose almost to the clouds. The waving cocoanut palms on the beach flared their decorative green leaves against the slate of an almost quiescent sea. His senses were cognizant of brilliant scarlet and ochres amid the vert of the coppice, of odours of fruit and bloom and the smoke from Chanca's clay oven under the calabash-tree; of the treble laughter of the native women in their huts, the song of the robin, the salt taste of the breeze, the diminuendo of the faint surf running along the shore--and, gradually, of a white speck, growing to a blur, that intruded itself upon the drab prospect of the sea.|$|R
60|$|While we {{were looking}} at these works Miss M------ {{unexpectedly}} joined us, and we went, all three together, to the Rospigliosi Palace, in the Piazza di Monte Cavallo. A porter, in cocked hat, and with a staff of office, admitted us into a spacious court before the palace, and directed us to a garden on one side, raised as much as twenty feet above the level on which we stood. The gardener opened the gate for us, and we ascended a beautiful stone staircase, with a carved balustrade, bearing many marks of time and weather. Reaching the garden-level, we found it laid out in walks, bordered with box and ornamental shrubbery, amid which were <b>lemon-trees,</b> and one large old exotic from some distant clime. In the centre of the garden, surrounded by a stone balustrade, like that of the staircase, was a fish-pond, into which several jets of water were continually spouting; and on pedestals, that made part of the balusters, stood eight marble statues of Apollo, Cupid, nymphs, and other such sunny and beautiful people of classic mythology. There had been many more of these statues, but the rest had disappeared, and those which remained had suffered grievous damage, here to a nose, there to a hand or foot, and often a fracture of the body, very imperfectly mended. There was a pleasant sunshine in the garden, and a springlike, or rather a genial, autumnal atmosphere, though elsewhere it was a day of poisonous Roman chill.|$|R
6000|$|Another {{and more}} serious {{difficulty}} {{in determining the}} rank of the several forms is that, according to Gallesio (10/16. 'Teoria della Riproduzione' page 53.) they largely intercross without artificial aid; thus he positively states that seeds taken from <b>lemon-trees</b> (C. lemonum) growing mingled with the citron (C. medica), which is generally considered as a distinct species, produced a graduated series of varieties between these two forms. Again, an Adam's apple was produced from the seed of a sweet orange, which grew close to lemons and citrons. But such facts hardly aid us in determining whether to rank these forms as species or varieties; for it is now known that undoubted species of Verbascum, Cistus, Primula, Salix, etc., frequently cross {{in a state of}} nature. If indeed it were proved that plants of the orange tribe raised from these crosses were even partially sterile, it would be a strong argument in favour of their rank as species. Gallesio asserts that this is the case; but he does not distinguish between sterility from hybridism and from the effects of culture; and he almost destroys the force of this statement by another (10/17. Gallesio 'Teoria della Riproduzione' page 69.) namely, that when he impregnated the flowers of the common orange with the pollen taken from undoubted VARIETIES of the orange, monstrous fruits were produced, which included [...] "little pulp, and had no seeds, or imperfect seeds." ...|$|R
5000|$|Goethe {{spent the}} night of 12 September at Torbole, and next morning earlystarted down the lake by boat. The {{description}} of this trip is contained in a letter dated"Malcesine, 13 September, in the evening:"This morning early, at three o'clock, I left Torbole with the rowers. At first the wind wasfavourable, {{so that they could}} use the sails. The morning was glorious, though cloudy,and quiet at sunrise. We rowed past Limone, whose hill gardens, laid out in ter-races andplanted with <b>lemon-trees,</b> presented a rich and neat appearance. The whole gar-denconsists of rows of square white pillars, which stand at regular distances from each otherand rise up the mountain slope in steps. Over these pillars strong beams are laid in orderduring the winter to cover the trees which are planted between. The observation andexamination of these pleasant objects was favoured by a slow trip, and so we hadalready passed Malcesine when the wind turned completely around, took its ordinarydirection by day and blew toward the north. Rowing was of little use against theoverwhelming power, and so we had to make a landing in the harbour of Malcesine. It isthe first Venetian place on {{the eastern side of the}} lake. When one has to do with water,one cannot say: ` To-day I shall be here or there.' This sojourn I shall employ as best Imay, especially in making a drawing of the castle which lies near the water and is abeautiful object. To-day in passing by I made a sketch of it." ...|$|R
