The work done can be divided into three separate stages, each of which is distinguished by the utilization of specific surveying tools. The first to be set up was GIS LUCA (Looking at an Urban Context Archive), where all the existing documentation on Roman Lucca was archived (maps, iconography, surveys, images, descriptive data). The information processed in LUCA provided data for the creation of the three-dimensional model of Roman Lucca, whereby the walls, main monuments and arteries, which still identify the town as Roman today, are represented in a schematic yet scientifically correct way. Additional experimentation was conducted as part of the research. Using an innovative three-dimensional relief technique, the ZScan, which enables cloud points to be taken from a photographic scan, three-dimensional models of the pillars of the eastern gate were elaborated, as well as three arches of the Roman amphitheatre that have been particularly well preserved. Lastly, the website www. luccaromana. com was created to publish the results that were obtained.

The set of Romance words representing the common heritage of this etymological base displays particular developments in terms of morphology and semantics, which are highlighted by the methods of comparative grammar. For example, the comparison between the Romance cognates leads to consider that the semantic shift from 'to seek for' to 'to want', which is already observable in some Latin texts for the verbe quaerĕre, must have been present in spoken language in the period preceding the appearance of Romance languages. Therefore, the article shows how the DÉRom can make original contributions to the study of Romance etymology. Partendo dalle osservazioni di J. Corominas, G. Rohlfs, H. W.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is to {{investigate}} references to meals, food and drink in Jane Austen's novels, and analyze how these references contribute to illustrate characters, assign moral worth, and reveal moral values. Specifically, this dissertation will center on the novels where eating and drinking are of paramount importance: Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park, and Emma. Readers are often solely focused on what happens around the table - lively dialogue, plot development - to recognize that {{what happens on the}} table is important too, and that food itself, its consumption and circulation, use, abuse and refusal, may convey a great deal of information. These considerations seem to be confirmed by the large number of references to food and drinks collected during the analysis of the above-mentioned novels: 295 reference to food and drink and 204 references to meals. Obviously, these references are too numerous to be merely coincidental. The analysis of Austen's treatment of food demonstrates indeed how references to meals, food and drink help understand better characters, determine their social status, clarify the time of the action. They provide crucial insights into morality and behaviour, as well. Food and drink, therefore, are not only a source of nourishment and bodily welfare but are also imbued with additional meaning and cultural significance that ensure a more comprehensive and critical reading of texts. For this reason I have explored Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park and Emma with a food-oriented approach and I have dedicated a whole chapter to the analysis of each novel. After having created an analytical index of meals, food and drinks per novel, and provided a narrative context for each reference, I have tried to understand and explain the function of food within each novel. I have divided the functions assigned to food and drink in Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park and Emma into three categories, which I name: Food and the Self, Food and Us, and Food and the "Other".

The narrator remembers how, as a child, she has been taken from her etiopian family without any explanation and sent to be brought up in the social environment of her italian father after he passed away. Placed at the exact converging point between two legacies – African and Western – and in the attempt (in vain?) to heal the wounds, – following from its Greek etymology, the author defines the word “trauma” as “a wound by fracture” – she makes use of the rhetorical figure of antanaclasis to put into words a persisting discomfort.

A ben vedere, per realizzare questo compito, bisogna prima interpellare i genitori su quello che già sanno sul tema a motivo della loro quotidiana esperienza educativa vissuta a contatto con i loro figli preadolescenti (11 - 14 anni) e adolescenti (15 - 19 anni). Per questo, innanzitutto si riferiscono alcune idee sul tema in questione espresse nel contesto dei {{focus group}} dai genitori che hanno partecipato agli incontri pedagogici fatti in alcune scuole secondarie di primo e di secondo grado della nostra regione siciliana, in cui l’autore è intervenuto come relatore nell’àmbito del progetto “P.

Da ultimo, si propone una metodologia pedagogica dell’ascolto in famiglia (suggerimenti pratici, codice d’ascolto e tecniche di personalizzazione) con cui i genitori possono migliorare la loro capacità di ascoltare minimizzando, da un lato, gli scontri verbali, le incomprensioni, le mutue chiusure alla comunicazione interpersonale; e accorciando, dall’altro lato, le distanze che separano oggi le generazioni dei figli adolescenti da quelle dei genitori adulti. In this short essay, some features of real communication {{between parents and}} children are outlined, according to the personal pedagogical {{point of view of the}} author. It seems that, before of decribing these caracteristics, parents should first be outspoken on what they already know about this subject, because of their daily educational experience lived in contact with their pre-teens (11 - 14 years old) and teenagers (15 - 19 years) sons. For this, we first refer to some ideas on this topic expressed by the parents who participated in the focus groups provided for by the pedagogical meetings made in some secondary schools of Sicily; in this context, the author intervened as rapporteur within the scope of the "POnTe" project. Secondly, we refer briefly to some "background" ideas that justify and enhance the ability to listen in the family. Lastly, an educational technique of listening in the family (practical tips, listening code and customization techniques) in proposed; using this technique, parents can improve their listening skills by minimizing, on the one hand, disputes, misunderstandings, mutual closures to interpersonal communication; on the other hand, by shortening the distances that today separate generations of teenage children from those of adult parents...|$|R

The focus is about the potential of architectural and urban design as a tool when pursuing this aim. Since the layering of different elements and relationships has been producing a remarkable richness in the city, particularly in Italy, architectural design is meant as a lively part of this, slow though never ending, ongoing stratification. Architectural design adds a new layer to the pre-existing ones and, {{through the creation of}} urban spaces, aims to provide a larger awareness in the fruition of the city. The case study, the area where the Eremitani Church lies in Padua, is heavily layered: around the Roman amphitheater the heritage of several centuries is found in the Scrovegni Chapel, the Eremitani Church, the city walls and the canals, which have been changing in terms of uses, meanings, spatial configurations and mutual relationships over the centuries. The design of renewed spaces inherits its formal fundaments from the above-mentioned relationships, uses and meanings, the existing as well as the newly produced ones. The architectural project is conceived to produce a Self Explaining City, where educational and exhibition needs are merged, without transforming the city into a museum, and without subordinating architectural form and space to the smartness of technological exhibitionism...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide an {{analysis}} of the cultural phenomenon of the book club, particularly of the success it has enjoyed in the two most important English speaking countries, the United States and the United Kingdom. The study focuses on reading as a social practice, a transaction between the text and the reader, in which the reader participates in the process of meaning-making of the text. Accordingly, my work provides a brief historical background of the phenomenon of the book club, from its origins in the late twelfth century to the present age. The first communities of readers in close communication with each other were established in the late twelfth century, when reading in groups was a common practice related to the need of sharing rare and expensive manuscripts. Thanks to the invention of the movable type printing press book circulation increased. Readers developed a new skill, the ability of reading in silence. A new 'image' of the reader came out, the 'silent reader', which established itself during the XVIII century. Reading became a private activity, and the image of the 'solitary reader' appeared. Meanwhile previous reading practices did not fade out. Different social practices cohabited and met different needs. Reading groups persisted giving importance to the social nature of reading. According to Jenny Hartley, "A reading group can be many things […]. The usual minimal definition would be a group of people who meet on a regular basis to discuss books" (2002, 2). Neighbourhood and word of mouth are basic elements in a traditional book club. However, according to Hartley, "A reading group isn't just about reading; it's about reading in a context which is fostered by the group, and which in turn affects the whole experience of reading" (2002, 22). Reading for pleasure is the subject of my analysis: it consists in reading "of our own free will [ [...] . ]. It also refers to reading that having begun at someone else's request we continue because we are interested in it. " (National Literacy Trust 2006, 5 - 6). The theory of reader response criticism focuses on the idea of 'reading as a transaction': the reader is an agent who participates in the process of meaning making of the text: "The black marks on the page are important, of course, but the meaning is constructed by the reader on the basis of his or her past experience with reading texts and with living in the world" (Ross 2006, 51). A reader's experience is unrepeatable. Book clubs fulfill the need of sharing personal experiences of reading with other readers. TV, computers, videogames and the Internet have been considered rivals of book reading. As a matter of fact the interaction among different media has given birth to novel resources, which in turn showed to be successful in providing new incentives to reading. Book clubs have entered bookstores as well. Chainstores, such as the American Barnes & Noble, provide places to read and discuss books, organize meetings with authors and sell books at cheap prices. Bookstores have come to adopt a new market strategy based on the double principle of communication and commercialization. In 1996 Oprah's Book Club went on air for the first time in America: its extraordinary success was followed in 2004 by the birth of a British celebrity book club, the Richard & Judy Book Club. These two shows proved to be real cultural phenomena: they showed great influence on the sales of the books featured in both programs. Oprah Winfrey in America and Amanda Ross in the UK are considered as the most influential people in publishing, thanks to their 'power' in shaping readers' literary taste. Both TV shows are supported by websites users can access to in order to share their reading experience with a wide number of readers. The R&J Book Club’s website summarizes this strategy of communication and commercialization by offering readers the opportunity to order books online at convenient prices. Finally, thanks to the web the cultural phenomenon of the book club has come to shape the global network: the main advantage is that the web, through forums, chats and social networks, abolishes physical borders of space and time and offers new experiences of reading and of socialization. The intimacy that book discussion groups succeed in establishing is the key factor of all these several interactive experiences of reading. Nowadays a kind of chain reaction is taking place: the social aspect of reading (communication) combines with commercial interest (books sales). In this way the book club finds its space in today's society: on the one hand it conjugates the pleasure coming from reading a good book with that of sharing one's own personal reading experiences. On the other hand book clubs seem to grant the book permanence. Their integration with new technologies offers renewed experiences of socialization and communication for their users.

Dai risultati dell’ indagine svolta emerge che nonostante sia possibile rilevare una correlazione positiva tra il grado di internazionalizzazione e la produzione di flussi informativi a sostegno dell’attività di export, il processo di internazionalizzazione produce ancora effetti limitati sullo scambio di informazioni di natura economico-finanziaria tra le imprese.

This in order to improve their communication process with foreign stakeholders (as client and suppliers, value chain partners, investors and others). Since, our research attempts to: -	evaluate which information is currently offered by these small firms that operate in international markets (both information compulsory and voluntarily given to users); -	suggest some improvements, according to a normative view, in order to increase the usefulness of small businesses financial statements. The survey covers 135 small firms. Our main findings suggest that: -	the way of internationalisation followed by small business of our sample is conforming with models suggested by literature; -	many small entrepreneurs do not use their company financial accounts and annual reports as support tools to communicate with their stakeholders, both national and foreign ones.

40|$|Peer {{reviewing}} {{is often}} called for as an essential divide between scientific knowledge and bare opinion. In general terms, it is an evaluation tool consisting in the formula through which an academic submits a text to the opinion of other academics (the so-called “peers”) who state its legitimacy; as a technical term, it amounts to the specific evaluation process that comes before publication on a scientific journal, a presentation’s approval to a conference or funding and grant allocation by funding agencies. In the abstract, peer review is required for appraising the quality of knowledge while it helps assuring its truthfulness and reputation; significantly, in the current transition between print and digital era, peer review itself is evoked as an element of continuity with the past and as a guarantee of scientific quality: while technology continuously upgrades, it is claimed, the knowledge validation process remains the same. Actually, {{it is one of}} the engines propelling research funding: as a filter by which it is decided whether to publish a scientific result, it influences both recruitment and career in the Republic of Science phaenomenon (that is, both in the academia and within research institutions), and public and private research funding. In practice, it often leaves room for abuses and frauds, allowing the darkest exertion of academic power. It may be for these reasons that peer review is acknowledged as the distinguishing feature of the modern academic system and, although legally unbinding, not only it is embraced (as a tool of the trade) by generations of scholars, but also it is very often deemed as the establishing and distinguishing feature of scientific knowledge. In the following pages I will examine the current praxis of peer review, to meditate then on the evolution and the future of this tool and, eventually, I will cast a glance at the historical and technological framework in which it first came to light. Il peer reviewing è spesso invocato come essenziale linea di demarcazione tra sapere scientifico e semplice opinione. Inteso in senso generico, esso è una forma di valutazione che consiste nella procedura tramite la quale un accademico sottopone un testo al giudizio di altri accademici (i cosiddetti “pari”) che ne stabiliscono la validità; come termine tecnico, corrisponde allo specifico processo di valutazione che precede la pubblicazione su una rivista scientifica, l'accettazione di una presentazione a una conferenza o l'assegnazione di fondi da parte di agenzie di finanziamento. Ma come si è definito il processo di accreditamento del sapere ancora oggi in vigore? Le tre sezioni in cui si articola questo lavoro sono dedicate: a) a considerare le diverse modalità in cui il concetto di peer review è stato declinato in epoca recente; b) a suggerire nuovi possibili modelli di peer review alla luce delle trasformazioni tecnologiche (la diffusione di Internet e del Web) che stanno rivoluzionando <b>la</b> pratica della <b>comunicazione</b> scientifica; e infine c) a ricostruire come è nato l'attuale processo di validazione della scienza, quali idee e tecnologie vi stanno alla base...|$|R
40|$| piante agli effetti interattivi dello stress idrico e delle alte temperature. Siccità e temperatura rappresentano, infatti, le variabili descriventi il riscaldamento globale che più delle altre potrebbero incrementare, e il cui incremento colpirebbe non solo la risposta delle piante a condizioni di stress, ma anche la chimica dell’atmosfera. Questa previsione è particolarmente vera se applicata agli ecosistemi forestali. La vegetazione terrestre, specialmente le foreste pluviali tropicali, rilasciano nell’atmosfera larghe quantità di carbonio sotto forma di composti volatili organici (VOC), il cui maggior rappresentante è l’isoprene. L’emissione di questi composti è strettamente legata a fattori ambientali, ed essi sono tanto rettivi quanto hanno una ridotta emivita. Gli isoprenoidi volatili possono essere rimossi da reazioni di ossidazione, le quali sono principalmente iniziate da radicali idrossilici (OH), di solito formati dalla foto-dissociazione dell’ozono. Una conseguenza della deforestazione, specialmente nella regione amazzonica, potrebbe essere una ridotta emissione di VOC, con un conseguente impatto sui livelli superficiali di ozono. Come evidenziato da Betts et al. (2008) . Tali considerazioni ci rivelano il possibile impatto degli isoprenoidi volatili, in particolare l’isoprene, sugli ecosistemi, in particolar modo su quelli forestali. Questi metaboliti sono coinvolti in numerosi processi biologici,quali il trasporto elettronico, la fotosintesi, la regolazione ormonale, la fluidità di membrana, i sistemi di difesa delle piante, come anche <b>la</b> <b>comunicazione</b> con altri organismi. Nelle piante l’isoprene in particolare è considerato un’importante molecola nel migliorare la risposta {{a stress}} abiotici. L’isoprene, infatti, può incrementare la termo-tolleranza, in particolare quando le foglie sono esposte a transienti periodi di alte temperature. A dispetto delle numerose e convincenti evidenze sperimentali a supporto di tale ipotesi, il meccanismo con cui l’isoprene esercita il suo ruolo protettivo non è stato ancora del tutto chiarito. Anche l’impatto della siccità sull’emissione d’isoprene è stato affrontato, considerando che tale stress rappresenta uno dei maggiori fattori limitanti lo sviluppo delle piante nel mondo, e che l’intensità e la frequenza di condizioni di siccità andrà a incrementare in risonanza all’attuale e futuro cambiamento climatico globale. Le attuali conoscenze suggeriscono che la sintesi d’isoprene non sia influenzata dalla siccità; cicli di forte stress idrico, che possono indurre una notevole diminuzione della fotosintesi, riducono solo parzialmente l’emissione d’isoprene. Sebbene numerosi isoprenoidi siano formati ed emessi dai cloroplasti a livello fogliare, dove essi esercitano la loro azione protettrice, altri composti volatili, come i sesquiterpeni, sono emessi anche dagli organi floreali. L’(E) - -cariofillene sintasi (TPS 27) catalizza la formazione del (-) -(E) - -cariofillene, il maggior {{sesquiterpene}} emesso dall’apparato floreale di Arabidopsis. È stato ipotizzato che l’(E) - -cariofillene possa giocare un ruolo rilevante nell’attrarre insetti, contribuendo al mantenimento di un basso livello di impollinazione incrociata ed incrementando la fitness riproduttiva nelle popolazioni naturali. Tuttavia, considerando i bassi livelli di emissione degli isoprenoidi volatili, è possibile che la biosintesi di (E) - -cariofillene possa avere una funzione nella o in aggiunta all’attrazione d’insetti impollinatori. A dispetto dei recenti studi a supporto dell’idea che la sintesi di terpeni volatili costitutivi (come isoprene, monoterpeni e sesquiterpeni) rilasciati dai tessuti vegetativi di differenti specie vegetali esposte a stress abiotico, possa mediare la termo-tolleranza o la protezione delle cellule dallo stress ossidativo, ci sono solo limitate informazioni disponibili sui possibili ruoli dei sesquiterpeni nella risposta fisiologica delle piante a condizioni di stress ambientale. Molte delle questioni riguardanti le funzioni biologiche degli isoprenoidi sono ancora aperte. Pur considerando la cospicua mole di studi fatti sull’impatto ecologico e fisiologico del rilascio in atmosfera degli isoprenoidi dalla vegetazione, attualmente è disponibile solo una parziale ed incompleta informazione riguardo la funzione, la biosintesi e la regolazione di tali composti a livello cellulare. Sarebbe importante poter riempire questo “gap”specialmente considerando il ruolo primario giocato da questi composti nel sistema difensivo delle piante contro stress ambientali. Particolarmente rilevante sembra essere, infatti, il ruolo dell’isoprene nel proteggere le foglie dai danni provocati dalle alte temperature e da condizioni di stress ossidativo. Data la specifica e attiva funzione dell’isoprene nel sistema difensivo delle piante, è ipotizzabile che la sintesi dell’isoprene sia regolata in modo altamente specifico. L’intento di questo lavoro è di fornire una risposta ad alcuni di questi punti ancora non del tutto chiariti. Utilizzando differenti specie vegetali e differenti approcci sperimentali abbiamo cercato di far luce sulla regolazione della funzione dell’isoprene in natura. Sarà mostrato che l’isoprene è in grado di incrementare la termotolleranza anche in piante che naturalmente non lo emettono (come piante di Arabidopsis thaliana ingegnerizzate per esprimere il gene dell’isoprene sintasi). Sarà dimostrato che tale ruolo protettivo non è giocato solo direttamente, detossificando l’eccesso di specie reattive dell’ossigeno (ROS) o aiutando la stabilità di membrana, ma anche in modo indiretto, attivando, già prima dell’accorrere di uno stress, il sistema di difesa specifico contro alte temperature e stress ossidativo. Saranno presentate inoltre nuove evidenze biofisiche a supporto dell’ipotesi che l’isoprene può essere in grado di interagire direttamente con le membrane cloroplastiche incrementandone la stabilità durante lo stress. Come per l’isoprene, molte domande su di un’altra classe d’isoprenoidi, i sesquiterpeni, sono ancora senza risposta. L’uso di specie modello geneticamente modificate, come Arabidopsis, per esprimere in modo costitutivo gli enzimi che regolano la biosintesi degli isoprenoidi nelle piante, può rappresentare un valido strumento d’indagine del ruolo fisiologico anche dei sesquiterpeni vegetali. Seguendo questo percorso, sarà presentato in questo lavoro una caratterizzazione di piante di Arabidopsis ingegnerizzate per esprimere in modo costitutivo il gene TPS 27, e come tali piante rispondono agli stress ambientali rispetto a piante selvatiche. Abbiamo utilizzato questo strumento per dimostrare che (E) - - cariofillene è in grado di incrementare la termo-tolleranza delle piante, ed anche che questo ruolo protettivo è innescato da meccanismi simili a quelli suggeriti per l’isoprene. Infine, l’analisi d’insieme dei risultati ottenuti, ci ha suggerito la possibilità che ci possa essere un percorso tanto funzionale quanto regolativo assimilabile a quello attenuto analizzando i dati raccolti con le piante di Arabidopsis ingegnerizzate per esprimere il gene dell’isoprene sintasi. Possiamo quindi ipotizzare che tutti gli isoprenoidi volatili esercitino un’azione protettiva simile, incrementando la protezione contro le alte temperature. Ripercorrendo i risultati ottenuti con l’isoprene e (E) - -cariofillene, guardando anche ai recenti lavori pubblicati su questi e altri isoprenoidi, ed infine analizzando anche la storia evolutiva della sintesi degli isoprenoidi, risulta possibile, o quantomeno ipotizzabile, che le piante emettano composti volatili,come parte del loro metabolismo secondario, combinandoli per rilasciare una miscela di molecole con specifiche funzioni,indipendentemente dalla specie vegetale. Le piante si sarebbero evolute sviluppando la loro capacità di regolare via via più finemente la biosintesi di una sempre più specifica famiglia d’isoprenoidi, per rispondere sempre meglio a specifiche condizioni ambientali. Oltretutto, composti filogeneticamente distanti come l’isoprene (un emiterpene) e (E) - -cariofillene (un sesquiterpene), sintetizzati ed emessi dalla stessa pianta, producono effetti simili, mostrando la stessa funzione biologica termo-protettrice. Questa ipotesi “concatenante” lega insieme le spiegazioni, non solo quella della termo-tolleranza, per spiegare l’emissione d’isoprenoidi verso un’unica molteplice funzione biologica: protezione delle piante da condizioni di stress ambientale e incremento della loro fitness. L’ipotesi “concatenante” racchiude gli isoprenoidi provenienti da differenti specie vegetali, suggerendo che sia la sintesi quanto l’uso o meno di uno specifico composto volatile da parte di due specie diverse non dovrebbe essere imputato al fatto che tale composto possa essere o no carbonio “spazzatura”, ma perché quelle piante si sono evolute seguendo vie differenti, adattando i loro profili di emissione a differenti condizioni ambientali e, di conseguenza,selezionando differenti isoprenoidi per rispondere a fenomeni simili.

The 13 th Article is our different study which based on “LIFELONG LEARNING THROUGH SECOND LIFE: Current Trends, Potentials And Limitations”, written by Nil GOKSEL-CANBEK, & me, Anadolu University, Eskisehir TURKEY and Maria MAVROMMATI & Despina MAKRIDOU-BOUSIOU, Department of Applied Inf., University of Macedonia, GREECE. This article previously presented at 10 th International Educational Technology Conference (IETC 2010) and published in CD as citing Canbek-Goksel, N., Mavromati, M., Makridou-Bousiou, D. & Demiray, U. (2010). Lifelong learning through Second Life: Current trends, potentials and limitations. 10 th International Educational Technology Conference (IETC 2010), Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey. This article is republished with an official permission of IETC Organizing Committee. The objectives of this study is Lifelong Learning (LLL) which has been a remarkable response to people-centered educational demand of 21 st century. In order to provide effective formal, non-formal, and informal learning, immersive educational activities undertaken throughout life should be aimed to create a learning society in which people can experience individual and collective learning with no constrains of time or location. The concept of lifelong learning within the context of distance immersive education encompasses diverse 3 D activities. The three dimensional, Web-based structured activities supported by distance learning technologies can be viewed as interactive tools which foster LLL. In this perspective, Second Life (SL) can be {{regarded as one of the}} learning simulation milieus that allow learners to participate in various educational LLL activities in individual or group forms. The following paper examines how SL, taking advantage of its simulative nature and the possibility for creative interaction among participants, which are also common in games, allows the learners to participate in immersive constructivist learning activities. The article will also touch on the current uses of SL as a tool for LLL, as well as its potentials for further development according to the current trends in adult education. Further, the authors will discuss its limitations and will make suggestions towards a more complete pedagogical use. The fourteenth and fifteenth articles are again from TURKEY and the fourteenth one belongs to Nil GOKSEL-CANBEK and Gülsün KURUBACAK, Open Education Faculty, Anadolu University, Department of Distance Education, Eskisehir, TURKEY. It is titled as “Lets Dive Into A Virtual World And See What Is Beneath Second Life”. This paper divulges the results of a master thesis study that evaluates the learner-course owner (instructor) interaction within University-Community Partnerships (UCPs) by giving samples on SL milieu. The study briefly demystifies 3 D interaction in virtual reality. The dimensions of immersive learning and learner-course owner (instructor) interaction are explored within the theoretical frame of Mindtool Model and Interaction-Communication Theory. The foundations of learning and communication are appraised on a matrix from which semi-structured and open-ended survey questions are formulated. The SL platform is assessed in terms of qualitative analyses of matrix based-foundations which are sent to four (4) distance education experts across the world. With the survey responses collected on a voluntary basis, 189 themes and 185 main themes on learner-course owner interaction are generated. The results demonstrate that Second Life as a learning mindtool uses Internet-based distance learning technologies effectively; however, it still needs appropriate andragogical adjustments for the efficacy of online interaction. The fifteenth article is titled as “THE NATURE OF USING VIRTUAL WORLDS BY A CHILD AS A LEARNING PLATFORM: A Case Study”, written by Ahmet BAYTAK, from Harran University, Sanlıurfa, Turkey. His artile is focused on that the development of new technologies is found inevitable and children interests toward online platforms and virtual worlds are rapidly growing. The purpose of his study also cannot be narrowed down to a single sentence but the overarching aim of the study is to explore the nature of using virtual worlds as a learning platform during. The theoretical background of this study is rooted from the constructivism and constructionism learning approaches. Consisted with its theoretical framework, this study has followed a qualitative case study research method to explore the nature of the construct. The case is a bounded system that is narrowed to a single case (Merriam, 1988; Stake, 1995; Yin, 2003). There are various types of data collected within this system. Based on the data collected and the research-suggested case study data analysis approaches, the following themes were emerged; realty, learning by discovering, learning by design, scaffolding and chunking information, and real life desires. After using Whyville virtual platform, the aim of this study was expected to start new discussion on young children using more complex virtual worlds such as Second Life. Thus, the results of this study could be guidance for transmission process of children toward Second Life type of virtual worlds. Even though a further discussion may need about the nature of using the virtual worlds, the primary findings of these case studies suggest some practical implications for children’s education. The sixteenth aricle arrived from Germany on SEMINAR ABOUT SERIOUS GAMES AND VIRTUAL WORLDS: An Experience of International Collaboration And Reflection”, written by Wolfram LAASER, from GERMANY and Julio Gonzalo BRITO, from ARGENTINA. They evaluated a seminar about serious games and virtual worldsas an experience of international collaboration and reflection for the educational possibilities of ICT, dizzying and exponentially growing every day, offer multiple alternatives of mediation for teaching, learning and communication. The inclusion of video games and virtual worlds into educational context represents a qualitative leap that claims to significantly boost ways of communication and knowledge representation of the scenarios involvedThe paper describes didactic design and technical solutions of the seminar format. The last but not least the 17 th article is on a Finnish project experience which is written by Heidi HEIKKILÄ who is the project coordinator of the Finnish Language and Literature, Sotunki Distance Learning Center, FINLAND, on “SOTUNKI: An Island Of Education and Adventure”. It serves that the information points to reflect the stylistic periods they presented so it would be easy to learn something of a stylistic period by just looking around: it activates visual memory and helps to connect information with the place where it was found.

40|$|Mobile communication, in {{particular}} mobile telephony, is a service whose nonexistence nowadays is unimaginable. The ongoing, ever increasing penetration of mobile communication equipment, presently intensified by {{the transition from}} second generation 1 to third generation 2 mobile telephone technology, raises the necessity for environmentally sound production, operation and End-of-Life 3 treatment. In order to determine potentials to improve the overall environmental performance of large technical systems, such as mobile phone networks, Life Cycle Assessment 4 is increasingly accepted as the state-of-the art tool. Up to now, this tool has been primarily {{used to determine the}} environmental effects of the production and the use phase. The environmental consequences related to the EOL treatment of mobile telephone electronic scrap has been addressed only marginally. A reliable assessment of the overall environmental consequences however, requires a comprehensive analysis of all life cycle phases. The focus of the present thesis is directed towards the environmental assessment of the EOL treatment of scrap of mobile phone networks that comply with present and forthcoming mobile phone standards in order to provide in-depth knowledge on the related environmental effects. Additionally, reliable environmental data for future studies shall be generated. After a brief introduction in Chapter 1, the application of LCA for the environmental analysis of mobile phone networks is outlined in general in Chapter 2 (LCA method applied to mobile phone technology). A decomposition 5 of the mobile telephone network infrastructure is proposed in order to investigate the network components separately (hierarchical classification of the network components into classes A-D). Technical background knowledge, compiled in parallel, is used in order to assemble a mobile phone network model used for network recomposition later on. Similar to the network decomposition, a dissection of the End-of-Life 6 phase is proposed in order to explore and model the processing of the electronic scrap in the EOL phase appropriately. Subsequently, the infrastructure and communication techniques of the presently applied 2 G and 3 G mobile telephone networks are described in detail in Chapter 3 (Technical characterisation of mobile phone technology). Using the decomposition approach the mobile phone network infrastructure is characterised in detail. Technique related effects are explained. Applying the subdivision approach, the various EOL stages are presented. Chapters 4 and 5 compile the results of LCA studies performed for a separate network component and an entire network. The objects of the studies both comply with the modern Global System for Mobile communication standard 7. The Screening LCA of an antenna station rack (Chapter 4) is based on comprehensive inventories of an antenna station rack 8 and currently applied EOL treatment. The environmental impacts related to the End-of-Life treatment of the rack are investigated. Six different EOL treatment scenarios are developed to find an environmentally acceptable treatment alternative. System expansion, i. e. inclusion of the production phase, is applied to all scenarios in order to consider different amounts of recycled materials. The production of primary rack materials to substitute lost materials, especially that of palladium (which accounts for almost 40 % of the ecotoxicity impact category), dominates the overall environmental impact. Emissions of heavy metals from landfilled rack components/ materials and of by-products to the environment greatly influence the overall impacts on human health and ecosystem quality. The final disposal of rack components contributes to about 70 % of the non-carcinogenic effects. Landfilled dust from steel production contributes to nearly 11 % of this impact category. The results suggest that all precious metals containing electronic scrap should be treated in specially equipped metal recovery plants. A complete rack disassembly before processing in high-standard metal recovery plants is not necessary. An elaborated pre-treatment and fractionation of the scrap prior to precious material recovery does not lower the environmental impacts and is not mandatory and would only become environmentally interesting if high recovery of heavy metals is achieved. To avoid the formation and release of volatile and toxic heavy metals, incineration of electronic scrap and of by-products prior to landfilling should be avoided. To reduce the overall environmental load, standardisation of the sizes of rack components is recommended in order to facilitate their re-use. The LCA of a GSM Network (Chapter 5) comprises a life cycle assessment based on a detailed life cycle inventory for a typical GSM mobile phone network and related EOL treatment infrastructure. The environmental relevance of the three life cycle phases: production, use and EOL treatment has been analysed using IMPACT 2002 +. The environmentally preferable EOL treatment alternative was identified adopting the six earlier developed EOL treatment scenarios. Results indicate that environmental impacts attributable to the use phase dominate the environmental impacts during the entire life cycle of the network. The impacts of the production phase are primarily attributable to the energy intensive manufacturing of Printed Wiring Board Assemblies 9. The EOL phase dominates impacts on ecosystem quality. In particular long-term emissions of heavy metals cause critical effects. Detailed analysis of the EOL phase shows that recycling of network materials in general leads to a two fold reduction of environmental impacts: in the EOL phase itself as well as by means of the avoided primary production of materials that are recovered in the EOL phase. An increase in the material quality of the secondary precious and rare materials leads to a significant reduction of impacts on human health. The EOL phase is assessed in-depth by developing different EOL treatment scenarios. Comprehensive experimental results on the volatilisation of heavy metals from PWBA during thermal EOL treatment are presented in Chapter 6 (Heavy metal partitioning from electronic scrap during thermal End-of-Life treatment). Samples of identical PWBA have been incinerated in a Quartz Tube Reactor 10 in order to detect the volatility of selected key heavy metals in electronic scrap. In preparation, evaporation experiments were performed using a Thermo-Gravimeter 11 in connection with an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emissions Spectrometer 12. The QTR-experiments were performed under reducing and under oxidising conditions at 550 and 880 °C. The volatilisation has been determined for As, Cd, Ni, Ga, Pb, Sb and Zn using ICP-OES. The results were evaluated by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and in comparison with similar studies. Neither As nor Cd nor Ga could be detected in the incineration ash residuals, expressing a high volatility. Ni remains as stable compound in the ash. Zn shows an increasing volatility with increasing temperature and depending on the supply of oxygen. Sb shows a high volatility nearly independent on temperature and oxygen supply. The results imply that, if electronic scrap is incinerated, attention has to be paid {{in particular}} to Sb, As and Ga. These metals are increasingly used in new electronic equipment such as mobile phone network equipment of the third generation. The series of the core chapters is finalised by presenting results of a comparative LCA study performed for mobile phone networks complying with the GSM and Universal Mobile Telecommunication System standard 13 (Chapter 7 : LCA of of Second Generation (2 G) and Third Generation (3 G) Mobile Phone Networks). The environmental performance of presently operated GSM and UMTS networks was analysed, concentrating on the environmental effects of the EOL phase using the LCA method. The study was performed based on comprehensive life cycle inventory and life cycle modelling. The environmental effects were quantified using the IMPACT 2002 + method and the robustness of the results was tested with other LCIA methods. Based on technological forecasts, the environmental effects of forthcoming mobile telephone networks were approximated. The results indicate that a parallel operation of GSM and UMTS networks is environmentally detrimental and the transition phase should be kept as short as possible. The use phase (i. e. the operation) of the radio network components account for a large fraction of the total environmental impact. In particular, {{there is a need to}} lower the energy consumption of those network components. Seen in relation to each other, UMTS networks provide an environmentally more efficient mobile communication technology per bit transferred than GSM networks and a slightly higher absolute impact. In assessing the EOL phase, recycling the electronic scrap of mobile phone networks has clear environmental benefits. Under the present conditions, material recycling could help to lower the environmental impact of the production phase by up to 50 %. Based on the recapitulation of the achievements of the thesis and an outline of the thematic limitations, challenges for future studies are formulated in Chapter 8. The results documented in the thesis are supported by the complementing appendices (A-D).
