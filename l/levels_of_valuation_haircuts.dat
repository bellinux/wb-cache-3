40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} empirically the well-known put-call parity no-arbitrage relation {{in the presence}} of short sale restrictions. We use a new and comprehensive sample of options on individual stocks in combination with a measure of the cost and difficulty of short selling, specifically the spread between the rate a short-seller earns on the proceeds from the sale relative to the standard rate (the rebate rate spread). We find that violations of put-call parity are asymmetric in the direction of short sales constraints, their magnitudes are strongly related to the rebate rate spread, and they are maintained even {{in the presence of}} transactions costs both in the options and equity lending market. These violations appear to be related to both the maturity of the option and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuations</b> in the stock market, consistent with a behavioral finance theory that relies on over-optimistic investors in the stock market and segmentation between the stock and options markets.

40|$|Although the {{commoditisation}} of {{illiquid asset}} exposures through securitisation facilitates the disciplining effect of capital markets on the risk management, private information about securitised debt {{as well as}} complex transaction structures could possibly impair the fair market valuation. In a simple issue design model without intermediaries we maximise issuer proceeds over a positive measure of issue quality, where a direct revelation mechanism (DRM) by profitable informed investors engages endogenous price discovery through auction-style allocation preference as a continuous function of perceived issue quality. We derive an optimal allocation schedule for maximum issuer payoffs under different pricing regimes if asymmetric information requires underpricing. In particular, we study how the incidence of uninformed investors at varying <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> uncertainty and their function of clearing the market effects profitable informed investment. We find that the issuer optimises own payoffs at each <b>valuation</b> irrespective <b>of</b> the applicable pricing mechanism by awarding informed investors the lowest possible allocation (and attendant underpricing) that still guarantees profitable informed investment. Under uniform pricing {{the composition of the}} investor pool ensures that informed investors appropriate higher profit than uninformed types.

We use a new and comprehensive sample of options on individual stocks in combination with a measure of the cost and difficulty of short selling, specifically the spread between the rate a short-seller earns on the proceeds from the sale relative to the normal rate (the rebate rate spread). We find statistically and economically significant violations of put-call parity that are strongly related to the rebate rate spread. Stocks with negative rebate rate spreads exhibit prices in the stock market that are up to 7. 5 % greater than those implied in the options market (for the extreme 1 % tail). Even after accounting for transaction costs in the options markets, these violations persist and their magnitude appears {{to be related to the}} general <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuations</b> in the stock market. Moreover, the extent of violations of put-call parity and the rebate rate spread for individual stocks are significant predictors of future stock returns.

It is difficult to reconcile these results with rational models of investor behavior, and, in fact, they are consistent with the presence of overoptimistic irrational investors in the markets for some individual securities. ...|$|R

40|$|The current project {{attempts}} {{to construct a}} modest version of natural theology {{with the aid of}} Confucian axiology and American Pragmatism. Its main thrust is to map out several <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> integrative <b>valuation</b> moving from nature and society into the innermost part of the human core. It envisions a Confucian axiological cosmos where values are scattered ubiquitously in the universe and its myriad presences. The pragmatic theories of Charles S. Peirce and William James are employed to construct methodological mechanisms by which natural values are to be recognized, semioticized, transferred and integrated into the human equilibrium as valutional core. Nature, society and the human valutional core are envisioned as three major value hubs that are intricately intertwined and mutually reciprocal. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> integrative <b>valuation</b> consist <b>of</b> a series of evaluative steps spread along the history of Confucianism. Beginning with an objective observation of Investigation of Things, it reaches the semiotic stage of Rectifying the Name, which followed by physical participation in the Unity of Knowledge and Action, and eventually arrives at the grand stage of Ritual Appropriateness. The Protestant churches with Chinese cultural background are considered as the communal basis of this project. The rival coexistence of both naturalistic and anti-naturalistic tendencies makes them an apt sample for this axiological project of reconfiguring a natural theology. If accomplished successfully, this project will establish an axiological type of natural theology by means of integrating resources from Confucianism, American Pragmatism and Christian Theology. It will demonstrate a way of engaging nature alternative to those of logical positivist, materialistic or even ecological approaches. This project may help conservative Protestant Christians redress their obsession concerning special, direct, salvific grace by redirecting them towards natural values that are profoundly rich and nourishing by reconciling the cultural and religious dimensions of their lives...|$|R

Foram sujeitos 31 atletas de voleibol, das categorias adulto masculina, juvenil masculina e juvenil feminina. Utilizou-se como instrumento de medida a Escala Fatorial de Autoconceito. Para a análise dos dados foram utilizados os testes kruskall-Wallis e MANOVA. Os dados demonstraram que as equipes comportaram-se de forma semelhante quanto aos fatores do autoconceito, ocorrendo diferença estatisticamente significativa para o fator segurança entre as equipes juvenis feminina e masculina. O fator ético-moral apresentou altos níveis de valorização em relação aos outros fatores, sendo estatisticamente superior nas equipes feminina e masculina juvenis. Na equipe masculina adulta este fator foi superior aos fatores "somático", "receptividade" e "atitude social". O sentimento de pertencer a um grupo socialmente valorizado parece ser o principal motivo de os atletas se perceberem como sujeitos morais. Conclui-se que existem diferenças de gênero quanto ao autoconceito ("segurança"), de modo que o esporte favorece o sentimento de "moralidade" e vivências de autoconsideração, propiciando a congruência do self-experiência.

40|$|I {{argue that}} {{competing}} visions of development guided the interventions of the United States and France in the West African country of Ivory Coast {{during the late}} colonial and early independence periods from 1946 through the 1960 s. Indeed, the postwar arrival of American modernity provided an opportunity for nationalist leaders to triangulate the relationship between metropolitan France and colonial Ivory Coast. The ensuing politics of triangulation forced French colonial officials, diplomats, and development experts to “dub” modernization in order to bolster (neo) colonial ties between France and the Ivory Coast. By dubbing I mean the effort to translate and adapt for French purposes development concepts and techniques first elaborated in the United States. I explore these issues in case histories of the port of Abidjan, Kossou dam, and San Pedro development projects. I highlight the discursive as well as institutional frameworks that shaped the development of Ivory Coast. In the early twentieth century, French colonialism’s mission civilisatrice and mise en valeur posited that the colonizers were rational and productive, while the colonized were backward and incompetent to exploit their natural resources. After the Second World War, the ascendant American modernization paradigm added a new <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> to colonialism’s moral economy. It proposed a dynamic and progressive teleology in which the colonized could become modernized and actually “work by themselves” to reproduce hegemonic U. S. technological, economic, and political norms. Modernization was a civilizing project as well, but in contrast French (neo) colonialism now appeared static and paternalistic. French attempts to recuperate {{their position in the}} Ivory Coast deployed the epistemic memories of decades of work in the colony but ironically involved promoting forms of regional planning pioneered by the Tennessee Valley Authority. To reach these insights, I have used an interdisciplinary historical methodology that is multiarchival and multisited. My dissertation is based on research in numerous French and American archives as well as oral histories with French and American actors who participated in the (post) colonial development drive in the Ivory Coast...|$|R

Using a sample of 146 bank-year observations from 18 countries over 2009 - 2012, this study finds banks’ incentives to use Level 3 valuation inputs are associated with both firm-level and country-level determinants. At the firm-level, leverage, profitability (in term of net income), Tier 1 capital ratio, size and audit committee independence are associated with the percentage <b>of</b> <b>Level</b> 3 <b>valuation</b> inputs. At the country-level, economy development, legal region, legal enforcement and investor rights are also associated with the Level 3 classification choice.
