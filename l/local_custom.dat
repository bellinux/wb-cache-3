5|$|<b>Local</b> <b>custom</b> {{was first}} {{recognized}} by Abū Yūsuf (d. 182/798), an early {{leader of the}} Ḥanafī school. However, it was {{considered part of the}} Sunnah, and not as formal source. Later, al-Sarak̲h̲sī (d. 483/1090) opposed it, holding that custom cannot prevail over a written text.|$|E
5|$|The son of Mircea I of Wallachia and his wife, Maria Tolmay, Michael was Mircea's only {{legitimate}} son. Alexander Aldea and Vlad were Michael's {{most prominent}} illegitimate half-brothers, who, {{in accordance with}} <b>local</b> <b>custom,</b> could have claimed the throne of Wallachia. To strengthen Michael's position, his father made him his co-ruler.|$|E

Hand-carved Jerusalem limestone adorn the building, according to <b>local</b> <b>custom.</b> The use of arches and domes closely models other building of Jerusalem and the gardens throughout the center contain many trees and other plants named in the Bible. The interior contains the arches and cupolas typical of the Near East, and large, windowed pavilions provide wide views of Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|According to Sunni jurisprudence, in the {{application}} of <b>local</b> <b>custom,</b> custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality. If it is in absolute opposition to Islamic texts, custom is disregarded. However, if it is in opposition to analogical reason, custom is given preference. Jurists also tend to, with caution, give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars. Shi'ite scholars do not consider custom as a source of jurisprudence, nor do the Hanbalite or Zahirite schools of Sunni jurisprudence.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A <b>local</b> <b>custom</b> in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, clocks {{primarily}} served religious purposes; {{the first}} employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In Dublin, the official measurement of time became a <b>local</b> <b>custom,</b> and by 1466 a public clock stood {{on top of}} the Tholsel (the city court and council chamber). It was {{the first of its kind}} to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand. The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks. A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its face is decorated with the images of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George.|$|E

5|$|Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end {{is often}} {{taken out of}} the fire and used {{according}} to the <b>local</b> <b>custom.</b> It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between the branches of a young plum or apple tree. The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries, so that the coming year may be happy and fruitful. It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E
5|$|Generally, each {{household}} prepares one badnjak, {{although more}} are cut in some regions. Depending on the <b>local</b> <b>custom,</b> Montenegrin Serbs may fell two, three, an arbitrary number greater than two, {{or the number}} equal to the male members of household plus one. The latter means {{that each of the}} males has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the head of household and the thinnest linked to the family's prosperity. If there is only one man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree. In parts of the Bay of Kotor, each household prepares four sets of badnjaks, as they are burned there not only on Christmas Eve, but also on the eves of New Years Day, Epiphany, and the Feast of Saint Sava.|$|E
5|$|The 16 sailors on Tahiti {{began to}} organise their lives. One group, led by Morrison and Tom McIntosh, began {{building}} a schooner, which they named Resolution after Cook's ship. Morrison {{had not been}} an active mutineer; rather than waiting for recapture, he hoped to sail the vessel to the Dutch East Indies and surrender to the authorities there, hoping that such action would confirm his innocence. Morrison's group maintained ship's routine and discipline, even {{to the extent of}} holding divine service each Sunday. Churchill and Matthew Thompson, on the other hand, chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives, which ended in the violent deaths of both. Churchill was murdered by Thompson, who was in turn killed by Churchill's native friends. Others, such as Stewart and Heywood, settled into quiet domesticity; Heywood spent much of his time studying the Tahitian language. He adopted native dress and, in accordance with the <b>local</b> <b>custom,</b> was heavily tattooed on his body.|$|E

5|$|When Radama died {{without leaving}} any {{descendants}} on July 27, 1828, according to <b>local</b> <b>custom,</b> the rightful heir was Rakotobe, {{the eldest son}} of Radama's eldest sister. An intelligent and amiable young man, Rakotobe was the first pupil to have studied at the first school established by the London Missionary Society in Antananarivo {{on the grounds of}} the royal palace. Radama died in the company of two trusted courtiers who were favorable to the succession of Rakotobe. However, they hesitated to report the news of Radama's death for several days, fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king's rivals, whose family had a stake in the succession after Radama. During this time, another courtier, a high-ranking military officer named Andriamamba, discovered the truth and collaborated with other powerful officers – Andriamihaja, Rainijohary and Ravalontsalama – to support Ramavo's claim to the throne.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century Bani Zeid was officially ruled by Sheikh Salih al-Barghouti, {{although}} he struggled to maintain full authority over the sheikdom, having to contend with his Abwein-based rival Sheikh Musa and his family, al-Sahwil. The latter controlled seven villages in the eastern part of the sheikdom, while the Barghouti maintained control over twelve villages in the western part. The two domains were separated by a wadi (seasonal stream). Nonetheless, Sheikh Salih enjoyed high political and social status, holding the official title of sheikh al-nahiya (chief of the subdistrict) and was also referred to locally as sheikh al-mashayikh (chief of the chieftains). The title ceased to be recognized by the Istanbul-based central government in 1864, but locally the title continued to demonstrate the guise of official authority. As sheikh al-nahiya, Sheikh Salih was tasked with the nomination and dismissal of makhatir (village headmen) and maintaining order through <b>local</b> <b>custom.</b> He also served as the multazim (tax collector) of the Bani Zeid sheikdom on behalf of the Ottoman authorities, despite the ban on tax-farming in 1853. This role in particular enabled the Barghouti clan to acquire vast wealth and property either forcefully or through legal transfer. During previous inter-family disputes, members of the clan had begun to settle in the surrounding villages of Beit Rima, Kobar and Deir Nidham.|$|E
