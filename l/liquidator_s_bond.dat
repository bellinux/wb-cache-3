40|$|The {{degradation}} of <b>S</b> [...] <b>S</b> <b>bonds</b> in 0. 2 M-NaOH at 25 degrees C was studied {{for a series}} of proteins and simple aliphatic disulphide compounds, by using cathodic stripping voltammetry, ion-selective-electrode potentiometry, spectrophotometry and ultrafiltration. The disulphide bonds that dissociated in 0. 2 M-NaOH were usually those that are solvent accessible and that can be reduced by mild chemical reductants. Some unexpected differences were found between similar proteins, both in the number of <b>S</b> [...] <b>S</b> <b>bonds</b> dissociated and in their rates of decomposition. Chymotrypsin has one <b>S</b> [...] <b>S</b> <b>bond</b> attacked, whereas chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen have two. Ribonuclease A has two <b>S</b> [...] <b>S</b> <b>bonds</b> dissociated, but ribonuclease S and S-protein have three. Denaturation in 6 M-guanidine hydrochloride before alkaline digestion caused the loss of an additional <b>S</b> [...] <b>S</b> <b>bond</b> in ribonuclease A and insulin, and increased the rate of dissociation of the <b>S</b> [...] <b>S</b> <b>bonds</b> of some other proteins. The initial product of <b>S</b> [...] <b>S</b> <b>bond</b> dissociation in dilute alkali is believed to be a persulphide intermediate formed by a beta-elimination reaction. This intermediate is in mobile equilibrium with bisulphide ion, HS-, and decomposes at a mercury electrode or in acid solution to yield a stoichiometric amount of sulphide. Rate constants and equilibrium constants were measured for the equilibria between HS- and the intermediates involved in the alkaline dissociation of several proteins. Elemental sulphur was not detected in any of the protein digests. It is suggested that formation of HS- from a persulphide intermediate involves a hydrolysis reaction to yield a sulphenic acid derivative. The small polypeptides glutathione and oxytocin gave only a low yield of persulphide, and their alkaline decomposition must proceed by a mechanism {{different from that of the}} proteins...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To examine morphologically {{the hybrid}} layer of {{one-step}} self-etching adhesive, Clearfil <b>S</b> 3 <b>Bond</b> (<b>S</b> 3 <b>bond),</b> in caries-affected dentin (CAD) and deep sound dentin (DSD) cavities performed clinically. For a comparative group, the two-step self etching adhesive Clearfil Protect Bond (Pbond) {{was used in}} a similar clinical situation. Methods: This study was carried out on carious and sound teeth clinically selected for extraction. In carious teeth, CAD was obtained by way of subjective criteria by removing infected tissue to form a cavity bottom. DSD was obtained {{at a depth of}} 4 mm in the dentin cavity of sound teeth. <b>S</b> 3 <b>bond</b> and Pbond were applied in the CAD and DSD cavities as indicated by the manufacturer, followed by a composite restoration. Teeth were extracted about 20 minutes after the bonding procedure, and processed for TEM analysis. Results: Expression of <b>S</b> 3 <b>bond</b> in CAD was morphologically highly variable. When affected tubules were occluded by intratubular mineralized deposits, the interface displayed a dense poly-HEMA hydrogel as water sorption by the hydrophilic <b>S</b> 3 <b>bond</b> toward the porous affected collagen. Conversely, when tubules appeared empty, voids of various sizes were formed by tubular fluid shift. In DSD, <b>S</b> <b>bond</b> clearly exhibited voids and water channels as signs of the high permeability of the sub-surface. Although porosities were somewhat retained, Pbond expression showed a hermetic character which was independent of the dentin substrate. <b>S</b> 3 <b>bond</b> bonding to dentin was compromised as shown by signs of water movement within the resin/dentin bond outlining a weak capacity to produce an impermeable hybridiztion...|$|R

The X-ray diffraction analysis of the compounds reveals square planar, four-coordination geometry for the homoleptic compounds and a six-coordinated distorted octahedral geometry for the adducts. In Ni[S 2 P(OBus) (2) ](2) the molecules are associated through C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds (2. 652 angstrom), and in Ni[S 2 P(OBui) (2) ](2) the molecules are associated through C-H center dot center dot center dot <b>S</b> hydrogen <b>bonds</b> (2. 948 angstrom). The pyrazole adducts are associated through N-H center dot center dot center dot O bonds and N-H center dot center dot center dot <b>S</b> <b>bonds</b> from the pyrazole nitrogen atoms, to form supramolecular assemblies.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} effective interest rate proxies for equity and mortgage REITs, this study analyzes seven different interest rate proxies that {{have been widely used}} in the REIT literature. They are the monthly holding period returns on long-term U. <b>S.</b> government <b>bonds</b> and high-grade corporate bonds, the percentage changes in yields for long-term U. <b>S.</b> government <b>bonds</b> and high-yield (Baa) corporate bonds, the difference between returns on long-term U. <b>S.</b> government <b>bonds</b> and T-bill rates, the spread between yields on high-yield (Baa) corporate bonds and returns on long-term U. <b>S.</b> government <b>bonds,</b> and the spread between returns on high-grade corporate bonds and returns on long-term U. <b>S.</b> government <b>bonds.</b> The overall OLS results suggest that mortgage REITs are sensitive to all proxies, while equity REITs are significantly affected by only changes in yields on long-term U. <b>S.</b> government <b>bonds</b> and high-yield corporate bonds. The time variation paths for sensitivities indicate that all interest rate sensitivities are time specific. Overall, the changes in yields on high-yield corporate bonds (Baa) has the strongest explanatory power for returns of equity and mortgage REITs for most of the 27 -year sample period (1972 through 1998) ...|$|R

Products deriving from the C <b>S</b> <b>bond</b> cleavage in the radical cations 1 (center dot+) - 5 (center dot+) have been observed in the steady-state photolysis experiments. Time-resolved LFP showed first-order decay of the radical cations accompanied by formation of the triphenylmethyl cation. A significant decrease of the C <b>S</b> <b>bond</b> cleavage rate constants was observed by increasing the electron-donating power of the arylsulfenyl substituent, that is, by increasing the stability of the radical cations. DFT calculations showed that, in 2 (center dot+) and 3 (center dot+), charge and spin densities are mainly localized in the ArS group. In the TS of the C <b>S</b> <b>bond</b> cleavage an increase of the positive charge in the trityl moiety and of the spin density on the ArS group is observed. The higher delocalization of the charge in the TS as compared to the initial state is probably at the origin of the observation that the C <b>S</b> <b>bond</b> cleavage rates decrease by increasing the polarity of the solvent...|$|R
