5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.|$|E

5|$|During Reagan's presidency, {{federal income}} tax rates were lowered {{significantly}} with {{the signing of the}} Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%.

Then, in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' first public–private partnerships and {{a major part of the}} president's job creation program.

5|$|Numismatist Bruce C. Goldstein {{indicated}} that several factors combined {{to keep the}} nickel three-cent piece in decline {{after the passage of}} the 1873 act. Less and less fractional currency was being redeemed, as almost a decade had passed since the issuance of three-cent notes. Rich silver strikes in the West <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> price of that metal to the point where old silver coins emerged from hoarding and circulated again. These factors, combined with ample stocks of cents and nickels, made the three-cent nickel, a non-silver coin of odd denomination, less desirable. By 1876, the mintage for circulation had declined to 162,000. None were struck for circulation in 1877 and 1878, though some proof coins were minted for sale to the public.|$|E
5|$|On 13 November 1962, Tsarapkin {{indicated}} that the Soviet Union would accept a proposal drafted by US and Soviet experts involving automated test detection stations ("black boxes") and {{a limited number of}} on-site inspections.

On 28 December 1962, Kennedy <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> US demand to 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, the number was lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued to insist on no more than three. Kennedy was willing to reduce the number to six, though this was not clearly communicated to the Soviet Union. On 20 April 1963, Khrushchev withdrew support for three inspections entirely.|$|E

30|$|As {{positions}} disappear, {{the rate}} at which workers arrive at employers rises, but {{the rate at}} which workers find new vacancies drops. As noted above, the higher arrival rate of workers at vacancies <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> cost of discriminating, because a faster arrival of the next worker means less foregone output when a type B worker is turned away 14. This <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> cutoff value of c*, which in turn <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> value of search for type B workers relative to type A workers. A similar effect results from disproportionately more type A than type B workers losing jobs, raising the share of type A workers among <b>the</b> searchers and <b>lowering</b> <b>the</b> expected waiting time for the next type A applicant for firms who turn away type B workers. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> arrival rate of job offers to workers <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> value of search for both type A and type B workers, which <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> wage of both types; but it <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> value of search more for type A workers.
