It was the first monument honoring an African American or a woman to be installed in a public park in the District of Columbia. At least 18,000 people attended the unveiling ceremony (although one estimate claims that approximately 250,000 people attended) including Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to Congress.

500|$|Along with {{introducing}} the band's new sound, the song opens the album as {{a statement of}} intent.

Some of the lyrics, particularly those in the bridge before the final chorus, use the eponymous subway station as a metaphor for time: [...] "Time is a train / Makes the future the past / <b>Leaves</b> <b>you</b> standing in the station / Your face pressed up against the glass". Bono cites the enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on Achtung Baby, as was his wife's second pregnancy during the album's 1991 recording.
