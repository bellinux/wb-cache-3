5|$|The New Zealanders {{continued}} {{their efforts to}} encircle Bapaume on 26 August, their flanks protected by the neighbouring 63rd and 5th Divisions. The New Zealand Rifle Brigade took over the attack in the north from the 2nd Infantry Brigade, while 1st Infantry Brigade was to carry on with its advance in to the south. Should the two brigades successfully link up {{to the east of}} Bapaume, they would attack into the town from there. However, little progress was made in the south. The 63rd Division was still struggling to capture Thilloy while the advance of the 2nd Wellington Battalion, the <b>leading</b> <b>unit</b> of the 1st Infantry Brigade, was checked by gunfire from Bapaume on its right and from its left. The Wellington men had to eventually withdraw to their starting positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{spearhead}} of the Free French First Army {{that had}} landed in Provence was the Ist Corps.

25|$|After {{escaping}} to Chongqing where Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government was established, Kim {{established the}} Korean Liberation Army (광복군; 光復軍), commanded by General Ji Cheong-cheon (지청천; 池靑天). When the Pacific War broke out on December 8, 1941, Kim Koo {{declared war on}} Japan and Germany and committed the Korean Liberation Army to the Allied side; the Korean Liberation Army took part in warfare in China and Southeast Asia.

25|$|The 2e Division Blindée (2nd Armoured Division), {{part of the}} Free French {{forces that}} {{had participated in the}} Normandy Campaign and had {{liberate}}d Paris, went on to liberate Strasbourg on 23 November 1944, fulfilling the Oath of Kufra made by General Leclerc almost four years earlier. The unit under his command, barely above company size when it had captured the Italian fort, had grown into an armoured division. The I Corps was the spearhead of the Free French First Army that had landed in Provence as a part of Operation Dragoon. Its <b>leading</b> <b>unit,</b> the 1re Division Blindée, was the first Western Allied unit to reach the Rhône (25 August), the Rhine (19 November) and the Danube (21 April 1945). On 22 April, it captured the Sigmaringen enclave in Baden-Württemberg, where the last Vichy regime exiles were hosted by the Germans in one of the ancestral castles of the Hohenzollern dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Saint-Cyr put his cavalry and {{artillery}} {{in the middle}} of his <b>leading</b> <b>unit</b> and was able to avoid pursuit. His column arrived at Trippstadt as the town was being attacked by Kleist. This lucky accident allowed Saint-Cyr's column to easily brush off Kleist's division and escape. Ambert's column had more trouble. His infantry was supposed to hold the edge of a forest until the cavalry {{and artillery}} of the rear guard reached it. By some error, the foot soldiers continued on their march. The Prussian horsemen routed their adversaries and the defeated French cavalry stampeded through the ranks of their own infantry, causing chaos. Oudinot's battalion, made of sterner stuff, chased off the Prussian cavalry and returned to the edge of the woods where they recovered some of the abandoned artillery. However, they were unable to drag away the guns because the horse teams had been killed. Continuing the withdrawal, Oudinot's men encountered a Prussian roadblock, but forced their way through. The two retreating columns reassembled at Pirmasens except for some soldiers who fled as far as Bitche. At Kaiserslautern the French lost about 1,000 men killed, wounded or missing in addition to 17 artillery pieces and two colors. Total Prussian casualties were 110 while Saxon losses were unknown but very light.|$|E

50|$|A {{combination}} of the declining coal market, and lack of coal being produced from the Quintette mine led to the electric system being shut down due to low traffic, and high maintenance costs. The system transferred over to diesel hauled trains after the last electrically hauled train left the Teck loadout (Bull-moose mine) on October 1, 2000. Towards the later years of operation, the GF6C units were de-rated due to the high amount of traction motor failures during operation. It is not known what their horsepower rating was after this modification, however loaded trains leaving {{the east side of}} the subdivision typically saw the use of 3 <b>leading</b> <b>units,</b> and 3 helper units per train. Previously, each loaded train would typically have 2 <b>leading</b> <b>units,</b> and 2 helper units. The helper units would be cut from the train upon reaching the summit.|$|R

500|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 12 October, the Germans, already on the alert, bombarded the areas where the New Zealand {{infantry}} were assembling prior to commencing their advance. [...] This, along with several rounds of New Zealander artillery that fell short, inflicted numerous casualties until the New Zealanders completed their barrage at 5:25 am and began moving forward. Their advance was slowed by ground conditions and machine gun fire from both their front and flanks. They stalled after reaching the wire, arranged in two belts. The following battalions began to catch up to the <b>leading</b> <b>unit,</b> the 2nd Otago Battalion, filling its depleted ranks, but were also held up by the wire. Some parties, led by subalterns and non-commissioned officers, managed to breach the wire and attack the German pillboxes beyond, but when their leaders were killed, the survivors began to dig in.

500|$|With Varsity a success, the 6th Airborne Division {{was ordered}} by Major General Matthew Ridgway, {{commander}} of U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, to advance eastwards. It {{was supported by}} the 6th Guards Tank Brigade, and many of the airborne troops used unconventional transport during the advance, including captured German staff cars, prams and even horses. Hill requisitioned a motorcycle for his batman and travelled alongside the 3rd Parachute Brigade as it advanced; at one point his batman stopped the motorcycle and relieved a captured German colonel of his binoculars before driving off again. Hill disapproved of battlefield looting and admonished his batman, although eventually relented by stating [...] "If you can get me a pair , you can keep them!" [...] At midnight, 27/28 March the division came under the control of British VIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Evelyn Barker, and became part of the general Allied advance through Germany towards the Baltic Sea, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade as the division's <b>leading</b> <b>unit.</b> German resistance continued to be heavy, but the division managed to advance at a rapid pace despite this, with the brigade at one point advancing fifteen miles in twenty-four hours, with eighteen of those being spent in combat. By early April the 6th Airborne reached the River Weser, with the brigade approaching it near the town of Minden, accompanied by armoured support; as it did so, the brigade found itself moving parallel to several German tanks, with Hill sitting on the rear of one of the British tanks. Both sides opened fire, but did little damage, the two German tanks managing to outpace the brigade.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} the M1s {{comprised}} the entire electric fleet, supplemented by 174 new M3 cars between 1985 and 1986. The newer, postwar single-level electric MU cars {{were converted to}} operate behind diesels, joining the postwar diesel-hauled coaches already in that service whose HVAC systems were converted from steam heating to head-end power (HEP). A modified type of push-pull operation {{was introduced to the}} diesel trains, using retired first-generation freight diesels from other railroads (mostly ALCO FAs) converted into control units capable only of HEP generation and controlling the locomotive {{at the other end of}} the train. The first 16 control cabs were created by GE using the last 16 Alco-GE FA-1 and FA-2 units in existence, all of which had been traded in to GE by the last four railroads to operate them: the Penn Central, Louisville & Nashville, Spokane, Portland and Seattle, and Western Maryland. Many of these units survive today in rail museums. New diesels for general use were purchased to replace the LIRR's ALCO Century 420s and other diesels, in the form of GP38-2s and MP15ACs. The latter switchers were innovatively used as [...] "pull-pull" [...] pairs on each end of short off-peak trains on the Oyster Bay Branch and the Greenport shuttle, whereby the <b>leading</b> <b>unit</b> would provide the motive power, and the trailing unit would supply the train with HEP, the process being reversed at the terminal.
