40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether mifepristone (RU 486) {{is more effective}} than <b>laminaria</b> <b>tent</b> in shortening the induction-abortion interval in termination of second trimester pregnancies with gemeprost. Design: Prospective randomised comparative trial. Setting: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in a University teaching hospital. Subjects: Sixty-two women undergoing termination of pregnancy in the second trimester. Interventions: The women were allocated at random to one of the two treatment groups. The first group received 600 mg of mifepristone 36 h before administration of gemeprost. In the second group, a medium-sized <b>laminaria</b> <b>tent</b> was inserted 12 h before gemeprost. The pregnancies in both groups were terminated with vaginal gemeprost, 1 mg every 3 h up to a maximum of 5 mg/day. Main outcome measures: Induction-abortion intervals, amount of gemeprost required, and incidence of side effects. Results: The median induction-abortion interval in the mifepristone group (7. 5 h) was significantly shorter than that in the <b>laminaria</b> <b>tent</b> group (11 h) and significantly fewer gemeprost pessaries were required. There {{was no significant difference in}} the amount of narcotic analgesics required or the incidence of side effects between the two groups. Conclusions: Mifepristone {{is more effective than}} <b>laminaria</b> <b>tent</b> in shortening the induction-abortion interval in termination of second trimester pregnancies. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Centre hospitalier universitaire de Québec, Quebec QC Objective: Our {{objective}} was to compare the use of misoprostol to that of laminaria tents for dilatation of the cervix before a surgical elective abortion (EAB) during the first trimester, {{with regard to the}} pain caused (1) during insertion, for both methods, (2) immediately before the EAB, and (3) one hour after the procedure. Methods: One hundred two women were recruited at Clinique de planification des naissances du Centre hospitalier universitaire de Québec, CHUL pavilion, between March 1, 2006 and March 1, 2007, for a tracking study. Fifty-three women were given 400 µg of misoprostol intravaginally, three to four hours before the EAB, and a <b>laminaria</b> <b>tent</b> was inserted in 49 women, 16 to 24 hours before the EAB.

30|$|However, it is {{important}} to appreciate that there are three types of osmotic dilators available for use to ripen the cervix. The first type of device, consisting of naturally derived products, includes the <b>Laminaria</b> <b>tent,</b> which is made from the stems of Laminaria japonica or Laminaria digitata (brown sea weed), and is the type most commonly used. It swells in the presence of liquid and ripens the cervix physically and chemically, by exerting a radial force during swelling, and this outward pressure stimulates the release of F-class prostaglandins, achieving a clinical effect in between 3 and 24  h [16, 17]. The second and third types of osmotic dilators are synthetic ones with the potential advantages of assured sterility, consistency of length and shape, and, theoretically, greater predictability of effect. The second type of device, e.g. Dilapan, is a synthetic hygroscopic polyacrylonitrile (hypan plastic polymer) rod-shaped dilator, acting primarily mechanically and having a notable clinical effect within 2 – 4  h [18]. The third type is Lamicel, a sterile, polyvinyl sponge impregnated with magnesium sulphate, which can reversibly decouple collagen cross-linkages in cervical stroma and increase sensitivity to prostaglandin E 2 [19]. The predominant chemical action with no outward pressure on the cervical wall permits it to be placed into a narrow, stenotic cervix and swell with a minor hourglass effect [20]. These osmotic dilators have been used to ripen the cervix for induced abortion as well as to overcome stenosis in non-pregnant women requiring hysteroscopy [13 – 15, 17 – 19].|$|E

40|$|Anaphylaxis {{following}} laminaria insertion rarely occurs {{but may be}} {{a life-threatening}} condition. <b>Laminaria</b> <b>tents,</b> prepared from natural sea kelp, are commonly used prior to elective termination of pregnancy to achieve cervical dilatation. We report herein two cases of anaphylaxis caused by IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to laminaria. Two women, each of whom had undergone at least one previous abortion where a laminaria had been utilized, developed anaphylactic reaction following laminaria insertion. The reaction included urticaria, nausea, breathing difficulty, and hypotension. The patients subsequently underwent skin testing and measurement of serum specific IgE level to laminaria extract, and were shown to elicit positive responses to laminaria. The implication and impact of laminaria allergy on gynecologic procedures are significant and this allergy {{should be included in}} the list of differential diagnoses for hypersensitive reaction in gynecologic procedures...|$|R

40|$|Dennis G Chambers, Robin J Willcourt, Anthony R Laver, Jane K Baird, Wye Y HerbertThe Queen Elizabeth Hospital Pregnancy Advisory Centre, Woodville Park, Adelaide, South Australia, AustraliaMethods: A {{retrospective}} analysis of medical records of three consecutive cohorts of women. All cohorts received a digoxin feticide injection on Day 1. Two cohorts {{were treated with}} laminaria, cohort A of 151 women over 1 &ndash; 2 days and cohort B of 52 women over 1 &ndash; 3 days, and cohort C of 151 women was treated with Dilapan-S over 1 &ndash; 3 days. Results: Adequate cervical priming for dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;E) on Day 2 was achieved in 98 % of the Dilapan-S cohort and 56 % of cohort A and 40 % of the cohort B laminaria cohorts. Return to theater for D&amp;E 3 &ndash; 4 hours after dilator insertion on Day 2 occurred in 62. 3 % of Dilapan-S cohort C and 9. 3 % of cohort A and 4 % of cohort B laminaria cohorts (P = 0. 001). A mean D&amp;E theater time of 19 minutes for laminaria cohort A was reduced by 10. 1 % in the Dilapan-S cohort C (P = 0. 02). The incidence of unscheduled overnight delivery outside the clinic was 0 % for Dilapan-S and 1. 3 % for cohort A and 3. 8 % for cohort B laminaria cohorts (P = 0. 14). Conclusion: Dilapan-S osmotic dilators are superior to laminaria in producing more cervical priming and dilatation in a shorter time. This enables 17 &ndash; 22 week D&amp;E procedures {{to be carried out}} in fewer days and in shorter theater times. They also eliminate the risk of an unscheduled overnight delivery outside the clinic.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{factors associated}} with increased risk of immediate complications from induced abortion. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a provincial database. SETTING: All Ontario general hospitals in which abortions are performed and all free-standing abortion clinics in Ontario. POPULATION: Women in Ontario aged 15 to 44 years who underwent an induced abortion in the province (without concurrent sterilization) between Jan. 1, 1992, and Dec. 31, 1993. OUTCOME MEASURES: Recording of complications {{at the time of}} the procedure, gestational age, type of procedure, place of abortion (hospital or clinic), and patient's age, parity and history of previous abortion (spontaneous or induced). RESULTS: During the study period 83 469 abortions were performed that met our inclusion criteria. Immediate complications were reported in 571 cases (0. 7 %). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that, after other variables were controlled for, the patient's age, parity and history of previous abortions (spontaneous or induced) were not significant risk factors for immediate complications; however, gestational age, method of abortion and place of abortion were significant risk factors (p < 0. 001). The odds ratio (OR) for having a complication from abortion was 1. 3 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 02 to 1. 63) between 9 and 12 weeks, compared with having one after abortion at 9 weeks or earlier, and increased to 3. 3 (95 % CI 2. 23 to 5. 00) after abortion between 17 and 20 weeks. Compared with surgical dilatation and curettage (D&C), instillation of saline and instillation of prostaglandins were more likely to be associated with immediate complications (OR 24. 0, 95 % CI 13. 22 to 43. 70, and OR 11. 7, 95 % CI 6. 43 to 21. 18, respectively), whereas both suction D&C and insertion of a <b>laminaria</b> <b>tent</b> were less likely to be associated with immediate complications (OR 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 26 to 0. 67, and OR 0. 3, 95 % CI 0. 19 to 0. 52, respectively). Compared with women who had an abortion in a free-standing clinic, the risk for immediate complications was greater among those who had an abortion in a hospital, especially a teaching hospital (OR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 38 to 2. 58), a nonteaching hospital with 200 to 399 acute care beds (OR 3. 1, 95 % CI 2. 27 to 4. 21) and a nonteaching hospital with fewer than 200 acute care beds (OR 5. 9, 95 % CI 4. 04 to 8. 64). CONCLUSION: The risk of immediate complications from induced abortion is very low. Unlike in previous studies, the woman's age, parity and history of previous spontaneous or induced abortions were not found to be risk factors. However, advancing gestational age and procedures involving instillation of saline or prostaglandins were predictive factors of immediate complications...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} randomized double-blind placebo-controlled {{trial was}} conducted in 13 subjects {{to find out whether}} mifepristone treatment could facilitate termination of second trimester pregnancy by sulprostone. The women received either 600 mg oral mifepristone or placebo tablets 36 hours before the administration of intramuscular sulprostone 0. 5 mg every 6 hours. The median interval between the administration of sulprostone and abortion in the mifepristone group (4. 6 hours) was significantly shorter than that in the placebo group (20 hours). The amount of sulprostone required was also significantly less in the mifepristone group. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of side effects or analgesic requirement between the two groups. We conclude that oral mifepristone is useful in facilitating termination of second trimester pregnancies by sulprostone. | Termination of second trimester pregnancies has been related to side effects. ATtempts have been made to shorten the induction-abortion interval and to lower dosage of the prostaglandins in order to reduce the incidence of side effects. In this study, 13 second trimester patients 18 - 35 years of age were administered mifepristone before the procedure which called for administration of intramuscular sulprostone; the trial was prospective and randomized and called for double-blind placebo controls. The objective was to determine whether administration of mifepristone would facilitate termination of the pregnancy. 6 women received 600 mg oral mifepristone in an unmarked packet 36 hours before the administration of. 5 mg sulprostone intramuscularly every 6 hours until the patient felt strong uterine contractions. 7 women received a placebo in an unmarked packet at the same time as those receiving mifepristone followed by sulprostone. Side effects, uterine contractions, blood pressure, and pulse were recorded every 2 hours. There were no significant differences in mean age of patients or in weight and height. Women were excluded who had any significant past or present medical disorder, who were using prescription drugs regularly, who were nursing or using hormonal contraception during or just before conception, or who were using an intrauterine device. The statistically significant results showed that the induction-abortion interval was shorter and the amount of sulprostone lower in the mifepristone group. 3 patients in the placebo groups did not abort within 24 hours and required administration of oxytocin and further injections of sulprostone. 2 patients (28. 6 %) in the placebo group required uterine evacuation under general anesthesia, and 4 patients (66. 7 %) in the placebo group required uterine evacuation due to incomplete abortions, which was not a statistically significant difference. Temperature highs were similar in both groups, but the amount of vomiting or diarrhea and the analgesic requirement was greater in the placebo group, but not significantly so. There was early termination of the study because of unexpected cardiovascular complications in another study; intravenous injection of sulprostone is recommended. The advantages of mifepristone are that it requires no special skills and avoids the complications of the <b>laminaria</b> <b>tent.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

MAIN RESULTS: For this update we have included a further 27 studies. The review includes 71 randomised controlled trials (total of 9722 women), ranging from 39 to 588 women per study. Most studies reported on caesarean section, all other outcomes are based on substantially fewer women. Four additional studies are ongoing. Mechanical methods versus no treatment: one study (48 woman) reported on women who did not achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0. 90; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 64 to 1. 26). The risk of caesarean section was similar between groups (six studies; 416 women, RR 1. 00; 95 % CI 0. 76 to 1. 30). There were no cases of severe neonatal and maternal morbidity. Mechanical methods versus vaginal PGE 2 (17 studies; 1894 woman) : The proportion of women who did not achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours was not significantly different (three studies; 586 women RR 1. 72; 95 % CI 0. 90 to 3. 27); however, for the subgroup of multiparous women the risk of not achieving delivery within 24 hours was higher (one study; 147 women RR 4. 38, 95 % CI 1. 74 to 10. 98), with no increase in caesarean sections (RR 1. 19, 95 % CI 0. 62 - 2. 29). Compared with intracervical PGE 2 (14 studies; 1784 women and misoprostol {{there was no significant difference}} in the proportion of women not achieving vaginal delivery within 24 hours. Mechanical methods reduced the risk of hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes when compared with vaginal prostaglandins: vaginal PGE 2 (eight studies; 1203 women, RR 0. 16; 95 % CI 0. 06 to 0. 39) and misoprostol (3 % versus 9 %) (nine studies; 1615 women, RR 0. 37; 95 % CI 0. 25 to 0. 54). Risk of caesarean section between mechanical methods and prostaglandins was comparable. Serious neonatal and maternal morbidity were infrequently reported and did not differ between the groups. Mechanical methods compared with induction with oxytocin (reduced the risk of caesarean section (five studies; 398 women, RR 0. 62; 95 % CI 0. 42 to 0. 90). The likelihood of vaginal delivery within 24 hours was not reported. Hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes was reported in one study (200 participants), and did not differ. There were no reported cases of severe maternal or neonatal morbidity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Induction of labour using mechanical methods results in similar caesarean section rates as prostaglandins, for a lower risk of hyperstimulation. Mechanical methods do not increase the overall number of women not delivered within 24 hours, however the proportion of multiparous women who did not achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours was higher when compared with vaginal PGE 2.
