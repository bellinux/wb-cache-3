40|$|The {{main tasks}} of central banks are to secure price and {{financial}} stability. These objectives can, {{in times of}} crises, conflict with one another, and the central bank may have to renounce {{one of them in}} order to secure the other. In a monetary union, this trade-off can be exacerbated by the presence of highly indebted countries or by the risk of <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies.</b> This paper offers a simple theoretical model that captures the trade-off. Different fiscal institutions are compared in order to evaluate their impact on the conduct of monetary policy. More specifically, the fiscal criteria of the Maastricht Treaty and the Pact for Stability and Growth in Europe are analyzed in light of this model. Fiscal mechanisms exist to help prevent or minimize the risk of fiscal crises and the corresponding risk of central bank financing and inflation.

This paper explores the determinants of such differences among countries slated for EU accession. Regression estimates suggest that economic and institutional fundamentals do not provide a full explanation. An alternative explanation lies in the political economy of the accession process, and a game-theoretic model illustrates why a country with a stronger bargaining position might have an incentive to deviate from convergence to the Maastricht criteria. The model generates alternative fiscal policy regimes-allowing for regime shifts-depending on country characteristics and EU policies.

40|$|The use of {{monetary}} policy in India has been constrained by a <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> and capital flows. Capital inflows {{have the potential}} to cause a Dutch Disease-type situation. The RBI has carried out sterilized intervention to prevent this. In spite of this, the trade balance and, more often than not, the current account continue to be in deficit. Thus the real exchange rate, in spite of the intervention, is inconsistent with external balance (defined as a manageable current account deficit). The problem of capital flows is a self-inflicted pain. The authorities could have kept a lid on capital flows, allowing only the most urgent inflows from a growth standpoint. It would have had a competitive edge in manufacturing. This would have allowed it to expand labor-intensive industry and help mitigate the massive poverty levels. ...|$|E

50|$|After a short respite in 1991-1996, when {{measures}} taken in 1993 led to economic stabilization, a relatively stable exchange rate, low inflation, sustainable <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies,</b> and growth, Suriname's economic situation deteriorated from 1996 to the present. This {{was due in}} large part to <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> of the Wijdenbosch government, which, in the face of lower Dutch development aid, financed its deficit through credit extended by the central bank. As a consequence, the parallel market for foreign exchange soared so that by the end of 1998, the premium of the parallel market rate over the official rate was 85%. Since over 90% of import transactions took place at the parallel rate, inflation took off, with 12-month inflation growing from 0.5% at the end of 1996, to 23% at the end of 1998, and 113% at the end of 1999. The government also instituted a regime of stringent economic controls over prices, the exchange rate, imports, and exports, in an effort to contain the adverse efforts of its economic policies. The cumulative impact of soaring inflation, an unstable exchange rate, and falling real incomes led to a political crisis.|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that political factors (elections, partisan motives, and bureaucracy) are crucial in determining economic policies and in turn economic outcomes. 2 The early literature based on rational expectations focused on the link between elections and fiscal policy.

Persson and Svensson (1989) and Alesina and Tabellini (1990) developed two-party models to show how fiscal and public debt policy can be used strategically by the incumbent party to influence the choices of its successor.

40|$|New Member States (NMS) {{coming from}} central {{planning}} are often advised against early Euro adoption {{because of their}} rigid labour markets. But are labour markets so rigid in these countries? We argue in this paper {{that this is not}} the case. Labour market institutions are no more “rigid ” than among current EMU Members whilst wage bargaining institutions are actually better equipped for microeconomic wage flexibility than in the EU- 15. NMS also achieved substantial reallocation of jobs and workers in the transition to markets, display relatively large job turnover rates and are reducing their regional mismatch. The view that NMS have rigid labour markets is fuelled by the low job content of growth in the region. But there is evidence that the latter is related to productivity enhancing job destruction in the aftermath of prolonged labour hoarding. Reduced-form employment equations estimated in this paper also suggest that tight <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies,</b> rather than being harmful to job creation, may actually improve the employment performance of the region. Our interpretation of this result is that <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> weaken the confidence of investors and crowd-out private employment growth through generous pay rises to civil servants...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine closely the {{financial}} events following the Mexican peso devaluation to uncover new lessons {{about the nature}} of financial crises. We explore the question of why, during 1995, some emerging markets were hit by financial crises while others were not. To this end, we ask whether there are some fundamentals that help explain the variation in financial crises across countries or whether the variation just reflects contagion. We present a simple model identifying three factors that determine whether a country is more vulnerable to suffer a financial crisis: a high real exchange rate appreciation, a recent lending boom, and low reserves. We find that for a set of 20 emerging markets, differences in these fundamentals go far in explaining why during 1995 some emerging markets were hit by financial crises while others were not. We also find that alternative hypotheses that have been put forth to explain such crises often {{do not seem to be}} supported by the data, such as high current account deficits, excessive capital inflows and <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies.</b> ...|$|R

This dissertation consists of three chapters. Chapter 1 reviews SSA's history of democracy and economic policy since independence, including a literature review. It argues that while SSA's disappointing economic performance is, in part, due to its difficult geography, high incidence of disease, and colonial legacy, {{the main reason for}} Africa's woes until mid- 1990 s seem to be the failure of economic policies adopted by most SSA governments after independence. Chapter 2 examines SSA's recent economic growth acceleration, and finds that such acceleration is mainly due to better institutions and policies adopted by most SSA governments (as a result of more open and democratic societies), as well as lower incidence of armed conflicts, whereas the role of aid and terms of trade is relatively limited. Chapter 3 reviews the impact on <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> of competitive presidential elections in SSA during 1980 - 2005, and finds that (i) the magnitude of political budget cycles has declined over time as a result of stronger checks and balances and more experienced electorates; and (ii) that <b>looser</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> do not help reelect incumbents...|$|R
40|$|Debates about {{economic}} policy in Britain have {{been dominated by}} claims that sovereign debt problems are due to <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> and excessive spending rather than volatile capital flows and flawed monetary policy. There are strong grounds for believing that these stories are largely nonsense, yet they inform policy and are widely believed among mass publics, and have proved almost impossible to refute in everyday political discourse.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{issues in}} the current debate over coordination between fiscal and monetary policies. Section I 1 uses the traditional targets-instruments approach to assess the potential gains from greater coordination. Since greater coordination is often equated with looser money and tighter fiscal policy, two econometric models of the economy are used to estimate the quantitative importance of the policy mix. Expectational effects that arise from the government budget constraint are also analyzed. Section III shows that our attitudes toward the non- coordination problem may be quite different depending on why policies were not coordinated to begin with, and argues that there are plausible circumstances under which it may be better to have uncoordinated policies. Section IV turns {{to the design of}} a coordination system. The game-theoretic aspects of having two independent authorities are stressed, and I offer a general reason to expect that uncoordinated behavior will result in tight money and <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> even when both parties would prefer easy money and tight fiscal policy. Finally, Section V considers the old "rules versus discretion" debate from the particular perspective of this paper. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{calls for}} Plan B mount, it is {{increasingly}} being suggested that the UK is making the same mistakes as in the Great Depression of the 1930 s by not expanding <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> This paper demonstrates that the UK government in the 1930 s did not make serious <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> errors. The evidence suggests that increasing government borrowing in the 1930 s would not have significantly {{changed the course of}} the economy. If <b>looser</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> would not have made much difference to the course of the Great Depression, there are reasons to believe that it would be even less effective in current circumstances. Developed, indebted, open economies with floating currencies respond least well to increased government borrowing: the UK economy fits that description. Legitimate debate surrounds the conduct of monetary policy. Whilst it is plausible that a loose monetary policy is appropriate in the current circumstances, drawing on a comparison with the 1920 s, this paper shows that, if the crash of 2008 permanently reduced the supply potential of the UK economy, loose monetary policy may simply lead to higher inflation with no benefit to output. There is, therefore, no case for Plan B where such a plan involves raising planned government borrowing. Indeed, if a fiscal stimulus is applied and has short-term benefits, there is a danger that taxes will have to rise to reverse it just as the economy recovers. It is important to note that, regardless of whether the economy has suffered a temporary or a permanent loss of capacity, supply side liberalisation could be a very important complement to fiscal austerity...|$|R

Both theory and history present us with ambiguous responses. A nice summary of long-standing arguments that democratic governance is not sufficient for the task in the long run is presented by Alexander Tytler, an 18 th century Scot historian: A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority of voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse out of the public treasury.

This paper shows how episodes of <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> have been minor {{compared to other}} Latin American countries. The near-crisis of the early 1980 s was addressed in a timely way through a sharp fiscal adjustment. An analysis shows this adjustment {{to have been a}} combination of good luck and fundamental policy changes, with more emphasis on the latter. The means of fiscal adjustment chosen were sometimes suboptimal from the standpoint of long-run growth, which will eventually require some fiscal reform to reverse some of the measures implemented during 1985 - 89. The analysis of this paper shows a close relationship between the means of financing of the fiscal deficit and macroeconomic outcomes in Colombia. A simulation model traces how money-financed and domestic debt-financed fiscal deficits translate into inflation and the real interest rate. It traces the relationship between externally-financed fiscal deficits and the real exchange rate and finds that {{a good deal of the}} changes in the real exchange rates over 1975 - 87 are attributable to fiscal policy.

It finds that on average small states have larger governments and higher public debt. Although there are intrinsic factors that explain why governments are bigger in small states, those with smaller governments and lower public debt tend to grow faster and are less vulnerable. Large fiscal adjustments, primarily through expenditure restraint, can underpin growth, although sometimes other elements can also impact.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} issues of capital controls and informal economy. Both subjects have evoked considerable interest in both academic environments and policy circles, especially given their importance for developing countries. The dissertation is structured as follows. Chapter 1 analyzes how exchange rate regimes influence fiscal discipline. This important question has typically been addressed using models assuming perfect capital mobility, even though capital controls are pervasive in developing countries. This chapter analyzes the effects of capital controls on fiscal performance by focusing on dual exchange rate regimes. In a model in which <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is endogenously determined by a non-benevolent fiscal authority, the paper shows that capital controls induce impatient politicians to have <b>looser</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> than under fixed and flexible regimes operating under perfect capital mobility. While capital controls enable politicians to enjoy the same temporarily low inflation as fixed regimes (since the commercial exchange rate {{is assumed to be}} fixed) lax <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> also result in a temporary consumption boom which is regarded as desirable by impatient politicians. The consumption boom occurs because, as households attempt to get rid of unwanted real money balances, the real domestic interest rate falls. Empirical analysis confirms that capital controls lead to larger primary deficits than fixed and flexible regimes. The study considers a dynamic panel data specification and controls for endogeneity by using a standard instrumental variables approach and natural disaster events to evaluate the response of <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> under diverse regimes. Chapter 2 estimates the size of the informal economy for the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) countries and 26 mainly Latin American countries in the early 2000 s, being the first study to address this issue for the ECCU economies and many other Central American and Caribbean countries. Using a structural equation modeling approach we find that a stringent tax system and regulatory environment, higher inflation and dominance of the agriculture sector are key factors in determining the size of the informal economy. The results also confirm that a higher degree of informality reduces labor unionization, the number of contributors to social security schemes and enrollment rates in education...|$|R

Upon closer scrutiny, opponents of a single currency appear to be less consistent and less rational in their responses than proponents. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1997...|$|R
40|$|A slow {{recovery}} is {{expected from the}} current recession. Since reaching a trough in the September quarter of 1990, real gross domestic product (GDP) has followed a flat path {{which is likely to}} continue through to the September quarter of 1991. A slow recovery may then commence in the December quarter of 1991. This is consistent with real GDP growth of - 0. 9 per cent in 1990 - 91 followed by 2. 4 per cent in 1991 - 92 and around 3 per cent per annum to the mid- 1990 s compared with 'normal' growth of 2. 5 per cent per annum. This {{recovery is}} likely to see the unemployment rate at over 10 per cent for most of 1991 - 92, before moving to around 8 per cent by the mid- 1990 s. Inflation may fall sharply from a peak of 8. 0 per cent in 1989 - 90 to a trough of 3 to 4 per cent in 199 1 - 92, due to the recession and movements in oil prices. With a slow recovery, inflation may increase to 4 to 5 per cent per annum in the medium term. The current account deficit has fallen from 5. 9 per cent of GDP in 1989 - 90 to a likely level of 4. 1 per cent in 1990 - 91, but part of this gain is cyclical rather than structural. Thus the deficit is expected to increase to around 5 per cent during recovery and remain flat to the mid- 1990 s, implying steady increases in the ratio of foreign debt to GDP. Looser monetary policy would erode part of the forecast sustained reduction in inflation. <b>Looser</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> would lead to a higher current account deficit.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two main}} {{aspects of the}} interaction between fiscal and monetary policy in emerging market economies. First, it explores the interest rate-inflation relationship in economies with different levels of external and domestic public debt using panel- and crosssection data. The results show that interest rate-inflation elasticity weakens with debt/GDP and external debt/GDP. Second, it utilizes high-frequency data from Brazil, Turkey, and Poland to examine how market-determined variables react to economic news. The results suggest that when vulnerabilities are high, budget news has the most significant impact on country spreads and interest rates, and the impact of monetary policy is weakened.

40|$|This paper surveys policy {{responses}} {{in recent years}} to capital inflows in a diverse group of countries that are represented by the Netherlands at the IMF Executive Board. Based on the findings from cross-country empirical literature, the paper distills some guiding principles for policy responses to excessive capital inflows, depending on country-specific circumstances and with a particular focus on fiscal policy. In addition to considering the conventional macroeconomic and structural policy tools, the paper also discusses the role of microfiscal policies in affecting the size and the composition of capital inflows. While conditions in these countries have changed very recently, the policy principles remain salient.

40|$|The paper {{traces the}} Baltics’ {{adjustment}} strategy during the 2008 - 09 global financial crisis. The abrupt {{end to the}} externally-financed domestic demand boom triggered a severe output collapse, bringing per capita income levels back to 2005 / 06 levels. In response to this shock, the Baltics undertook an internal devaluation that relied on unprecedented fiscal and nominal wage adjustment, steps to preserve financial sector stability as well as complementary efforts to facilitate voluntary private debt restructuring. One-and-half years on, the strategy is making good progress but not yet complete. Confidence in the exchange rate was maintained, the banking system was supported by its parent banks, external imbalances and inflation have largely disappeared, competitiveness is improving, and fiscal deficits are gradually being brought back towards pre-crisis levels. However, amid record levels of unemployment, further reforms are needed to foster a return to more balanced growth, fiscal sustainability, and a healthier banking system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the impact of}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> {{co-ordination}} in a monetary union {{on the size of}} the spending bias, inflation and the optimal degree of conservatism of the central bank. Our main result is that, when the fiscal authorities internalise the spillover effects originating from their <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> stances, the size of the inflation bias decreases. As a result, the optimal degree of conservatism declines as well. Moreover, we show that the Stability Pact can be seen as an optimally designed linear penalty in the utility function of the fiscal authorities. This is able to achieve the same desired result as <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> co-ordination but without an explicit commitment to it.

50|$|Suriname {{elected a}} new {{government}} in May 2000, but until it was replaced, the Wijdenbosch government continued its <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> and monetary <b>policies.</b> By the time it left office, the exchange rate in the parallel market had depreciated further, over 10% of GDP had been borrowed to finance the fiscal deficit, {{and there was a}} significant monetary overhang in the country. The new government dealt with these problems by devaluing the official exchange rate by 88%, eliminating all other exchange rates except the parallel market rate set by the banks and cambios, raising tariffs on water and electricity, and eliminating the subsidy on gasoline. The new administration also rationalized the extensive list of price controls to 12 basic food items. More important, the government ceased all financing from the central bank. It is attempting to broaden its economic base, establish better contacts with other nations and international financial institutions, and reduce its dependence on Dutch assistance. However, to date the government has yet to implement an investment law or to begin privatization of any of the 110 parastatal, nor has it given much indication that it has developed a comprehensive plan to develop the economy.|$|R
40|$|The authors examine Russia's {{macroeconomic}} {{crisis in}} 1992 and 1993, focusing on <b>fiscal</b> and monetary <b>policies.</b> They {{show how the}} large transfers from the government to the enterprise sector exacerbated the crisis. Money creation did not finance the narrow (cash) budget deficit of the government. Rather, money creation financed the huge directed credit programs aimed at specific sectors and enterprises, including assistance to other economies of the former Soviet Union to sustain Russian exports. During 1992 enterprises and households financed this effort with their large flow of savings, but while enterprises largely avoided the inflation tax, households did not. Enterprises benefited most from the <b>loose</b> <b>fiscal</b> and monetary <b>policies</b> of the Russian government in 1992 - 93. The enterprises were net recipients of transfers from the budget and the main beneficiaries of the inflation tax (which nearly offset their own inflation tax payments). The main losers from high inflation were households. As many have noted, inflation in Russia correlates well with past money growth. Real money and the real exchange rate are also closely correlated. Money demand in Russia is well above international comparisons, controlling for inflation and negative interest rates. But the trend of money demand is obviously down. Current levels of monetary financing cannot be maintained without an increase in inflation. Even if the government takes no actions that lower money demand, it will fall anyway as the financial system and households and enterprises adjust to inflation. Banks and enterprises are finding {{ways to reduce the}} float and excess reserves with the central bank. Stabilization of inflation will thus be a race between the authorities'willingness and ability to tighten monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> and the adjustment of enterprises and households to exisiting inflation.
