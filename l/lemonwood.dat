50|$|<b>Lemonwood</b> is {{commonly}} found in escarpment forest and regenerated scrub. Its leaves have a strong lemon scent when crushed. Fragrant yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by small green capsules that take about a year to ripen.|$|E
50|$|In Central Asia, {{the rise}} of the Mongols in {{approximately}} 1000 AD can be partially attributed to the good range and power of the bows of Genghis Khan's hordes. These bows were constructed with laminated <b>lemonwood</b> and bullhorn bonded by an unknown adhesive.|$|E
50|$|Common names include lemon aspen, hard aspen and <b>lemonwood.</b> The true aspens of the Northern Hemisphere {{belong to}} the genus Populus in the willow family Salicaceae. The genus Acronychia {{is a member of}} the rue family Rutaceae, the same family as the genus Citrus which {{contains}} true lemons.|$|E
5000|$|A close {{neighbor}} of Grayson's in Riverside, a scoutmaster and archer, was friends with prominent archers such as Art Young, Saxton Pope, and William [...] "Chief" [...] Compton. Grayson {{made his first}} bow from a <b>lemonwood</b> stave that he won selling tickets to a movie about Art Young's trek across Alaska.|$|E
50|$|The yellow {{lancewood}} tree Calycophyllum candididissimum, {{common names}} <b>lemonwood</b> or degame, {{is from a}} different family (Rubiaceae). It is used {{as an alternative to}} lancewood and is found in tolerable abundance throughout The Guianas, and used by the Amerinds for arrow-points, as well as for spars, beams, etc. Some bowyers use this wood for making longbows.|$|E
50|$|Wood {{engraving}} blocks {{are typically}} made of boxwood or other hardwoods such as <b>lemonwood</b> or cherry. They are expensive to purchase because end-grain wood {{must be a}} section through the trunk or large bough of a tree. Some modern wood engravers use substitutes made of PVC or resin, mounted on MDF, which produce similarly detailed results of a slightly different character.|$|E
50|$|Xymalos monospora (plant family Monimiaceae), {{commonly}} known as <b>lemonwood,</b> is a species of evergreen tree native to Africa, the only species in the genus Xymalos. It is an Afromontane endemic, {{and can be found}} from 900-2700 meters elevation in the highlands of Eastern Africa from Sudan to South Africa, as well as on Mount Cameroon and Bioko in west-central Africa.|$|E
50|$|Wooden {{laminated}} longbows {{can be made}} by gluing {{together two}} or more different pieces of wood. Usually this is done {{to take advantage of the}} inherent properties of different woods: some woods can better withstand compression while others are better at withstanding tension. Examples include hickory and <b>lemonwood,</b> or bamboo and yew longbows: hickory or bamboo is used on the back of the bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting) and so is in tension, while the belly (the part facing the archer when shooting) is made of <b>lemonwood</b> or yew and undergoes compression (see bending for a further explanation of stresses in a bending beam). Traditionally made Japanese yumi are also laminated longbows, made from strips of wood: the core of the bow is bamboo, the back and belly are bamboo or hardwood, and hardwood strips are laminated to the bow's sides to prevent twisting. Ready-made laminated longbows are available for purchase.|$|E
50|$|In November 1989 Manuel Rodriguez, {{a member}} of the <b>Lemonwood</b> Chiques gang, was shot and killed by Arnell Salagubang, {{a member of}} the Satanas gang. Salagubang and Manuel Rodriguez had been arguing in front of Channel Islands High School. Salagubang pulled out a small caliber handgun and shot Rodriguez in the head. Salagubang fled the scene, but a witness was able to get his license plate number. The witness turned the {{information}} over to the police who arrested Salagubang the next day.|$|E
50|$|The second {{installation}} is a FORNSAT (foreign satellite interception) {{station in}} the Thai city of Khon Kaen. It is codenamed INDRA, but has also {{been referred to as}} <b>LEMONWOOD.</b> The station is approximately 40 ha (100 acres) in size and consists of a large 3,700-4,600 m2 (40,000-50,000 ft2) operations building {{on the west side of}} the ops compound and four radome-enclosed parabolic antennas. Possibly two of the radome-enclosed antennas are used for SATCOM intercept and two antennas used for relaying the intercepted material back to NSA. There is also a PUSHER-type circularly-disposed antenna array (CDAA) array just north of the ops compound.|$|E
5000|$|Pittosporum eugenioides, {{common names}} <b>lemonwood</b> or tarata, is {{a species of}} New Zealand native tree. Growing to 12 m tall by 5 m broad, it is conical when young but more rounded in shape when mature. Its leaves are mottled yellow-green with curly edges and a salient bright midrib, and have a strong lemony smell when crushed. It has highly {{fragrant}} clusters of attractive yellow-cream flowers in spring, followed by distinctive black seed capsules. It is found throughout New Zealand's North and South Islands along forest margins and stream banks from sea level to 600 m. [...] It is New Zealand's largest pittosporum.|$|E
50|$|Dactylanthus taylorii is a round warty tuber-like stem (up to 50 cm wide) or {{haustorium}} with no roots, {{which draws}} nutrients from {{the roots of}} its host. Its leaves do not photosynthesise, and are reduced to floral bracts. Some plants have been aged in excess of 30 years old. Dactylanthus prefers damp but not waterlogged soil, and is often found {{at the head of}} small streams. It parasitises about 30 species of native hardwood trees and shrubs, preferring those growing in secondary forest on the margin of mature podocarp forest. Common hosts include pate or seven-finger (Schefflera digitata), five-finger (Pseudopanax arboreus), <b>lemonwood</b> (Pittosporum eugenioides), and putaputaweta (Carpodetus serratus).|$|E
50|$|One of the world's oldest green belts, the Town Belt {{was planned}} in Scotland {{at the time}} of the advent of the Otago {{settlement}} in 1848. Residential areas outside the belt became separate boroughs, and were not amalgamated with Dunedin until much later. The town belt now forms a break between the city's inner and outer suburbs. The belt was originally a combination of native bush and scrubland, but is now largely replanted forest and open parkland. Many species of plant can be found in the belt, including tree fuchsia, <b>lemonwood,</b> lancewood, manuka, and broadleaf, and the forested area is home to many species of birds, including some uncommon and endangered species such as the kereru, eastern rosella, bellbird, tomtit, tui, rifleman, morepork, and shining cuckoo, and kotare.|$|E
5000|$|Arranged {{around the}} central hall are grand public rooms meant for entertaining. To {{one side is}} the Reception Room, with gilded wallpaper, quarter-sawn oak paneling, and Tiffany fixtures, {{furnished}} with a <b>lemonwood</b> sideboard and olivewood reception table commissioned in Florence. The pink and green Music Room is anchored at each end by a grand piano; the Green Room reflects the sensibilities of Mrs. Cruikshank in its gold leaf and garlands, lace and velvet drapes, and white onyx fireplace. Friend and writer Mark Twain guest of honor on his last visit to Hannibal addressed 300 guests and Hannibal citizens from the double staircase {{to the second floor}} during his visit in 1902. The Moorish Room provides the de rigueur eclecticism embraced by the period L.C. Tiffany lighting fixtures and stained glass windows." ...|$|E
5000|$|The 26 was {{powered by}} a single engine, mounted above the {{trailing}} edge and driving a pusher propeller. Although the 26 inherited the engine of the AEREON III—apparently a four-cylinder McCulloch of —it appears to have had three different propellers {{over the course of}} the test program. After the aircraft experienced difficulty in getting out of ground effect, [...] "a propeller of a different pitch" [...] was fitted. This second propeller was a [...] "virtually unique" [...] example, made of <b>lemonwood,</b> that had been used by Igor Bensen in an unsuccessful attempt on the autogyro speed record. After further testing indicated the 26 to be underpowered, a third propeller was carved to order from yellow birch by Sensenich Propeller and fitted in time for the 26's second series of flight tests in 1971.|$|E
50|$|Despite damage, {{distinct}} plant communities (tree fern, ridge, lowland, valley floor, boulder slope, {{coastal and}} montane exposed and sheltered) remain. The Botanical Society identified 127 indigenous species from forest above 300 m and 264 below that level, including chain fern, spring clubmoss (puakarimu), star fern, hen & chickens fern, hanging spleenwort, crown fern, thread fern, miniature tree fern (Blechnum fraseri), silver fern, mamaku, soft tree fern, golden tree fern, rough tree fern, strap fern, water fern, filmy fern, mangemange, ring fern, fragrant fern, shield fern, bracken, titipo, climbing shield fern, kidney fern, titoki, karapapa, makomako, rangiora, bindweed, putaputawētā, clematis, twiggy coprosma, karaka, prickly mingimingi, grass tree, hīnau, parataniwha, hangehange, kapuka, puka vine, hebe, pigeonwood, poroporo, kowhai, aka, perching lily, Easter orchid, blueberry, tree daisy, jasmine vine, kiekie, <b>lemonwood,</b> rice grasses, pepper tree, supplejack, gloxinia and hook grass.|$|E
50|$|Castle Hills {{has its own}} Police, Fire, and Public Works departments. The Fire Department is a First Responder {{organization}} staffed with Firefighter/EMT(Basic and Paramedics). Acadian Ambulance Service is the EMS provider for City of Castle Hills. Castle Hills Fire Departments {{responds with}} Acadian EMS to all Fire and EMS calls. The City of Castle Hills also has a small green-space, known as the Castle Hills Commons, located on <b>Lemonwood</b> Drive between the Fire Department and City Hall. City Hall {{is located in a}} building formerly used as a church. Drinking water is provided to residents of the city by the San Antonio Water System. Most of the properties in Castle Hills are single family residences, many located on large lots. Many were built in the early 1950s. Ranch style architecture is predominant. There are several retail establishments in Castle Hills, mostly located along Military Highway. Also located within Castle Hills is the McGimsey Boy Scout Camp, a 140 acre park for BSA use. The city was ranked the 5th best place in Texas to start a business by a 2016 Fundera study.|$|E

40|$|Transplanting native {{seedlings}} is {{a widely}} used restoration tool to enhance biodiversity in urban areas. Due to labour and economic needs of this tool, {{it is crucial to}} maximise the survival rates of the transplanted seedlings. In this research, I monitored, over a six month period, the status of wineberry (Aristotelia serrata), cabbage tree (Cordyline australis) and <b>lemonwood</b> (Pittosporum eugenioides) seedlings in their initial years after transplanting. The seedlings, up to 4 years old, were located in 11 forest re-vegetation sites in Wellington city, New Zealand. Using mixed effects models to predict the mortality probability of each species, I analyse the relative importance that variables (e. g. soil conditions or grass competition) have in the mortality of the seedlings. <b>Lemonwood</b> seedlings experienced the lowest mortality rates (< 2 %), independent of age. The models predicting probability of mortality of wineberry and cabbage tree indicate that grass competition and water availability are crucial variables in the mortality of these species during the initial 6 months after transplanting. Combinations of plant size (e. g. height) and certain environmental variables (e. g. soil conditions or slope) crucially affect mortality of wineberry and cabbage trees from one to three years of age. Based on these results, I provide recommendations, such as appropriate planting date and ideal length of maintenance tasks, to maximise survival rates of native plants within the first years after transplanting. A longer monitoring period and similar research of other species are required to assist forest re-vegetation groups in Wellington city achieving more cost- and labour-efficient re-vegetation management...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if re-teaching key phonemic first grade principles using Phonics for Reading I to Intensive first grade students can effectively be used to improve the learning for all first grade intensive students at <b>Lemonwood</b> School. This study plans to prove that through increasing each struggling first grade student's phonemic skills the need for future interventions decreases significantly. The paper will measure the success of the program Phonics for Reading with struggling first graders through data collected during benchmark assessments, and through on-going assessments that are incorporated into the Phonics for Reading program. I am also interested in seeing if the classroom teacher, parent, and student perceive the achieved success that is occurring...|$|E
40|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV), {{the most}} destructive virus of citrus, is a quarantine pathogen in Greece. Since 2000, several accidental imports of infected propagation material {{have been detected}} in the country, and while eradication measures were applied, a few disease foci still remain. CTV isolates were collected from Chania (Crete) and the "lemonwood" of Poros (Peloponnese), and their genetic variability was studied using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). One previously characterized isolate from Argolida grafted on a Mexican lime (GR 3) and two Italian isolates from Calamondin were {{also included in the}} study. ELISA and RT-PCR tests confirmed CTV presence, and SSCP analysis of the virus amplified coat protein (CP) gene was used to separate either distinct virus isolates for cloning the CP gene or variants (haplotypes) for sequencing. Analyses showed that selected variants of four representative isolates clustered into three of the seven defined phylogenetic groups: groups 3 b and 5 (severe isolates) and group M (mild isolates). The prevalent haplotypes detected in the CTV from <b>lemonwood</b> of Poros (GR 9) were in group 3 b, confirming previous results. However, one sequence variant was identified as a recombinant between haplotypes from groups 3 b and 5. Variants of these two groups were also detected in the Italian Calamondin isolate. In the grafted Mexican lime isolate (GR 3) from Argolida, only one haplotype was found which belonged to group M, while in the field isolate from Chania (GR 6) the only haplotype detected was in group 5. This is the first report of variants of group 5 in Greece, suggesting an unknown virus introduction. The prevalence of severe isolates in the area is of particular concern, and implications {{for the future of the}} CTV epidemics are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{eastern side}} of Banks Peninsula was created by eruptions and {{subsequent}} erosion of the Akaroa volcano which was active between 9 and 8 million years ago. Banks Peninsula was completely forested but due to human settlement approximately {{one percent of the}} forested area was left by the early 1900 s. This large-scale removal of forest and the introduction of exotic mammals created a mass extinction of New Zealand’s native biota. The present day landscape is a mixture of bush occupying gullies which either escaped clearance or have regenerated due to more ideal moisture conditions and less disturbance from farming stock. The forested areas consist of either kanuka canopy or a mixed canopy of Fuchsia, mahoe, fivefinger, <b>lemonwood,</b> lacebark, ribbonwood, pigeonwood, kowhai and kaikomako. Within the {{eastern side of}} Banks Peninsula, inland from Le Bons Bay, is an area called Panama Rock, also known as Keller’s Peak. This peak is a trachyte dome with a feeder dike trending away south westwards. An invertebrate study on 19 covenant and reserves on eastern Banks Peninsula found that the Panama Rock remnant had high diversity compared to the others. The Panama Rock remnant was bought by the Joseph Langer Trust to conserve the native flora and fauna of the area and to make it available for the public to enjoy. This research aims to identify the native and pest fauna of the area. Monitoring will assist with management decisions by identifying: which native species are present, species in need of conservation, and exotic pests that need to be eradicated. Baseline surveys will allow the Trust to compare with future years and be able to gauge if their management actions are working. If the Trust is planning to trap introduced mammals at Panama Rock and/or the Stones remnant, monitoring will help to determine whether trapping is helping the native biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} and histology {{are described}} {{for the entire}} male internal reproductive organs of the Mahoenui weta. These show many similarities to other Stenopelmatidae. Testes follicles of Mahoenui weta have the usual structure for Stenopelmatidae with basal sections surrounding {{the ends of the}} vasa efferentia. Epithelial cells of the vasa efferentia, vasa deferentia and seminal vesicle have similar basophilic cytoplasm. Muscle layers are best developed around the seminal vesicle and the accessory glands. The ejaculatory duct has a cuticular intima and is enclosed by a muscular sheath. The development of the external genitalia from the 8 th to the 10 th instar is followed and discussed. The morphology of the external reproductive genitalia is close in form to that of the Rhaphidophoridae. The morphology and histology of the entire female reproductive organs of the Mahoenui weta are described. The morphology and histology of female Mahoenui weta are very similar to those of other Orthoptera. The histology is particularly close to that of the Acrididae. Ovaries and ovarioles have the usual structure for Stenopelmatidae. The follicles are enclosed within a follicular epithelium and the ovarioles are enclosed within an outer ovariole sheath layer of connective tissue. The epithelial cells of the ovarioles and lateral oviducts have basophilic cytoplasm. The vagina is lined with a cuticular intima and is surrounded by a muscular sheath. The external genitalia are described from 8 th to 10 th instar Mahoenui weta and their probable functions are discussed. The behaviour of captive Mahoenui weta was observed, using infra-red time lapse video. Data were recorded from the months of December, January, February, March and July. Weta ate most often in January, March and July, and most mating activity occurred during January. Mahoenui weta were consistently most active at 60 - 80 % of total night-time and showed less activity closer to sunrise or sunset. Mating and moulting are discussed. Incubation time of Mahoenui weta eggs was recorded using eggs laid in a previous study (Richards 1994). The time of hatching and the behaviour of newly hatched nymphs was recorded over several days using video equipment. All eclosion occurred at night, with time of eclosion ranging from 8 pm to 3. 30 am over the three nights. Weta were free of the egg and walked within 17 minutes of the egg appearing on the soil surface. All hatched weta died within three days of eclosion. The external appearance and histology of eggs is described. Mahoenui weta eggs have many features in common with other Orthoptera. Mahoenui weta were exposed to 12 different plant species commonly fed to them in captivity, and present in the Mahoenui weta reserve. The weight of plant material eaten was recorded to determine which species of plant the weta preferred. Mahoenui weta showed the greatest preference for kowhai followed by gorse, broom, buttercup, tawa, karaka, coprosma, camellia, <b>lemonwood,</b> mahoe, houhere and hoheria. There was a marked preference for legume plant species over non-legumes...|$|E
