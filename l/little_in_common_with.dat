5|$|A quasi-sequel, called Dr. Caligari, was {{released}} in 1989, directed by Stephen Sayadian and starring Madeleine Reynal as the granddaughter of the original Dr. Caligari, now running an asylum and performing bizarre hormonal experiments on its patients. The sex-driven story ultimately had <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the original film.|$|E
5|$|In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He {{defeated}} Arthur Denning in {{an election}} for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was widely seen as {{a victory for the}} proponents of autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the professors who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice-chancellor.|$|E
5|$|The early French filmmaker Georges Méliès, who greatly {{admired the}} Baron Munchausen stories, filmed Baron Munchausen's Dream in 1911. Méliès's short silent film, which has <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the Raspe text, follows a {{sleeping}} Baron through a surrealistic succession of intoxication-induced dreams. Méliès {{may also have}} used the Baron's journey to the moon as an inspiration for his well-known 1902 film A Trip to the Moon. In the late 1930s, he planned to collaborate with the Dada artist Hans Richter on a new film version of the Baron stories, but the project was left unfinished at his death in 1938. Richter attempted to complete it the following year, taking on Jacques Prévert, Jacques Brunius, and Maurice Henry as screenwriters, but {{the beginning of the}} Second World War put a permanent halt to the production.|$|E

50|$|While antebellum Southern {{portraiture}} has <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> visually <b>with</b> modern Southern expressionism, it {{is considered}} Southern art because it was created by Southern artists and its subjects were residents of the American South.|$|R
50|$|The Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System (MAARS) is a robot that {{is being}} {{developed}} by Qinetiq. A member of the TALON family, {{it will be the}} successor to the armed SWORDS robot.

5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E

50|$|Nepenthes fusca of Borneo {{may produce}} aerial {{pitchers}} resembling those of N. eymae, although its lower pitchers are considerably narrower and cylindrical in shape.

25|$|The Scouse accent {{is highly}} distinctive, and has <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> {{those used in}} the {{neighbouring}} regions of Cheshire and Lancashire. The accent itself is not specific to all of Merseyside, with the accents of residents of St Helens and Southport, for example, more commonly associated with the historic Lancastrian accent.|$|E
25|$|Population influx {{since the}} 1950s, coupled with {{geographically}} lying {{in both the}} Midwest and Upper South, proximity to the Mississippi embayment, the Osage and Northern Plains, contributes to changing cultural values in the Ozarks.

50|$|The {{magazine}} {{retained its}} large classified ads section, and remained {{the first call}} for musicians wanting to form a band. Suede formed through ads placed in the paper. MM also continued to publish reviews of musical equipment and readers' demo tapes -though these often had <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> stylistically <b>with</b> {{the rest of the}} paper- ensuring sales to jobbing musicians who would otherwise have <b>little</b> interest <b>in</b> the music press.|$|R
50|$|Its {{subtitle}} ('John Inglesant: a romance') {{may also}} be misleading to modern readers; it implies free invention, not love interest, and the book has <b>little</b> or nothing <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the romance novel of the present day.|$|R
25|$|As {{the war in}} Europe {{escalated}} {{in spring}} 1940, Republic and the USAAC concluded that the XP-44 and the XP-47 were inferior to the Luftwaffe fighters. Republic unsuccessfully attempted to improve the design, proposing the XP-47A. Kartveli then designed a much larger fighter, which was offered to the USAAC in June 1940. The Air Corps ordered a prototype in September, to be designated the XP-47B. The XP-47A, which had <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the new design, was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Such {{mathematical}} {{and philosophical}} inferences had <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> {{the paintings of}} Picasso or Braque. Metzinger's interpretation targeted a wide audience—as opposed to private gallery collectors—exhibits in abundance an underlying idealism, a temporal reconstruction of dissected subjects based {{on the principles of}} non-Euclidean geometry. These inferences were compelling because they offered a stimulating and intelligible rationale for his innovations—consistent with contemporary intellectual trends in literature; notably with the Abbaye de Créteil group and Bergson's philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{some analysts}} {{maintain}} {{that whatever the}} source of modern Jihadi terrorism and the actions and words of some rogue members, the Brotherhood now has <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> radical Islamists and modern jihadists who often condemn the Brotherhood as too moderate. They also deny the existence of any centralized and secretive global Muslim Brotherhood leadership. Some claim that the origins of modern Muslim terrorism are found in Wahhabi ideology, not that of the Muslim Brotherhood.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes stratigraphic {{units with}} the same age from the Alps, {{southern}} Europe and even Asia are called Muschelkalk too. Of course these rocks have <b>little</b> history <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the central European Muschelkalk except for similarities in fossil content. Closer at hand, the Alpine Muschelkalk differs in many respects from that of Central Europe, and in its characteristic fossil fauna has a closer affinity with the Triassic Tethys realm.|$|R
5000|$|Tor Lundvall {{is also a}} musician, and his {{compositions}} {{are often}} described as Dark ambient. His first album, [...] "Passing Through Alone" [...] (1997) was co-produced with his brother Kurt Lundvall and could be categorized in the Industrial music genre, as it shared <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> musically <b>with</b> subsequent releases. At the time [...] "Passing Through Alone" [...] was only available at Lundvall's gallery showings, but is now available again through his website.|$|R
50|$|Seahenge is {{so named}} by analogy with Stonehenge {{and does not}} possess an extant henge and appears to have had <b>little</b> {{functionally}} <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> its namesake. The contemporary ground surface associated with the monument has long since been washed away meaning no associated features survive and the silt Seahenge stood in when found considerably postdates the timber circle. It is thought that Seahenge was a mortuary enclosure {{for the use of}} excarnation rather than a henge.|$|R
25|$|From its conception, the Red Army {{committed}} {{itself to}} emphasizing highly mobile warfare. This decision {{was influenced by the}} formative wars of its history, namely the Russian Civil War and the Polish–Soviet War. Both of these conflicts had <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the static trench warfare of the First World War. Instead, they featured long range mobile operations, often by small but highly motivated forces, as well as rapid advances of hundreds of kilometers in a matter of days.|$|E
25|$|Underwater rugby is an {{underwater}} team sport. During a match two teams try {{to score a}} negatively buoyant ball (filled with saltwater) into the opponents’ goal {{at the bottom of}} a swimming pool. It originated from within the physical fitness training regime existing in German diving clubs during the early 1960s and has <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> rugby football except for the name. It was recognised by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) in 1978 and was first played as a world championship in 1980.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an {{accident}} (or sabotage), it is expected that a fusion reactor would release far less radioactive pollution than would an ordinary fission nuclear station. Furthermore, ITER's type of fusion power has <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> nuclear weapons technology, and does not produce the fissile materials necessary {{for the construction of a}} weapon. Proponents note that large-scale fusion power would be able to produce reliable electricity on demand, and with virtually zero pollution (no gaseous CO2, SO2, or NOx by-products are produced).|$|E
40|$|Information {{technology}} {{has become an}} integral part of our lives, so there is no surprise that different computers are widely used in various areas of daily life from the industrial production to household. From the early childhood kids deal with lots of mobile devices that has led to the emergence of smart toys, such as robots and interactive toys. The modern toys have a <b>little</b> bit <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> their forerunners. The main difference is in the presence of a built-in artificial intelligence...|$|R
5000|$|Some newer drinks {{include the}} word [...] "martini" [...] or the suffix [...] "-tini" [...] {{in the name}} (e.g., appletini, peach martini, {{chocolate}} martini, espresso martini). These are named after the martini cocktail glass they use and generally contain vodka but share <b>little</b> else <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the drink.

25|$|Lippisch {{began the}} design of the Fafnir 2 in 1934. Apart from being a wood and fabric {{aircraft}} with a strongly tapered cantilever gull wing, it had <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the Fafnir of 1930, though lessons had been learned from that design. During 1934 the RRG was disbanded and its technical section, led by Lippisch, moved from the Wasserkuppe to Darmstadt to become the DFS, so the new glider was sometimes known as the DFS Fafnir 2. It was Lippisch's last conventional glider design.|$|E
25|$|Mathematical and {{philosophical}} inferences {{known to have}} been essential aspects of Metzinger's work had <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the paintings of Picasso or Braque.

25|$|Żak’s {{repertoire}} of forms {{may not be}} rich, but it is characteristic enough due to make his works immediately recognizable. His style inspired many Polish artists gathered around “Rhythm,” a group which co-created a Polish version of Art Deco. The important feature of Żak’s grammar of forms was his treatment of the human silhouette, which the painter endowed with elongated proportions that had <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> those of the real models, a mannerist over-emphasis on contrapposto, and dance-like postures usually ascribed to marionettes or dummies rather than to people.|$|E
50|$|The Kingdom of Westphalia was {{a kingdom}} in Germany, with a {{population}} of 2.6 million, that existed from 1807 to 1813. It included territory in Hesse and other parts of present-day Germany. While formally independent, it was a vassal state of the First French Empire and was ruled by Napoleon's brother Jérôme Bonaparte. It was named after Westphalia, but this was a misnomer since the kingdom had <b>little</b> territory <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> that area; rather the kingdom mostly covered territory formerly known as Eastphalia.|$|R
50|$|Village sign use, by both {{deaf and}} hearing, is attested from 1820. There's the {{possibility}} of influence from immigrant sign later that century, though HSL has <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> today <b>with</b> ASL or other languages. The establishment of a school for the deaf in 1914 strengthened the use of sign among the students. A deaf community hero, Edwin Inn, a Chinese-Hawai'ian deaf man taught HSL to other deaf adults and also stood as president of a deaf club. However, the introduction of ASL in 1941 in place of purely oral instruction resulted in a shift to that language.|$|R

Their glam, '70s-influenced look, melodic hooks, and feel-good lyrics set them apart from the then-popular grunge movement, which emphasized stripped-down attire (typically jeans and flannel shirts), heavy and frequently atonal music, and angry lyrics. In addition, because of their glam look and sound, they were frequently lumped in with 80s glam metal bands such as Poison and Warrant despite having <b>little</b> musically <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> these acts.
