5|$|Before the Cassini mission, <b>little</b> <b>was</b> {{known about}} the {{interior}} of Enceladus. However, flybys by Cassini provided information for models of Enceladus's interior, including a better determination of the mass and shape, high-resolution observations of the surface, and new insights on the interior.|$|E
5|$|The first {{excavations}} of {{the abbey}} {{took place in}} the 17th century, when the Dowager Countess, Christiana Cavendish, instructed her gardener to search for the body of Cardinal Wolsey and relics from the abbey; although <b>little</b> <b>was</b> found.|$|E

5|$|A man {{was sent}} to New York to receive payment for the stock, but Grey had {{forgotten}} that he had ever stopped at Martha's Vineyard. Colonel Beriah Norton made two special trips to London for the same purpose, and at one time {{he was given a}} hearing in Parliament.

5|$|A {{speculator}} to {{his very}} core, Little never put away {{any of his}} fortune {{to prepare for a}} rainy day; any money he made on the stock market, he immediately invested back into it. Thus when the Panic of 1857 destroyed his investment fortune, <b>Little</b> <b>was</b> left penniless. He would live out {{the rest of his life}} under the wing of his last protége, David Groesbeck. <b>Little</b> <b>was</b> only ever able to make small trading returns to the market in his later years, and the magnitude of his fall was often the target of mockery from his former peers. He died a broken man. Little died on March 28, 1865, and his funeral was held on March 31 at New York's Grace Church. His pall-bearers included Jesse Hoyt and Edward Prime; Reverend Thomas House Taylor officiated at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|According to Gary Oldman, very <b>little</b> <b>was</b> {{written about}} Oswald in the script. Stone gave him several plane tickets, {{a list of}} contacts, {{and told him to}} do his own research. Oldman met with Oswald's wife, Marina, and her two daughters to prepare for the role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with Marina Oswald. Since the script {{contained}} few lines for the Oswalds, Poźniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with Gary Oldman.|$|E

5|$|Before Donald Pattie's {{research}} {{during the}} late 1960s, when his team studied marsh shrews in captivity, <b>little</b> <b>was</b> known about their behavior. Before then, most information about the marsh shrew was from notes about the mammal's habitat and information about trapping it. Its descriptions in the literature were largely derived from the examination of museum specimens.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{character}} and the program were announced to the public via an advertisement in March 2000, though the program was not ready for use at that time.

The program was never officially released nor cancelled, though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002. The name Mya was believed to be a play on the words 'My assistant'.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{never spoke}} more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} {{such a thing}} would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion. <b>Little</b> <b>was</b> known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.|$|E

5|$|Conflicting reports {{initially}} made {{it impossible}} to determine who had made the first kill, which would be the first North Korean plane shot down by the United Nations forces in the war. Later research indicated Hudson had successfully shot down the first aircraft. The exact timing of Hudson and Moran's victories remains unclear, and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, <b>Little</b> <b>was</b> awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E
5|$|Ender's Game: Battle Room was {{a planned}} {{digitally}} distributed video game for all viable downloadable platforms.

5|$|Executing {{the design}} was slow: <b>Little</b> <b>was</b> {{actually}} completed in Michelangelo's lifetime (the Cordonata Capitolina {{was not in}} place when Emperor Charles arrived, and the imperial party had to scramble up the slope from the Forum to view the works in progress), but work continued faithfully to his designs and the Campidoglio was completed in the 17th century, except for the paving design, {{which was to be}} finished three centuries later.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary.

5|$|In early 2001, the Workshop {{conducted}} a summative study {{about the effects}} of war, natural disasters, and other events on young children. It demonstrated that <b>little</b> <b>was</b> being done to address the fears and concerns of victims of traumatic events. As a result, the Workshop developed a series of materials it believed would help children (and their families) cope with events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>was</b> born on 19 July 1895 at Hawthorn, {{a suburb}} of Melbourne, to Canadian James Little, a seller of medical and {{surgical}} books, and his Victorian-born wife Susan.

5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>was</b> {{known about}} {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E
