5|$|The {{media of}} these devices were {{crystals}} with transition metal ion impurities, absorbing <b>low-energy</b> light and re-emitting it in the visible range. By the 1970s, atomic vapors were used in atomic vapor quantum counters for detection of infrared electromagnetic radiation, as they {{were found to be}} superior to the metallic salts and crystals that had been used.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits <b>low-energy</b> {{electrons and}} thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Low-energy</b> {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range 8–20keV and the angle of incidence is 1–4°.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{architectural}} planning authorities {{continue to}} take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of <b>low-energy</b> standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems, recycling rainwater, green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving.|$|E
5|$|The hard X-ray and <b>low-energy</b> gamma-ray SIGMA {{telescope}} was {{a collaboration between}} CESR (Toulouse) and CEA (Saclay). It covered the energy range 35–1300keV, with an effective area of 800cm2 and a maximum sensitivity field of view of ~5°5°. The maximum angular resolution was 15arcmin. The energy resolution was 8% at 511keV. Its imaging capabilities were derived from the association of a coded mask and a position sensitive detector based on the Anger camera principle.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} of solids is weak {{molecular}} crystals (e.g., fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are held together essentially by physical forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds). Since these solids are held together by weak forces, a very low input of energy is required to break them, thus they are termed “low energy”. Depending {{on the type of}} liquid chosen, <b>low-energy</b> surfaces can permit either complete or partial wetting.|$|E
5|$|Uranium has {{the highest}} number (25) of both natural and {{synthetic}} isotopes. They have mass numbers of 217–242, and three of them, 234U, 235U and 238U, are present in appreciable quantities in nature. Among others, {{the most important is}} 233U, which is a final product of transformations of 232Th irradiated by slow neutrons. 233U has a much higher fission efficiency by <b>low-energy</b> (thermal) neutrons, compared e.g. with 235U. Most uranium chemistry studies were carried out on uranium-238 owing to its long half-life of 4.4 years.|$|E
5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all <b>low-energy</b> incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E
5|$|Inside the {{magnetosphere}} is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing <b>low-energy</b> charged particles, or plasma. This region {{begins at}} {{a height of}} 60km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth. There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10million electron volts (MeV)). The inner belt is 1–2Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4–7Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.|$|E
5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and <b>low-energy</b> types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid {{has to do with}} the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Mimas, the {{innermost}} {{of the round}} moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula , where ρ is the (mass) density of the satellite, n is its mean orbital motion, r is the satellite's radius, e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, μ is the shear modulus and Q is the dimensionless dissipation factor. For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of qtid for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), μ and Q are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a 'basic' <b>low-energy</b> thermal state with little internal temperature gradient, and an 'excited' high-energy thermal state with a significant temperature gradient, and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable. For Mimas, only a <b>low-energy</b> state {{is expected to be}} stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model predicts a low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of μ and Q are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of μ and Q are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past).|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only <b>low-energy</b> sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds mostly on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed on the blood of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|E
25|$|Heating by <b>low-energy</b> cosmic rays: The first {{mechanism}} {{proposed for}} heating the ISM was heating by <b>low-energy</b> cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are an efficient heating source able to penetrate {{in the depths}} of molecular clouds. Cosmic rays transfer energy to gas through both ionization and excitation and to free electrons through Coulomb interactions. <b>Low-energy</b> cosmic rays (a few MeV) are more important because they are far more numerous than high-energy cosmic rays.|$|E
25|$|In principle, {{the physics}} within a nucleus {{can be derived}} entirely from quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In {{practice}} however, current computational and mathematical approaches for solving QCD in <b>low-energy</b> systems such as the nuclei are extremely limited. This {{is due to the}} phase transition that occurs between high-energy quark matter and <b>low-energy</b> hadronic matter, which renders perturbative techniques unusable, making it difficult to construct an accurate QCD-derived model of the forces between nucleons. Current approaches are limited to either phenomenological models such as the Argonne v18 potential or chiral effective field theory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of new {{building}}s, <b>low-energy</b> building techniques can be used which can virtually {{eliminate the need for}} heating, such as those built to the Passivhaus standard.|$|E
25|$|The skyrmion, a topological {{solution}} of the pion field, used to model the <b>low-energy</b> properties of the nucleon, such as the axial vector current coupling and the mass.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan to develop technologies in areas including renewable energy, energy conservation, <b>low-energy</b> buildings, fourth generation nuclear reactor, coal pollution mitigation, and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{there are}} very low energy bands {{associated}} with the core orbitals (such as 1s electrons). These <b>low-energy</b> core bands are also usually disregarded since they remain filled with electrons at all times, and are therefore inert.|$|E
25|$|During warm, still days, the {{building}} relies {{mostly on the}} stack effect while air is taken from the shady north side of {{the building}}. <b>Low-energy</b> fans in the tops of the stacks {{can also be used to}} improve airflow.|$|E
25|$|<b>Low-energy</b> {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a technique}} for {{the determination of the}} surface structure of single-crystalline materials by bombardment with a collimated beam of low energy electrons (20–200 eV) and observation of diffracted electrons as spots on a fluorescent screen.|$|E
25|$|For extra spatial precision, the ECAL also {{contains}} preshower detectors that {{sit in front}} of the endcaps. These allow CMS to distinguish between single high-energy photons (often signs of exciting physics) and the less interesting close pairs of <b>low-energy</b> photons.|$|E
25|$|In current {{models of}} Lorentz {{symmetry}} violation, the phenomenological parameters {{are expected to}} be energy-dependent. Therefore, as widely recognized, existing <b>low-energy</b> bounds cannot be applied to high-energy phenomena; however, many searches for Lorentz violation at high energies have been carried out using the Standard-Model Extension.|$|E
25|$|On 20 November 2009, <b>low-energy</b> beams {{circulated}} {{in the tunnel}} {{for the first time}} since the incident, and shortly after, on 30 November, the LHC achieved 1.18TeV per beam to become the world's highest-energy particle accelerator, beating the Tevatron's previous record of 0.98TeV per beam held for eight years.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{reason for}} the high surface {{sensitivity}} of LEED is that for <b>low-energy</b> electrons {{the interaction between the}} solid and electrons is especially strong. Upon penetrating the crystal, primary electrons will lose kinetic energy due to inelastic scattering processes such as plasmon- and phonon excitations as well as electron-electron interactions.|$|E
25|$|A small {{community}} of researchers continues to investigate cold fusion, now often preferring the designation <b>low-energy</b> nuclear reactions (LENR) or condensed matter nuclear science (CMNS). Since cold fusion articles are rarely published in peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals, {{they do not}} attract the level of scrutiny expected for mainstream scientific publications.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{electrons}} donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from the electron {{configuration of the}} reactant element. Elements try to reach the <b>low-energy</b> noble gas configuration, and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron respectively. Noble gases themselves are chemically inactive.|$|E
25|$|The {{zero-energy}} building {{concept has}} been a progressive evolution from other <b>low-energy</b> building designs. Among these, the Canadian R-2000 and the German passive house standards have been internationally influential. Collaborative government demonstration projects, such as the superinsulated Saskatchewan House, and the International Energy Agency's Task 13, have also played their part.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the smaller}} {{wastewater}} treatment plants are waste stabilization ponds, a low-cost and <b>low-energy</b> treatment that eliminates pathogens while conserving nutrients. An example is the Arab village of Kafr Manda in the Western Galilee, whose wastewater is being treated and reused for irrigation in the neighboring Jewish community of Yodfat.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{clinical}} {{presentation of a}} hip fracture is an elderly patient who sustained a <b>low-energy</b> fall and now has groin pain and is unable to bear weight. Pain may be referred to the supracondylar knee. On examination, the affected extremity is often shortened and unnaturally, externally rotated compared to the unaffected leg.|$|E
25|$|Loop quantum {{gravity is}} {{formulated}} in a background-independent language. No spacetime is assumed a priori, but {{rather it is}} built up by the states of theory themselves – however scattering amplitudes are derived from -point functions (Correlation function (quantum field theory)) and these, formulated in conventional quantum field theory, are functions of points of a background space-time. The relation between the background-independent formalism and the conventional formalism of quantum field theory on a given spacetime is far from obvious, and {{it is far from}} obvious how to recover <b>low-energy</b> quantities from the full background-independent theory. One would like to derive the -point functions of the theory from the background-independent formalism, in order to compare them with the standard perturbative expansion of quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct <b>low-energy</b> limit.|$|E
25|$|The total known {{deposits}} recoverable {{by current}} technologies, including highly polluting, <b>low-energy</b> content types of coal (i.e., lignite, bituminous), {{is sufficient for}} many years. Consumption is increasing and maximal production could be reached within decades (see world coal reserves, below). On the other hand, much {{may have to be}} left in the ground to avoid climate change.|$|E
25|$|The new {{interchange}} {{will offer}} enhanced accessibility with a modern concourse and passenger facilities including a retail outlet, cycle hub, shop mobility, café and modern public toilets including adult and baby changing facilities. It will also {{make use of}} innovative sustainable energy initiatives, including rainwater recycling to flush the toilets, solar panels, air source heat pumps and <b>low-energy</b> LED lighting.|$|E
25|$|Many {{physicists}} simply {{give up on}} {{a microscopic}} approach, and make informed guesses of the expected phases (perhaps based on NJL model results). For each phase, they then write down an effective theory for the <b>low-energy</b> excitations, {{in terms of a}} small number of parameters, and use it to make predictions that could allow those parameters to be fixed by experimental observations.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} {{strongly}} emphasized that this {{separation of the}} Dirac spinor into large and small components depends explicitly on a <b>low-energy</b> approximation. The entire Dirac spinor represents an irreducible whole, and the components we have just neglected {{to arrive at the}} Pauli theory will bring in new phenomena in the relativistic regime – antimatter and the idea of creation and annihilation of particles.|$|E
25|$|Toddler's {{fractures}} or childhood accidental spiral tibial (CAST) fractures are bone fractures of {{the distal}} (lower) {{part of the}} shin bone (tibia) in toddlers (aged 9 months-3 years) and other young children (less than 8 years). The fracture {{is found in the}} distal two thirds of the tibia in 95% of cases, is undisplaced and has a spiral pattern. It occurs after <b>low-energy</b> trauma, sometimes with a rotational component.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{harvesters}} {{provide a}} very small amount of power for <b>low-energy</b> electronics. While the input fuel to some large-scale generation costs resources (oil, coal, etc.), the energy source for energy harvesters is present as ambient background. For example, temperature gradients exist from the operation of a combustion engine and in urban areas, {{there is a large}} amount of electromagnetic energy in the environment because of radio and television broadcasting.|$|E
