25|$|An Asian coffee {{known as}} kopi <b>luwak</b> {{undergoes}} a peculiar process made from coffee berries eaten by the Asian palm civet, passing through its digestive tract, with the beans eventually harvested from feces. Coffee brewed from {{this process is}} among the most expensive in the world, with bean prices reaching $160 per pound or $30 per brewed cup. Kopi <b>luwak</b> coffee is said to have uniquely rich, slightly smoky aroma and flavor with hints of chocolate, resulting from the action of digestive enzymes breaking down bean proteins to facilitate partial fermentation.|$|E

This selective picking gives the growers reason to give their coffee a certain specification called [...] "operation cherry red" [...] (OCR). In rare circumstances, the Asian palm civet eats coffee berries and excretes the beans. These beans are called kopi <b>luwak,</b> and can be processed further into a rare and expensive coffee.|$|E

50|$|Imitation {{has several}} motivations. The {{high price of}} kopi <b>luwak</b> drives {{the search for a}} way to produce kopi <b>luwak</b> in large quantities. Kopi <b>luwak</b> {{production}} involves a great deal of labour, whether farmed or wild-gathered. The small production quantity and the labor involved in production contribute to the coffee's high cost. Imitation may be a response to the decrease in the civet population.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the coffee}} industry, kopi <b>luwak</b> is widely {{regarded}} as a gimmick or novelty item. The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) states that there is a [...] "general consensus within the industry ... it just tastes bad". A coffee professional cited in the SCAA article was able to compare the same beans with and without the kopi <b>luwak</b> process using a rigorous coffee cupping evaluation. He concluded: [...] "it was apparent that <b>Luwak</b> coffee sold for the story, not superior quality...Using the SCAA cupping scale, the <b>Luwak</b> scored two points below the lowest of the other three coffees. It would appear that the <b>Luwak</b> processing diminishes good acidity and flavor and adds smoothness to the body, which is what many people seem to note as a positive to the coffee.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Kopi <b>Luwak</b> (<b>Luwak</b> coffee), {{also called}} civet coffee or “poo coffee”. It {{is named after}} the {{practice}} of weasel-like animals called civets let loose into coffee plantations at night to eat coffee berries then poop out the coffee beans which are collected, washed and roasted over a fire.|$|E
50|$|Kopi <b>Luwak</b> is coffee {{prepared}} using {{coffee beans}} {{that have been}} subjected to ingestion and fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract of the Asian palm civet, which is called <b>luwak</b> in Indonesia. Caffeine content in both Arabica and Robusta <b>luwak</b> coffee is lower than in unfermented coffee. Large deformation mechanical rheology testing revealed that civet coffee beans are harder and more brittle in nature than their control counterparts indicating that digestive juices enter into the beans and modify the micro-structural properties of these beans. Proteolytic enzymes cause substantial breakdown of storage proteins.|$|E

50|$|In 2009 {{coffee was}} grown on {{an area of}} 24,017 ha whereas a total number of 16,060 tons were harvested. The {{cultivated}} area increased in 2011 to 24,928 ha. Farmers grow both types of coffee, Arabica and Robusta. Besides the regular cultivation of coffee, farmers increasingly produce <b>Luwak</b> Coffee as well, which generates additional income for the farmers and therefore lessens the traditionally strong dependency on the annual harvests of coffee beans, which, besides the naturally caused fluctuations, is also subject to price fluctuation on the market. The <b>Luwak</b> (Civet) cat coffee of the Regency of Kepahiang {{is known to be}} of high quality and is among the most expensive types of coffee worldwide. The local government supports the production of <b>Luwak</b> Coffee {{within the framework of the}} SELUNA program. <b>Luwak</b> coffee is supported primarily by providing expertise on the subject to interested farmers.|$|E
50|$|Trung Nguyên {{is known}} as an {{important}} producer and distributor of kopi <b>luwak</b> (Vietnamese: cà phê chồn), weasel coffee Trung Nguyen, also known as civet coffee, both natural and simulated. Kopi <b>luwak,</b> widely noted as the most expensive coffee in the world, is coffee made from the beans of coffee berries which have been eaten by the Asian Palm Civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) and other related civets, then passed through its digestive tract. After gathering, thorough washing, sun drying, light roasting, and brewing, these beans yield an aromatic coffee with much less bitterness.Trung Nguyên's Legendee brand coffee is a simulated kopi <b>luwak</b> product, which uses synthetic enzymes to mimic the civet's gastric acid, producing effects on flavour similar to actual kopi <b>luwak,</b> and reducing the need {{to rely on the}} civet, which is now endangered in Vietnam due to excessive hunting. In August 2010, Trung Nguyên CEO Dang Le Nguyen Vu reported that the company had begun manually producing its own natural (non-simulated) kopi <b>luwak</b> under its Weasel sub-brand. Due to the complicated production process, only 40-50 kg of Weasel coffee are produced annually. It is much more expensive than any of the company's other products: a 1 kg bag of Weasel coffee costs $3,000, six times higher than Indonesian kopi <b>luwak.</b> Dang has claimed, however, that Trung Nguyên's Vietnamese version is of higher quality, since production depends on wild or free range civets who choose the best coffee beans themselves, instead of being caged and force-fed.|$|E

Coffee experts believe that the unique flavour of Kopi <b>Luwak</b> comes, at least in part, from the extraction of naturally occurring potassium salts from the beans during the digestive process. This results in a smooth, mild cup, with a sweet after-taste. Kopi <b>Luwak</b> is very rare, and can retail for more than $600 per kilogram.|$|E
