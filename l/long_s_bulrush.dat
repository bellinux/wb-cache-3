40|$|Muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) are {{associated}} with marshlands throughout North America. Their impact on marsh vegetation is well documented. In recent years, research pertaining to marsh ecosystems has emphasized the role of interspersion of marsh vegetation to higher faunal diversity and productivity. Muskrats can provide a natural control of aquatic emergents if managed properly. Experimentation at Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge, Utah, has attempted to ascertain whether vegetation-utilization index {{could be used for}} determining muskrat population levels and to evaluate the impact of muskrats on their primary food resource, Olney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bulrush</b> (Scirpus americanus). Three known populations of muskrats were maintained within wire-mesh enclosures 0. 4 - 0. 9 ha in size. Variable length transects were used to estimate the number of grazed stems of Olney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bulrush</b> present in an enclosure for a 5 -day period. Estimated number of grazed stems was divided by muskrat-days to give an estimate of the number of grazed stems muskrat- 1 day- 1. A consistant relation between the known muskrat population and the number of stems grazed muskrat- 1 day- 1 (23. 0) was found, indicating that a valid index could be formulated using vegetation utilization data. Assessment of plant species utilization was analyzed from dietary composition obtained from stomach contents. Olney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bulrush</b> was the most utilized food resource. Phragmites (Phragmites australis) was the most utilized resource in the absence of bulrush. The potential effects of muskrat grazing was determined using exclosures in homogeneous stands of the above vegetation. A 4 x 4 randomized block design with varying levels of simulated grazing was employed for monthly replications duringthe growing season for 2 years. Effect of repeated grazing was found to be highly significant for clipping rates within and between months for both years. Vegetative yield was measured as mean dry weight (g) per stem per plot. Significant differences in yield were noted among the grazing rates. Repeated grazing of emergent vegetation by muskrats can have a marked effect on the plants 2 ̆ 7 ability to grow...|$|R
50|$|The <b>long</b> <b>s</b> {{was used}} in {{ligatures}} in various languages. Three examples were for si, ss, and st, besides the German letter ß. The <b>long</b> <b>s</b> survives in Fraktur typefaces.|$|R
5000|$|A {{proper use}} of the <b>long</b> <b>s,</b> (...) , ſ, is {{essential}} for writing German text in Fraktur typefaces. Many Antiqua typefaces include the <b>long</b> <b>s</b> also. A specific set of rules applies {{for the use of}} <b>long</b> <b>s</b> in German text, but nowadays it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting. Any lower case [...] "s" [...] {{at the beginning of a}} syllable would be a <b>long</b> <b>s,</b> as opposed to a terminal s or short s (the more common variation of the letter s), which marks the end of a syllable; for example, in differentiating between the words [...] (guard-house) and [...] (tube of polish/wax). One can easily decide which [...] "s" [...] to use by appropriate hyphenation, ( [...] vs. [...] ). The <b>long</b> <b>s</b> only appears in lower case.|$|R
5000|$|An {{individual}} {{instance of}} an important work using s instead of the <b>long</b> <b>s</b> occurred in 1749, with Joseph Ames’ Typographical Antiquities, about printing in England 1471-1600, but [...] "the general abolition of <b>long</b> <b>s</b> began with John Bell's British Theatre (1791)." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wilkie Collins {{routinely}} {{used the}} <b>long</b> <b>s</b> {{for the first}} in a double s in his manuscript correspondence; for example, he used the <b>long</b> <b>s</b> in the words mſs (for manuscripts) and needleſs in a 1 June 1886 letter to Daniel S. Ford.|$|R
25|$|The {{lowercase}} ' f ' is {{not related}} to the visually similar <b>long</b> <b>s,</b> ' ſ ' (or medial s). The use of the <b>long</b> <b>s</b> largely died out {{by the beginning of the}} 19th century, mostly to prevent confusion with ' f ' when using a short mid-bar (see more at: S).|$|R
50|$|The {{lowercase}} letter <b>s</b> — See <b>long</b> <b>s.</b>|$|R
25|$|It {{originates}} as the sz digraph {{as used in}} Old High German and Middle High German orthography, {{represented as}} a ligature of <b>long</b> <b>s</b> and tailed z in blackletter typography (ſʒ), which became conflated with the ligature for <b>long</b> <b>s</b> and round s (ſs) used in Roman type.|$|R
5000|$|In Spain, {{the change}} was mainly {{accomplished}} between the years 1760 and 1766; for example, the multi-volume España Sagrada made the switch with volume 16 (1762). In France, the change occurred between 1782 and 1793. Printers in the United States stopped using the <b>long</b> <b>s</b> between 1795 and 1810: for example, acts of Congress were published with the <b>long</b> <b>s</b> throughout 1803, switching to the short s in 1804. In the U.S., a late use of the <b>long</b> <b>s</b> was in Low's Encyclopaedia, which was published between 1805 and 1811. Its reprint in 1816 {{was one of the}} last such uses in America. And the statutes of the United Kingdom's colony Nova Scotia also used the <b>long</b> <b>s</b> as late as 1816.Some examples of the use of the <b>long</b> and short <b>s</b> among specific well-known typefaces and publications in the UK include the following: ...|$|R

5000|$|The Anglo-Saxon runes {{developed}} a variant shape (...) , called the [...] "bookhand" [...] s rune {{because it is}} probably inspired by the <b>long</b> <b>s</b> (ſ) in Insular script. This variant form {{is used in the}} futhorc given on the Seax of Beagnoth.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{nowadays}} substituted correctly only by ss, {{the letter}} actually originates from two distinct ligatures (depending on word and spelling rules): <b>long</b> <b>s</b> with round <b>s</b> ("ſs") and <b>long</b> <b>s</b> with (round) z ("ſz"/"ſʒ"). Some people therefore prefer to substitute [...] "ß" [...] by [...] "sz", {{as it can}} avoid possible ambiguities (as in the above [...] "Maßen" [...] vs [...] "Massen" [...] example).|$|R

50|$|In {{common with}} texts in other {{languages}} using the Roman alphabet, Latin texts down to c. 1800 used the letter-form <b>ſ</b> (the <b>long</b> <b>s)</b> for s in positions other {{than at the}} end of a word; e.g. ipſiſſimus.|$|R
50|$|The Latin {{alphabet}} {{started out}} as uppercase serifed letters known as roman square capitals. The lowercase letters evolved through cursive styles that developed to adapt the formerly inscribed alphabet to being written with a pen. Throughout the ages, many dissimilar stylistic variations of each letter have evolved that are still identified as being the same letter.After {{the evolution of the}} alphabet from the Western Greek Alphabet through Old Italic alphabet, G developed from C, the letter J developed from a flourished I, V and U split and the ligature of VV became W, the letter thorn Þ was introduced from the runic alphabet but was lost in all languages except Icelandic, and the letter s could be written either as a <b>long</b> <b>s</b> (ſ) inside a word or as a terminal s at the end or after a <b>long</b> <b>s</b> (ß) after the 7th century AD, but the <b>long</b> <b>s</b> was generally abandoned in the 19th century.|$|R
