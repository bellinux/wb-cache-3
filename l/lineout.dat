5|$|The next game, away to Scotland on 2 February, {{resulted}} in defeat for Wales, with the seven forwards system receiving {{much of the}} blame. The Williams–Gabe combination performed well on the left wing, but the Welshmen were unable to cross their opponents' line. Against Ireland at Cardiff Arms Park on 9 March, Wales fielded a team including eight Cardiffians. Gabe was appointed captain for the match, while Billy Trew - the former captain - and Dicky Jones, were replaced at halfback by Percy Bush, Cardiff's captain, and Dicky David, also from Cardiff and earning his first - and only - cap for Wales. Wales beat Ireland 29–0, and 26 of the points came from Cardiff players. In the first four minutes of the game, the Welshmen reached the Irish 25. Following a scrum, the ball reached Gabe, and he, after making some ground, passed to Williams, who ran in a try unopposed. Early in the second half, with Wales leading by two tries to nil, a <b>lineout</b> to Wales on the Irish 25, {{resulted in}} Williams receiving the ball and, after breaking through the Irish defence, with only Hinton, the fullback, to beat, passed to Gabe to score the try. Williams scored a second try after David, receiving the ball from the forwards, passed to Bush, who got past the Irish halfbacks, and passed to Gabe, missing out Evans. Gabe then ran up to Hinton, and passed the ball to Williams to score. A third try came for Williams in similar style, and he came close to scoring a fourth. The David–Bush halfback pairing, and the Gabe–Williams partnership on the left wing, supported by the excellent play of Winfield at fullback, {{and that of the}} forwards, were the decisive factors in the Welsh triumph over Ireland.|$|E

Kim entered Game 4 in the 8th inning with the Diamondbacks leading 7-3. However, prior to Kim entering the game, The D-backs had worked themselves into a bases loaded jam with no one out. Kim pitched masterfully in the inning, ending the bases loaded jam with a double play and a <b>lineout.</b> He then retired the next three batters in the 9th inning {{and picked up the}} save. The next night, Kim pitched another two shut-out innings and earned the two-inning save that clinched the Diamondbacks’ ticket to the World Series. Kim became the first pitcher since Goose Gossage to earn two-inning saves on back-to-back days in the postseason. In the 2004 postseason, Houston Astros closer Brad Lidge matched Gossage and Kim's feat.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Bath {{won their}} first {{silverware}} in 10 years, beating Worcester {{to win the}} European Challenge Cup. After defeat in the 2003 and 2007 finals, it was third time lucky for the English team who ground out an impressive win over Worcester Warriors at Kingsholm. Outgoing skipper Steve Borthwick led by example and was a tower of strength in the <b>lineout</b> {{on his way to}} becoming FedEx Man of the match. Bothwick, who joins Saracens next season, was carried aloft by his jubilant teammates after a titanic tussle in appalling conditions. Worcester won the toss and opted to play with the wind at their backs in the first period. It mattered not as Bath dominated possession and territory in the first quarter, and deservedly took the lead on 15 minutes with an Olly Barkley penalty. Barkley went on to score a second penalty a drop goal and a conversion, but it was tries from Jonny Fa'amatuainu and Nick Abendanon that put the game beyond the reach of brave Worcester. Bath won 24–16.|$|E
25|$|Having {{only one}} base runner since the third inning, the Red Sox mounted {{a rally in}} the top of the eighth. Bill Buckner led off with a single. Jim Rice {{followed}} with one, and Evans hit a double after that to drive Buckner and Rice in and cut the lead to one. Davey Johnson brought in Jesse Orosco to try and stop the rally with the tying run now in scoring position. Orosco retired Gedman on a <b>lineout,</b> struck Henderson out, and induced a groundout to pinch hitter Don Baylor to strand Evans in scoring position. McNamara brought in Al Nipper, who started and lost Game 4, to pitch the bottom half. Darryl Strawberry led off with a home run to make the score 7-5. Knight singled and advanced to second on a groundout by Dykstra. Santana was intentionally walked to get to the pitcher's spot, and Orosco helped his cause by singling to center to drive in Knight. Steve Crawford then came in to face Wilson and hit him, loading the bases. Backman then grounded into a force retiring Santana, and Hernandez grounded out and ended the inning.|$|E

The North beat the South 12–8 in a closely contested, entertaining game in front of a full capacity crowd. The Northern forwards in general played a good game; it was suggested that Downing's passing back from the <b>lineout</b> to the halfback was something that other forwards might consider imitating. A tour with the North Island Country team followed, in which Downing played all four games. The last, against South Island Country in Wellington on 4 August, had to be stopped at half time due to the condition of the match ground, and the North won 14–3. His Hawke's Bay and North Island Country team-mate Norman McKenzie described him as [...] "an outstanding line-out forward with a wonderful pair of hands".|$|E

2500|$|A free kick {{is awarded}} for {{technical}} infringements {{that do not}} warrant a penalty. A free kick differs from a penalty in that it cannot be used for an attempt at goal.

The World Cup also saw prop Mike MacDonald become both the most capped Eagle in World Cup play (11 caps) and the most capped Eagle of all time at 65 caps.

2500|$|Australia scored {{their only}} try of the 1991 World Cup Final in the 26th minute. Campese's [...] "chasing" [...] played an {{indirect}} {{part in the}} lead-up to Australia's first try. Simon Poidevin recalls in For Love Not Money that, [...] "He [...] took a bomb near his own line, spun out of the defence and sprinted 60m before kicking ahead..." [...] Bob Dwyer records that, [...] "Tim Horan had chipped ahead in a marvellous counter-attack from his own 22, and Campese had chased the ball and forced a <b>lineout</b> in the corner." [...] Australia scored moments later off a rolling maul. Dwyer noted that, [...] "The key to the whole exercise was Horan's grubber kick. If it had gone into touch, England {{would have had the}} put-in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Punts are {{the most}} common type of kick {{employed}} by players. They are used as clearing kicks, especially if a team is close to their own goal-line or is looking to gain territory. With these kicks the player tries to kick the ball as far as possible towards the opponents goal and they usually aim for one of the touch lines. If the ball crosses the touch line before being touched by anyone a <b>lineout</b> is awarded to the opposing team. If the ball is put inside the player's 22 metre line by a member of the opposition they can kick the ball out on the full and gain ground. Otherwise ground is only gained if the ball bounces in the field of play before crossing the touch line. Care has to be taken not to kick it too far, because if it travels through their opponents in-goal and becomes dead the opposition is awarded a scrum from where the kick occurred. The disadvantage of [...] "kicking for territory" [...] is that it almost always gives possession of the ball to the opposing team. If a clearing kick is caught by the opposition, then they can counter-attack by running, passing, or kicking the ball back toward the clearing team.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s the Athletics chant of {{the school}} (adapted by the Christian Brothers from their Australian schools) was urangabe, urangabe, urangabe uranga/Woolagalla, woolagalla, rumba/Flay them, beat them, yah mung do!/Christies, Christies, blue, gold, blue. One old boy, at SPC in the mid 1950s, has written that the Christian Brothers (being then [...] "Aussies") were not much {{interested}} in Rugby but {{were more interested in}} cricket, [...] "square-bashing" [...] and athletics. However, John Tamihere, at St Peter's in the 1970s, remembers the Christian Brothers (by then mostly Kiwi) being very enthusiastic about Rugby. He has written that if the Christian Brothers wanted a boy for the First XV, the boy didn't have much say in the matter. [...] "They would walk around the school grounds at lunchtime sizing up" [...] likely candidates to see if they might be any good. They picked out one boy because he looked usefully tall. [...] "I'd rather play soccer", the boy protested, [...] " ... but next minute there he was in the <b>lineout,</b> leaping." [...] Under such pressure, Tamihere played for the college First XV (in 1975 and 1976) although he would have preferred to play Rugby League for the Point Chevalier Pirates and later for the Glenora Bears as his brothers did. He said that the college First XV at that time was composed of [...] " ... not bad players", and they were [...] " ... always competitive". [...] "We didn't win a lot, {{but on the other hand}} we never really got hammered". [...] "St Peter's used to play St Kentigern's, who were led out onto the field by their pipe band. When we played Anglican King's College there was no doubt this was a Catholic versus [...] "Proddy" [...] battle, though some of our toughest games were against other Catholic schools like St Paul's and Sacred Heart. If you think Māori society was tribal, you should have seen those Catholics". There is also strong traditional Rugby rivalry with other schools such as De La Salle College, Auckland Grammar School, Kelston Boys' High School, Mt Albert Grammar School and the North Shore school, Rosmini College (The Battle of the Bridge). An annual senior rugby fixture between Auckland Grammar and St Peter's (The Battle of the Overbridge) is played for the Henry Cooper-Br. Paddy Ryan Rugby Challenge Cup in memory of headmasters in office in 1962 when St Peter's beat Grammar for the first time. [...] Amongst the college's Rugby highlights was winning by the First XV of the New Zealand Secondary School's Top Four Championship and the Auckland Secondary Schools Premiership in 1987. [...] The latter feat was repeated in 1988. The college won the Auckland Championship and the New Zealand First XV Knock out competition undefeated in 2000. The college has held the Moascar Cup (national school 1st XV rugby honour) twice, in 1977 and 2000.|$|E

For example, radiography using an x-ray backlighter target allows the size, symmetry, and density of both the compressed core and surrounding shell to be determined. One means of imaging ICF target x-ray emission is a compact Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) microscope. Before a KB microscope is used, the KB optic must have its best focus location and resolution determined. Test exposures were taken with an electron-beam-generated x-ray source. The test target was a copper grid with 25. 4 µm diameter wires and a reference hole to align different exposures. A PV-Wave program was written to efficiently take <b>lineouts</b> across the image. These <b>lineouts</b> graph the film density of the shadows created by the mesh grid.
