5|$|Józef, when he {{attended}} the Russian gymnasium in Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania), was not an especially diligent student. One of the younger Polish students at this gymnasium was the future Russian communist leader Feliks Dzierżyński, who <b>later</b> <b>would</b> become Piłsudski's arch-enemy.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Bundy {{was working}} at the Washington State Department of Emergency Services (DES) in Olympia, a {{government}} agency involved in the search for the missing women.

5|$|The house {{known as}} the Jesse Ashbridge house {{was built on the}} family's land {{beginning}} in 1854. The house was designed for Sarah's grandson and Jonathan's son, Jesse Ashbridge, by prominent local architect, Joseph Sheard, who many years <b>later</b> <b>would</b> later serve as Mayor of Toronto. The cottage was designed in the Regency style, built with red brick laid in a Flemish bond, with a hipped roof and treillage veranda. Jesse married in 1864 and died in 1874.|$|E
50|$|Three {{years after}} WTRA signed on, a {{substitute}} DJ {{by the name}} of John Longo was hired as an employee, and 30 years <b>later,</b> Longo <b>would</b> assume the ownership of this station. Though Longo <b>would</b> <b>later</b> leave what <b>would</b> <b>later</b> become WCNS to pursue advancement opportunities at other neighboring stations, he <b>would</b> <b>later</b> return in November 1983 as an equity partner, four years after the station was sold by WTRA Broadcasting to Advance Communications Corporation https://latrobebulletin.our-hometown.com/news/2016-05-07/Front_Page/Former_station_owner_shares_memories_of_Dow.html. With the ownership change came a new set of call letters...WCNS. The newly named station, now boasting a new country format, saw its most dramatic changes under Advance's ownership and Longo's leadership.|$|R

5|$|The work {{assumes that}} the royal legal system would still address some issues that <b>later</b> <b>would</b> have been dealt with by ecclesiastical courts. Clergy are not only {{to take part in}} the shire court, but could be summoned to answer charges in the court. It also sets out the various courts that were {{established}} and their jurisdiction. It takes for granted that the Anglo-Saxon laws of England are still in effect. It also addresses the administration of forest law under Henry I. Another new concern in the Leges is law covering the roadways and highways.|$|E
5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread {{that at one point}} over 650,000 people were out of power in the Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which less than a year <b>later</b> <b>would</b> be struck by another tornado.|$|E
5|$|A two-day {{political}} crisis followed the raid. It {{was obvious to}} the Ottoman government what Enver had allowed to occur. As soon as {{the news of the}} attack reached Istanbul, the Grand Vizier and the Cabinet forced Enver to wire a ceasefire order to Souchon. Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four <b>later</b> <b>would,</b> including Djavid Bey. Though many in the government thought it opportune to attack Russia, solidarity was regarded as vital and a letter of apology was soon drafted. On 31 October Enver informed the Germans of the planned apology and said {{there was nothing he could}} do.|$|E

5|$|Animals is {{the tenth}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 23 January 1977 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. It {{is a concept}} album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late-1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. Animals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that three years <b>later</b> <b>would</b> culminate in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, was conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Voss Line was {{completed}} Norway had plunged into recession. Parliament {{was not willing to}} give more money to railways, and the country had to make do with a transport plan launched in 1886 that did not follow up with any funding. On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line. Several different routes had been proposed, including over Krøderen, or down Numedal (which <b>later</b> <b>would</b> get the Numedal Line). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to Hønefoss and via Sandvika. To save costs a preliminary line would connect Hønefoss to Roa with the branch Roa–Hønefoss Line. The final stage would be along the Gjøvik Line to Oslo. The line would also connect to the system via the Randsfjorden Line at Hønefoss.|$|E
5|$|Existing {{negative}} {{views about}} Peribsen's existence {{are based on}} Ramesside king lists, such as the Abydos King List, the Saqqara King List and the Royal Canon of Turin, which all omit Peribsen's name. These, however, {{are known to have}} been redacted nearly 1,500 years after his death and several 4th dynasty tombs of priests performing the funerary cult for Peribsen have been uncovered. These tombs report Peribsen's name correctly and their existence demonstrate that Peribsen was seen as a legitimate pharaoh, not subject to damnatio memoriae as Akhenaten <b>later</b> <b>would</b> be. Historians and Egyptologists therefore consider the possibility that Peribsen's name was actually forgotten in time or that his name was preserved in a distorted, misspelled form.|$|E
50|$|Capitan Pitong’s son, Don Olympio Guanzon (former Pampanga Governor) <b>would</b> <b>later</b> {{inherit the}} lot and an earlier old house in the same lot by 1925. The old house <b>would</b> <b>later</b> be {{dismantled}} to give way for the villa and <b>would</b> <b>later</b> pass on to Don Felipe Guanzon. The villa was designed and constructed by Architect Mariano Pineda, a native of Sta. Rita and relative of the Guanzons. Pineda <b>would</b> <b>later</b> join the Federal Architects of America.|$|R

5|$|In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} make the claim for gender {{equality}} using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists <b>later</b> <b>would.</b> For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law. For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell {{returned}} to Provincetown {{the following summer}} and requested that painting instructor, Oliver Chaffee, teach her the white-line woodcut technique innovated by B.J.O. Nordfeldt and adopted {{by a group of}} artists who had spent the previous winter in Provincetown. The white-line woodcuts were inspired by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, but only used a single block of wood. Designs were etched into the surface of woodblocks, with the incised lines separating sections of the blocks. The sections were individually painted and printed onto paper with the carved portions forming white lines. Lazzell and other artists specializing in the white-line technique formed the Provincetown Printers, an artist collective that <b>later</b> <b>would</b> earn national recognition. Toward the close of 1916 she traveled to Manhattan where she studied with Homer Boss and did an analysis of color with William E. Schumacher. Two of her pieces in the white-line style were exhibited in the Provincetown Art Association's annual show in 1917.|$|E
5|$|No battles are {{recorded}} during the campaign, and chronicles do not record its outcome. By September, however, {{he was back}} in the south of England at Buckingham, where Constantine witnessed a charter as subregulus, that is a king acknowledging Æthelstan's overlordship. In 935 a charter was attested by Constantine, Owain of Strathclyde, Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, and Morgan ap Owain. At Christmas of the same year Owain of Strathclyde was once more at Æthelstan's court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine was not. His return to England less than two years <b>later</b> <b>would</b> be in very different circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Paranotal {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{suggests that}} the insect's wings developed from paranotal lobes, a preadaptation found in insect fossils that {{is believed to have}} assisted stabilization while hopping or falling. In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly. The theory {{suggests that the}}se lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even <b>later</b> <b>would</b> appear the muscles to move these crude wings. This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with parachuting, then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field.|$|E
5|$|The Scooter {{is another}} storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This {{nickname}} first arose {{during the months}} leading up to the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot (and images acquired <b>later</b> <b>would</b> subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by Voyager 2). The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as Voyager 2 approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty on Increased Integration in the Economic and Humanitarian Fields {{signed in}} 1996 laid the first {{foundation}} for economic convergence. The treaty ensured {{the creation of}} a permanent executive organ to oversee integration of states that <b>later</b> <b>would</b> be part of the EEU. It served as the blueprint for the future common market for goods, services, capital and labour. The Single Economic Space established a single market across the territory of Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. In 2015 with the entry into force of the EEU Agreement, the single market was expanded to include Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The countries represent a market of some 183 million people and a combined GDP of around $4 trillion.|$|E

5|$|The {{triumph in}} Caseros was a pivotal {{military}} victory for Brazil. The independence of Paraguay and Uruguay was secured, and the planned Argentine invasion of Rio Grande do Sul was blocked. In {{a period of}} three years, the Empire of Brazil had destroyed any possibility of reconstituting a state encompassing the territories of old Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, a goal cherished by many in Argentina since independence. Brazil's army and fleet had accomplished what Great Britain and France, the great powers of that time, had not achieved through interventions by their powerful navies. This represented a watershed for the history of the region as it not only ushered in Imperial hegemony over the Platine region, but, according to Brazilian historian J. F. Maya Pedrosa, also in the rest of South America. The War of the Triple Alliance eighteen years <b>later</b> <b>would</b> only be a confirmation of Brazilian dominance.|$|E
5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled {{his face with a}} handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years <b>later</b> <b>would</b> result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after all}} seven books had been published, Graeme Davis {{regarded}} Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the weakest of the series, and {{agreed that the}} plot structure {{is much the same}} as in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a deus ex machina: he said that the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving <b>later</b> <b>would</b> have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.|$|E
