2500|$|In the {{following}} year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the Boston University School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was [...] "swept up" [...] by the excitement engendered {{by the many}} scientists and inventors residing in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored {{to find a way}} to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house. Keeping [...] "night owl" [...] hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a <b>locking</b> <b>cover.</b> Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches. Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.|$|E

50|$|The risk of firemen {{tying down}} the safety valve remained. This was {{encouraged}} by them being fitted with easily adjustable wing nuts, the practice of adjusting the boiler's working pressure via the safety valve being an accepted behaviour well into the 1850s. It was later common with Salter valves {{for them to be}} fitted in pairs, one adjustable and often calibrated for use as a gauge, the other sealed inside a <b>locked</b> <b>cover</b> to prevent tampering.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, such as {{equipment}} used in schools, community centers, or other public places, {{the equipment is}} designed so that {{some or all of}} the switches are hidden behind a <b>locked</b> <b>cover.</b> Some public address systems are sold in tamper-resistant designs that make it harder for unauthorized members of the public to activate the system or change the settings. The switches are at the rear of the unit; only LED lights are on the front of the panel. When the unit is rack-mounted into a wall or rack unit, this means that only official personnel (who are able to access the back of the panel) can change the settings or use the unit. Another variant on this design is to cover the switches with a locked panel. In some cases, such as the sound system in a bar or club, the <b>locked</b> <b>cover</b> may be made from transparent plexiglass, so that the sound engineer can verify the sound system settings and switches (yet at the same time, the locked panel prevents mischief-minded club patrons from tampering or altering the amplifier or equalizer settings).|$|R
50|$|In {{his first}} appearance, {{we learn that}} Sabbath was {{originally}} a renegade member of the British Secret Service during the late 18th century. It was explained that it is customary for agents to take Biblical names, and Sabbath's name derived itself from a Jewish Kabalistic trend in the Service during the time period of his initiation. His initiation into the Service involved him being thrown into the River Thames bound in thirteen chains and thirteen <b>locks,</b> <b>covered</b> in sackcloth. Sabbath survived by encountering Leviathan, who rescued him.|$|R

Hypatia could look at nothing but those eyes; and she reddened, and grew all but unphilosophically angry, as she saw that the old woman intended her to look at them, and feel the strange power which she evidently wished them to exercise.|$|R

30|$|The main aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is fabrication of low-cost S.H Cu and Al nanoparticles and extending their application towards the catalysis field. For the synthesis of S.H Cu or Al metal plates, a standard literature procedure was followed [35]. The Cu or Al plate with the area of 12  cm 2 was taken as a source material. The metal plate was cleaned with acetone and ultrasonicated for 1  h in an aqueous medium. Then the plate {{was removed from the}} ultrasonic bath and dried at 110  °C for 2  h and it was weighed (W 1 g) and subjected to the chemical etching reaction in the presence of 0.10  g MA in 100  mL ethanol medium under mild stirring condition. After 7  days of chemical etching, the metal plate was removed from the reaction medium and dried at 80  °C for 2  h (W 2 g). The content of the medium was dried at 80  °C for a night. The metal with hierarchical structure was obtained as a powder, weighed (W 3 g) and stored in a zip <b>lock</b> <b>cover.</b> During the fabrication of S.H Cu or Al plate, the etching agent-coated Cu or Al is formed as a by-product without any use. Thus, obtained hierarchically structured Cu or Al powder was dispersed in an aqueous medium with the aid of ultrasonication for 30  min. Once the dispersion was completed, excess of NaBH 4 was added under ultrasonication. The hierarchically structured Cu or Al is now subjected to chemical reduction reaction and reduced to Cu and Al nanoparticles. The reduction reaction was allowed to continue for another 30  min. At the end of the reaction, the dark-colored precipitate was filtered, dried, weighed and stored in a zip <b>lock</b> <b>cover</b> under nitrogen atmosphere.|$|R

50|$|The Ranger's base trim {{appointments}} included arm rests, {{a cigarette}} lighter, rear-view mirror, two coat hangers and black rubber floor mats. On the exterior, Rangers received chrome around the {{rear quarter panel}} cove molding. Two-tone paint was also optional. The main visual cue {{that makes it possible}} {{to tell the difference between}} most Rangers and the upmarket Pacer was the lack of stainless trim on the front doors and fenders. A very rare, optional, Ranger-only door trim was available from dealers early in the model year to be used together with the Pacer fender trim. A basic heater (as a US$92 option) and radio (at US$95) were available, and air conditioning was optional as well (at $417), along with seat belts, warning lights, automatic trunk opener, and rear door child safety <b>lock</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{big news}} for 1988 was the {{introduction}} of the Seville Touring Sedan (STS) which came equipped with GM's FE2 Touring Suspension. It featured special 15 inch alloy wheels, special springs, rear sway bar, and a special 15.6:1 steering ratio for enhanced handling, a grille mounted Cadillac emblem, special cloisonne trunk <b>lock</b> <b>cover,</b> and a unique four-place interior. 1988 Seville Touring Sedan production totaled 1,499 units. The first 1988 STS's were custom built in June 1988 by Cars and Concepts and announced at the 1988 Detroit Grand Prix. These initial run models were available to VIP's within General Motors, the Cadillac Division, some major shareholders and a short list of dignitaries. A special label was affixed to the lower corner of the driver-side front door by Cars and Concepts identifying it as one of the original STS's.|$|R

30|$|FA-functionalized ferrite was {{synthesized}} as follows: 5  g {{ferrous sulphate}} and 10  g ferric chloride in 100  mL water were mixed thoroughly; 2  g FA in 25  mL water was added slowly. The slow addition was continued for 30  min at 45  °C {{under nitrogen atmosphere}} under mild stirring condition; 5  g NaOH in 25  mL water {{was added to the}} content slowly. The appearance of dark black color (pH > 10) confirmed the formation of FA-functionalized ferrite. The stirring was continued for another 1  h. Then the beaker was kept on a magnetic bar to isolate the FA-functionalized ferrite and to purify the nanohybrid material (Scheme  1). The purification process was continued three times with 50  mL fresh water. After the purification process the contents were filtered and dried at 110  °C for 8  h. The dried sample was weighed and stored in a zipper <b>lock</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|R
