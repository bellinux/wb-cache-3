500|$|Dan Iverson of IGN wrote [...] "this {{week was}} {{confirmation}} of the show's quality, as 'Chick Cancer' proved that the program could create hilarious flashbacks, while presenting a story that added a lick of satire to improve on {{the overall quality of}} the show." [...] In a review of the episode, Brett Love of TV Squad wrote [...] "I'm still calling this an up and down season overall, but this episode was one of the upswings," [...] adding that [...] "There were some truly great moments." [...] Later in the review, Love comments [...] "If there was anything I didn't <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> story it was that bad boy Stewie was so short lived." ...|$|E

Gillian Anderson said, [...] "I never quite understood whether {{it was going to}} work or not. When we finally saw 'Triangle' after this new way of filming everything, a style that we'd never attempted before, as well as trying new scenes...trying this, trying that... that was terrific." [...] Chris Owens, who portrayed the Agent Spender Nazi lookalike, said, [...] "One thing I really <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>The</b> X-Files was that they were always challenging themselves. Chris [...] would write an episode in which we're going to do Rope without any cuts, seemingly. A great challenge for a cast and crew." ...|$|E

In this debate when asked what Republican he would pick as a running mate if forced, Biden answered, [...] "I would pick Chuck Hagel, and I'd consider asking Dick Lugar {{to be secretary of}} state." [...] In regards to Iraq, Biden stated that it was unrealistic to say that all troops would be redeployed. He instructed those who used that rhetoric to [...] "Tell the truth for a change." [...] When he discussed education Biden declared that he [...] "would scrap" [...] the No Child Left Behind Act. He concluded his participation in the debate after being asked to say something he didn't <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> candidate to his left, Dennis Kucinich.

500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel J. Goor and {{directed}} by Dean Holland. The episode marked {{the culmination of a}} seven-episode story arc that began with the third season premiere, [...] "Go Big or Go Home", in which Leslie and the parks department prepare to relaunch the harvest festival, which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended. The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee which forced a government shutdown and threatened major cuts to the parks department, prompting Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake the future of the entire department on its success or failure. Amy Poehler said she believed the storyline was appropriate for a series about small government and was well handled by the writers: [...] "What I <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> show is it doesn't spend 25 episodes talking about this thing, it talks about it in the right amount of time. It happens and then there's consequences of it. The show keeps moving forward, which is always really fun." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, while Soulfly was on tour, Max {{received}} a call from his brother, {{and by the end of}} the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix for the tenth anniversary of D-Low, an annual memorial show for Dana. At the concert, Igor joined Soulfly and performed two Sepultura songs, [...] "Roots Bloody Roots" [...] and [...] "Attitude," [...] for which Dana had written the lyrics. In an interview with Chad Bowar for About.com, Max stated that performance was [...] "the birth of Cavalera Conspiracy". After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project after Soulfly finished touring. Max confessed to Bowar that he had lied to Igor when he said all the songs were ready when he had only finished one. He added, [...] "It was one of those good lies. Everything rolled from there. What I <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Conspiracy is that nothing is really planned. One thing leads to another. There's no pressure and it feels like a different project than anything I've done." ...|$|E

Simon has been credited as [...] "developing [...] sensibility". Ken Levine says he [...] "brought a level of honesty to the characters" [...] and made them [...] "three-dimensional", adding that Simon's [...] "comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon saw The Simpsons {{as a chance to}} solve [...] "what [...] didn't <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other. The Simpsons would have been a great radio show. If you just listen to the sound track, it works." [...] The music for all 13 episodes was composed by former Oingo Boingo member Richard Gibbs, who would depart the show {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
500|$|Prohibition agents {{closed the}} {{original}} club on December 22, 1931, and Billingsley moved it to East 51st Street for three years. It was raided in August 1932 at the 51st Street location after an angry patron lost a quarter in a coin machine and notified police. The police asked guests to quietly pay their checks {{and leave the}} building; this took two hours. [...] In 1934, the Stork Club moved to 3 East 53rd Street, where it remained until it closed in October 1965. Billingsley's guest list for the 53rd Street opening consisted of people from Broadway and Park Avenue. [...] He sent out 1,000 invitations for Champagne and dinner. The women found much to <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fresh flowers everywhere and the mirrored walls, while the men were pleased to see their favorite dishes on the club's menu {{as well as many}} of their personal and business friends at the opening. When the Stork Club became a tenant in 1934, the building was known as the Physicians and Surgeons Building. Many of the medical tenants were unhappy about the night club moving in, but in February 1946, Billingsley purchased the seven-story building for $300,000 cash, evicting the doctors to expand the club.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, writing {{that while there}} had been a [...] "self-congratulatory quality" [...] to Glee since its mid-season break, [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] was a return to [...] "the Glee [...] fell in tormented love with." [...] He graded the songs performed [...] "C−" [...] through to [...] "A−", commending what he deemed [...] "by far the greatest performance of [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] ever". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also felt the episode was a return to form. He praised the decision not to [...] "apply meaningless rules to their musical selections", writing: [...] "The freedom to not have to use songs by one artist let the storylines take priority, and not sticking to songs that share a common lyrical theme kept those choices from feeling too forced." [...] Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times recapped the episode positively, describing it as: [...] "pack more camp into an hour's worth of television than most kids will get all summer." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] "B+", writing that he: [...] "enjoyed the episode quite a bit, even as [...] found some of it rather messy." [...] Though VanDerWerff felt that not everything in the episode worked, he stated: [...] "the stuff that did reminded me that what I <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> show is its all-out embrace of a crazy mishmash of tones." ...|$|E

500|$|Simon {{has been}} {{credited}} with [...] "developing [...] sensibility". Former Simpsons director Brad Bird has described him as [...] "the unsung hero" [...] of the show, while Vitti has stated to [...] "leave out Sam Simon" [...] is to tell [...] "the managed version" [...] of The Simpsons history, because [...] "he was the guy we wrote for." [...] Writer Ken Levine called Simon [...] "the real creative force behind The Simpsons...The tone, the storytelling, the level of humor – that was all developed on Sam's watch." [...] Levine says that Simon [...] "brought a level of honesty to the characters" [...] and made them [...] "three-dimensional", adding that his [...] "comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon crafted {{much of the world}} of Springfield and designed the models for many of the show's recurring characters, including Mr. Burns, Dr. Hibbert, Chief Wiggum and Eddie and Lou, as well as many of the one-time and guest star roles, such as Bleeding Gums Murphy. One of his contributions to the show's character development was his proposal that Waylon Smithers should be gay, but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it; Smithers' sexuality became one of the show's longest-running gags. [...] Simon saw The Simpsons as a chance to solve [...] "what [...] didn't <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other.

2500|$|The much-delayed {{third season}} of Cougar Town {{became the most}} {{critically}} acclaimed season of the series thus far, garnering an average Metacritic score of 80 out of 100, based on five reviews. RedEye gave the season a positive review, stating that it [...] "returns with its wit, silliness and good-heartedness fully intact." [...] TV Guide concluded: [...] "witty and wacky, this sharp-tongued, sweet-souled sitcom picks up without losing a (heart)beat." [...] The Huffington Post summed up their review by noting that fans of the show will [...] "find a lot to <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> new season." [...] Despite this, the 3rd season ranked 107th among viewers, and was quickly dropped by ABC afterwards. The show continued its run on the cable network TBS.|$|E

2500|$|Another aspect {{that was}} {{cited as a}} {{drawback}} to its horror was its pacing and the third story was especially criticized. Green said it [...] "frequently suffers when the reader engages it" [...] and that the twists in the first volume [...] "are obvious or aggravating", considering the Human-Fish story [...] "trampl ground that will be very problematic for some audiences". Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock criticized this story because of Esuno's treatment of rape, saying the girl saving her rapist vindicates his abuse. Zoth considered the Human-Fish story [...] "a complete misfire" [...] and its twists [...] "completely ridiculous". Similarly, Santos and Zimmerman felt it was [...] "convoluted", while considered the first chapter was [...] "rushed", attributing it to Esuno's lack of pacing. Nonetheless, both Santos and Zimmerman were mixed regarding the pacing. Although stated it was [...] "so frequently sloppy in its execution", Santos praised [...] it because [...] "the deadpan, Twilight Zone-esque introductions to each chapter set the perfect tone, and the tension builds up {{at just the right}} pace—you know when those shocking moments are going to hit, but it doesn't make them any less terrifying when they happen". Zimmerman commented that [...] "if the series has one weakness, {{it would have to be}} its pacing", but [...] "still, horror fans will find much to <b>like</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> series" [...] as [...] "the stories will have readers guessing the whole way through". On the other hand, Henderson said the second and the third stories had [...] "a nice twist", and Gaffney affirmed [...] "the pacing is excellent", commending the [...] "balance between cute innocent victims, poorly communicating boyfriends, and complete jerkass monsters." ...|$|E
