A total of 110 human root segments were instrumented to size 80 under irrigation with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Half of the roots were irrigated with a 5-mL rinse of 17% EDTA to remove the smear layer. Roots were filled with gutta-percha (GP) and AH Plus sealer (AH), GP and Apexit sealer (AP), or RealSeal cones and sealer (RS). Following storage in humid conditions at 37 degrees C for 7 days, the specimens were mounted into a bacterial <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> model for 135 days. Survival analyses were performed to calculate the median time of leakage and log-rank test was used for pairwise comparisons of groups.

In the presence of the smear layer, RS and AP leaked significantly more slowly than in its absence. In the absence of the smear layer, AH leaked significantly more slowly than RS. It was concluded that removal of the smear layer did not impair bacterial penetration along root canal fillings.

Ten additional roots were used as control samples.

40|$|Background : Pancreatic fistula is {{major source}} of {{postoperative}} morbidity or mortality. Soft pancreas has been considered {{to be one of}} the most important risk factors for pancreatic fistula. The purpose of the study is to clarify the relationship among extravasation of pancreatic secretions from the pancreatic stump, the pancreatic texture and clinical pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methods : For nineteen patients who were treated between July 2007 and August 2008, we performed intraoperative pancreatic <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> to confirm the extravasation of pancreatic secretions from the pancreatic stump. Degree of fibrosis at the cut surface of the pancreas was reviewed blindly. Results : Serum pancreatic amylase increased on first postoperative day (POD) and returned to preoperative level on 3 POD. These change were inversely correlated with fibrosis (P < 0. 001), namely the amylase level in patients with normal to mild fibrotic pancreas showed marked increase on 1 POD, but not in those with moderate to severe fibrotic pancreas. Positive pancreatic <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> was recognized in five patients (26. 3 %), four of 9 patients with soft pancreas (44. 4 %) and one of 10 with hard pancreas (10. 0 %). In soft pancreas, all four cases showing positive <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> developed pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy, while one positive case in hard pancreas did not develop pancreatic fistula. Conclusion : The extravasation of pancreatic secretions from the pancreatic stump occurred frequently in soft pancreas, which might result in postoperative pancreatic fistula. Therefore we should take care in treating branched duct as well as main pancreatic duct at the pancreatic stump of soft pancreas. ãã¯ããã«ãèµæ¶²æ¼ã¯èµåé¤è¡åä½µçã§ç¹ã«åé¡ã¨ãªãåä½µçã§ããï¼Soft pancreasã¯èµæ¶²æ¼ã®å±éºå å­ã¨è¨ããã¦ããï¼ä»åèµåé¢æ­ç«¯ããã®èµæ¶²ã®æ¼ãã¨ï¼èµã®ç¹ç¶­åã®ç¨åº¦ï¼èµæ¶²æ¼ã®çºçã¨ã®é¢é£æ§ãæããã«ããï¼ãæ¹æ³ãèµé ­åäºæè¸åé¤ãè¡ã£ã 19 çä¾ã«å¯¾ãã¦ï¼åé¤ç«¯ã®èµç®¡ããã¢ãã ãã¥ã¼ããæ¿å¥ãã¤ã³ã¸ã³ã«ã«ãã³æº¶æ¶²ãæ³¨å¥ãæ­ç«¯ããã®è²ç´ ã®æ¼ãã®æç¡ãèª¿ã¹ï¼åé¤èµã®ç¹ç¶­åã®ç¨åº¦ã¨çµç¹å­¦çã«ãªãï¼è»½åº¦ï¼ä¸­ç­åº¦ï¼é«åº¦ã«é¡å¥ãæ¯è¼ï¼ãçµæãè¡æ¸ã¢ãã©ã¼ã¼å¤ã¯ï¼è¡å¾ 1 æ¥ç®ã«ä¸æãï¼ 3 æ¥ç®ã«ã¯è¡åå¤ã«æ»ã£ã¦ãããï¼ 1 æ¥ç®ã®ä¸æã¯ç¹ç¶­åããªãã»ã©ææã«é«å¤ãç¤ºããï¼ãªã¼ã¯ãã¹ãé½æ§ã 5 ä¾ã«èªãããï¼ 1 ä¾ãã®ããsoft pancreasçä¾ã§ãã£ãï¼ãªã¼ã¯ãã¹ãé½æ§ã§ãã£ãsoft pancreasçä¾ 4 ä¾ã¯å¨ä¾èµæ¶²æ¼ãçãããï¼ãªã¼ã¯ãã¹ãé½æ§ã§ãã£ãhard pancreasçä¾ã¯èµæ¶²æ¼ãçããªãã£ãï¼ãã¾ã¨ããSoft pancreasã«ããã¦ã¯èµæ­ç«¯ã®åæèµç®¡ããã®æ¼ããå¤ãï¼èµæ¶²æ¼ã®åå ã§ããå¯è½æ§ãããåæèµç®¡ã«ãæ³¨æãæãã¹ãã¨èãããã...|$|E

Two main types of virus filter defects may produce inconsistent and undesirable performance in virus removal: improper pore-size distribution across the membrane; and specific damage, such as tears, broken fibers, or pinholes. Two integrity tests are performed on each individual filter manufactured by Asahi Kasei Medical to ensure the absence of these defects prior to shipment. In this study, we verified that typical usage of Planovaâ¢ BioEX filters would not improperly shift the pore-size distribution. Damage occurring during shipment and use (e. g., broken fibers or pinholes) can be detected by end-users with sufficient sensitivity using airâwater diffusion based leakage tests. We prepared and tested filters with model pinhole defects of various sizes to develop standard acceptance criteria for the <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> relative to porcine parvovirus infectivity logarithmic reduction values (LRVs).

The {{objective of this}} study was to validate existing analytical models of the friction force and leakage for O-ring seals at high pressure, where high pressure is defined as 2000 psi. A set of three pistons with 9, 6, and 4 mm bore were used in this experiment. Each piston had a single O-ring seal located in the cap end. To validate the friction force model, the force efficiency was measured by exerting a load on a piston and collecting pressure, load, and displacement measurements during constant piston descent. To validate the leakage model, a static <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> was performed by measuring the displacement of the piston after being exposed to a constant load for an extended amount of time. Results indicated that the friction force efficiency model was valid for a range of pressures between 500 and 2000 psi, which indicates that the model for O-ring friction holds at high pressure. Results from the <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> showed that the piston moved close to 600 microns during the first 12 hours of testing and did not move for the remaining 36 hours. This indicates that O-ring seals are leak-free, so the volumetric efficiency can be approximated to be 100 %.
