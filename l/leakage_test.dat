A total of 110 human root segments were instrumented to size 80 under irrigation with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Half of the roots were irrigated with a 5-mL rinse of 17% EDTA to remove the smear layer. Roots were filled with gutta-percha (GP) and AH Plus sealer (AH), GP and Apexit sealer (AP), or RealSeal cones and sealer (RS). Following storage in humid conditions at 37 degrees C for 7 days, the specimens were mounted into a bacterial <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> model for 135 days. Survival analyses were performed to calculate the median time of leakage and log-rank test was used for pairwise comparisons of groups. Selected specimens were longitudinally sectioned and inspected by scanning electron microscopy for the presence of bacteria at the interfaces. In the presence of the smear layer, RS and AP leaked significantly more slowly than in its absence. In the absence of the smear layer, AH leaked significantly more slowly than RS. It was concluded that removal of the smear layer did not impair bacterial penetration along root canal fillings. A comparison of the sealers revealed no difference except that AH performed better than RS {{in the absence of the}} smear layer.|$|E

Ten additional roots were used as control samples. The roots were sterilized in ethylene oxide and mounted on a device for evaluation of bacterial leakage using the bacteria Enterococcus faecalis for 120 days. After the <b>leakage</b> <b>test,</b> roots were microscopically analyzed for the {{presence of}} dentin infection in the root canals and dentinal tubules. Results.

The lateral condensation technique allowed lower penetration of bacteria in the root canals and dentinal tubules, followed by Touch `n Heat + Ultrafil, MicroSeal, and Tagger`s hybrid technique, which allowed significantly greater penetration of bacteria.

40|$|Background : Pancreatic fistula is {{major source}} of {{postoperative}} morbidity or mortality. Soft pancreas has been considered {{to be one of}} the most important risk factors for pancreatic fistula. The purpose of the study is to clarify the relationship among extravasation of pancreatic secretions from the pancreatic stump, the pancreatic texture and clinical pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methods : For nineteen patients who were treated between July 2007 and August 2008, we performed intraoperative pancreatic <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> to confirm the extravasation of pancreatic secretions from the pancreatic stump. Degree of fibrosis at the cut surface of the pancreas was reviewed blindly. Results : Serum pancreatic amylase increased on first postoperative day (POD) and returned to preoperative level on 3 POD. These change were inversely correlated with fibrosis (P < 0. 001), namely the amylase level in patients with normal to mild fibrotic pancreas showed marked increase on 1 POD, but not in those with moderate to severe fibrotic pancreas. Positive pancreatic <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> was recognized in five patients (26. 3 %), four of 9 patients with soft pancreas (44. 4 %) and one of 10 with hard pancreas (10. 0 %). In soft pancreas, all four cases showing positive <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> developed pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy, while one positive case in hard pancreas did not develop pancreatic fistula. Conclusion : The extravasation of pancreatic secretions from the pancreatic stump occurred frequently in soft pancreas, which might result in postoperative pancreatic fistula. Therefore we should take care in treating branched duct as well as main pancreatic duct at the pancreatic stump of soft pancreas. 【はじめに】膵液漏は膵切除術合併症で特に問題となる合併症である．Soft pancreasは膵液漏の危険因子と言われている．今回膵切離断端からの膵液の漏れと，膵の繊維化の程度，膵液漏の発生との関連性を明らかにした．【方法】膵頭十二指腸切除を行った 19 症例に対して，切除端の膵管からアトムチューブを挿入しインジコカルミン溶液を注入し断端からの色素の漏れの有無を調べ，切除膵の繊維化の程度と組織学的になし，軽度，中等度，高度に郡別し比較．【結果】血清アミラーゼ値は，術後 1 日目に上昇し， 3 日目には術前値に戻っていたが， 1 日目の上昇は繊維化がないほど有意に高値を示した．リークテスト陽性を 5 例に認めたが， 1 例をのぞきsoft pancreas症例であった．リークテスト陽性であったsoft pancreas症例 4 例は全例膵液漏を生じたが，リークテスト陽性であったhard pancreas症例は膵液漏を生じなかった．【まとめ】Soft pancreasにおいては膵断端の分枝膵管からの漏れも多く，膵液漏の原因である可能性があり分枝膵管にも注意を払うべきと考えられる...|$|E
40|$|AbstractConfirmation {{of virus}} filter {{integrity}} {{is crucial for}} ensuring the safety of biological products. Two main types of virus filter defects may produce inconsistent and undesirable performance in virus removal: improper pore-size distribution across the membrane; and specific damage, such as tears, broken fibers, or pinholes. Two integrity tests are performed on each individual filter manufactured by Asahi Kasei Medical to ensure the absence of these defects prior to shipment. In this study, we verified that typical usage of Planova™ BioEX filters would not improperly shift the pore-size distribution. Damage occurring during shipment and use (e. g., broken fibers or pinholes) can be detected by end-users with sufficient sensitivity using air–water diffusion based leakage tests. We prepared and tested filters with model pinhole defects of various sizes to develop standard acceptance criteria for the <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> relative to porcine parvovirus infectivity logarithmic reduction values (LRVs).

40|$|Experimental {{validation}} of analytical model. The {{objective of this}} study was to validate existing analytical models of the friction force and leakage for O-ring seals at high pressure, where high pressure is defined as 2000 psi. A set of three pistons with 9, 6, and 4 mm bore were used in this experiment. Each piston had a single O-ring seal located in the cap end. To validate the friction force model, the force efficiency was measured by exerting a load on a piston and collecting pressure, load, and displacement measurements during constant piston descent. To validate the leakage model, a static <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> was performed by measuring the displacement of the piston after being exposed to a constant load for an extended amount of time. Results indicated that the friction force efficiency model was valid for a range of pressures between 500 and 2000 psi, which indicates that the model for O-ring friction holds at high pressure. Results from the <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> showed that the piston moved close to 600 microns during the first 12 hours of testing and did not move for the remaining 36 hours. This indicates that O-ring seals are leak-free, so the volumetric efficiency can be approximated to be 100 %.
