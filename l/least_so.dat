5|$|Aristotle {{stated in}} the History of Animals that all beings were {{arranged}} in a fixed scale of perfection, reflected in their form (eidos). They stretched from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the scala naturae or great chain of being. His system had eleven grades, arranged according to the potentiality of each being, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals gave birth to warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. The system was based on Aristotle's interpretation of the four elements in his On Generation and Corruption: Fire (hot and dry); Air (hot and wet); Water (cold and wet); and Earth (cold and dry). These are arranged from the most energetic to the <b>least,</b> <b>so</b> the warm, wet young raised in a womb with a placenta were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds. However, Aristotle is careful never to insist that a group fits perfectly in the scale; he knows animals have many combinations of attributes, and that placements are approximate.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the <b>least,</b> <b>so</b> it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E

25|$|Bertrand Russell {{made the}} {{following}} {{comment on the}} Philosophical Investigations in his book My Philosophical Development:I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at <b>least</b> <b>so</b> I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.Ernest Gellner wrote the book Words and Things, in which he was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to The Times. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.|$|E

The piano on which she sang was covered with brown, curly hair and she was surrounded by flames. Halfway through the performance, Gaga took the wig and placed it on her head. Ryan Love of Digital Spy had a preview of the recording of the show, and commented that when [...] "it's just GaGa [...] on the piano, you can't help but be impressed."

2500|$|In the USA, a {{protective}} trust {{is a type}} of trust that was devised for use in estate planning. (In another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of asset protection trust.) Often a person, A, wishes to leave property to another person B. A, however, [...] fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before A dies, and that therefore B would receive none of it. A could establish a trust with B as the beneficiary, but then A would not be entitled to use of the property before they died. Protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation. A would establish a trust with both A and B as beneficiaries, with the trustee instructed to allow A use of the property until they died, and thereafter to allow its use to B. The property is then safe from being claimed by As creditors, at <b>least</b> <b>so</b> long as the debt was entered into after the trust's establishment. This use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders, and is frequently used as an alternative to them.|$|E

[...] On Cap's relationships with new partners Black Widow and Brock Rumlow, [...] "I think {{he sees her}} as a valued ally, but [...] tends to be suspicious of the outfit that she works for. He trusts her as someone to have his back in a fight, but I think also believes that if S.H.I.E.L.D. told her to put a knife in his back, she would do so without hesitation, {{and that can be}} problematic. Rumlow, meantime, is an eager partner, but Cap doesn't trust him at all. First, there's the suspicion aspect. And second, I think Cap is still gun-shy because {{the last time he had}} a partner.

2500|$|From George Wilkins Kendall's {{account of}} the Texan Santa Fe Expedition: [...] "In their habits, they are clannish, social, and {{extremely}} convivial, never living alone like other animals, but, on the contrary, always found in villages or large settlements. They are a wild, frolicsome, madcap set of fellows when undisturbed, uneasy and ever on the move, and appear to take especial delight in chattering away the time, and visiting from hole to hole to gossip and talk over each other's affairs—at <b>least</b> <b>so</b> their actions would indicate. On several occasions I crept close to their villages, without being observed, to watch their movements. Directly in the centre {{of one of them}} I particularly noticed a very large dog, {{sitting in front of the}} door or entrance to his burrow, and by his own actions and those of his neighbors it really seemed as though he was the president, mayor, or chief—at all events, he was the 'big dog' of the place. For at least an hour I secretly watched the operations in this community. During that time the large dog I have mentioned received at least a dozen visits from his fellow-dogs, which would stop and chat with him a few moments, and then run off to their domiciles. All this while he never left his post for a moment, and I thought I could discover a gravity in his deportment not discernible in those by which he was surrounded. Far is it from me to say that the visits he received were upon business, or had anything to do with the local government of the village; but it certainly appeared so. If any animal has a system of laws regulating the body politic, it is certainly the prairie dog." ...|$|E
2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at <b>least</b> <b>so</b> far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction.

2500|$|In October 1944, Wittgenstein {{returned}} to Cambridge {{around the same}} time as Russell who had been living in America for several years. Russell {{returned to}} Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell's works to Drury;Russell’s books should be bound in two colours…those dealing with mathematical logic in red – and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue – and no one should be allowed to read them.Russell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein's later work;I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages.

Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal Mind. It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards writing in his diary, [...] "The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background."
