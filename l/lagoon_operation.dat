Forewarned by intelligence {{a week before}} the US raid, the Japanese had withdrawn their larger warships (heavy cruisers and larger vessels) to Palau. Once the American forces captured the Marshall Islands, they used them as a base from which to launch an early morning attack on February 17, 1944 against Truk <b>Lagoon.</b> <b>Operation</b> Hailstone lasted for three days, as American carrier-based planes sank twelve smaller Japanese warships (light cruisers, destroyers, and auxiliaries) and thirty-two merchant ships, while destroying 275 aircraft, mainly on the ground. The consequences of the attack made [...] "Truk lagoon the biggest graveyard of ships in the world".|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{and discusses}} {{the research and}} {{results of the investigation}} of biosorptive removal of organic halogens from a Kraft mill wastewater. Wastewater from a lagoon treating Kraft mill wastewater was placed in contact with returned activated sludge (RAS) collected from a Tucson wastewater treatment plant. Removal of organic halogens was quantified as the difference in total organic halogen (TOX) level between samples containing wastewater and biomass and samples containing wastewater alone. Two molecular weight distributions were analyzed: total molecular weight and < 1000 molecular weight. Total organic carbon (TOC) levels for the total molecular weight fractions were monitored. The effects of pH, temperature, biomass viability and contact time on biosorptive capabilities were examined. Implications concerning <b>lagoon</b> <b>operation</b> are discussed. Improvements for future research in this area are included in this report...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{considers}} {{environmental impacts}} {{and the power}} production potential {{of a number of}} coastally attached tidal lagoons, proposed along the North Wales coast, UK. Initially, the impoundment shape, turbine and sluice gate locations were modified according to the regional bathymetric data. A refined 0 -Dimensional approach was implemented to optimise the <b>lagoon</b> <b>operation,</b> based on given turbine and sluice gate specifications. In turn, a two-dimensional numerical model, based on an unstructured triangular mesh, has been refined to simulate the hydrodynamic processes, initially without and subsequently {{in the presence of the}} lagoons. The hydrodynamic model adopts a TVD finite volume method to solve the 2 D shallow water equations, based on a second-order accurate spatial and temporal numerical scheme. An encouraging performance is apparent in reproducing the established conditions encountered in the region through comparisons against available data. The incorporation of tidal lagoons in the model appears to have a considerable effect on the flow structure in the region, by inducing high velocity accelerations near the sluices and turbines, depending on the stage of the tidal cycle. Considering a two-way generation regime, it is outlined that the loss of intertidal regions can be minimised, which is a major source of concern with regards to the environmental impact of such schemes through an ebb-generation operation. Particular focus is directed towards the comparisons between the 0 -D and 2 -D modelling results, an aspect which has not been reported previously. Predictions of the models diverge as the scale of the lagoon project increases, but it is highlighted that the 0 -D methodology can be utilised for the optimisation of the processes in the initial stages of design before proceeding to more sophisticated numerical model simulations...|$|E

Our {{objective}} in submitting these comments {{is to help}} ensure that the final rule is based on sound science and proven agricultural practices. Within the proposed USEPA rules are {{a large number of}} options and proposals that will have implications on the costs and feasibility of phosphorus-based manure management. Will the USEPA insist on annual phosphorus limits or allow 5 -year rotation limits? Will <b>lagoon</b> <b>operations</b> be required to agitate lagoons to ensure land application of all excreted phosphorus? The many potential outcomes of the phosphorus rule make a straightforward, concise analysis difficult. The USEPA, in their analysis of the proposed rule, focused primarily on the costs associated with the proposed rule. In our analysis of the rule, we determine that feasibility issues, not costs, are the most obvious barriers to a farmer implementing its requirements. The USEPA also addressed the impact of proposed rules on components of a concentrated animal feeding operation but frequently failed to address the effect o...|$|R

50|$|Cheetham Salt {{established}} {{a series of}} ponds in the 1920s where sea water was fed into the shallow ponds and allowed to evaporate. Dried salt was then harvested {{from the floor of}} the <b>lagoons.</b> This <b>operation</b> continued until the early 1990s, when the site was purchased by the Victorian Government. The more environmentally important bayside part of the original saltworks now comprises Cheetham Wetlands which make up the migratory bird habitat and conservation area that is there today. The higher, western section is being developed privately by various housing estates, such as Sanctuary Lakes that are there today. In 1948 Point Cook hosted the Australian Grand Prix, which was held at the Point Cook RAAF Base. The race was won by Frank Pratt driving a BMW 328.|$|R
40|$|Facultative waste {{stabilization}} ponds, {{sometimes referred}} to as lagoons or ponds, are frequently used to treat municipal and industrial wastewater in the United States. The technology associated with facultative lagoons has been in widespread use in the United States for at least 90 years, with more than 7, 000 facultative <b>lagoons</b> in <b>operation</b> today. These earthen lagoons are usually 1. 2 to 2. 4 m (4 to 8 feet) in depth and are not mechanically mixed or aerated. The layer of water near the surface contains dissolved oxygen due to atmospheric reaeration and algal respiration, a condition that supports aerobic and facultative organisms. The bottom layer of the lagoon includes sludge deposits and supports anaerobic organisms. The intermediate anoxic layer, termed th...|$|R
5000|$|Objectionable odors {{are likely}} when {{the rate of}} oxygen {{transfer}} from the lagoon surface {{is less than the}} rate of oxygen consumption in the lower levels of the lagoon. A 1 acre facultative lagoon might provide 50 pounds of oxygen per day (5 grams of oxygen per square meter per day) for biochemical catabolism. Biological activity within a facultative lagoon varies directly with temperature. Warm weather will require large oxygen transfer rates, and waste accumulation during cold weather can cause short-term warm weather oxygen requirements to exceed long-term waste loading rates. [...] Algae can provide surface oxygen during daylight hours, but algal respiration can require additional oxygen during darkness. [...] Ice or scum mats can reduce the oxygen transfer surface. Some facultative lagoons use mechanical surface aerators to increase atmospheric oxygen transfer, but aerator mixing depth should not re-suspend anaerobic sludge {{from the bottom of the}} <b>lagoon.</b> Aerator <b>operation</b> may be limited to periods of heavy waste loads, high temperatures, darkness, low wind velocity, or other conditions threatening to cause anaerobic conditions on the lagoon surface.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of commercial environmental sensors and public domain modeling applications in observing soil salinity levels and salt fluxes in dairy waste <b>lagoon</b> irrigation <b>operations</b> in the San Joaquin Valley. The physical sensors employed recorded temperature, soil moisture, and electrical conductivity at multiple depths at two dairy sites, one characterized by clayey soils (Clay Dairy) and the other by sandy soils (Sandy Dairy). The sensors performed reliably with negligible temperature dependency. An exception was that high salinity in the Clay Dairy soil led to water content overestimation that required correction. The HYDRUS 1 -D software package successfully modeled field measurements of water content at the Sandy and Clay Dairies (R 2 = 0. 78, and R 2 = 0. 75 respectively), and overall salinity (R 2 = 0. 69 and R 2 = 0. 72 respectively). Estimated hydraulic parameters at both sites varied with depth but were consistent with values gleaned from the literature. Model fits of the solute transport at the sandy site resulted in large ranges in dispersivity values due to the scale of the soil domain. While the Clay Dairy hydraulic characteristics were reasonably well described by the model, the model was incapable of describing solute transport effectively, especially at the shallower depths. This result may have been due to high dispersion, and lateral movement of water and salts not accounted for by the 1 -dimensional form of the convection-dispersion equation. Long-term model projections showed distinct peaks in water and salt during irrigation events and subsequent drainage at both sites. The less permeable soil at the Clay Dairy facilitated greater water and nutrient retention in the root zone, while continued irrigation at the Sandy Dairy showed movement of salt to speculated depths of groundwater (20 to 40 meters) on a time scale of weeks, suggesting substantial salt fluxes into deep groundwater over time. Coupling detailed monitoring with more advanced models (2 D/ 3 D, groundwater-surface water) would prove beneficial in describing water and salt movement and accumulation in the vadose zone and the water table to better understand the risks salinization poses to groundwater and crop yield...|$|R
40|$|Waste <b>lagoons</b> {{of swine}} <b>operations</b> {{are a source}} of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Few studies, however, have {{reported}} on oocyst concentrations in swine waste lagoons; none have reported on oocyst viability status, nor has there been a systematic assessment of species/genotype distributions across different types of swine facilities. Ten swine waste lagoons associated with farrowing, nursery, finishing, and gestation operations were each sampled once a month for a year. Oocysts were extracted from triplicate 900 -ml effluent samples, enumerated by microscopy, and assessed for viability by dye exclusion/vital stain assay. DNA was extracted from processed samples, and 18 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced for species and genotype identification. Oocysts were observed at each sampling time at each lagoon. Annual mean concentrations of total oocysts and viable oocysts ranged between 24 and 51 and between 0. 6 and 12 oocysts ml− 1 effluent, respectively. The species and genotype distributions were dominated (95 to 100 %) by Cryptosporidium suis and Cryptosporidium pig genotype II, the latter of which was found at eight of the lagoons. The lagoon at the gestation facility was dominated by Cryptosporidium muris (90 %), and one farrowing facility showed a mix of pig genotypes, Cryptosporidium muris, and various genotypes of C. parvum. The zoonotic C. parvum bovine genotype was observed five times out of 407 18 S rDNA sequences analyzed. Our results indicate that pigs can have mixed Cryptosporidium infections, but infection with C. suis is likely to be dominant...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of livestock and poultry manure produces methane when organic {{material in the}} manure decomposes in an anaerobic environment. Many confined animal feeding operations, particularly swine and dairy operations, manage their manure and associated manure wastewater in anaerobic <b>lagoon</b> systems. These <b>operations</b> are {{a significant source of}} methane from agricultural operations. To develop a national estimate of methane emissions from these operations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 1 includes two possible estimation methodologies. The more detailed, “Tier 2 ” approach requires specific animal waste characteristics, including a methane conversion factor (MCF) that defines the portion of methane-producing potential achieved for each type of manure management system. The guidance provides a default MCF range from 0 % to 100 % for animal waste lagoons, which reflects the wide range of performance these systems may achieve. There exist relatively few data points on which to determine country-specific MCFs for these systems. Therefore, a procedure was developed for the United States to calculate MCFs based on the limited set of measurement data available, the results of laboratory-scale tests on methane production from animal waste, and knowledge on the performance of lagoon systems. This procedure accounts for temperature variation throughout the year, retention of volatile solids in a system, and management and design practices that may reduce the volatile solids available for conversion to methane...|$|R
40|$|In 1959, the {{building}} of chemical preparation plant of uranium ore MAPE Mydlovary was initiated in a small village Mydlovary, near České Budějovice. In October 1962, the operation and processing of the uranium ore started. During operation, about 17 million tons of uranium ore were processed and the material from processed uranium ores was stored into the contiguous sludge <b>lagoons.</b> The <b>operation</b> of this plant was terminated in November 1991. The premises of MAPE Mydlovary were partially liquidated, decontaminated and handed over for privatization, nowadays there are recovery and reclamation works in process. Even though, MAPE Mydlovary is nowadays {{one of the most}} dangerous strains for environment, which emerged after mining and processing of uranium ores in the Czech Republic. The projection is to liquidate the consequences of this process for many more years from now. In immediate closeness to the premises of MAPE Mydlovary there lie the villages Mydlovary, Olešník and Zahájí. It can be assumed that during the processing of uranium ores and subsequent storing of waste into the contiguous sludge lagoons there could have been some impact on the inhabitants of these villages by radio nuclides. The possibility that there are still some sources of contamination and effect on the inhabitants of the three neighboring villages cannot be excluded nowadays, even after almost 23 years after the shutdown of the plant. For this reason this diploma thesis is dealing with the effects of the preparation plant MAPE Mydlovary on the inhabitants of Mydlovary, Olešník and Zahájí, specifically on the amount of deaths due to cancer diseases of inhabitants of these villages. Data was collected from October 2013 till April 2014 and it includes figures from the period 1971 - 2010. It was collected using non-standardized interviews and was provided by practicing physicians of the investigated villages; furthermore, data was collected from websites of the Czech Statistical Office. Aim of this thesis was to analyze and compare the deaths due to cancer diseases of the inhabitants in the surroundings of MAPE Mydlovary and of inhabitants in the whole Czech Republic (whole republic´s cancer disease mortality) and evaluate the possible influence of the radiation load on the number of deaths due to cancer diseases of inhabitants in the surroundings of MAPE Mydlovary. The analysis and comparison of the number of deaths was carried out using statistical research. Non parametric testing was used for the statistical research and the so called Fisher exact test was used, which is carried out by means of statistical software www. ncss. com. For this test the level of significance - = 0, 2 was used. The influence of the radiation load on the number of deaths due to cancer diseases is statistically significant only in the village Mydlovary, where it is possible to prove statistically an increased number of deaths due to cancer diseases in comparison to the number of deaths due to cancer diseases in the whole Czech Republic. Based on the evaluation of the obtained data we can state that the chemical preparation plant of uranium ore MAPE Mydlovary most likely had and still may have a negative impact on the inhabitants of the neighboring villages, especially on the inhabitants of the village Mydlovary. For this reason it is very important to continue with the recovery and reclamation works in the premises of the chemical preparation plant of uranium ore MAPE Mydlovary and their main objective is to protect the inhabitants of surrounding villages against possible exposure to the radio nuclides. Nevertheless, the impacts of processing the former chemical preparation plant of uranium ore MAPE Mydlovary will be eliminated for many more years...|$|R
