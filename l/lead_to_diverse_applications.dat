40|$|Heteroatom doping is an {{efficient}} way to modify the chemical and electronic properties of graphene. In particular, boron doping is expected to induce a p-type (boron) -conducting behavior to pristine (nondoped) graphene, which could <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>diverse</b> <b>applications.</b> However, the experimental progress on atomic scale visualization and sensing properties of large-area boron-doped graphene (BG) sheets is still very scarce. This work describes the controlled growth of centimeter size, high-crystallinity BG sheets. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy are used to visualize the atomic structure and the local density of states around boron dopants. It is confirmed that BG behaves as a p-type conductor and a unique croissant-like feature is frequently observed within the BG lattice, which is caused by the presence of boron-carbon trimers embedded within the hexagonal lattice. More interestingly, it is demonstrated {{for the first time that}} BG exhibits unique sensing capabilities when detecting toxic gases, such as NO 2 and NH 3, being able to detect extremely lowconcentrations (e. g., parts per trillion, parts per billion). This work envisions that other attractive applications could now be explored based on as-synthesized BG...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} of proteins and polyelectrolytes <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>diverse</b> <b>applications</b> in separations, delivery and wound repair, {{and are thus}} of interest to scientists in e. g. (a) glycobiology, (b) tissue engineering, (c) biosensing, and (d) pharmacology. This breadth is accompanied by an assortment of contexts and models in which polyelectrolytes are seen as (a) protein cognates assisting in complex cellular roles, (b) surrogates for the extracellular matrix, mimicking its hydration, mechanical and sequestering properties, (c) benign hosts that gently entrap, deposit and tether protein substrate specificity, and (d) selective but non-specific agents that modify protein solubility. Unsurprisingly, this literature is somewhat segregated by objectives and paradigms. We hope this review, which emphasizes publications over the last 8 years, represents and also counterbalances that divergence. An ongoing theme {{is the role of}} electrostatics, and we show how this leads to the variety of physical forms taken by protein–polyelectrolyte complexes. We present approaches towards analysis and characterization, motivated by the goal of structure–property elucidation. Such understanding should guide in applications, our third topic. We present recent developments in modeling and simulations of protein–polyelectrolyte systems. We close with a prospective on future developments in this field...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of a society to adapt and cope with disasters is generally discussed under the term resilience. It {{is a concept that}} entered vulnerability research recently and that will still need further theoretical underpinning and empirical grounding. The vulnerability context of urban poor can be approached from different angles, such as urbanism or development studies. My thesis has the aim to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} resilience within vulnerability research. I decided to follow recent approaches in vulnerability research for two reasons. First, integrated vulnerability concepts highlight the value of interdisciplinary approaches. Second, the integrated vulnerability discourse offers a analytical framework that can be modified and applied to the empirical study of vulnerability in Jakarta's kampungs. In chapter two I will introduce the theoretical embedding of the analytical framework. This will be necessary, as disaster research in social science is a relatively young research stream. Terms such as disasters, catastrophes and hazards are often used synonymously. Moreover, different definitions of vulnerability and resilience <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>diverse</b> <b>applications</b> of the concepts. Thus, I would like to outline some aspects of disaster research in social science and present the definitions I will apply in this thesis. Moreover, at the end of chapter two, I will refine my research question and present the methodological framework I use for the analysis of my empirical data. The integrated vulnerability framework is pointing out the importance of the temporal and spatial scale in vulnerability analysis. In chapter three, I will therefore provide the temporal and spatial embedding of my research by presenting a historical perspective on Jakarta. Since it is not possible to present almost 500 years of city history in one chapter, I will concentrate on two aspects. The first focus will be put on the origin and development of Jakarta's kampungs. The second focus will be put on the flood situation. Accordingly, I will shortly present the different phases of Jakarta's history. In each phase I will point out the aspects relevant for kampungs and aspects that will be relevant in regards to the flood situation. Finally, I will conclude how the situation of the kampungs and its dwellers changed over time. In addition to that, I will discuss the historical development of flood risk in a separate section in order to contribute to a better understanding of recent flooding. Since the integrated vulnerability framework is a place based approach, I would like to introduce the theoretical discussion on urbanism and space in chapter four. I will show that the analytical value of the concept of slum in approaching the local level in Jakarta's kampungs is limited. I will also present the concept of informality as it is often discussed in the context of slums and urban poverty. Moreover, I will argue that informality is an integral part of megacities in developing countries and it reflects processes of self-organisation on a local level. Aspects of social organisations are, again, also important for a vulnerability analysis. I will then link the concepts of institutions and social capital in order to show how social organisation can be approached as a resource for communities. I will conclude the chapter with models of social space, particularly the concept of locality, that will provide a framework for structuring and analysing the empirical field data. In chapter five and six, I will leave the theoretical discussion and present the data I collected during my empirical research in two kampung. Chapter five will begin with a short introduction to the research approach and the methods I used in the research process. Then I will present the field data following the structure provided by the concept of locality which is basically referring to the categories of material space and social organisation. I will add two categories to this structure. In order to link the previous discussion on informality with the empirical research, I will present data on the informal-formal continuum in both research locations. In addition to this I will sum up my empirical findings on how people adapt to and cope with hazards, particularly flooding. I decided to separate description and analysis of my research findings because I would like to first provide a general understanding of the local situation in both research locations in a descriptive way before I analyse and interpret the data. Accordingly, I will analyse and interpret the data in chapter six. The main focus will be put on aspects of space and social organisation so that local communities can be conceptualised. In chapter seven I will finally analyse aspects of vulnerability and resilience by applying the integrated vulnerability framework to my research findings. Lastly, I will briefly summarize the thesis in chapter eight and provide an outlook. Die Kapazität einer Gesellschaft sich an Katastrophen anzupassen und diese zu bewältigen wird mit dem Begriff der Resilienz beschrieben. Es ist auch ein Konzept, dass sich kürzlich in der Vulnerabilitätsforschung etabliert hat und deshalb einer weiteren empirischen Fundierung bedarf. Dem Vulnerabilitätskontext armer Bevölkerungsgruppen in Megastädten kann man sich mit Hilfe verschiedener Ansätze nähern, wie beispielsweise Ansätze aus der Stadtforschung oder Entwicklungsstudien. Meine Forschungsarbeit hat sich zum Ziel gesetzt zu einem besseren Verständnis des Resilienzkonzepts in der Vulnerabilitätsforschung beizutragen. Ich habe mich aus zwei Gründen dazu entschlossen neuere Ansätze der Vulnerabilitätsforschung als Grundlage in meiner empirischen Forschung zu verfolgen. Zum einen unterstreicht der Vulnerabilitätsdiskurs den Wert interdisziplinärer Ansätze. Zum anderen bietet der integrierte Vulnerabilitätsdiskurs einen analytischen Rahmen der für eine empirische Studie der Vulnerabiltät der Kamung-Gemeinschaften in Jakarta herangezogen werden kann. In Kapitel zwei werde ich die theoretische Einbettung des methodologischen Analyserahmens vorstellen, der zu der Erhebung der empirischen Daten verwendet wurde. Dies wird deshalb von Bedeutung sein, da Katastrophenforschung innerhalb der Sozialwissenschaften eine relatives junges Forschungsfeld ist. Der integrierte Vulnerabilitätsansatz betont die Bedeutung von zeitlichen und räumlichen Skalen. Deshalb werde ich in Kapitel drei die zeitliche und räumliche Einbettung meiner Forschung darstellen und eine historische Betrachtung der Stadtentwicklung in Jakarta aufzeigen. Dabei werde ich mich auf zwei Aspekte fokusieren, Der erste Fokus wird auf den Ursprung und Entwicklung von den Kampungs in Jakarta gesetzt. Der zweite Fokus beschäftigt sich mit der Hochwassersituation in Jakarta. In Kapitel vier wird die theoretische Diskussion zu Urbanismusstudien und Raum vorgestellt. Dabei werde ich zeigen, dass das Konzept "Slum" nur einen geringen analytischen Wert besitzt. In diesem Zusammenhang werde ich argumentieren, dass Informalität integraler Bestandteil von Megastädten ist und Selbstorganisationsprozesse auf lokaler Ebene reflektiert. Ich werde dann den Institutionenbegriff mit dem Diskurs zu "Sozialkapital" verbinden um zu zeigen, dass für lokale Gemeinschaften soziale Organisation eine Ressource bedeuten kann. In Kapitel fünf und sechs werde ich die empirischen Daten meiner Feldforschung darstellen. Dabei werde ich den Forschungsansatz und die Methoden vorstellen. De empirischen Daten werden mit Hilfe des Konzepts der Lokalität strukturiert. Abschliessend werden die Daten interpretiert. Der integrierte Vulnerabilitätsansatz wird in Kapitel sieben dazu genutzt, die Aspekte von Vulnerabilität und Resilienz herauszuarbeiten. In Kapitel acht werden die Ergebnisse zusammen gefasst und ich gebe einen kurzen Ausblick...|$|E

Also presented is a discussion of TOFMS instrumentation and the improvements in resolution and instrument automation that have <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> widespread and <b>diverse</b> <b>applications</b> of MALDI-TOFMS in all areas of science. The feasibility of using direct laser desorption/ionization (LDI) TOFMS to detect trace elements in a variety of glass samples using a lithium borate fusion technique for sample preparation is investigated. The result of the fusion technique is a homogeneous incorporation of the analytical sample into a glass. The fusion technique is investigated as a way to eliminate matrix effects in direct LDI-TOFMS analysis. However, the high concentration and low ionization potential of lithium suppress ionization of the elements of interest. The detection limits of elements in glass samples were not at the trace level. Therefore the technique is not as useful as well-established analytical methods like Xray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry...|$|R
