5|$|The <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> {{were long}} thought {{to remain the}} same under mirror reflection. The results of an {{experiment}} viewed via a mirror {{were expected to be}} identical to the results of a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{rejects the}} teleological, or purposive, {{view of the}} {{material}} world that was dominant in the West {{from the time of}} Aristotle. The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The conatus is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no new motion or rest can be created or destroyed.|$|E

Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto.

5|$|Since Georges Lemaître first {{noted in}} 1927 that an {{expanding}} universe could {{be traced back}} in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail {{back in time to}} an initial state of extreme density and temperature.|$|E

This account posits that the relations between universals are truthmakers for the statements about physical laws, and it is realist as it accepts that <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are {{a feature of the}} world rather than just a way we talk about the world. Armstrong identifies the laws as holding between universals rather than particulars as an account of laws involving just particulars rather than universals would not adequately explain how <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> operate in the case of counterfactuals.|$|E

To the other great ethical question, How are moral distinctions apprehended?, he replies that it is by means of right reason. But by right reason he means merely the power of rising to general <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> from particular facts of experience. It is no peculiar faculty or distinctive function of mind; it involves no original element of cognition; it begins with sense and experience; it is gradually generated and wholly derivative.|$|E
25|$|Causal determinism: The {{idea that}} {{everything}} is caused by prior conditions, {{making it impossible for}} anything else to happen. In its most common form, nomological (or scientific) determinism, future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong rejects dispositionalism, {{the idea}} that dispositional {{properties}} (or powers as they are sometimes referred to) are ontologically significant and {{have an important role}} in explaining <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Armstrong believes that the challenge that dispositionalism presents for his account of <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> is not in the case of manifested dispositions (say, a glass dropping on the ground and breaking) but unmanifested dispositions (the fact that counter factually if one were to drop the glass on the ground, it would break). Armstrong simply states that the disposition is simply {{in the nature of the}} instantiated properties of the thing which is supposed to have the disposition.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{deemed it}} obvious {{that we have}} some {{objective}} knowledge of the world, such as, say, Newtonian physics. But this knowledge relies on synthetic, a priori <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> like causality and substance. The problem, then, is how this is possible. Kant's solution was to reason that the subject must supply laws that make experience of objects possible, and that these laws are the synthetic, a priori <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> that we know apply to all objects before we experience them. So, to deduce all these laws, Kant examined experience in general, dissecting in it what is supplied by the mind from what is supplied by the given intuitions. What has just been explicated is commonly called a transcendental deduction.|$|E

25|$|A third {{argument}} for incompatibilism was formulated by Carl Ginet in the 1960s and has received much {{attention in the}} modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we {{have no control over}} {{the events of the past}} that determined our present state and no control over the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the consequences of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the consequence argument. Peter van Inwagen remarks that C. D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Bart Ehrman {{states that}} what makes science {{possible}} {{is the assumption}} of the uniformity of the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> but given that miracles are by definition events that go against the usual way nature works, historians are virtually unable to confirm or refute reports of Jesus' miracles.|$|E
25|$|This {{can be seen}} {{as simply}} the classic design {{argument}} restated in the garb of contemporary cosmology.

25|$|So, Kant argues, we are {{committed}} to two incompatible positions. From the perspective of practical reason, which is involved when we consider how to act, we have to take ourselves as free. But from the perspective of speculative reason, which is concerned with investigating the nature of the world of appearance, freedom is impossible. So we {{are committed}} to freedom on the one hand, and yet on the other hand we are also committed to a world of appearances that is run by <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> and has no room for freedom. We cannot give up on either. We cannot avoid taking ourselves as free when we act, and we cannot give up our picture of the world as determined by <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> As Kant puts it, there is a contradiction between freedom and natural necessity. He calls this a dialectic of reason.|$|E
25|$|Spencer {{followed}} Comte in {{aiming for}} the unification of scientific truth; {{it was in this}} sense that his philosophy aimed to be 'synthetic.' Like Comte, he was committed to the universality of natural law, the idea that the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> applied without exception, to the organic realm as much as to the inorganic, and to the human mind as much as to the rest of creation. The first objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was thus to demonstrate that there were no exceptions to being able to discover scientific explanations, in the form of natural laws, of all the phenomena of the universe. Spencer's volumes on biology, psychology, and sociology were all intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific disciplines. Even in his writings on ethics, he held {{that it was possible to}} discover 'laws' of morality that had the status of <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> while still having normative content, a conception which can be traced to George Combe's Constitution of Man.|$|E
25|$|From a theistic viewpoint, the {{underlying}} <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> {{were designed by}} God for a purpose, and are so self-sufficient that {{the complexity of the}} entire physical universe evolved from fundamental particles in processes such as stellar evolution, life forms developed in biological evolution, and in the same way the origin of life by natural causes has resulted from these laws.|$|E
