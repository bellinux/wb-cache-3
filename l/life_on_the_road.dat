5|$|Peart is {{the main}} lyricist for Rush. Literature has always heavily {{influenced}} his writings and, as such, he has tackled {{a wide range of}} subjects. In his early days with Rush, much of his lyrical output was influenced by fantasy, science fiction, mythology and philosophy. However, nearly as much would deal with real world or personal issues such as <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and parts of his adolescence.|$|E

Passionate about the sea and rivers (a love which he owes to his grandfather), he left the Netherlands by boat with 1,000 guilders in his pocket (about two months' living expenses).|$|R

5|$|The Dark Tower reveals more of Flagg’s background, {{relating}} that he {{was born}} Walter Padick in Delain to Sam the Miller of Eastar’d Barony. At age 13 Walter set out for a <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> but was raped by a fellow wanderer; author Bev Vincent hypothesized in The Road to the Dark Tower that Flagg's later actions towards Delain in The Eyes of the Dragon may have been revenge for the abuse he suffered as a child. Resisting the temptation to crawl back home, Padick instead moves towards his destiny; he learns various forms of magic, achieving a quasi-immortality. After centuries of wreaking havoc Flagg attracts {{the attention of the}} Crimson King, who adopts him as his emissary.|$|E

5|$|This {{version of}} the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album Chunga's Revenge (1970), which was {{followed}} by the double-album soundtrack to the movie 200 Motels (1971), featuring the Mothers, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Ringo Starr, Theodore Bikel, and Keith Moon. Co-directed by Zappa and Tony Palmer, it was filmed in a week at Pinewood Studios outside London. Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting. The film deals loosely with <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> as a rock musician. It was the first feature film photographed on videotape and transferred to 35mm film, a process that allowed for novel visual effects. It was released to mixed reviews. The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the Royal Albert Hall after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.|$|E

Road accident occurrence rates also tend to distinguish the developed from the developing world. For South Africa to be a caring nation and to lead the way in the development of southern Africa nations, it follows that <b>the</b> importance of <b>road</b> safety cannot be underestimated. The annual loss of <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> is horrific, and the cost of accidents to the country is enormous. A significant proportion of South Africas accidents occur in the large urban concentrations.

EThekwini is in the process of developing a comprehensive and integrated road safety plan to effectively address <b>the</b> <b>road</b> safety problem. <b>The</b> paper will focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> importance of <b>road</b> safety to South Africa as a nation (and eThekwini in particular) and the overall development of eThekwinis road safety plan.
