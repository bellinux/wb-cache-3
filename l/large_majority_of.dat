5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill a <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the emerging young {{of a population}} is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of {{one or a few}} years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E

The colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788, {{was part of the}} eastern half of Australia claimed by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770, and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation. Together with another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies, the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901.|$|E

5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that the <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo.

The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} known to kill deer, {{especially}} in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the Everglades showed a <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. On the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E

Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E

5|$|The cytosol is {{a complex}} mixture of {{substances}} dissolved in water. Although water forms the <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the cytosol, its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular fluid; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation, cell signaling, and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such as endocrine, nerve and muscle cells. The cytosol also contains large amounts of macromolecules, which can alter how molecules behave, through macromolecular crowding.|$|E

However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of all the polls.|$|E
