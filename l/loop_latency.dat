We present an application of extended time delay autosynchronization introduced by Socolar et al. to an unstable focus. This system represents a generic model of an unstable steady state which can be found for instance in a Hopf bifurcation. In addition to the original controller design, we investigate effects of control <b>loop</b> <b>latency</b> and a bandpass filter on the domain of control. Furthermore, we consider coupling of the control force to the system via a rotational coupling matrix parametrized by a variable phase.

40|$|Abstract—The {{traditional}} {{sampling method}} in process control systems {{is based on}} a periodic task model. This is because controllers are executed in a strictly periodic manner. Sensors sample the process data and send it periodically to the appropriate controllers through a communication system such as the fieldbus. Since the fieldbus is shared by multiple sensors, there is some delay (control <b>loop</b> <b>latency)</b> between the sampling and control actions. In order to minimize the control <b>loop</b> <b>latency,</b> a higher than necessary sampling frequency is typically adopted, which results in unnecessary waste of energy. In this paper, we propose MinMax: a sampling interval control algorithm for tackling this problem. In MinMax, sampling tasks are not periodic but have both maximum and minimum distance constraints. This sampling model has advantages that are especially important in the domain of wireless control for industrial automation. We shall then discuss the jitter property of sampling schemes under this model and propose algorithms for controlling the sampling intervals of sensors in terms of the MinMax problem (UMinMax) which we shall introduce. Though this problem is NP-hard in general, even for special case of unit-time tasks, we show how to reduce MinMax to well-studied scheduling models such as Liu and Laylandtype periodic models and pinwheel models, at the expense of some loss of schedulability. These reductions allow us to derive efficient schedulability tests {{that can be used to}} solve the sampling interval control problem in practice. Simulations are used to compare the performance of different UMinMax schedulers in two key figures of merit: the acceptance ratio and the jitter ratio. Simulation of a process control system model also shows that UMinMax can reduce about 40 % of the traffic load on the communication system which is especially important for energy-aware wireless process control applications.

We propose a method that computes haptic feedback for the steering wheel. It is best suited for low-cost, fixed-base driving simulators but can be ported to any driving simulator platform. The goal of our method is twofold. 1) It provides an efficient yet simple algorithm to model the steering mechanism using a quadri-polar representation. 2) This model is used to compute the haptic feedback on top of which a tunable haptic augmentation is adjusted to overcome the lack of presence and the unavoidable simulation <b>loop</b> <b>latencies.</b> This algorithm helps the driver to laterally control the virtual vehicle.

40|$|We present Virtual Resources: a {{software}} architecture {{to resolve the}} tension between effective development and efficient operation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Emerging IoT architectures exhibit recurring traits: resource-limited sensors and actuators with RESTful interfaces at one end; full-fledged Cloud-hosted applications at the opposite end. The application logic resides entirely at the latter, creating performance issues such as excessive energy consumption and high latencies. To ameliorate these, Virtual Resources allows developers to push {{a slice of the}} application logic to intermediate IoT devices, creating a continuum between physical resources and Cloud-hosted applications. With Virtual Resources, for example, developers can push processing of sensed data to IoT devices close to the physical sensors, reducing the data to transmit and thus saving energy. We describe the key concepts of Virtual Resources and their realization in a CoAP prototype atop resource-constrained devices. Experimental results from cycle-accurate emulation indicate that Virtual Resources enable better performance than Cloud-centric architectures, while retaining the RESTful interaction pattern.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Two {{new medium}} access {{protocols}} for ring type local area networks, CTR (Concurrent Token Ring) protocol and DRUID (Destination Removal withoUt Intermediate node Delay) ring protocol, are proposed, designed and analyzed. A destination partial removal technique is designed {{and used in}} these two protocols to support concurrent message transmission and minimize <b>loop</b> <b>latency.</b> CTR protocol is the first protocol using the destination partial removal technique. In this network, a source node captures a Token and transmits a message which loops around the ring to its destination. The message frame is truncated and configured by the destination node into a Conditional Token which is allowed to circulate back to the source node for final destruction. The Conditional Token, informs "downstream" nodes of busy data paths and allows them to establish concurrent message transmission if the resources they need are free. In a DRUID ring network, a node may initiate message transmission if its output link is free. Every node will relay each incoming message immediately if it is idle when the message arrives. At the same time, the node also receives and buffers all the incoming messages. Upon decoding the destination address, the destination node will truncate the message frame to form a cut frame by eliminating the information field from its output data stream. This cut frame will continue to circulate around the ring until it arrives at a busy node where it is buffered, identified and destroyed. The message frame will be completely removed by the destination node if it is busy when the message arrives. The protocol supports high concurrency while the <b>loop</b> <b>latency</b> is minimized. Programs {{have been developed to}} simulate these two protocols. Their results are compared with Token Ring protocol and Register Insertion Ring protocol. The comparisons have shown that both of the new protocols have higher performances than the existing ring protocols...|$|E

We investigate three possible modifications of the PD scheme with the aim of extending the range of permissible delays. Effectively, these modifications introduce another parameter. This additional parameter can be used to continue the triple-zero singularity in four parameters until it gains a higher-order degeneracy imposing a new limit on the permissible delay.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an architectural study on the design of FPGA- based architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We have analyzed the memory access patterns of a Convolutional Neural Network (one of the biggest networks in the family of deep learning algorithms) by creating a trace of a well-known CNN architecture and by developing a trace-driven DRAM simulator. The simulator uses the traces to analyze the effect that different storage patterns and dissonance in speed between memory and processing element, can have on the CNN system. This insight is then used create an initial design for a layer architecture for the CNN using an FPGA platform. The FPGA is designed to have multiple parallel-executing units. We design a data layout for the on-chip memory of an FPGA such that we can increase parallelism in the design. As the number of these parallel units (and hence parallelism) depends on the memory layout of input and output, particularly if parallel read and write accesses can be scheduled or not. The on-chip memory layout minimizes access contention during the operation of parallel units. The result is an SoC (System on Chip) that acts as an accelerator and can have more number of parallel units than previous work. The improvement in design was also observed by comparing post synthesis <b>loop</b> <b>latency</b> tables between our design and one with a single unit design.

The ADFE overcomes the first feedback-loop latency challenge of traditional digital and mixed-signal DFEs by separating data re-timing from equalization and also {{eliminates the need}} for clock-recovery prior to decision-feedback equalization. The ADFE enables 10 -Gb/sec decision-feedback equalization using a 0. 18 -um CMOS process, the first to do so to the author s knowledge. A tuneable current-mode-logic (CML) feedback-loop is designed to enable first post-cursor cancellation for a range of data-rates and to have external control over <b>loop</b> <b>latency</b> over variations in process, voltage and temperature. CML design techniques are used to minimize current consumption and achieve the required voltage swing for decision-feedback to take place. The all-analog equalizer consumes less power and area than comparable state-of-the art DFEs. The ADFE is used to compensate inter-symbol interference (ISI) for 20 inches of FR- 4 backplane and 300 m of multi-mode fibre at 10 -Gb/sec. The ADFE also extends the reach of single-mode fibre at 10 -Gb/sec to 120 km. The work described in this dissertation advances the state-of-the-art in equalization solutions for multi-Gb/sec serial data transmission and can find applications in several of the 10 -Gb/sec Ethernet standards that have been approved recently.

40|$|The {{trend of}} {{increasing}} storage densities results in growing sensitivity of system performance to variations of storage channel parameters. To counteract these variations, more adaptivity {{is needed in}} the data receiver. Accurate tracking of rapid variations is limited by latencies in the adaptation <b>loops.</b> These <b>latencies</b> are largely governed by delays of the bit detector. In two-dimensional storage systems, data are packaged {{in a group of}} adjacent tracks or rows, and for some of the rows the detection delays can increase dramatically with respect to one-dimensional systems.

Rapid variations for all the rows are tracked using control information from rows for which detector latency is smallest.

This lability allows spontaneous conversion of the active form to a more stable, latent conformation under physiological conditions. In other serpins, polymerization, rather than latency transition, is induced under pathological conditions or upon heat treatment. To identify specific factors promoting latency conversion in PAI- 1, we mutated PAI- 1 at various positions and compared the effects with those of equivalent mutations in α 1 -antitrypsin, the archetypal serpin. Mutations that improved interactions with the turn between helix F and the third strand of β-sheet A (thFs 3 A) or the fifth strand of β-sheet A (s 5 A), which are near the site of latency transition-associated insertion of the reactive center <b>loop,</b> retarded <b>latency</b> conversion but did not greatly increase structural stability.

40|$|Performance of {{adaptive}} optics (AO) compensation for beam control is quantified via wave-optical propagation, sensing, and control methods using wind tunnel measurements 1 of aero-optical disturbances {{in addition to}} Kolmogorov turbulence distributed over a laser path. For Kolmogorov turbulence the residual phase variance scales as (fG/f 3 dB) 5 / 3, where fG is the Greenwood frequency for the propagation path 2 and f 3 dB is the error-rejection bandwidth of the classical AO control. It is shown that the residual phase variance with classical AO control, when normalized to the open-loop, scales as (fA/f 3 dB) γ, where γ is an arbitrary power and fA is a characteristic frequency of the aero-optical disturbance deter-mined from a linear fit of the compensation data with increasing bandwidth. AO system latency degrades performance, especially with high-bandwidth control. When operating at a fixed but modest sampling frequency with appreciable latency, AO compensation perfor-mance can be significantly enhanced by application of an adaptive control augmentation based on lattice filtering of the residual wavefront sensor gradients, as was implemented in the wave-optics simulations. A classical controller operating at 200 Hz bandwidth with> 400 µsec latency has a limited ability to compensate the aero-optical and free-stream disturbances.

In the recent years, low power communications has evolved towards multi-kilometer ranges and low bit-rate approaches such as LoRa TM. However, the medium access layer protocols rely on the well-known duty-cycling schemes, which require a trade-off between power consumption and latency for message transfer from the gateway to the nodes.

40|$|Actions are {{selected}} {{in the context of}} environmental demands and internal goals. Both change constantly and dynamically and several studies have addressed the issue of how information about these is represented, updated and integrated in the brain to form appropriate decisions and actions. The reprogramming of actions requires inhibition of movements or movement plans, resolution of response conflict and initiation of alternative actions. The right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) and the presupplementary motor areas (pre-SMA) have been suggested {{to play a major role}} in response inhibition and action reprogramming. The degree to which inhibition of actions at a behavioural level can be related to physiological inhibition is unknown. Using single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we investigated M 1 excitability and M 1 internal inhibitory mechanisms during action reprogramming (see Chapter 2. 1. 1). The temporal pattern of M 1 excitability and M 1 internal inhibitory mechanisms differed from those during normal action execution and could therefore play a causal role in action reprogramming. These findings are important as M 1 is likely to be the site of convergence from different influences exerted by regions in the frontal lobes. In a second experiment we used paired-pulse TMS over rIFC and M 1 to investigate functional rIFC-M 1 interactions (see 2. 1. 2). We found that rIFC inhibited M 1 excitability 175 ms after cue onset only in trials when actions needed to be reprogrammed and responses had to be inhibited, but not during normal action selection. In a third experiment we used a combined paired-pulse TMS – diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) approach to elucidate anatomical pathways of functional pre-SMA-M 1 and rIFC-M 1 connectivity (see 2. 2). We found extended networks of executive control and action reprogramming. These results suggest that both, pre-SMA and rIFC influence motor output via premotor areas and fronto-basal ganglia <b>loops.</b> Different <b>latency</b> periods of rIFC-M 1 and pre-SMA-M 1 interactions were mediated by different white matter paths and networks. In a fourth experiment we tried to delineate the roles of rIFC and pre-SMA during action reprogramming using a combined paired-pulse TMS– repetitive TMS paradigm (see 2. 3). The inhibitory influence exerted by rIFC over M 1 during action reprogramming disappeared after mild and transient disruption of pre-SMA activity. Besides elucidating a network of brain areas associated with action reprogramming and movement inhibition these experiments have interesting methodological implications.

40|$|In {{the design}} process of {{high-throughput}} applications, design choices concerning the type of processor architecture and appropriate scheduling mechanism, have to be made. Take a reed-solomon decoder as an example, the amount of clock cycles consumed in decoding a code {{is dependent on the}} amount of errors within that code. Since this is not known in advance, and the environment in which the code is transmitted can cause a variable amount of errors within that code, a processor architecture which employs a static scheduling scheme, has to assume the worst case amount of clock cycles in order to cope with the worst case situation and provide correct results. On the other hand a processor that employs a dynamic scheduling scheme, can gain wasted clock cycles, by scheduling the exact amount of clock cycles that are needed and not the amount of clock cycles needed for the worst case situation. Since processor architectures that employ dynamic scheduling schemes have more overhead, designers have to make their choice beforehand. In this paper we address the problem of making the correct choice of whether to use a static or dynamic scheduling scheme. The strategy is to determine whether the application possess non-manifest behavior and weigh out this dynamic behavior against static scheduling solutions which were quite common in the past. We provide criteria for choosing the correct scheduling architecture for a high throughput application based upon the environmental and algorithm-specification constraints.

40|$|Plasminogen {{activator}} inhibitor type 1 (PAI- 1) is {{a member}} of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. Its highly mobile reactive-center loop (RCL) is thought to account for both the rapid inhibition of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), and the rapid and spontaneous transition of the unstable, active form of PAI- 1 into a stable, inactive (latent) conformation (t(1 / 2) at 37 degrees C, 2. 2 hours). We determined the amino acid residues responsible for the inherent instability of PAI- 1, to assess whether these properties are independent and, consequently, whether the structural basis for inhibition and latency transition is different. For that purpose, a hypermutated PAI- 1 library that is displayed on phage was pre-incubated for increasing periods (20 to 72 hours) at 37 degrees C, prior to a stringent selection for rapid t-PA binding. Accordingly, four rounds of phage-display selection resulted in the isolation of a stable PAI- 1 variant (st- 44 : t(1 / 2) 450 hours) with 11 amino acid mutations. Backcrossing by DNA shuffling of this stable mutant with wt PAI- 1 was performed to eliminate non-contributing mutations. It was shown that the combination of mutations at positions 50, 56, 61, 70, 94, 150, 222, 223, 264 and 331 increases the half-life of PAI- 1 245 -fold. Furthermore, within the limits of detection the stable mutants isolated are functionally indistinguishable from wild-type PAI- 1 with respect to the rate of inhibition of t-PA, cleavage by t-PA, and binding to vitronectin. These stabilizing mutations constitute largely reversions to the stable "serpin consensus sequence" and are located in areas implicated in PAI- 1 stability (e. g. the vitronectin-binding domain and the proximal hinge). Collectively, our data provide evidence that the structural requirements for PAI- 1 <b>loop</b> insertion during <b>latency</b> transition and target proteinase inhibition can be separate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{the most}} prevalent endocrine disease {{and one of the}} most common causes of peripheral neuropathy. Neither conventional electrodiagnostic nor imaging studies (even MRI of lumbosacral vertebrae) can precisely differentiate concomitant radiculopathy (e. g. S 1 -root irritation) and diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy. This usually leads to unnecessary surgical interventions and its complications. In this study, S 1 -roots of diabetic neuropathic patients with impaired conventional H-reflexes were evaluated by the central loop of gastrocnemius-soleus H-reflexes. Materials & Methods: This descriptive study was performed in the clinics of Shiraz medical school in 1387 (2008). Forty two diabetic patients (14 males and 28 females with a mean age of 48. 2 years) with unobtainable or abnormal conventional gastrocnemius-soleus H-reflexes and peripheral neuropathy were enrolled. The central loop of H-reflex was performed bilaterally by stimulating S 1 -root with a monopolar needle and recorded in the half way of the line from popliteal crease to the medial malleolus. Collected data were analyzed by McNemar test, using SPSS software. Results: Of 84 limbs with impaired conventional H-reflexes, 82 limbs (97. 6 %) had the central loop of H-reflexes with latencies less than 8 ms. All the limbs with abnormally prolonged conventional H-reflexes' latencies had the central <b>loop</b> of H-reflexes' <b>latencies</b> in the range of 5. 5 - 7. 85 ms. The <b>latency</b> of central <b>loop</b> of H-reflex in this study was 6. 34 ± 0. 96 ms with the range of 4. 3 - 7. 85 ms. Conclusion: In case the conventional H-reflex is impaired, the central loop of H-reflex in diabetic neuropathic patients offers a valuable approach for investigating S 1 -root. It seems that this approach leads to a better diagnosis of the absence of radiculopathy and a decrease in the rate of unnecessary surgical interventions and its complications in diabetics.
