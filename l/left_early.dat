5|$|The remains visible {{today are}} those of the stone bath house and mansio, built in {{approximately}} 130CE after Letocetum ceased to have a military function and became a civilian settlement.

At the end of the 3rd century, the town relocated within high defensive walls astride Watling Street. After the Romans <b>left</b> <b>early</b> in the 5th century the settlement went into decline.

5|$|As the war {{turned against}} the Austrians, the {{garrison}} in Bologna <b>left</b> <b>early</b> {{in the morning on}} 12 June 1859. By the end of the same day the papal colours flying in the squares had been replaced with the Italian green, white and red, the cardinal legate had left the city, and a group styling itself Bologna's provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. Bologna was promptly incorporated as part of the province of Romagna. The Archbishop Michele Viale-Prelà attempted to persuade the citizenry not to co-operate with the new civil authorities, but had little success.
