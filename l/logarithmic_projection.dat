40|$|The amoeba of {{a complex}} hypersurface is its image under a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>projection.</b> A number of {{properties}} of algebraic hypersurface amoebas are carried over {{to the case of}} transcendental hypersurfaces. We demonstrate the potential that amoebas can bring into statistical physics by considering the problem of energy distribution in a quantum thermodynamic ensemble. The spectrum ϵ_k⊂Z^n of the ensemble is assumed to be multidimensional; this leads us to the notions of a multidimensional temperature and a vector of differential thermodynamic forms. Strictly speaking, in the paper we develop the multidimensional Darwin and Fowler method and give the description of the domain of admissible average values of energy for which the thermodynamic limit exists.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{automatic}} generation of features for value function approximation. Bellman Error Basis Functions (BEBFs) have been shown to im-prove the error of policy evaluation with function approximation, with a conver-gence rate similar to that of value iteration. We propose a simple, fast and ro-bust algorithm based on random projections to generate BEBFs for sparse feature spaces. We provide a finite sample analysis of the proposed method, and prove that <b>projections</b> <b>logarithmic</b> in the dimension of the original space are enough to guarantee contraction in the error. Empirical results demonstrate the strength of this method. ...|$|R
40|$|Anisotropy {{arises in}} {{mechanics}} and other fields of science as the deviatoric-symmetric parts of various tensor quantities {{and is a}} frequently measurable physical proper ty of naturally deformed rocks. This presentation discusses homogeneous anisotropies of a real second-order tensor nature and asks whether any one graphical representation of form and intensity is fundamental and facilitates linear statistical analysis. The question has practical application {{to the problem of}} superposed anisotropies in geological materials and is of interest for representation of deviatoric second-order tensors generally. Geometric tensors such as homogeneous finite strain and second-order mineral-orientation density are members of what mathematicians call Lie groups that can be mapped into corresponding lineartensors by logarithmic operations. The deviatoric part that is of interest here lies at a unique position with respect to the projections of defined principal axes in an octahedral plane, sometimes called a three-axis plane. Thus vector addition and linear statistics can be applied to points in this plane, including points defined by the projections of logarithms of principal components of deviatoric geometric tensors. The <b>logarithmic</b> octahedral <b>projection</b> can assist not only in separating tectonic and initial components of anisotropy, such as in deformed sedimentary rocks, but also in providing information about the underlying lineartensor relating to average deformation styles and transport directions in tectonic zones. The method is discussed for monoclinic transpressive and transtensional non-coaxial progressive deformations of an orthogonal bedding anisotropy and compared with some of the more commonly used graphical plots. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} convex {{constrained}} optimization problems, where {{the solution is}} subject to a convex inequality constraint. In particular, we aim at challenging problems for which both projection into the constrained domain and a linear optimization under the inequality constraint are time-consuming, which render both projected gradient methods and conditional gradient methods (a. k. a. the Frank-Wolfe algorithm) expensive. In this paper, we develop projection reduced optimization algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth optimization with improved convergence rates under a certain regularity condition of the constraint function. We first present a general theory of optimization with only one projection. Its application to smooth optimization with only one projection yields O(1 /ϵ) iteration complexity, which improves over the O(1 /ϵ^ 2) iteration complexity established before for non-smooth optimization and can be further reduced under strong convexity. Then we introduce a local error bound condition and develop faster algorithms for non-strongly convex optimization {{at the price of}} a <b>logarithmic</b> number of <b>projections.</b> In particular, we achieve an iteration complexity of O(1 /ϵ^ 2 (1 -θ)) for non-smooth optimization and O(1 /ϵ^ 1 -θ) for smooth optimization, where θ∈(0, 1] appearing the local error bound condition characterizes the functional local growth rate around the optimal solutions. Novel applications in solving the constrained ℓ_ 1 minimization problem and a positive semi-definite constrained distance metric learning problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve significant speed-up compared with previous algorithms.
