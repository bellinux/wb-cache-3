5|$|By 1994, {{the tram}} {{route to the}} new {{hospital}} appeared to have political support, but by 1996 local politicians instead wanted to use Gaustad Station and buses to serve the hospital. There also arose a disagreement between {{the city and the}} state as to who should be paying for the light rail line, should it should be built. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, <b>line</b> <b>4</b> was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsarken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built. On 20 August 2003, the Ring Line of the metro opened, and <b>line</b> <b>4</b> started to also serve Nydalen and Storo.|$|E
5|$|The Sognsvann Line {{is served}} by lines 4 and 5 of the Oslo Metro. Half of line 5 trains operate {{the full length of}} the Sognsvann Line, while <b>line</b> <b>4</b> and {{the other half of the}} line 5 trains branch off after Ullevål stadion and serve the Ring Line. All {{services}} operate with a fifteen-minute headway, except during late evenings and weekend mornings. This gives the stations Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion an average five-minute headway to the city center and all stations in the Common Tunnel, and an average ten-minute headway to Nydalen and Storo. On the east side of the city, Line 5 connects with the Ring Line, and makes a full loop before it leaves Oslo on the Grorud Line. <b>Line</b> <b>4</b> connects with the Lambertseter Line. Travel time from Stortinget to Sognsvann is 18 minutes. The Oslo Metro is operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse had {{notified}} {{his counterpart}} in Newport, the Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of his intentions and his planned arrival date. Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the <b>line,</b> <b>4</b> frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route {{in order to}} minimize the possibility of an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton to mobilize assistance for Cornwallis.|$|E

5|$|The Oslo Metro {{operates}} in all fifteen boroughs of Oslo, {{as well as}} reaching a bit inside the neighbouring municipality of Bærum. There are five lines, numbered 1 through 5, each color-coded. They all pass through the Common Tunnel, serving eight branch lines. In addition two lines operate to the Ring Line. Two branches are served by two lines each: the Grorud branch is served by both lines 4 and 5, while the Lambertseter branch has full-time service by <b>line</b> <b>4</b> and limited service by line 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} opened from Ullevål stadion via Nydalen to Storo on 20 August 2003, costing NOK590 million. With the opening, <b>line</b> <b>4</b> was {{extended}} from Ullevål stadion to Storo. Nydalen {{had grown up}} as an urban redevelopment area after the local industry had been abandoned in the 1980s, where 14,800 jobs had been located by 2004. On 20 August 2006, the final section opened, from Storo via Sinsen to Carl Berners plass, with the whole project costing NOK1,348 million.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the suburbs of the left bank were the quickest growing areas of Rouen, in {{particular}} the communes of Sotteville (a large railway town) and Grand-Quevilly, but these towns did not have good enough public transport. Although the CTR had constructed some lines, they did not well serve residents wishing for rapid transit between the suburbs and the city centre. <b>Line</b> <b>4</b> of the CTR, with its central terminus at Place Beauvoisine, ran only as far as the Trianon roundabout {{at the edge of the}} Jardin des Plantes. A southern extension was planned to the Bruyères roundabout, a meeting-point of several roads to the new districts, and to the racecourse where major horse racing events took place each Thursday. But it was always delayed.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1991 {{decision}} {{to build a}} new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered too far away to be a suitable transfer point. Forskningsparken would also serve {{the northern part of the}} Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, <b>Line</b> <b>4</b> of the metro was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsparken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built.|$|E
5|$|The {{city council}} {{voted in favor}} of {{building}} the Ring Line on 25 June 1997, against the votes of the Progress Party. Financing was partially ensured in December, when a political agreement was reached for Oslo Package 2, a financing plan for investments in public transport in Oslo and Akershus between 2002 and 2011. Construction started in June, with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction. The first section opened from Ullevål stadion via Nydalen to Storo on 20 August 2003. With the opening, and <b>Line</b> <b>4</b> was extended from Ullevål stadion to Storo. On 20 August 2006, the final section opened, from Storo via Sinsen to Carl Berners plass.|$|E
5|$|City {{planning}} staff {{estimate that}} the peak ridership of the one-stop extension to be 7,300 in the peak hour and peak direction, {{about half of the}} 15,000 peak ridership considered the low end to justify a subway. With the original three-stop extension, the peak ridership estimate was 9,500 to 14,000; however, that estimate was reduced to 7,300 because of competition from the proposed SmartTrack and by the elimination of two of the three original stops. Mayor John Tory and Scarborough Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker say a peak ridership of 7,300 would still be acceptable as it is still greater than the 6,000 peak at terminal station Kipling. However, a Toronto Star article points out there is only one station within 6 kilometres of Scarborough Town Centre but more stations are within 6 kilometres of other terminal stations to boost ridership. The SSE would carry an estimate 31,000 riders per day as compared to 66,355 riders from Kipling to Jane (five stations) and 96,660 riders from Finch to York Mills (four stations). The SSE performs better in ridership only against the terminal of the underperforming <b>Line</b> <b>4</b> Sheppard line.|$|E
