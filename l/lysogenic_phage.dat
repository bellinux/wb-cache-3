40|$|In {{the wake}} of global warming {{seawater}} temperatures in temperate waters increased over the past decades. In consequence, many bacterial species can proliferate successfully in those for-mer cold habitats, increasing drastically in abundance. But the emergence of microbial commu-nities embraces not only harmless but also pathogenic genera, entailing severe consequences for human infections. Especially several pathogenic species of the genus Vibrio may be an in-creasing health risk in the future. Though, not only the temperature related emergence of path-ogenic strains was in the focus of recent studies, but also the origin of new pathogenic strains in the first place. Phages are known to {{play a key role}} in the development of new virulent and pathogenic strains. As a result to their vast influence of microbial genome diversification phages have become a prime suspect in the adaptation of new pathogens. Common genomic alterations are caused by lysogenic conversion, a process in which <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phages</b> transfer virulence factors to the bacterial host upon prophage integration. These virulence factors can encode haz-ardous toxins or other beneficial metabolic modifications, increasing the pathogenic potential of the bacteria. Many studies focused on a detailed genomic analysis of <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phages,</b> to understand the evolution of new pathogenic strains and the underlying molecular mechanism. However, due to the fact that the <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phages</b> are commonly integrated within the bacterial genome, phage separation and isolation is a fundamental process for any phage-related study. Thus was the aim of this thesis the isolation of <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phages</b> from potentially pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strains, to enable a detailed analysis of the phage genome in successive stud-ies. Prophages were detected in two out of 12 strains, via chemical induction. The remaining strains carried either no prophage (inducible with the used methods) or the induction was too inconsistent for further experiments. In general, all strains showed a high intraspecies diversity concerning induction efficiency and growth development. Furthermore, most strains reacted highly sensible towards modulation of particular experimental parameters. Finally the strains with inducible prophages were used to produce large quantities of phage biomass, enabling a detailed characterization of the <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phages</b> in future studies. Only on the basis of phage isolation, possible virulence factors within the phage genome can be identified which might relate to the emergence of new pathogenic Vibrio strains...|$|R

It is then passed on to its daughter cells; this is why it usually isn’t recognized by the host. A process known as <b>lysogenic</b> or <b>phage</b> conversion changes the properties of the bacteria cell; this is possible because the prophage itself contains genes that can present new properties into the bacteria cell or host cell.

40|$|Phage group II Staphylococcus aureus {{has been}} {{identified}} as the etiological agent of the staphylococcal scaleded skin syndrome. The development of an animal model system permitted fulfillment of Koch's postulates and recognition of exfoliative toxin (ET) as being responsible for some of the clinical manifestations of this syndrome. Initial studies directed toward associating a <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phage</b> with the genetic control of ET synthesis failed to support this hypothesis. Growth of two Tox+ strains at 44 C was more effective than growth in ethidium bromide or sodium dodecyl sulfate in eliminating the ability to produce ET. The early and rapid accumulation of ET-negative (Tox−) variants during growth of strain UT 0007 at 44 C, the lack of any selective advantage of the Tox− variants over Tox+ cells during growth at 44 C, and an enhanced elimination frequency at 44 C of 97. 9 % over the spontaneous frequency of loss strongly suggest that the gene for ET synthesis is extrachromosomal.

The aim was to determine which factor(s) controlled viral dynamics using detailed concomitant published data on inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and bacterial production for Beaver Lake (Freshwater Biology, 51, 2006, 1119). Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the bacterial community was also undertaken to investigate the potential relationship between bacterial community composition and viral dynamics. Virus concentration ranged between 1. 43 × 104 and 302. 4 × 104 viruses mL- 1 and showed a clear increase over the summer, while bacterial concentrations exhibited no seasonal pattern (range: 9. 6 × 104 to 44. 6 × 104 cells mL- 1). Consequently, VBR varied with highest values in January (3. 32 - 7. 33).

40|$|The {{potential}} effect that induction of lysogenic bacteria has on bacteriophage production and bacterial mortality in coastal waters was investigated, and we present {{estimates for the}} percentage of lysogenic cells in a natural aquatic bacterial community. Various concentrations of mitomycin C and exposure times to UV C radiation (UV-C) (wavelength of 254 nm) were used to induce the lytic cycle in lysogenic cells of natural communities of marine bacteria. UV-C treatment occasionally resulted in phage production, but phage production induced by UV-C was always less than that caused {{by the addition of}} mitomycin C. There was no evidence that high growth rates of bacteria resulted in <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phage</b> production. The burst size of cells induced by mitomycin C was determined by transmission electron microscopy and ranged from 11 to 45. Dividing the induced phage production by the burst size provided an estimate of the number of lysogenic bacterial cells, which ranged from 0. 07 to 4. 4 % (average, 1. 5 %) of the total bacterial population. The percentages of lysogenic bacteria that were induced by mitomycin C were similar for samples collected nearshore from the pier of the Marine Science Institute (chlorophyll a, 1. 6 to 2. 9 (mu) g liter(sup- 1)) and in relatively oligotrophic water (chlorophyll a, 0. 2 to 0. 9 (mu) g liter(sup- 1)) collected 25 to 100 km offshore. By using a steady-state model, if all lysogenic bacteria were induced simultaneously, 0. 14 to 8. 8 % (average, 3. 0 %) of the total bacterial mortality would result from induction of lysogenic cells.

Materials and Methods: A total of 968 S. aureus isolates were collected from a tertiary care hospital in Tehran, Iran and identified at the species level by PCR and biochemical tests. Susceptibility to 17 antibiotics was determined. Then oxacillin and vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the resistant isolates were determined. Multiplex-PCR was used to detect 6 classes of prophages. Results: Out of the 968 isolates 247 isolates were resistant to methicillin. Highest antibiotic resistance was seen to penicillin (100 %), erythromycin (89. 8 %), kanamycin (89. 4 %), ciprofloxacin (88. 6 %) and tobramycin (87. 4) respectively. None of the MRSA isolates showed resistance to vancomycin, synercid and linezolid. MIC results indicated that 46. 1 and 4. 4 % of isolates with high (MIC ≥ 128 µg/ml) and low level (MIC ≥ 4 µg/ml) showed resistance to oxacillin, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Bioinformatic {{analysis}} of the genome sequence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae revealed the presence of nine probable prophage islands. The distribution, conservation and function {{of many of these}} sequences, and their ability to produce bacteriophage particles are unknown. Results Our {{analysis of}} the genomic sequence of FA 1090 identified five genomic regions (NgoΦ 1 – 5) that are related to dsDNA <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phage.</b> The genetic content of the dsDNA prophage sequences were examined in detail and found to contain blocks of genes encoding for proteins homologous to proteins responsible for phage DNA replication, structural proteins and proteins responsible for phage assembly. The DNA sequences from NgoΦ 1, NgoΦ 2 and NgoΦ 3 contain some significant regions of identity. A unique region of NgoΦ 2 showed very high similarity with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa generalized transducing phage F 116. Comparative analysis at the nucleotide and protein levels suggests that the sequences of NgoΦ 1 and NgoΦ 2 encode functionally active phages, while NgoΦ 3, NgoΦ 4 and NgoΦ 5 encode incomplete genomes. Expression of the NgoΦ 1 and NgoΦ 2 repressors in Escherichia coli inhibit the growth of E. coli and the propagation of phage λ. The NgoΦ 2 repressor was able to inhibit transcription of N. gonorrhoeae genes and Haemophilus influenzae HP 1 phage promoters. The holin gene of NgoΦ 1 (identical to that encoded by NgoΦ 2), when expressed in E. coli, could serve as substitute for the phage λ s gene. We were able to detect the presence of the DNA derived from NgoΦ 1 in the cultures of N. gonorrhoeae. Electron microscopy analysis of culture supernatants revealed the presence of multiple forms of bacteriophage particles. Conclusion These data suggest that the genes similar to dsDNA <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phage</b> present in the gonococcus are generally conserved in this pathogen and that they are able to regulate the expression of other neisserial genes. Since phage particles were only present in culture supernatants after induction with mitomycin C, it indicates that the gonococcus also regulates the expression of bacteriophage genes. </p...|$|E

The difficulties surrounding this issue can be ascribed {{in part to}} the genomic plasticity of viruses themselves as well as the scarcity of existing information in genomic databases. The open-source software PhagePhisher ([URL] has been designed as a simple pipeline to extract relevant information from complex and mixed datasets, and will improve the examination of bacteriophages, viruses, and virally related sequences, in a range of environments. Key aspects of the software include speed and ease of use; PhagePhisher can be used with limited operator knowledge of bioinformatics on a standard workstation. As a proof-of-concept, PhagePhisher was successfully implemented with bacteria–virus mixed samples of varying complexity. Furthermore, viral signals within microbial metagenomic datasets were easily and quickly identified by PhagePhisher, including those from prophages as well as <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phages,</b> an important and often neglected aspect of examining phage populations in the environment. PhagePhisher resolves viral-related sequences which may be obscured by or imbedded in bacterial genomes...|$|R
40|$|Temperate phages are {{important}} players in genetic diversification of their bacterial host by transforming their genomes by transduction. During this process, the phage forms a stable interaction with its host, either by integrating into the bacterial chromosome or as plasmid. The integrated phage genome replicates {{along with the}} host until the lytic cycle is induced. Temperate phages carry mobile genetic elements which contribute to emergence of disease-causing strains from environmental bacterial populations, e. g. temperate Vibriophages can turn its host Vibrio cholera into a fatal disease upon successful infection and transduction. However, the potential of transferring pathogenic genes due in the marine environments to temperate phages is far less understood. We present results of potential pathogenic Vibrio strains isolated from the North Sea which were screened for <b>lysogenic</b> <b>phages.</b> Three potentially pathogenic Vibrio species V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholera were induced using Mitomycin C. New Vibriophages were isolated to investigate their role in pathogenicity. The present work shows the first insights of temperate phages presence on potential pathogenic Vibrio strains from Northern European seawaters...|$|R
