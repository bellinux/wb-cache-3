5|$|More {{contentious}} {{than the}} <b>lower</b> <b>house</b> {{was the question}} of the upper house. Few agreed with Madison that its members should be elected by the <b>lower</b> <b>house.</b> James Wilson suggested election by popular vote versus election by state legislature, but his proposal was shot down 10–1 by the delegates. Most delegates didn't question the intelligence of the voters, rather what concerned them was the slowness by which information spread in the late 18th century.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> {{each have}} four floors, but are much {{narrower}} with each level having only four rooms.

The rooms in the <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> are also considered more luxurious with hardwood floors and large sizes. Rooms in the <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> are more expensive, however. Until 2003 the <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> were restricted to upper year students but with the double cohort of graduates from Ontario schools many of the rooms were transformed into doubles and now hold first years.|$|R
