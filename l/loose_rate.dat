In fact, assuming that signals in the FTN framework are well localized in time, one can construct a signaling scheme that violates the Shannon capacity bound.

Therefore, the results of Mazo do not imply that one can transmit more data per time unit without degrading performance in terms of error probability. We also consider FTN signaling in the case of pulses that are different from the sinc pulses. We show that one can use a precoding scheme of low complexity to remove the inter-symbol interference. This leads to the possibility of increasing the number of transmitted samples per time unit and compensate for spectral inefficiency due to signaling at the Nyquist rate of the non sinc pulses.

40|$|Self healing {{materials}} {{are becoming more}} and more important for the construction of mechanical components due to their ability to detect and heal failures as well as cracks autonomously. Especially in polymers and polymer-composites, where the component can <b>loose</b> a high <b>rate</b> of strength and durability due to micro cracks, those damages are nearly impossible to repair from outside. Thus, self healing ability is a very effective approach to extend the lifetime of polymer-made components. In view of the numerical simulation of such self healing effects we consider the microencapsulation approach [1] and develop a thermodynamically consistent macroscopic 5 -phase model within the framework of the Theory of Porous Media (TPM) [2]. The model consists of the following different phases: solid, liquid, healed material, gas, and catalysts. The increase of damage, which is represented by the gas phase, is driven by a damage evolution equation. Furthermore, a mass exchange between the liquid-like healing agents and the solid-like healed material, i. e., the change of the aggregate state from liquid healing to solid healed material, describes the healing process. The onset of the healing process is associated with the break open of the microcapsules in connection with the subsequent motion of the liquid healing agents. Numerical examples of the simulation of healing processes in polymers and polymer-composites are presented in order to show the applicability of the model...|$|R

Purpose The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the complications and revision rate after 100 semi-constrained total elbow arthroplasties from various types of aetiologies performed in our university hospital. Methods One hundred linked semiconstrained total elbow arthroplasties were performed and were reviewed with 24 months minimum follow-up. Indications were rheumatoid arthritis (45), trauma (33), revisions (16) and others (6). Results At five years average follow-up (range, 2 – 11), the {{complication rate}} was 37 %. Most frequent complications were ulnar nerve involvement (9 %) and triceps insufficiency (7 %). Five implants were aseptically <b>loosed.</b> The infection <b>rate</b> was 4 % with loosening of the implant in two. Four fract humerus proximal or distal to the stem. The radial nerve was injured in two cases. Failure of the locking system of the prosthesis was noted in one case and a fracture of the ulnar component was found in another patient. A revision surgery was performed in 13 cases (13 %). At follow-up 94 prostheses were still in place and the survival rate was 98 % at five years and 86 % at ten years.

To prepare better products it would be helpful to develop proper mathematical models for the simulation of moisture diffusion characteristic dynamics in a cigarette. In this work, four mathematical models have been developed with appropriate assumptions adequate to analyze the dynamics of moisture diffusion in cigarettes. The simulation of the derived models was also carried out in this work. When the theoretical values produced from each model were compared with the corresponding experimental data, it was found that three models (I-II, II, III) can be used to explain the behavior of moisture in cigarettes. Convective mass transfer coefficients and effective moisture diffusivities that fit best were obtained by a regression analysis of the model using the experimental values. The simulation of the models revealed that there is no significant positional dependence of {{moisture content}} inside a tobacco column because most of the moisture dries out radially through the cigarette wrapper. The drying rate of moisture in a tobacco column is rarely affected by effective moisture diffusivity, but strongly influenced by convective mass transfer. To prevent quality deterioration of the cigarettes during long-term storage, it is concluded that improvement of the cigarette wrapper and air tightness of the package, which are directly related to the convective mass transfer, is very important...|$|R

The sulphur radical formation measured by {{electron spin resonance}} spectroscopy-spin trapping (EPR-ST) was correlated with the activity of sulphite oxidase and with the rate of sulphite oxidation to sulphate by PMNs. Sulphite metabolism was studied both in resting, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated freshly isolated cells. The rate of sulphur trioxide radical formation was demonstrated by use of the spin trapping agent 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyroline- 1 -oxide (DMPO) with subsequent formation of an adduct. The intensity of adduct formation was most intense in cells with low sulphite oxidase activity, while a mixture of the adduct and of DMPO hydroxyl radical was mainly observed in cells with high sulphite oxidase activity. Furthermore, experiments carried out on purified sulphite oxidase showed that {{in the presence of}} sulphite the enzyme could also give rise to a DMPO-OH adduct.

40|$|Network {{formation}} of associative semiflexible fibers and mixtures of fibers and colloidal particles is simulated for the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model of elastic contacts, and a phase diagram {{in terms of}} particle elasticity and surface energy is presented. When fibers self-assemble they form a network for sufficiently large fiber-solvent surface energy. If the surface energy is above the value where single particles crystallize the adhesion forces drive diffusion-limited aggregation. Two mechanisms contribute to coarsening: non-associated chains joining existing bundles, and fiber bundles merging. Coarsening stops when {{the length of the}} network connections is roughly the persistence length, independent of surface energy. If the surface energy is below the value where single particles crystallize, a network can still be formed but at a much slower (reaction limited) <b>rate.</b> <b>Loose</b> (liquid-like) assemblies between chains form when they happen to run more-or-less parallel. These assemblies grow by diffusion and aggregation and form a loose network, which sets in micro-phase separation, i. e. syneresis. Only when the clusters crystallize, the coarsening process stops. In this case the length of the network connections is larger than the persistence length of a single chain, and depends on the value of the surface energy. All networks of semiflexible homopolymers in this study show syneresis. Mixtures of fibers and colloid particles also form fiber bundle networks, but by choosing the colloid volume fraction sufficiently low, swelling gels are obtained. Applications of this model are in biological systems where fibers self-assemble into cell walls and bone tissue. Comment: typos correcte...|$|R

When variance in fitness is low and linkage is <b>loose,</b> the baseline <b>rate</b> of substitution is L 0 ~ 2 NUSsT, where N is the population size, U is the rate of beneficial mutations per genome, and SsT is their mean selective advantage. Heritable variance v in log fitness due to unlinked loci reduces L by e{ 4 v under polygamy and e{ 8 v under monogamy. With a linear genetic map of length R Morgans, interference is yet stronger. We use a scaling argument {{to show that the}} density of adaptive substitutions depends on s, N, U, and R only through the baseline density: L=R~F L 0 =Rð Þ. Under the approximation that the interference due to different sweeps adds up, we show that L=R * L 0 =Rð Þ = 1 z 2 L 0 =Rð Þ, implying that interference prevents the rate of adaptive substitution from exceeding one per centimorgan per 200 generations. Simulations and numerical calculations confirm the scaling argument and confirm the additive approximation for L 0 =R *; 1; for higher L 0 =R, the rate of adaptation grows above R= 2, but only very slowly. We also consider the effect of sweeps on neutral diversity and show that, while even occasional sweeps can greatly reduce neutral diversity, this effect saturates as sweeps become more common—diversity can be maintained even in populations experiencing very strong interference. Our results indicate that for some organisms the rate of adaptive substitution may be primarily recombination-limited, depending only weakly on the mutation supply and the strength of selection...|$|R

40|$|Debris {{flows and}} sediment-rich floods are common {{transport}} processes in steep valleys that dissect mountainous terrain. Rapid movement, high discharges, and {{the transport of}} large quantities of coarse-grained sediment characterize these hydrologically-driven processes. Despite the importance of debris flows for landscape evolution and natural hazards, {{there is not an}} agreed upon mechanical framework to describe how debris flows entrain sediment, erode bedrock, and transport mass. As a result, large uncertainties remain pertaining to the potential for a debris flow to grow through entrainment of <b>loose</b> sediment, the <b>rate</b> at which bedrock is eroded, {{and the manner in which}} changes in climate, tectonics, or land-use might affect steep landscapes. I use a combination of in situ measurements of debris-flow dynamics from a natural laboratory located in the headwaters of a debris-flow dominated catchment, grain-scale numerical modeling of granular flows, and digital elevation model data to constrain the mechanics controlling erosion and transport of mass by debris flows. In particular, I quantify: (1) the characteristic flow properties of natural debris-flow surges and how they relate to total travel distance; (2) the mechanics controlling the rate of bed-sediment entrainment and growth of flow volume; (3) the degree to which debris flows erode the bedrock channel floor; and (4) how changes to channel or flow properties influence the erosive potential of a flow. Monitored debris-flow events were composed of multiple surges, each with clear variation of flow properties along the length of the surge. Relatively fine-grained and water-rich tails that had a wide range of pore-fluid pressures pushed along steep, highly resistant, visually unsaturated surge fronts of coarse-grained material. Surges with large excess pore-fluid pressures, and thus lower frictional resistance, had longer travel distances. The dominant control of non-equilibrium pore pressure on flow resistance makes the prediction of travel distance based solely on channel properties problematic. During passage of dense granular-fronts as well as water-rich, inter-surge flow, bed sediment was entrained from the sediment-surface downward in a progressive fashion. Despite similar flow properties and thicknesses of bed sediment entrained across all events, time-averaged entrainment rates for bed sediment that was saturated prior to flow arrival could exceed entrainment rates for dry sediment by over an order of magnitude. As a result, a debris flow over wet bed sediment will be larger than the same flow over dry bed sediment. Once all shielding bed sediment was entrained, flow particles could directly impact the bedrock channel floor. Average bedrock erosion rates that resulted were ~ 1 cm yr [...] 1. Variability in impact-stress magnitude increased linearly with the mean basal stress and measured probability density functions were generally best fit by Pareto or power law distributions with well-defined means and variances. Using the grain-scale numerical modeling, I observed a nonlinear increase in particle-bed impact forces and impact energy as a function of slope. In contrast, particle impact flux increased at small slopes, but then decreased linearly as slope increased beyond a threshold value. Predicted erosion rate, which scales as the product of impact energy and impact flux, increased as a nonlinear function of slope. Steep landscapes in which millennial scale erosion rates have been quantified display a similar nonlinear relationship between erosion rate and channel gradient. This suggests that the grain-scale mechanics quantified here place strong controls on steepland morphology that evolves over thousands to millions of years...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{commodity}} futures investment strategy {{with the impact}} of the Chinese specific factors. First, I study the so called Chinese specific factors. To do so, I investigate how commodity future price interacts with domestic macroeconomic variables and overseas futures prices respectively. Specifically, Chapter 2 emphasizes the interaction between domestic commodity futures prices and domestic macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, monetary growth, exchange rates and industrial growth. Among these variables, monetary growth should receive deeper attention because it is widely regarded as the main channel of monetary policy transmission. Subsequently, Chapter 3 focuses on the interaction between domestic commodity futures prices and overseas commodity futures prices. Having gained a clear understanding of the Chinese specific factors, a dynamic timing strategy is accordingly proposed in chapter 4. Chapter 2 is primarily focused on the interaction between domestic macroeconomic variables and domestic commodity future price movement. Specifically, I try to explore whether low (high) interest <b>rates,</b> <b>loose</b> (tight) money supplies, low (high) foreign exchange rates (Renminbi / US Dollar rate) and high (low) economic growth will lead to high (low) commodity prices and whether commodity prices present overshooting behaviour in response to the interest rate, money supply or changes in the foreign exchange rate. It has been argued by Frankel (1986, 2006) that commodity prices tend to overshoot in response to interest rates as well as to changes in the exchange rates based on Dornbusch’s (1976) model. Evidences from the SVAR models show that part of the theory regarding the relationship between macroeconomic variables and commodity price movement can be supported. The empirical also results suggest that the commodity price shock itself make the largest contribution to commodity price shocks in general. An interest rate shock barely contributes while an M 1 growth shock contributes substantially in metals. Foreign exchange rate shocks contribute approximately 40 percent to some commodities, while industrial output shocks comprise approximately 20 to 30 percent to some metals. In chapter 3, the thesis tries to explore the impacts between China’s futures market and overseas futures markets in chapter 3. Research from this angle could help reveal which side has stronger pricing power. Specifically, I aim to study the information spillover effect between the domestic spot and futures market as well as the information and risk spillover effects between the domestic metal futures market and the overseas metal futures market. Moreover, to check whether China has gained pricing power in the global commodities market, I also study the risk spillover effect between the domestic metal futures market and other overseas financial markets. From the empirical evidences in Chapter 3, it could be seen that asymmetry factors are significant in the futures market, no matter in the Chinese market or oversea market. The empirical results of Granger causality test in Chapter 3 show that movement in the SHFE market could directly guide movement in the LME market, indicating a rise in China’s pricing power in the global commodity market. However, such pricing power is limited and should not be wildly exaggerated. Chapter 4 forms an effective dynamic timing strategy in China’s commodity market with full consideration of the Chinese specific factors. I adopt Vrugt, Bauer and Molenaar’s (2004) dynamic modeling approach to predict the sign of monthly returns for the three metal futures listed on the Shanghai Futures Exchange: copper, aluminum and zinc. Following Vrugt, Bauer and Molenaar (2004), the base set of explanatory variables is classified into three categories: 1) business cycle indicators; 2) monetary environment indicators; 3) indicators of market sentiment. The empirical results in Chapter 4 show that the timing strategy can offer better returns, a lower standard deviation and, as a consequence, a higher information ratio for all three metal futures. ...|$|R

Macroeconomic factors, flawed government policies, and perverse incentives at financial institutions that lead to excessive risk taking are often cited as contributing forces to the crisis. In this dissertation, I investigate two forces that drove the 2008 financial crisis. One force is the credit rating agencies, whose excessively generous ratings lie {{at the root of the}} 2008 financial crisis. The popular claim is that the rating agencies have become too <b>loose</b> at their <b>rating</b> assignments, which led to overestimation of the creditworthiness of the companies by the public. In this dissertation, I examine the assertion that the rating companies have progressively relaxed their standards in recent decades for corporate credit ratings. Such relaxation seems to have lulled investors into a false sense of security about the safety of credit instruments whose values collapsed abruptly. Next I examine the contagion effects of rating downgrades. I ask whether rating downgrade news have spill over effects on the rest of the industry. I then investigate a different force that has received less attention in the crisis; investor confidence. The third essay focuses explicitly on the period when the financial crisis was at its peak. In Essay 1 titled, "Structural Shifts in Credit Rating Standards", I examine the time series variation in corporate credit rating standards for the period 1985 - 2007. I report two main findings: (i) There is a divergent pattern between investment grade and speculative grade rating standards during 1985 - 2002. Investment grade ratings tighten between 1985 and 2002. In contrast, the speculative grade rating standards loosen during the same period. Consistent with an agency explanation, rating companies assign more issuer friendly ratings to speculative grade credits, where there is substantial growth by the first-time entrants. The loose standards in speculative grade ratings are consistent with widespread criticism of the rating agencies during the Dot-Com crash. However, while the media focused on failure of rating agencies in high profile corporate debacles, the more serious problem was in the speculative grade rating assignments. (ii) There is a sharp structural break in both investment grade and speculative grade standards towards more stringent ratings around 2002. The change in rating levels due to the structural break is both economically and statistically significant. Holding firm characteristics constant, firms experience a drop of 1. 5 notches in ratings due to tightening standards between 2002 and 2007. It appears that widespread criticism and threat of regulation led rating agencies to move towards more conservative ratings after the Dot-Com crash, Enron debacle and passage of Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In Essay 2 titled "Contagion Effects of Rating Downgrade Announcements", we examine the intra-industry spill over effects of rating downgrade announcements based on abnormal returns for stock and CDS spreads of competitor industry portfolios. We find minor contagion effects for the equity prices of the industry portfolios for the entire sample. For the competitors of investment grade firms, we find significant contagion effects in the magnitude of - 15 basis points for the window (0, 1). For the speculative grade sample, we do not observe contagion or competition effects although this result can be due to cancellation of contagion and competition effects for the low rated firms. These results suggest that the net effect is dependent on the event firm's original rating. We find statistically significant CDS reaction of industry portfolios to downgrade news although in moderate magnitudes. The cross sectional tests show that the industry portfolio equity response and event firm equity response are positively correlated. This finding presents further evidence of contagion effects for rating downgrades. Essay 3 discusses a different force that has received less attention in the financial crisis, investor sentiment, and focuses on data drawn from the crisis period. In Essay 3, titled "Confidence and the 2008 Financial Crisis", we examine the role of confidence in the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis using new high frequency data on daily closed-end fund discounts and novel measures of consumer sentiment from non-financial sources extracted at daily frequency. Empirically, there is some movement in sentiment through much of the crisis period but it is relatively moderate. However, tests detect a sharp structural break around the Lehman bankruptcy, after which there are breaks in both pricing across multiple asset classes and co-movement, especially in hard-to-arbitrage fund classes. Fund discounts also exhibit significantly increased co-movement with non-financial Gallup sentiment measures after the Lehman bankruptcy, and closed-end fund discount betas with respect to the market increase significantly during this period. While fund discounts may reflect liquidity issues in normal conditions, they seem to better reflect sentiment in stressed environments, so funds have undesirable conditional betas. The results are consistent with the view that the Lehman bankruptcy induced a negative shock to the supply of arbitrage capital, and as predicted by behavioral finance models of costly arbitrage, sentiment then matters more and is closely tied to returns. The results are also consistent with theories of financial crisis in which sentiment or confidence is an extra force that amplifies and transmits economic shocks that add to the usual credit and collateral mechanisms studied in the literature...|$|R
