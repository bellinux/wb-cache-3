40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the intraspecific variability in Hannaella kunmingensis, 11 isolates, including the type strain, were analyzed for their morphological and biochem-ical traits. The combined internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), D 1 /D 2 domains of the large subunit rDNA (LSU), and cytochrome b gene were examined using phylogenetic and parsimony network analyses. Our investigations revealed differences in colony morphology as well as differences in 31 out of 64 phenotypic characteristics exam-ined, including growth in <b>lactose,</b> vitamin <b>free</b> medium, xylitol, L-arabinitol, and nitrite. Growth {{in the presence of}} 0. 1 % cycloheximide was also highlighted in H. kunmin-gensis. All the 11 strains were conspecific in the LSU; however, variations of about 2. 5 % were found in the ITS while isolate CBS 8356 exhibited a 27. 3 % divergence from the other strains in the cytochrome b gene. Parsimony net-work analysis revealed the existence of three haplotypes among the H. kunmingensis strains studied but excluded CBS 8356 from the network connecting these haplotypes. This study contributes to the knowledge of the intraspecific diversity of H. kunmingensis. To accommodate such intra-specific variations, an emendation of the species diagnosis is proposed...|$|R

Optimization process in this study involved four steps: screening for significant factors using 23 full factorial design, steepest ascent, optimization using FCCD-RSM, and verification. From screening steps, skim milk and yeast extract showed significant influence on the biomass production and, based on the steepest ascent step, middle points of skim milk (6 %[*]wt/vol) and yeast extract (1. 89 %[*]wt/vol) were obtained. A polynomial regression model in FCCD-RSM revealed that both factors were found significant and the strongest influence was given by skim milk concentration. Optimum concentrations of skim milk and yeast extract for maximum biomass G 4 and β-galactosidase production meanwhile low in lactose and FAN balance after cultivation period were 5. 89 % (wt/vol) and 2. 31 % (wt/vol), respectively. The validation experiments showed that the predicted and experimental values are not significantly different, indicating that the FCCD-RSM model developed is sufficient to describe the cultivation process of G 4 using skim-milk-based medium {{with the addition of}} yeast extract...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the protein concentrate on milk quality. The attempt took place on an organic dairy farm with cows of Holstein breed, which was added to the ration a concentrate containing 60 % soybean cake, 20 % sunflower cake and 20 % linseed cake at 1 kg / head / day. The experiment lasted 30 days. Content of fat, protein, <b>lactose,</b> urea, <b>free</b> fatty acids, somatic cell count and the concentration of citric acid was determined in milk samples. Milk production was evaluated from the quantitative parameters. Addition of the concentrate had a positive effect on the fat content (P < 0. 05) and a decrease in free fatty acids (P < 0. 05). Production of urea which may be in excessive concentration dangerous for the health of dairy cows, was increased (P < 0. 05). Concentrate did not affect milk yield, protein content, lactose and somatic cell count. The content of citric acid was increased in the experimental and control groups (P < 0. 05). The results showed that the addition of protein concentrate can affect certain components of milk, but in case of inappropriate inclusion in the mix, there are health risks associated with excessive excretion of urea...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of 72 isolates of Lactobacillusplantarum, previously identified from different rawvegetables and fruits, was studied based on phenotypic (BiologSystem) and genotypic (randomly amplifiedpolymorphicDNA-polymerasechainreaction, RAPD-PCR, and amplifiedfragmentlengthpolymorphism, AFLP) approaches. A marked phenotypic and genotypic variability was found. Eight clusters were formed at the similarity level of 92 % based on BiologSystem analysis. The most numerous clusters grouped isolates {{apart from the}} original habitat. Almost all isolates fermented maltose, d,l-lactic acid, N-acetyl-d-mannosamine and dextrin, and other typical carbon sources which are prevalent in rawvegetables and fruits. None of the isolates fermented <b>lactose</b> and <b>free</b> amino acids. At high values of linkage distance, two main clusters were obtained from both UPGMA (unweighted pair group with arithmetic average) dendrograms of RAPD-PCR and AFLP analyses. The two clusters mainly separated isolates from tomatoes and carrots from those isolated from pineapples. At 2. 5 linkage distance, a high polymorphism was found and several sub-clusters were formed with both analyses. In particular, AFLP allowed the differentiation of 55 of the 72 isolates of L. plantarum. The discriminatory power of each technique used was calculated through the Simpson's index of diversity (D). The values of the D index were 0. 65, 0. 92 and 0. 99 for BiologSystem, RAPD-PCR and AFLP analyses, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Carbohydrates were {{extracted}} from {{a sample of}} milk from a mink, Mustela vison (Family Mustelidae). Free neutral and acidic oligosaccharides were isolated from the carbohydrate fraction and their chemical structures were {{compared with those of}} white-nosed coati (Nasua narica, Procyonidae) and harbour seal (Phoca vitulina, Phocidae) that we had studied previously. The ratio of <b>free</b> <b>lactose</b> to milk oligosaccharides was similar to that in milk of the white-nosed coati; in both species, this ratio was much lower than that in the milk of most eutherians. The neutral oligosaccharides of mink milk had alpha(1 - 3) -linked Gal or alpha(1 - 2) -linked Fuc residues at their non-reducing ends, as in the neutral oligosaccharides of white-nosed coati milk. Some of the neutral and acidic oligosaccharides, determined here, had been found also in harbour seal milk, but the harbour seal oligosaccharides did not contain alpha(1 - 3) -linked Gal residues.

40|$|Combinatorial (glyco) peptide {{libraries}} {{offer the}} possibility to define effective inhibitors of protein (lectin) – glycan interactions. If a (glyco) peptide surpasses the inhibitory potency of the free sugar, then the new peptide–lectin contacts underlying the affinity enhancement may guide further rational drug design. Focusing on the adhesion/growth regulatory human galectins 1 and 3, a screening of three combinatorial solid-phase (glyco) peptide libraries, containing Gal(b 1 -O) Thr, Gal(b 1 -S) Cys/Gal(b 1 -N) Asn, and Lac(b 1 - O) Thr, with the fluorescently labeled lectins had led {{to a series of}} lead compounds.

In addition, subclinical mastitis incidence was defined by determining the number of somatic cells in the samples and their California mastitis test (CMT) values. The relationship between subclinical mastitis incidence and other milk properties was investigated. The mean pH, EI and DN values of the raw milks sampled were 6. 75 ± 0. 01, 5. 83 × 10 - 3 S/cm and - 0. 5296 ± 0. 002, respectively, while protein, lactose, mineral matter and fat contents were 3. 37 %± 0. 03 %, 4. 99 ± 0. 03 %, 0. 64 ± 0. 01 % and 3. 10 ± 0. 06 %, respectively. 99. 2 % of the samples were found to contain TAMB higher than 5 logcfu/mL and 13. 4 % were found to include E. coli. The relationship between subclinical mastitis and these values have been also investigated. The incidence of subclinical mastitis in Çanakkale-Yenice was determined as 59 %. Only the difference between CMT values of subclinical mastitis milk (CMT value ≥ 2) and healthy milk (CMT value < 2) was found to be statistically significant (p< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} an increased rate of acid production when yogurt starter cultures are grown in milk treated with lactase enzyme was investigated by studying carbohydrate utilization and acid development by a pure culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and a mixed yogurt starter culture consisting of S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. In milk containing glucose, galactose, and lactose, glucose and <b>lactose</b> (but not <b>free</b> galactose) were fermented. Fermentation of lactose in control milk {{was accompanied by}} the release of free galactose, {{with the result that}} carbohydrate utilization was less efficient than in treated milk. This phenomenon also occurred when lactose was fermented by S. thermophilus in broth culture. Carbohydrate utilization by the mixed yogurt culture was more rapid when the lactose in milk was partially prehydrolyzed. Our results suggest that the more rapid acid development that took place when a mixed yogurt starter culture was grown in milk containing prehydrolyzed lactose {{was the result of a}} more rapid and efficient utilization of carbohydrate by S. thermophilus when free glucose in addition to lactose was available for fermentation. The evidence presented also suggests that uptake and utilization of glucose and lactose by S. thermophilus are different in broth and milk cultures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The heat {{treatment}} of milk powders during food manufacturing induces {{physical and chemical}} modifications that are governed by material phase transitions. The main aim of this work was to describe the heat-induced physical changes occurring in whole milk powder (WMP). The study was based on increasing the water activity (aw) of the powder in order to relate the glass tran-sition temperature (Tg) to the parameters resulting in changes in physical properties. Colour chan-ges in milk powder due to non-enzymatic browning (NEB) were monitored by spectrophotometry based on the CIE L*a*b * function. Changes in particle structure were investigated by scanning elec-tron microscopy (SEM). WMPs at low and high water activities (0. 28 and 0. 35) were heated in closed tubes and their physical properties (aw, <b>lactose</b> crystallisation and <b>free</b> fat release) monitored. The {{results showed that the}} kinetics of lactose crystallisation and the resulting increase in aw were clearly influenced by the Tg, modulated here by the water content of WMP at the time of heat treat-ment. The kinetics of free fat release was related to the trend of lactose crystallisation. SEM showed that the free fat was released onto the particle surfaces and formed a fat layer covering the lactose crystals. Porosity then resulted inside the powder matrix due to empty cavities formerly occupied by fat globules. In addition, the chemical reactivity of WMP expressed by colour changes showe...|$|R
40|$|Pecorino di Farindola is a {{handicraft}} cheese made {{by farmers}} on small scale using raw ewes' milk and pig rennet. In this study, yeast consortia were evaluated during Pecorino di Farindola making and ripening. Molecular identification of 156 isolates {{was achieved by}} a combination of PCR-RFLP of the 5. 8 S ITS rRNA region and sequencing of the D 1 /D 2 domain of the 26 S rRNA gene. Kluyveromyces marxianus was the predominant species, while other species (Pichia kudriavzevii, Candida parapsilosis, Candida glaebosa and Candida zeylanoides) were present only during the early weeks of ripening. Moreover, the isolates were differentiated both by RAPD-PCR and a sequence alignment of D 1 /D 2 26 S rRNA gene, revealing different K. marxianus profiles and variants, and suggesting the role of local selective pressure as the origin of distinctive K. marxianus populations. The strains were characterized also on the basis of different dairy properties such as growth temperature, lactose, galactose, lactate and citrate assimilation at different NaCl concentrations, as well as lipolytic and caseinolytic activities. Moreover, 39 selected K. marxianus strains were inoculated in pasteurized whey to evaluate their growth kinetics, besides <b>lactose,</b> lactate and <b>free</b> amino acids metabolism. The growth kinetics distinguished different biotypes and different metabolic behavior were determined. The general picture of K. marxianus population from Pecorino di Farindola shows a high biodiversity at genetic and phenotypic levels that potentially offers many opportunities for new and advanced knowledge at species level, providing in the meantime a good basis to study the relationship between genetic variability and functional diversities...|$|R
