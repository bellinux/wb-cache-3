50|$|The <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vulture's</b> world {{population}} {{is believed to}} have decreased perceptibly (As for October 2015 their IUCN status was updated to Endangered). They are declining in Sahel and several parts of their southern, northern and western distribution in Africa. They are apparently currently stable in Arabia but have a small population there and have been expirated from Israel as a breeding bird. The declines are almost entirely due to human activities, including disturbances from habitat destruction and cultivation, disturbances at the nesting site (to which the species is reportedly quite sensitive) and ingestion of pesticides, which are usually set out for jackals and other small mammalian carnivores. Domestic cattle, who have replaced natural prey over much of the range, are now often sold off, rather than abandoned, due to the proliferation of markets and abattoirs and rarely left to die and be consumed by <b>vultures.</b> <b>Lappet-faced</b> <b>vultures</b> are also sometimes victims of direct persecution, including shooting and the use of strychnine and other poisons. In Namibia, 86 <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vultures</b> died after eating poisoned cattle carcasses, because the farmers erroneously believed they were killing and eating the cattle. In some cases the poisoning is done by poachers, who fear the presence of vultures will alert authorities to their activities, the illegal killings of protected species. They are considered Vulnerable at the species level, with an estimated {{world population}} of under 9,000 individuals.|$|R

50|$|The <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vulture</b> or Nubian vulture (Torgos tracheliotos) is an Old World vulture {{belonging}} to the bird order Accipitriformes, which also includes eagles, kites, buzzards and hawks.

50|$|The <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vulture</b> is a {{scavenging}} bird, feeding {{mostly from}} animal carcasses, which it finds by sight or by watching other vultures. More so {{than many other}} African vultures, they often find carrion {{on their own and}} start tearing through the skin. They are the most powerful and aggressive of the African vultures, and other vultures will usually cede a carcass to the <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vulture</b> if it decides to assert itself. This is often beneficial to the less powerful vultures because the Lappet-face can tear through the tough hides and knotty muscles of large mammals that the others cannot penetrate, although hyenas are even more efficient in this regard (if more voracious eaters). However, lappet-faced vultures frequently hang {{around the edges of the}} throngs at large carcasses, waiting until the other vultures are done, to feed on remnant skin, tendons and other coarse tissues that the others will not eat. Big game animals, up to the size of elephants, are preferred as carrion, since they provide the most subsistence at a sitting. A full crop can contain up to 1.5 kg of meat.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{more than}} any other true <b>vulture,</b> <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vultures</b> have been {{recorded}} as regularly feeding on freshly killed smaller mammals, birds and reptiles.

Flamingo colonies (including eggs, young and adults), young impalas and guineafowl have reportedly been predated. They are believed to still-hunt from an elevated perch and then drop on their prey, stunning them with the impact and tearing them apart with their strong bills. Most remains found at nests are from small animals possibly caught alive.|$|R

40|$|The ongoing global {{decline in}} vulture populations raises major {{conservation}} concerns, but {{little is known}} about the factors that mediate scavenger habitat use, in particular the importance of abundance of live prey versus prey mortality. We test this using data from the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem in East Africa. The two hypotheses that prey abundance or prey mortality are the main drivers of vulture habitat use provide alternative predictions. If vultures select areas based only on prey abundance, we expect tracked vultures to remain close to herds of migratory wildebeest regardless of season. However, if vultures select areas where mortality rates are greatest then we expect vultures to select the driest regions, where animals are more likely to die of starvation, and to be attracted to migratory wildebeest only during the dry season when wildebeest mortality is greatest. We used data from GSM-GPS transmitters to assess the relationship between three vulture species and migratory wildebeest in the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem. Results indicate that vultures preferentially cluster around migratory herds only during the dry season, when herds experience their highest mortality. Additionally during the wet season, Ruppell’s and <b>Lappet-faced</b> <b>vultures</b> select relatively dry areas, based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, whereas White-backed vultures preferred wetter areas during the wet season. Differences in habitat use among species may mediate coexistence in this scavenger guild. In general, our results suggest that prey abundance is not the primary driver of avian scavenger habitat use.

40|$|Diurnal raptors have {{declined}} significantly in western Africa since the 1960 s. To evaluate {{the impact of}} traditional medicine and bushmeat trade on raptors, we examined carcasses offered at markets at 67 sites (1 – 80 stands per site) in 12 countries in western Africa during 1990 – 2013. Black kiteMilvus migransand hooded vulture Necrosyrtes monachus together accounted for 41 % of 2, 646 carcasses comprising 52 species. Twenty-seven percent of carcasses were of species categorized as Near Threatened, Vulnerable or Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Common species were traded more frequently than rarer species, as were species with frequent scavenging behaviour (vs non-scavenging), generalist or savannah habitat use (vs forest), and an Afrotropical (vs Palearctic) breeding range. Large Afrotropical vultures were recorded in the highest absolute and relative numbers in Nigeria, whereas in Central Africa, palm-nut vultures Gypohierax angolensis were the most abundant vulture species. Estimates based on data extrapolation indicated that within West Africa 73 % of carcasses were traded in Nigeria, 21 % in Benin and 5 % elsewhere. Offtake per annum in West Africa {{was estimated to be}} 975 – 1, 462 hooded vultures, 356 – 534 palm-nut vultures, 188 – 282 Rüppell's griffons Gyps rueppellii, 154 – 231 African white-backed vultures Gyps africanus, 143 – 214 <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vultures</b> Torgos tracheliotos, and 40 – 60 crowned eagles Stephanoaetus coronatus.

5000|$|Like great horned owls, {{but unlike}} Eurasian eagle-owls, the Verreaux's eagle-owls {{normally}} uses old nests built other birds {{as their own}} nests. Usage of a nest site other than those constructed by other birds is considered rarer even than in the horned owl and is viewed as almost exceptional {{in some parts of}} this species range. Existent reports of this species building its own nest are certain to be dubious, as no known living owl builds a nest and only a small handful of owl species have been verified adding a small amount of nesting material to an existing surface or nest. They variety of bird nests they use is extreme. Large stick nests in sturdy trees are generally used. In southern Africa, recorded nest heights have ranged from 6 to 25 m off the ground. Like other Bubo owls, the large nest of large-bodied accipitirids are often popular for use, due to the often huge size and sturdiness of construction typical in this family, with the nest builders devoting up to four months to their construction. However, perhaps the constructor of nests that most often host Verreaux's eagle-owls are hamerkops (Scopus umbretta). In everywhere from Mali to South Africa the eagle-owl has been recorded using old nests built by this species. The unusual, massive nest is an enclosed circle of sticks with a side entrance that are often very large relative {{to the size of the}} hamerkop, a smallish, compact wading bird. Usually the eagle-owls nest on the flat top of the hamerkop nest rather than the interior which is usually too small for the eagle-owls to enter and this can provide a rather safe structure for the eagle-owl family to call home. [...] Other nest builders which are popular as hosts are vultures, eagles (at least eight species have built nests used by these eagle-owls), secretarybirds, crows and even much smaller birds such as weavers, which build huge communal nest structures which the eagle-owls then similarly nest on top of. Most nests are already abandoned when the Verreaux's eagle-owl take over it, in large accipitrids for example, many build alternate nests which are not used for years on end. However, if the nest is occupied, the Verreaux's eagle-owl pair readily displaces the occupants and sometimes feeds on the birds in them. Species known to be successfully displaced from their nests have ranged up in size to <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vultures</b> (Torgos tracheliotos), which are more than three times heavier on average than the Verreaux's eagle-owl. In some cases, hamerkops have been known to try to defend their nest from the eagle-owls but are usually chased away. Verreaux's eagle-owls have been known to displace other opportunistic nest usurpers such as other owls and falcons in order to take over nest structures for themselves. In one case, a pair of eagle-owls nesting on top of a hamerkop nest while the interior of the nest was occupied by Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiacus), an unusual aggressive species of waterfowl that uses nests built by other species. In rare cases, Verreaux's eagle-owls have been recorded using large, old hollows, the stem of a palm tree or on a very dense tangle of creepers or orchids instead of birds’ nests as a nesting site.|$|R
50|$|Overall, the <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vulture</b> is blackish above with a {{strongly}} contrasting white thigh feathers. The black feathers {{on the back}} of African vultures are lined with brown, while Arabian birds are dark brown rather than black above. The underside can range from pure white to buff-brown. Like many vultures, it has a bald head. The head coloration can range from reddish in southern Africa to dull pink in more northern Africa to pink {{on the back of}} the head and gray on the front in the Arabian Peninsula. The combination of the colorful head and fleshy folds on the side of it are distinctive. The bald head of the <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vulture</b> is advantageous, because a feathered head would become spattered with blood and other fluids, and thus be difficult to keep clean. While flying, lappet-faced vultures have large, broad wings held with the front edges held parallel and slightly pointed, serrated-looking wingtips. Compared to the somewhat similarly marked hooded vulture, it is considerably larger with a more massive bill and can only be confused at a great distance. The Gyps vultures are generally much paler, with less white lining the wings and more bulging secondaries. The cinereous vulture (which may overlap in range in the Arabian area) has a similar body shape but is all dark, with no contrasting plumage.|$|E

50|$|The diverse flora {{accommodates}} {{a diverse}} array of fauna. More than 220 different kinds of birds inhabit the area including raptor species such as <b>Lappet-faced</b> <b>vulture,</b> Pel's fishing owl, Martial eagle and impressive larger birds such as Kori bustard, Ground hornbill, Saddle-billed stork. There are over 30 species of mammals ranging from plains game such as zebra, wildebeest and giraffe to predators such as lions, leopards and cheetahs. The rivers and other watering holes are home to large herds of hippos and crocodiles, {{and in the long}} dry seasons these areas are heavily trafficked by wildlife and safari tour groups alike.|$|E
50|$|More {{similar in}} habitat and, locally, prey {{selection}} to martial eagles are three medium-sized eagles, the 1.47 kg African hawk-eagle (Aquila spilogaster), the 2.25 kg tawny eagle (Aquila rapax) and the 2.2 kg bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus). The biology of martial eagles was compared extensively {{with that of}} these species in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya, where all four were known to prey on large numbers of Kirk's dik-diks (albeit none of these took as many as did the martial eagles and some eaten by bateleurs and tawny eagles are probably scavenged). It {{was found that the}} bateleur and tawny eagle are even broader in their prey composition and take live prey more often of a smaller size, also often coming to and feeding on carrion (which is seldom seen in martial eagles) and pirating from other raptors, especially the tawny eagles. The African hawk-eagle takes fairly similar prey to the martial eagle but does not conflict with martial eagles considering its much smaller size and preference for slightly denser wooded areas. In Tsavo East, 29% of prey of tawny eagle and 21% of bateleur foods were the same that of martial eagles. In east Africa, the breeding season differs mildly between these eagles with bateleurs nesting much earlier than the others and African hawk-eagles breeding peaking slightly later. Thus pressure on shared prey types such as dik-diks are exerted at different times of the year. While the bateleur and tawny eagle can kill prey weighing up to 4 kg and the African hawk-eagle (being relatively large footed and clawed despite its smaller size) can kill prey of up to 5 kg, these raptors are too small to regularly go after live prey as large in the prey spectrum of martial eagles, with the bateleur and tawny having talons relatively smaller even adjusted for their body size (the hawk-eagle’s talons were relatively similar in proportion to their body size). Due to its large size and broad wings, martial eagles are not highly maneuverable in flight and are not infrequently robbed of their catches by these more agile and swift smaller eagles, particularly bold tawny eagles. Other raptors to steal food from martial eagles include bateleurs and even other big species such as Verreaux's eagles and <b>lappet-faced</b> <b>vultures</b> (Torgos tracheliotos). Considering their potential for aggressiveness in regards to prey pursuits, martial eagles can be surprisingly passive in response to kleptoparasitism, especially if they are able to first fill their crop. This may be because they try to avoid unnecessary expenditures of energy in contention over food. Leopards also rarely steal kills from martial eagles but may also be robbed of small kills by martial eagles as have cheetahs. In another case, a martial eagle stole a rock hyrax from a bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus). Prey species are shared by a wide range of birds of prey, both other eagles and other, usually, larger raptors, and mammalian carnivores of many sizes that are too numerous to mention. Some mammalian carnivores such as caracals have superficially similar diets to martial eagles. One other species worth noting is the Verreaux's eagle owl (Bubo lacteus), as it is similarly the largest African owl, weighing about 2.1 kg, with almost identical habitat preferences and distributional range as the martial eagle. Therefore, some consider the eagle owl to be the martial eagle’s nocturnal ecological equivalent. While there is considerable overlap in their diets, there are discrepancies as the eagle owl tends to hunt large numbers of hedgehogs (not known in the eagle’s diet) and occasionally high quantities of mole-rats. When considered this in combination with their different times of activity {{and the fact that the}} eagle owl weighs about half as much as the martial eagle, direct competition probably does not affect either predator in any considerable way.|$|R
