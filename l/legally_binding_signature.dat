50|$|Unlike other web-based {{single sign-on}} solutions, such as Google's and Facebook's, NemID {{is not based}} on a cryptographical guarantee. While the {{security}} of for example Google's single sign-on is based on HTTPS, in that you use the domain name accounts.google.com in the browser's address line to ensure that you only send your password to Google (trusted third party), NemID is based on inputting your NemID-password on arbitrary webpages which show something that looks like a NemID password dialog, and then hoping that these pages do not steal your NemID-password. As NemID is a <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>signature,</b> gives access to bank accounts, and protects much personal information, this lack of cryptographical security has been criticized. There appear to be no concrete reason for NemID to not be designed with a cryptographical guarantee.|$|E

40|$|This study explores {{selected}} {{issues in}} the legal environment created by domestic and international electronic contracting practices on the Internet within the United States and international jurisdictions: questions regarding {{the formation of the}} contract through the Internet, the enforceability of such a contract (contractual writing requirements, <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>signatures),</b> the contents of the contract, the ways to prove the electronic contract, the applicable law and the competent court, and finally, the best ways to settle disputes arising from electronic contracts are considered. We examine to what extent contract law, and in particular article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), provides a satisfactory legal ground for the Internet, and how the various model trading partner agreements or the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law's Draft Model Statutory Provisions (UNCITRAL DMSP) deal with legal contract issues. We attempt to show that contracts in Cyberspace do not require any substantial reform but only some changes and adaptations to existing law, since when the policy considerations that underlie an existing rule still make sense as applied to Cyberspace, a completely new rule is not worth having.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of digital medical images requires a <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> digital <b>signature</b> that guarantees authenticity {{and integrity of}} the image. In real-time teleradiology services, the system is expected to respond very quickly however to verify the signature {{a considerable amount of}} time is spent to compute the hash value of the image since the image size might be huge (tens of megabytes). Motivating by this fact, in this paper we propose EVEREST, an efficient methodology for verification. The key observation we have made is that in the traditional verification the processor of the verifying machine is idle (I/O blocked) while the image is downloaded. In EVEREST, to improve the real-time efficiency the receiver can perform most of the hash computation while he is receiving the image itself. One other important advantage of our scheme is the communication efficiency since getting the entire image file is no longer necessary to detect the tampering.

The term [...] "What You See Is What You Sign" [...] (WYSIWYS) was coined in 1998 by Peter Landrock and Torben Pedersen of Cryptomathic during their work on delivering secure and <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> digital <b>signatures</b> for Pan-European projects. In 2004, Cryptomathic received the VISA Smart Star Award for it contributions to the field of EMV and Chip and PIN based on its data preparation offering.

5000|$|Technically speaking, {{a digital}} {{signature}} applies to {{a string of}} bits, whereas humans and applications [...] "believe" [...] that they sign the semantic interpretation of those bits. In order to be semantically interpreted, the bit string must {{be transformed into a}} form that is meaningful for humans and applications, and this is done through a combination of hardware and software based processes on a computer system. The problem is that the semantic interpretation of bits can change {{as a function of the}} processes used to transform the bits into semantic content. It is relatively easy to change the interpretation of a digital document by implementing changes on the computer system where the document is being processed. From a semantic perspective this creates uncertainty about what exactly has been signed. WYSIWYS (What You See Is What You Sign) [...] means that the semantic interpretation of a signed message cannot be changed. In particular this also means that a message cannot contain hidden information that the signer is unaware of, and that can be revealed after the signature has been applied. WYSIWYS is a necessary requirement for the validity of digital signatures, but this requirement is difficult to guarantee because of the increasing complexity of modern computer systems. The term WYSIWYS was coined by Peter Landrock and Torben Pedersen to describe some of the principles in delivering secure and <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> digital <b>signatures</b> for Pan-European projects.|$|R
