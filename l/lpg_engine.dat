500|$|On 4 August 2009, Holden {{announced}} the MY10 {{revisions to the}} VE and WM range {{to be released in}} September. For the VE Omega and Berlina, the 3.6-litre Alloytec V6 has been downsized to 3.0-litres, the lowest engine displacement of a Commodore since the straight-six engine fitted to the 1986 VL series. This smaller capacity engine features Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) technology, and is officially claimed to reduce fuel consumption by up to 12percent depending on the variant. Power increases to , although torque is reduced to [...] Along with the 3.0-litre engine, a 3.6-litre version of the same, producing [...] and , was also unveiled. Other than the manual transmission version of the SV6, all SIDI V6 models are coupled to GM's 6L50 automatic and fall under Holden's EcoLine banner. Benefits to fuel economy for the 3.6-litre SIDI can also be attributed to an improved [...] "deceleration fuel cut" [...] system, which terminates the fuel supply during engine coasting; a higher efficiency alternator and voltage regulator; a 50rpm lower idle speed (to 550rpm); and a new [...] "turbine damper" [...] for the automatic transmission that works to suppress vibrations at low rpms, thus enabling earlier upshifts. Omega versions of the Ute and all bi-fuel versions retain the existing 3.6-litre and four-speed automatic combination, although the <b>LPG</b> <b>engine</b> has been tweaked for further efficiency gains.|$|E

25|$|Although LPG-powered {{vehicles}} {{are supposed to}} be relatively non-polluting, and do indeed reduce roadside pollution, a 2007 study by Polytechnic University indicated that older LPG taxis emitted at least double the amount of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons compared to diesel.

40|$|Abstract: Despite {{being one}} of the fastest growing {{alternative}} fuel sources, little attention has been given to control of the air fuel ratio at the point of combustion in liquefied petroleum gas (<b>LPG)</b> <b>engines.</b> In this paper a mean value engine model is presented for LPG throttle body injected engines. Based on this model, a control algorithm capable of adapting to errors in both the fuel and air systems is proposed to ensure accurate stoichiometric fuel injection control.

40|$|Abstract: Liquid phase {{injection}} {{technology is}} the key point in overcoming most of the traditional problems of <b>LPG</b> <b>engines,</b> related both to their low capability in {{air to fuel ratio}} control, and to the sensible power decrease with respect to analogous gasoline inducted IC engines. Anyway, the introduction of this technology in OEM equipments is still limited, being subjected to the overcoming of some relevant problems about liquid phase maintenance inside the fuel system, and to the so called "hot start delay " phenomenon. This work, through a comprehensive analysis of the dynamical behaviour of the injection system, individuates a solution able to enhance liquid phase control, while reducing hot start delay. 1...|$|R

There is no annual registration fee or road tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault (27% of cars sold in France in 2003), Peugeot (20.1%) and Citroën (13.5%).

40|$|The engine, {{which uses}} both {{conventional}} diesel fuel and LPG fuel, {{is referred to}} as ‘LPG–diesel dual fuel engines’. <b>LPG</b> dual fuel <b>engines</b> are modified diesel engines which use primary fuel as LPG and secondary fuel as diesel. <b>LPG</b> dual fuel <b>engines</b> have a good thermal efficiency at high output but the performance is less during part load conditions due to the poor utilization of charges. This problem can be overcome by varying factors such as pilot fuel quantity, injection timing, composition of the gaseous fuel and intake charge conditions, for improving the performance, combustion and emissions of dual fuel engines. This article reviews about the research work done by the researchers in order to improve the performance, combustion and emission parameters of a LPG–diesel dual fuel engines.
