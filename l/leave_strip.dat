50|$|An unfortunate {{consequence}} of strip thinning was the build-up of spruce beetle populations. Shaded slash {{from the initial}} cut, together {{with an increase in}} the number of windthrown trees in the <b>leave</b> <b>strips,</b> provided conditions ideally suited to the beetle.|$|R

Yes, I {{am afraid that}} is so. There ain't no hiding a camp from Indian eyes where horses have been about. It {{is sure to be}} near a stream. Shall you look for them, chief?" ...|$|R

Often used as a {{traditional}} ingredient in the Roman salad called by the same name, they are prepared with the <b>leaves</b> <b>stripped</b> and the shoots soaked in cold water until they curl. The salad is served with a prepared dressing of anchovy, garlic, vinegar, and salt, pounded and emulsified with olive oil.|$|R
50|$|A {{prepared}} seedbed remains receptive for {{a relatively}} short period, seldom as long as 5 years, sometimes as short as 3 years. Seedbed receptivity on moist, fertile sites decreases with particular rapidity, and especially on such sites, seedbed preparation should be scheduled {{to take advantage of}} good seed years. In poor seed years, site preparation can be carried out on mesic and drier sites with more chance of success, because of the generally longer receptivity of seedbeds there than those on moister sites. Although an indifferent seed year can suffice if seed distribution is good and environmental conditions favourable to seedling germination and survival, small amounts of seed are particularly vulnerable to depredation by small mammals. Considerable flexibility is possible in timing site preparation to coincide with cone crops. Treatment can be apllied either before any logging takes place, between partial cuts, or after logging. In cut and <b>leave</b> <b>strips,</b> seedbed preparation can be carried out as a single operation, pre-scarifying the <b>leave</b> <b>strips,</b> post-scarifying the cut strips.|$|R

In early October 2009, the first Canadian cities began to appear on Street View; several, including Saskatoon, {{were not included in the}} initial roll-out. One city that was included, Calgary, included images taken in both summer and winter. Images of Saskatoon were rolled out on December 2, 2009.|$|R
50|$|The {{dearth of}} seed and a {{deficiency}} of receptive seedbeds were recognized as major {{reasons for the}} lack of success of clearcut harvesting. One remedy attempted in British Columbia and Alberta has been alternate strip cutting. The greater seed source from uncut trees between the cut strips, and the disturbance to the forest floor within the cut strips could be expected {{to increase the amount of}} natural regeneration. Trees were cut to a diameter limit in the cut strips, but large trees in the <b>leave</b> <b>strips</b> often proved too much of a temptation and were cut too, thus removing those trees that would otherwise have been the major source of seed.|$|R

5000|$|Methods for spacing may be: manual, using various tools, {{including}} power saws, brush saws, and clippers; mechanical, using choppersand mulchers; chemical; or {{combinations of}} several methods. One treatment has had notable success in spacing massively overstocked (<100 000 stems/ha) natural regeneration of spruce and fir in Maine. Fitted to helicopter, the Thru-Valve boom emits herbicide spray droplets 1000 µm to 2000 µm in diameter {{at very low}} pressure. Swaths 1.2 m wide and <b>leave</b> <b>strips</b> 2.4 m wide were obtained with [...] "knife-edge" [...] precision when the herbicide was applied by helicopter flying at a height of 21 m at a speed of 40-48 km/h. It seems likely that no other method could be as cost-effective.|$|R

Despite having no experience in editorial cartooning, the Tribune hired Locher. Locher retired May 1, 2013.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{air-drying}} {{methods used to}} for different kinds of flowers. The easiest and {{most effective way to}} dry most flowers is to tie them in small bundles with twine, raffia or ribbons, and hang them upside down, out of direct sunlight in a warm, well-ventilated place. Bunches should contain one type of flower. Large flowers are dried individually. The <b>leaves</b> <b>stripped</b> as soon as possible after picking. They retain moisture and slow down the drying process. Wall hooks, poles or wires are placed at least six inches from the ceiling. Heads should be staggered to allow plenty of air to circulate. This prevents mildew and rot. It may be necessary to re-tie bunches or individual flowers half way through the drying process, because the stems tend to shrink as they dry.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat of}} the northern waterthrush is wet woodlands near water. It nests in a stump or among tree roots where it lays three to six eggs, cream- or buff-colored, with brown and gray spots. These eggs are laid in a cup nest constructed of <b>leaves,</b> bark <b>strips,</b> and rootlets.|$|R

50|$|In 1947, Schwartz {{was hired}} as an artist for the Herald-Tribune comic strip based on The Saint. However, {{creative}} difficulties led to Schwartz <b>leaving</b> the <b>strip</b> to Mike Roy. After The Saint, Schwartz found a job at King Features Syndicate through Caniff, initially working on preparing Steve Canyon for publication in various sizes. He also ghosted on the Brick Bradford and Secret Agent X-9 newspaper strips.|$|R
50|$|Howe {{was educated}} in the local public schools, and spent his {{childhood}} and teen years assisting on the farm {{as well as at}} his father's gristmill and sawmill. In 1833, having invented a machine that cut palm <b>leaves</b> into <b>strips</b> for weaving into hats, Howe moved to Watertown, Massachusetts, and established a palm leaf factory there. He moved his business to the neighborhood of Cambridgeport in nearby Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1835.|$|R

50|$|The paghapnig (bundling) and pagriras (stripping off) are {{the next}} steps in the preparation. The manugbanig gathers and bundles the slashed <b>leaves</b> to <b>strip</b> off thorns along the edges and into the middle ridge. In {{removing}} the ridge, the leaf is divided into two. Each leaf is piled separately until the bundle is stripped off with thorns. The leaves will be tightly tied up in bundle so that each piece will not curl up as it dries.|$|R
50|$|Transient by nature, {{the only}} home they {{typically}} own is their pressure suit, and perhaps their singleship. As {{a form of}} heraldry, Belters decorate their skintight suits with elaborate (and often expensive) torso paintings. Most Belters, male and female, sport {{what is known as}} the Belter Crest: shaving their heads on the sides, <b>leaving</b> a <b>strip</b> of hair down the center resembling a mohawk. However, the hair in the back can be of any length, particularly for women.|$|R
50|$|Stripping (= bare {{argument}} ellipsis) is an ellipsis {{mechanism that}} elides {{everything from a}} clause except one constituent. It occurs exclusively in the non-initial conjuncts of coordinate structures. One prominent analysis of stripping {{sees it as a}} particular manifestation of the gapping mechanism, the difference between stripping and gapping lies merely with the number of remnants left behind by ellipsis: gapping leaves two (and sometimes more) constituents behind, whereas <b>stripping</b> <b>leaves</b> just one. <b>Stripping</b> occurs in many languages and is a frequent occurrence in colloquial conversation. As with many other ellipsis mechanisms, stripping challenges theories of syntax in part because the elided material often fails to qualify as a constituent in a straightforward manner.|$|R
50|$|The {{yellow-breasted chat}} is a shy, skulking species of bird, often being only heard but not seen. The {{breeding}} habitats {{of this species}} are dense, brushy areas and hedgerows. The nests of these birds are bulky cups made of grasses, <b>leaves,</b> <b>strips</b> of bark, stems of weeds and lined with finer grasses, wiry plant stems, pine needles and sometimes roots and hair. Nests are invariably placed in thick shrubs and often only about 2.5 m above the ground. They will lay from 3 to 5 creamy white eggs with reddish brown blotches or speckles, incubated by the female, hatch in 11 to 12 days. Both parents tend the young, who fledge in approximately 8 to 11 days. Chats are apparently vigilant guards of their nests, as parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds is not as frequent as with other cup nest builders. However, {{they are not as}} monogamous as other warblers. In one study in central Kentucky, DNA fingerprinting revealed that 17% of 29 yellow-breasted chat nestlings were not sired by the male of the social pair and 33% of 9 broods contained at least 1 extra-pair nestling.|$|R
