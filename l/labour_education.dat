25|$|During {{the period}} 1970 to 1979, both Conservative and Labour administrations {{promoted}} {{the move to}} comprehensive education. As Leader of Sutton Council, Squire advocated a move to comprehensive education in the Borough that would be phased in by 1984. However, in 1978 <b>Labour</b> <b>Education</b> Secretary Shirley Williams pressed {{for an end to}} selective education in the Borough by 1980. This resulted in a stand-off and Squire threatened legal action against the government to prevent an earlier move to comprehensives. The advent of a new Conservative government in May 1979 allowed Sutton to remain as an isolated pocket of selective education and grammar schools. After the Liberal Democrats took control of the Council in 1986 selective education was retained.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{support from}} most staff {{and all three}} headteachers, the new Lincolnshire County Council voted to return the scheme for further {{consultation}} in January 1975, a move the Sleaford Standard called [...] "politically motivated". Two of the leading opponents, councillors Eric Fairchild and Reg Brealey, were governors at the secondary modern and Brealey was a former pupil. He proposed a three-school system, arguing it offered more choice: the secondary modern would be consolidated at Westholme as a single-site 11–16 school; Carre's and the High School would operate Sixth Forms. Fairchild argued {{that this would be}} more popular and cheaper. After the Government ordered the Council to submit a comprehensive proposal in 1977, it voted to submit the three-school system, which had become popular with parents and was championed by Brealey, who had become chairman of the Governors. But, the <b>Labour</b> <b>Education</b> Secretary, Shirley Williams, dismissed the proposals in 1978 on grounds that the Sixth Forms would be too small. The council then voted against the two-school system again.|$|E

2500|$|During his 4 {{years as}} Schools Minister, Squire was {{involved}} in many high-profile issues.
