50|$|A similar idea is {{curation}} {{at source}} {{used in the}} context of Laboratory Information Management Systems LIMS.

40|$|The {{benefit of}} using {{integrating}} spheres {{to generate a}} highly uniform radiance or luminance sources for the calibration of sensors and cameras {{has been well documented}} and is established practice by many calibration laboratories and instrument manufacturers. However, the spectral radiance in the absorption features of the SWIR region of an integrating sphere source are generally not characterised with sufficient detail for hyper-spectral calibration across these features resulting in large uncertainties. In addition the spectral width and depth of these features is dependent on the specification of the national or traceable <b>laboratory’s</b> <b>instrumentation</b> and may differ significantly from the hyperspectral camera. Generating a radiance source form an irradiance standard and reflectance panel produces has a more predictable spectrum with shallower features in the SWIR region. By combining the two calibration techniques the uncertainty in SWIR region can be reduced whilst maintaining the uniformity attributes of an integrating spheres source...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} types of motors {{that can be used}} in a linear {{actuator}} system. These include dc brush, dc brushless, stepper, or in some cases, even induction motors. It all depends on the application requirements and the loads the actuator is designed to move. For example, a linear actuator using an integral horsepower AC induction motor driving a lead screw can be used to operate a large valve in a refinery. In this case, accuracy and high movement resolution aren't needed, but high force and speed are. For electromechanical linear actuators used in <b>laboratory</b> <b>instrumentation</b> robotics, optical and laser equipment, or X-Y tables, fine resolution in the micron range and high accuracy may require the use of a fractional horsepower stepper motor linear actuator with a fine pitch lead screw. There are many variations in the electromechanical linear actuator system. It is critical to understand the design requirements and application constraints to know which one would be best.|$|E

5000|$|RPA is one {{of several}} {{isothermal}} nucleic acid amplification techniques to be developed as a molecular diagnostic technique, frequently with the objective of simplifying the <b>laboratory</b> <b>instrumentation</b> required relative to PCR. A partial list of other isothermal amplification techniques include LAMP, NASBA, Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), and Nicking Enzyme Amplification Reaction (NEAR). The techniques differ in the specifics of primer design and reaction mechanism, and in some cases (like RPA) make use of cocktails of two or more enzymes. Like RPA, many of these techniques offer rapid amplification times with the potential for simplified instrumentation, and reported resistance to substances in unpurified samples that are known to inhibit PCR. With respect to amplification time, {{it should be noted that}} modern thermocyclers with rapid temperature ramps can reduce PCR amplification times to less than 30 minutes, particularly for short amplicons using dual-temperature cycling rather than the conventional three-temperature protocols. [...] In addition, the demands of sample prep (including lysis and extraction of DNA or RNA, if necessary) should be considered as part of the overall time and complexity inherent to the technique. These requirements vary according to the technique as well as to the specific target and sample type.|$|E
