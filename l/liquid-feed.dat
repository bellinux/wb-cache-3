The potential for large reductions in overall package resistance {{with the use}} of high-conductivity wick materials enhanced with CNT nanostructures is investigated. While such nanostructured wicks feature very small pore sizes that support high capillary pressures, it is shown that the high fluid flow resistance through these dense arrays prevents their use as the lone fluid transport mechanism. It is proposed that evaporator surfaces comprised of nanostructured wicks fed by interspersed conventional wick materials (such as sintered powders) can provide the required permeability for fluid flow while simultaneously decreasing the effective evaporator thermal resistance. Optimization of wicks with integrated sintered and nanostructured areas requires a study of the trade-offs between the greater permeability of the sintered materials and the greater capillary pressure and thin-film evaporation area offered by the nanostructures.

Diffusion and convection of both gas and liquid phases are considered in the backing layer and flow channel {{as well as the}} anode and cathode electrochemical reactions.

The model employs three important requisites: (i) implementation of analytical treatment of nonlinear terms to obtain a faster numerical solution as also to render the iterative scheme easier to converge, (ii) an appropriate description of two-phase transport phenomena in the diffusive region of the cell to account for flooding and water condensation/evaporation effects, and (iii) treatment of polarization effects due to methanol crossover. An improved numerical solution has been achieved by coupling analytical integration of kinetics and transport equations in the reaction layer, which explicitly include the effect of concentration and pressure gradient on cell polarization within the bulk catalyst layer. In particular, the integrated kinetic treatment explicitly accounts for the nonhomogeneous porous structure of the catalyst layer and the diffusion of reactants within and between the pores in the cathode. At the anode, the analytical integration of electrode kinetics has been obtained within the assumption of macrohomogeneous electrode porous structure, because methanol transport in a <b>liquid-feed</b> SPE- DMFC is essentially a single-phase process {{because of the high}} miscibility of methanol with water and its higher concentration in relation to gaseous reactants. A simple empirical model accounts for the effect of capillary forces on liquid-phase saturation in the diffusion layer.
