It {{is also known as}} <b>Load</b> <b>Bus.</b> Generally, in a PQ bus, the generated real and reactive power will be assumed to be zero. However, power will be flowing out, thus, {{the real power}} and reactive power will be both negative. The <b>Load</b> <b>Bus</b> will be used to find the bus voltage and angle.|$|E
5000|$|In the power-flow problem, it {{is assumed}} that the real power PD and {{reactive}} power QD at each <b>Load</b> <b>Bus</b> are known. For this reason, Load Buses are also known as PQ Buses. For Generator Buses, {{it is assumed}} that the real power generated PG and the voltage magnitude |V| is known. For the Slack Bus, {{it is assumed that}} the voltage magnitude |V| and voltage phase Θ are known. Therefore, for each <b>Load</b> <b>Bus,</b> both the voltage magnitude and angle are unknown and must be solved for; for each Generator Bus, the voltage angle must be solved for; there are no variables that must be solved for the Slack Bus. In a system with N buses and R generators, there are then [...] unknowns.|$|E

For similar reasons, there are no equations written for the Slack Bus.|$|E

A bus without any generators connected to it is called a <b>Load</b> <b>Bus.</b> With one exception, a bus with at least one generator connected to it is called a Generator Bus. The exception is one arbitrarily-selected bus that has a generator. This bus {{is referred to as the}} slack bus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It {{is common}} for many {{induction}} motors {{to be connected to}} a <b>load</b> <b>bus,</b> and voltage can sometimes quickly collapse when an initial disturbance triggers a cascade of motors stalling. We analyze a single line power system supplying a bus with many induction motors. Variation and uncertainty in the motor load is modeled probabilistically. We describe an analytic method to estimate the parameters of a model of cascading failure from system parameters, and hence estimate the probabilities of the number of motors stalled. The analytic method gives insights into cascading stall and relates system parameters to the risk of cascading stall.

Due to the extremely reduced computational time, this technique can be successfully used for fast reliability assessments, when a huge number of load flow scenarios, generated by a probabilistic approach like Monte Carlo techniques, must be analyzed in terms of voltage violations; the algorithm is also promising for Optimal Reactive Power Flow procedures.

40|$|Abstract — Voltage {{stability}} {{is a major}} concern in planning and operations of power systems. It is well known that voltage instability and collapse have led to major system failures. Modern transmission networks are more heavily loaded than ever before to meet the growing demand. One of the major consequences resulted from such a stressed system is voltage collapse or instability. This paper presents maximum loadability identification of a <b>load</b> <b>bus</b> in a power transmission network. In this study, Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI) is utilized as the indicator of the maximum loadability termed as Qmax. In this technique, reactive power loading will be increased gradually at particular <b>load</b> <b>bus</b> until the FVSI reaches close to unity. Therefore, a critical value of FVSI was set as th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{discusses}} the voltage {{control of a}} critical <b>load</b> <b>bus</b> using dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) in a distribution system. The critical load requires a balanced sinusoidal waveform across its terminals preferably at system nominal frequency of 50 Hz. It is assumed that {{the frequency of the}} supply voltage can be varied and it is different from the system nominal frequency. The DVR is operated such that it holds the voltage across critical <b>load</b> <b>bus</b> terminals constant at system nominal frequency irrespective of the frequency of the source voltage. In case of a frequency mismatch, the total real power requirement of the critical <b>load</b> <b>bus</b> has to be supplied by the DVR. Proposed method used to compensate for frequency variation, the DC link of the DVR is supplied through an uncontrolled rectifier that provides a path for the real power required by the critical load to flow. A simple frequency estimation technique is discussed which are Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), Kalman Filter and ANN controller. The present work study the compensation principle and different control strategies of DVR used here are based on DFT,and kalman Filter. Through detailed analysis and simulation studies using MATLAB. It is shown that the voltage is completely controlled across the critical load...|$|E

In the mid-1990s the arm control system was redesigned to increase the payload capability to 3293 kg {{in order to support}} space station assembly operations. While able to maneuver payloads with the mass of a <b>loaded</b> <b>bus</b> in space, the arm motors cannot lift the arm's own weight when on the ground. NASA therefore developed a model of the arm for use at its training facility within the Johnson Space Center located in Houston, Texas. The Canadarm can also retrieve, repair and deploy satellites, provide a mobile extension ladder for extravehicular activity crew members for work stations or foot restraints, and be used as an inspection aid to allow the flight crew members to view the orbiter's or payload's surfaces through a television camera on the Canadarm.|$|R
