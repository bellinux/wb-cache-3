Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E

States that underperform predicted <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> while spending above the state-wise average on relevant development sectors can be said to have squandered development expenditures, while those that outperform predicted levels while spending below the state-wise mean likely spend more efficiently.

Just outside the hamlet, NY104 meets I-81 at exit34.

5|$|The {{views of}} Winckelmann on art {{encompassed}} {{the entirety of}} civilisation. He drew a parallel between a civilisation's general <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> {{and the evolution of}} its art. He interpreted this artistic evolution the same way that his contemporaries saw the life cycle of a civilisation, in terms of progress, apogee and then decline. For him, Greek art had been the pinnacle of artistic achievement, culminating with Phidias. Further, Winckelmann believed that the most beautiful works of Greek art had been produced under ideal geographic, political and religious circumstances. This frame of thought long dominated intellectual life in Europe. He classified Greek art into four periods: Ancient (archaic period), Sublime (Phidias), Beautiful (Praxiteles) and Decadent (Roman period).|$|E
5|$|Originating {{from the}} Post-Zarubintsy {{cultures}} and often considered the oldest Slavic culture, the Kiev culture functioned during the later Roman periods (end of 2nd through mid-5th century) {{north of the}} vast Chernyakhov culture territories, within the basins of the upper and middle Dnieper, Desna and Seym rivers. The archeological cultural features of the Kiev sites show this culture to be identical or highly compatible (representing the same cultural model) {{with that of the}} 6th-century Slavic societies, including the settlements on the lands of today's Poland. The Kiev culture is known mostly from settlement sites; the burial sites, involving pit graves, are few and poorly equipped. Not many metal objects have been found, despite the known native production of iron and processing of other metals, including enamel coating technology. Clay vessels were made without the potter's wheel. The Kiev culture represented an intermediate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> between that of the cultures of the Central European Barbaricum, and the forest zone societies of {{the eastern part of the}} continent. The Kiev culture consisted of four local formations: The Middle Dnieper group, the Desna group, the Upper Dnieper group and the Dnieper-Don group. The general model of the Kiev culture is like that of the early Slavic cultures that were to follow and must have originated mainly from the Kiev groups, but evolved probably over a larger territory, stretching west to the base of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains, and from a broader Post-Zarubintsy foundation. The Kiev culture and related groups expanded considerably after 375 AD, when the Ostrogothic state, and more broadly speaking the Chernyakhov culture, were destroyed by the Huns. This process was facilitated further and gained pace, involving at that time the Kiev's descendant cultures, when the Hun confederation itself broke down in the mid-5th century.|$|E
