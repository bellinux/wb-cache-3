40|$|Slugs {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} animals called Mollusks that {{includes}} clams, oysters, squid, octopus, and snails- slugs closest relative. Snails cause similar damage as slugs, but usually are not as serious a pest in the Pacific Northwest. Outside the <b>garden,</b> <b>slugs</b> and snails actually do good things. They recycle organic matter, which helps to build soils, and {{are an important part of}} the foodchain. Inside the garden and landscape, however, slugs and snails can do considerable damage and often must be controlled. The most common slug species are the Gray <b>garden</b> <b>slug,</b> Deroceras reticulatum, and the European slug, Arion ater. The native Yellow green banana slug, Ariolimax columbianus, is most often found in wooded areas. Slugs vary in length, depending on species and age, from 1 / 4 inch to as much as 10 inches. They move or glide on a “foot”, which produces the slime that helps them move. Their eyes are at the end of stalks, which can be drawn back into their head at the sign of danger. Slugs are active largely at night. They feed during the night and on cool, cloudy days. If the weather is hot and dry, slugs hide beneath stones, flower boxes, boards, and dense plant cover such as ivy. Slugs avoid dry, dusty areas. Slugs have both male and female reproductive systems. Slugs can live from 1 to 2 years, and can begin to lay eggs when they are a...|$|R
