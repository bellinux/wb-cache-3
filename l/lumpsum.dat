One day Sannasi gets {{a phone call from a}} group of men in a lodge near by. They pay him a <b>lumpsum</b> amount to book his group for a dance programme in a temple in Andaman Nicobar islands. The group goes to Andaman by a passenger ship, stays in the hotel provided by the organizers and performs Karagattam in a temple. The men who organized the dance liked the women dancers and asks Sannasi to show them the girls indirectly asking for sex. Sannasi without uttering any word takes the organizers to the room where the lady dancers are staying and says to them that he has showed the girls as per their wish [...] Sooravalli who is short tempered fiercefully hits all the organizers knowing that they had asked for sex with the lady dancers including her. The organizers who were drunk at that time were badly injured and in turn they tore the return tickets to main land India taking revenge on them. That night the group of dancers could not find a shelter and sleep in the road. Not knowing how to get back to main land India, they go in search of a job. A building contractor helps them to find a construction work and asks for some percent of money as his commission. Agreed to this the group of dancers work in the construction site only to damage the buildings and the constructions built so far. In the chaos Sooravalli gets hurt by getting her feet pricked by a nail. The building owner gets irritated with the damage and scolds the contractor. The contractor asks them to stop the work and go back. Without any money the dance group was not able to buy even a tea. Soorvalli who could not see Sannasi starving for hunger puts her make-up and dances karagattam,with the wounded feet, in the street asking the thavil players and nadaswaram players to accompany her. Mesmerized by the dance the public gives them enough money with which they return to mainland India. While returning Sooravalli fells ills because of the nail which got pricked in her foot. Sannasi takes care of her throughout the journey which improves their bonding.|$|E

40|$|Taxing internationally mobile {{factors of}} {{production}} has been dismissed as an inefficient means of raising tax revenue. This paper addresses {{the question of whether}} it is efficient to tax capital at source when labor markets and the taxation of <b>lumpsum</b> income suffer from imperfections. Four reasons for taxing capital are identified: (i) institutional constraints rendering any taxation of profit income infeasible; (ii) market power in the demand for labor; (iii) market power in the supply of labor if it increases with the employment of capital; (iv) unemployment benefits that are not tied to net real wages. It is argued that the case for taxing capital is not particularly strong. By reinterpreting capital as energy the results are applicable to the discussion about ecological tax reforms.

40|$|Previous {{experimental}} work {{has examined the}} effects of relaxing some assumptions upon which Ricardian equivalence is based. Notably, however, the impact of distortionary taxation on Ricardian equivalence has not been investigated. This paper tests the effects of distortionary versus nondistortionary taxation. Distortionary taxes are introduced in some settings by levying a â€œtaxâ€ on savings, so that one unit of savings does not lead to one unit of future consumption. We find that, in the presence of nondistorting (e. g., <b>lumpsum)</b> taxes, there is strong evidence that subjects behave according to the predictions of Ricardian equivalence; that is, an increase in debt on one generation leads to an increase in bequests to the future generation by an equal amount. However, in the presence of distorting taxes, consumption is not equalized across periods, and the predicted Ricardian equality between the change in bequests and the change in debt is not attained.

40|$|Consider {{the finance}} of an {{exogenous}} path of public expenditure, G(t), with taxes and public debt issues. In {{the absence of}} unexpected default, borrowing does not allow the government to escape taxes in a present-value sense. But the choices of how much to borrow and in what form affect the timing of tax collections {{and the ways in}} which these collections are contingent on economic outcomes. This note assesses these choices from an optimal-tax perspective. That is, the government manages its debt to minimize the expected present value of the distortions from financing its expenditures. The optimal-tax solution can be analyzed in three stages. In the first stage, the conditions hold for Ricardian equivalence, so that choices between debt and taxes do not matter. Sufficient conditions for this result are <b>lumpsum</b> taxes; certainty about future levels of income, public spending, rates of return, etc.; perfect capital markets; and infinite horizons for households. Under these conditions, the known present value of taxes is fixed by th...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how preference heterogeneity affects {{the ability of}} the poor to extract resources from the rich. We study the equilibrium of a game in which coalitions of individuals form parties, parties propose platforms, and all individuals vote, with the winning policy chosen by plurality. Political parties are restricted to offering platforms that are credible (in that they belong to the Pareto set of their members). The platforms specify the values of two policy tools: a general redistributive tax which is <b>lumpsum</b> rebated and a series of taxes whose revenue is used to fund specific (targeted) goods. We show that taste conflict first dilutes but later reinforces class interests. When the degree of taste diversity is low, the equilibrium policy is characterized by some amount of general income redistribution and some targeted transfers. As taste diversity increases in society, the set of equilibrium policies becomes more and more tilted towards special interest groups and against general redistribution. As diversity increases further, however, only general redistribution survives. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the distributional {{impact of}} carbon tax in Indonesia, {{one of the}} largest carbon emitter developing countries. Using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with disaggregated households, the result suggests that in contrast to most studies from industrialised countries, the introduction of carbon tax in Indonesia is not necessarily regressive. Its structural change and resource reallocation e¤ect, following the carbon tax, is in favor of factors endowed more proportionately by rural, and lower income households. In addition, the expenditure of lower income households, especially in rural area, are less sensitive to the prices of energy-related commodities. Revenue-recycling through uniform reduction in commodity tax rate may reduce the adverse aggregate output e¤ect, whereas uniform <b>lumpsum</b> transfers may enhance the progressivity. This study demonstrates an example, that encouraging developing countries to reduce carbon emission, may not only increase the e ¢ ciency of carbon abatement globally, but also have desirable distributional implication in the developing countries themselves...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of ageing and child support in a model with endogenous fertility and Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) pensions. First, we show that the endogeneity of fertility makes society vulnerable to both pessimistic beliefs and changes in life expectancy. In particular, we show that the private fertility choice may not coincide with the social optimum, due {{to the existence of}} two external effects of a child on society as a whole. The market outcome without government intervention is efficient, however, as both externalities exactly cancel out in that case. If the government wants to redistribute towards the old, it cannot replicate the command optimum by merely applying <b>lumpsum</b> transfers, but rather needs a child allowance scheme to effectively alter the number of offspring chosen by households. Finally, we analyse whether a Pareto-improving social security reform is possible. It is shown that a mere reduction of the PAYG-scheme cannot be Pareto-improving, but a combined policy of decreasing the PAYG-tax and introducing child allowances can be...|$|E
40|$|A {{key issue}} in alliances (defined here as any {{cooperative}} or joint activity between {{two or more}} firms) is the payment or compensation structure stated in the formal agreement between the parties. These days, most agreements include a multiplicity of payment types, including royalties, <b>lumpsum</b> payments and returns on equity. The paper outlines reasons for this and presents a general framework for alliance negotiations. A simulation example shows key negotiation variables, together with non-zero-sum tradeoffs between them. Each map of variable pairs indicates a 'zone of mutual benefit' where the joint profits of both partners can increase. There is often a contradiction between profit maximization and other strategic, behavioral, tax and regulatory considerations which themselves point in non-congruent directions for structuring the alliance. No wonder alliances are such fragile things! Nevertheless, alliances are an indispensable part of the management landscape, and negotiators must know how to structure them. The approach outlined in this paper, the simulation method presented, the caveats indicated for non-financial variables, and the behavioral responses to each, will however help companies to craft better and longer-lasting alliances. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design charges subsystem using multi agent technology which deals with calculation, accrual and collection of various charges levied at the goods in a supply chain Logistics. Accrual of various charges such as freight, demurrage, and wharfage take place implicitly in the SC system at the various events of different subsystems which is collected and calculated by software agents. An Agent-based modeling is an approach based on the idea that a system is composed of decentralized individual ‘agents ’ and that each agent interacts with other agents according to its localized knowledge. Our aim is to design a flexible architecture that can deal with next generation supply chain problems based on a multi-agent architecture.

40|$|Due to the di¢culties of {{devising a}} system of …rst-best {{lump-sum}} taxes, optimal taxation models usually con…ne themselves {{to the study of}} the optimal shape of the linear/nonlinear income tax schedule and the structure of (linear) commodity taxation, disregarding any possibility to raise revenue by means of some limited, second-best lump-sum measures based on characteristics which are both easily observable and hard to alter by the individual. This approach has been criticized by Hahn (1972) who argues that there is a scope for some kind of <b>lumpsum</b> taxation with redistributive power and that this possibility has been de-emphasized by economists rashly. As Akerlof (1978) pointed out in his analysis of “tagging”, if the tax system can be di¤erentiated between individuals, the redistribution-incentive con‡ict can be substantially reduced. Setting up an OLG model where individuals live for two periods and face a consumption-leisure choice in each period, the paper develops the idea to use age as a (noisy) signal for market ability, investigating if, by relating the tax payments to the age of persons, it is possible to achieve redistribution at smaller e¢ciency costs...|$|E
40|$|In overlapping-generations economies {{with perfect}} {{financial}} markets and <b>lumpsum</b> taxation, {{restrictions on the}} government budget deficits do not limit the set of achievable allocations. For economies in which tax instruments are distortionary and limited in number, deficits are irrelevant only in the unrealistic {{case in which the}} number of tax instruments is large relative to the number of policy goals. In particular, if the government can use only anonymous consumption taxes, then achieving the prescribed deficits without changing the equilibrium allocation will typically be impossible when the number of consumers exceeds the number of commodities. A similar result holds if consumer credit is (exogenously) restricted. Surprisingly, in this case, distortionary taxes may be more likely than lump-sum taxes to lead to the irrelevance of government deficits.
