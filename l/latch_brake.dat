50|$|The {{thousand}} foot lift of {{the cable}} railway was not continuous. The initial two and later three sections of the Ashley Planes railroad was capable of operation as a funicular railroad or a cable railroad, for its hoist houses all used a pusher cart called a 'barney' hooked into a continuous cable {{in the same way}} as a modern ski lift uses a continuous cable. Like a ski lift, the railway was operated from a standing engine by an operator in control of a winch, clutch and brake. A helper spotted cars below a short local drop to an area upslope of the 'barney house', where the cable and pusher cart would drop into on one end (heading down) and rise out of on the other to engage the freight cars and push them upwards. The axle on the barney's telescoped so that at the barney house entrance the barney's wheels slide inside and dropped under the plane of the standard width railroad tracks so the barney could slide away and let gravity take the consist onto the marshaling yard. When using furnicular action, as it did sending returns down during its early years the rails split connecting two pairs of tracks bulging out in a vase-like shape in a passing area, so the railway could ship freight downhill east to west as well as the heavy operations west to east which predominated until its closing. In the earliest years of operation, there was no back track to return cars to the bottom for refilling, and they had to be returned on the Planes, thus slowing and complicating the lift operations. When stopping cars from rolling free, the barneys had to be positioned below the cars, and since the upsides are uphills from the barney house opening, that meant a <b>latch</b> (<b>brake</b> system) had to hold a string of empties above the barney before it emerged from hiding its little tunnel. It also means the barney was moving down hill and away from the latched cars which would then accelerate and bang into the small barneys with considerable force, part of which was transmitted via the cables to everything in the system. It was actually easier to lift cars waiting at a latch for a barney than it was to drop cars down safely onto a moving barney.In the 1860s, the LH&S completed tracks along the right bank of the Lehigh through the Lehigh Gorge to Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe, PA) and its trackage to the Delaware Valley, especially the Delaware Canal to Philadelphia markets and rail connections at Easton via the industrial centers of Allentown and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. These inclined plane railbeds were used for the transportation of anthracite coal. The railroads were in use until 1948.|$|E
5000|$|Tadpole trikes tend also to use Ackermann {{steering}} geometry, {{perhaps with}} both front brakes {{operated by the}} stronger hand. While the KMX Kart stunt trike with this setup allows the rear brake to be operated separately, letting the rider do [...] "bootlegger turns", the standard setup for most trikes has the front brake for each side operated by each hand. The center-of-mass of most tadpole trikes {{is close to the}} front wheels, making the rear brake less useful. The rear brake may instead be connected to a <b>latching</b> <b>brake</b> lever for use as a parking brake when stopped on a hill.|$|R
50|$|In cars, {{the parking}} brake, also called hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, or e-brake, is a <b>latching</b> <b>brake</b> usually {{used to keep}} the vehicle stationary.Automobile hand brakes usually consist of a cable directly connected to the brake mechanism on one end and to a lever or pedal at the driver's position. The mechanism is often a hand-operated lever (hence the hand brake name), on the floor {{on either side of}} the driver, or a pull handle located below and near the steering wheel column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located far apart from the other pedals.In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking.Some cars have the parking brake operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|R
50|$|An {{elevator}} has brakes {{that are}} held off brake pads by {{the tension of}} the elevator cable. If the cable breaks, tension is lost and the <b>brakes</b> <b>latch</b> on, stopping the elevator from falling.|$|R
5000|$|The chase {{locomotive}} <b>latches</b> on, applies <b>brakes,</b> but {{loses the}} connection, chases again but passes a [...] "point of no return" [...] {{at which point}} it should be impossible to stop the train. The chase engineer won't sit still for abandoning the runaway, and pushes his engine beyond safe limits to chase and firmly latch on as the young woman takes {{the hand of the}} young man trying to talk her into living.|$|R
5000|$|Over Booth's {{objections}} that a {{move from}} light car production would weaken the {{market share of}} the Scripps-Booth Company, company directors began to approve the additions of larger and larger models to its product lines. Angered by this turn of events, Booth tendered his resignation to the company {{in the autumn of}} 1916, just as Scripps-Booth began to experience a severe drop in sales. At the end of 1917, the company was absorbed by Chevrolet and in the following year, when Chevrolet was acquired by General Motors, Scripps-Booth became a part of the General Motors family. The line was discontinued altogether in 1922. In 1923, Booth began to design his ultimate driving machine, the [...] "Da Vinci". This compact car featured an underslung worm drive axle which allowed for a flat nineteen inch floor (much lower than any other car on the market), cable-controlled hood <b>latches,</b> hanging <b>brake</b> and clutch pedals, and a parking brake in the transmission. Having no interest in manufacturing the car on his own, Booth attempted to sell his novel design to established automakers. He was understandably horrified, then, when Stutz produced a car with a similar underslung drive a year after he had shown the firm the [...] "Da Vinci" [...] plans. A costly patent infringement suit ensued, which Booth eventually won in 1935. By then, however, Stutz was ailing financially and the judgement that Booth received barely covered his own legal expenses. After this disconcerting ordeal, Booth produced just one other vehicle—the [...] "Da Vinci Pup", a small, sleek cyclecar—and that solely for his own pleasure.|$|R
