40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} {{a traffic}} counts database covering a ten year period (1976 - 1985) to identify travel trends for Montgomery County, {{a suburb of}} Washington D. C. Generally, travel behavior is analyzed using person based travel survey data. The use of traffic counts to understand travel behavior {{is a relatively new}} approach. Unlike household surveys, which are typically characterized by respondent and sample bias, and require special effort for their collection, traffic counts are routinely collected by Departments of Transportation and provide the best available measure of observed traffic volumes. The study provides fresh evidence to support some of the earlier findings: an increase in lateral commuting as a share of travel, changes in work and non-work trip proportions, and increase in peak spreading. An interesting result in this paper relates to a more pronounced directionality in radial as compared with lateral trips. The relative symmetry of traffic flows along <b>lateral</b> <b>routes</b> compared with radial routes results in better utilization of the suburban road network. Non-work trips emerge as the more elastic trips, shifting to off-peak hours with an increase in congestion. MNCPPC - Montgomery County Planning Departmen...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Membrane-intrinsic enzymes are {{embedded}} in lipids, yet how such enzymes interrogate lipid substrates remains a largely unexplored fundamental question. The outer membrane phospholipid:lipid A palmitoyltransferase PagP combats host immune defenses during infection and selects a palmitate chain using its β-barrel interior hydrocarbon ruler. Both a molecular embrasure and crenel in Escherichia coli PagP display weakened transmembrane β-strand hydrogen bonding to provide potential <b>lateral</b> <b>routes</b> for diffusion of the palmitoyl group between the hydrocarbon ruler and outer membrane external leaflet. Prolines in strands A and B lie beneath the dynamic L 1 surface loop flanking the embrasure, whereas the crenel is flanked by prolines in strands F andG. Reversibly barricading the embrasure prevents lipid A palmitoylation without affecting the slower phospholipase reaction. Lys 42 Ala PagP is also a dedicated phospholipase, implicating this disordered L 1 loop residue in lipid A recognition. The embrasure barricade additionally prevents palmitoylation of nonspecific fatty alcohols, but not miscible alcohols. Irreversibly barricading the crenel inhibits both lipid A palmitoylation and phospholipase reactions without compromising PagP structure. These findings indicate lateral palmitoyl group diffusion within the PagP hydrocarbon ruler is likely gated during phospholipid entry via the crenel and during lipid A egress via the embrasure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{report on}} their 20 -year {{experience}} with 120 patients with infected extracavitary prosthetic arterial grafts (95 polytetraflouroethylene, 25 Dacron). Throughout this experience, an effort was made, when appropriate, to salvage all or {{a portion of}} these infected grafts. METHODS: When patients had arterial bleeding (20 cases) or systemic sepsis (6 cases), immediate graft excision was performed. When the infected graft was occluded (43 cases), subtotal graft excision was performed, leaving an oversewn 2 - to 3 -mm graft remnant to maintain patency of the artery. Complete graft preservation was attempted in 51 {{cases in which the}} graft was patent, the patient was not septic, and the anastomoses were intact. Aggressive operative wound debridement was repeated, as necessary, to achieve wound healing. The preferred method of revascularization, when necessary, included secondary bypasses tunneled through uninfected (often <b>lateral)</b> <b>routes.</b> Follow-up averaged 3 years (range, 1 month- 20 years). RESULTS: This strategy resulted in a hospital mortality of 12 % (14 / 120) and a hospital amputation rate in survivors of 13 % (14 / 106 threatened limbs). Of the surviving patients treated by complete graft preservation, the hospital amputation rate was only 4 % (2 / 45) and long-term complete graft preservation was successful in 71 % (32 / 45) of cases. Partial graft preservation also proved successful in 85 % (35 / 41) of surviving patients who had occluded grafts. Successful complete graft preservation was as likely when gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria were cultured from the wound, with the exception of Pseudomonas (successful graft preservation in only 40 % [4 / 10] of cases). CONCLUSION: Based on this 20 -year experience, the authors conclude that selective partial or complete graft preservation represents a simpler and better method of managing infected extracavitary prosthetic grafts than routine total graft excision...|$|R

Here, we present a mechanistic model that describes 'passive' Papp values (i. e., neglecting active transport) by accounting for the different resistances solutes encounter when permeating a cell monolayer. We described three parallel permeation pathways, namely a cytosolic-, paracellular-, and <b>lateral</b> <b>route,</b> each of which consists of a number of serial resistances. These resistances were accounted for via a mechanistic depiction of the underlying processes that are largely based on literature work.

For the cytosolic route by far the most chemicals found their main resistance in the various water layers and not in the membrane. Although correlations within the subclasses of chemicals dominated by a specific permeation route were rather poor, we could overall satisfyingly predict Papp for 151 chemicals at a pH of 7. 4 (R 2 = 0. 77, RMSE = 0. 48).

40|$|Flight {{trajectory}} optimization {{is being}} looked {{as a way}} of reducing flight costs, fuel burned and emissions generated by the fuel consumption. The objective of this work is to find the optimal trajectory between two points. To find the optimal trajectory, the parameters of weight, cost index, initial coordinates, and meteorological conditions along the route are provided to the algorithm. This algorithm finds the trajectory where the global cost is the most economical. The global cost is a compromise between fuel burned and flight time, this is determined using a cost index that assigns a cost in terms of fuel to the flight time. The optimization is achieved by calculating a candidate optimal cruise trajectory profile from all the combinations available in the aircraft performance database. With this cruise candidate profile, more cruises profiles are calculated taken into account the climb and descend costs. During cruise, step climbs are evaluated to optimize the trajectory. The different trajectories are compared and the most economical one is defined as the optimal vertical navigation profile. From the optimal vertical navigation profile, different <b>lateral</b> <b>routes</b> are tested. Taking advantage of the meteorological influence, the algorithm looks for the lateral navigation trajectory where the global cost is the most economical. That route is then selected as the optimal lateral navigation profile. The meteorological data was obtained from environment Canada. The new way of obtaining data from the grid from environment Canada proposed in this work resulted in an important computation time reduction compared against other methods such as bilinear interpolation.

40|$|Plesiadapiformes {{has long}} been {{considered}} to be an archaic group of Primates. Discovery of a paromomyid plesiadapiform skull and independent analysis of referred postcrania have led investigators to conclude that Plesiadapiformes shares a closer relationship to extant flying lemurs (Dermoptera) than to Primates (= Euprimates of Hoffstetter [1977] Bull Mem Soc Anthropol Paris Ser 13 4 : 327 – 346). Despite challenges to this interpretation, the plesiadapiform-dermopteran relationship has gained currency in recent years. Here we show that newly discovered crania of Ignacius graybullianus, preserving previously undocumented portions of the ear, are more similar to primates than to dermopterans. New specimens confirm that paromomyids lacked the petrosal bulla of primates. However, these new specimens also demonstrate that paromomyids likely had: 1) a small promontorial branch of the internal carotid artery; 2) a <b>lateral</b> <b>route</b> for the internal carotid nerves crossing the promontorium; and 3) a ring-like ectotympanic with an annular bridge. This pattern is similar to primitive primates and fundamentally different from dermopterans, which have: 1) no internal carotid artery; 2) internal carotid nerves that take a more medial route; and 3) no annular bridge. Recognition of some primate-like traits, documented here by new evidence, indicates that Paromomyidae is likely to be more closely related to other Paleogene Plesiadapiformes and Eocene Primates than to extant Dermoptera. In view of these findings, a link between paromomyids and extant dermopterans (“Eudermoptera”) is not convincingly supported by a single characteristic of the basicranium.

40|$|A {{key element}} of future Air Traffic Management {{concepts}} like SESAR or NextGen is the stepwise introduction of the extensive use of 4 D trajectories. Two of the expected areas of benefit are reduced lateral flight path lengths through direct flight routings {{and the application of}} near idle descent flight profiles from en-route flight level to landing. High density terminal areas of large international airports present a particular challenge to these concepts due to their traffic share {{on the one hand and}} the traffic complexity on the other hand. This paper presents an approach to estimate requirements and costs for applying 4 D ATM in a high density Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) in a specific example. The approach is starting from a scenario where trajectory uncertainty is completely eliminated and aircraft proceed along their pre-planned 4 D trajectories exactly. This “ideal” scenario is called Utopia. Utopia is used to calculate the upper bound for improvements which theoretically could be obtained from using 4 D ATM. The only constraints that must be met in Utopia are conflict free runway threshold times. Then Utopia is degraded sequentially by the introduction of additional constraints and parameter uncertainties. Examples for such degradations are the stepwise increase of separation requirements between trajectories within the TMA or TMA entry time deviations. To compensate the degradation effects measures have to be taken to fulfil the initial constraints of conflict free threshold times. Measures are e. g. level segments in profile, speed changes or <b>lateral</b> <b>route</b> extensions. The degraded scenarios are evaluated with regard to feasibility and compensation costs. The results give an indication on the range of the degradation which can be compensated by specific measures. Indicators used for scenario evaluation are <b>lateral</b> <b>route</b> lengths, normalized flight times, number of separation conflicts and model fuel consumption. A reference scenario based on today’s route structure in a high density TMA is used as a lower bound starting point for the calculation of possible improvements. Aircraft in this scenario follow standard instrument departures and standard arrival routes that include guidance along a trombone as seen in many high density approach patterns today. All scenarios are evaluated using the air traffic simulator TrafficSim. TrafficSim is designed to support the development and validation of pilot assistant systems dealing with airborne separation assurance systems and air traffic management tools. It is as well suitable as a “proof of concept simulation” for new ATM-concepts or operations. All aircraft in the scenarios under study are equipped with a flight management system (FMS) that is capable of meeting multiple time constraints in a 4 D trajectory. The traffic example used is based on an actual busy day of real traffic at a major hub in Central Europe. Real traffic is considered as important to depict the spatial and temporal distribution of demand, the traffic mix and the relationships between arrival and departure peaks. The traffic example contains about 1400 arrivals and departures and is being used consistently over all scenarios under study. Thus a direct and fast comparison between scenario results is facilitated. First results of the Utopia approach under study give an indication on the relation between the expected benefits of advanced 4 D application in high density TMAs and the requirements associated to such a concept. In addition, the scenario and evaluation method developed can be used as a testing environment for new concepts to organize high density TMA traffic using 4 D trajectories...|$|E

Osnovni namen diplomske naloge je preučitev možnosti in kriterijev za rekonstrukcijo obstoječega trikrakega križišča. V diplomskem delu so analizirani vsi parametri, ki vplivajo na izbiro optimalnega tipa in oblike rekonstruiranega križišča. Prav tako so preverjeni vsi kriteriji, katere mora izpolnjevati predlagana rešitev. Kot optimalna rešitev je bila izbrana rešitev rekonstrukcija obstoječega križišča v enopasovno krožno križišče. Z izvedbo predlagane rešitve bi izboljšali obstoječo raven prometne varnosti, izboljšali priključevanje iz stranske prometne smeri ter izboljšali pogoje za nemotorizirane udeležence v cestnem prometu (pešci, kolesarji). The {{subject of}} the thesis is an {{judgement}} of {{the reconstruction of the}} intersection at Cesta talcev at Velenje. The main purpose of the thesis is the research of possibilities and criteria for the reconstruction of the existing three-lane intersection. The thesis analyzes all the parameters, which influence the selection of the optimal type and the form of the reconstructed intersection. At the same time, the thesis checks all the criteria that the suggested solution should fulfil. As the optimum solution the chosen solution for the reconstruction of the existing intersection is a one-lane roundabout. This type of a roundabout would greatly the current traffic safetyimprove the current entering of cars coming from the <b>lateral</b> traffic <b>route</b> and improve the conditions for non-motorised traffic participants (pedestrians, cyclists) ...|$|R
40|$|The sleep-inducing {{effect of}} {{prostaglandin}} D 2 (PGD 2) was studied in five conscious male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) maintained in a 12 -hr light/dark cycle. PGD 2 was infused into the lateral or the third ventricle of the cerebrum slowly and continuously for 6 hr {{in the light}} period. Infusion of PGD 2 into the lateral ventricle at 15 - 2250 pmol/min induced natural sleep as identified by electroencephalogram, electromyogram, electrooculogram, body temperature, heart rate, and animal behavior. Although sensitivity to PGD 2 was slightly different among individual animals, the amount of total sleep time increased maximally up to 3 - to 4 -fold over the control level. PGD 2 infused into the third ventricle induced effects similar to those observed for the <b>lateral</b> ventricular <b>route,</b> but infusion into the third ventricle was about 1000 times more effective than infusion into the lateral ventricle. In three monkeys, PGD 2 increased the amount of sleep in a dose-dependent manner. Bell-shaped dose-response curves were observed for the other two monkeys. Infusion of prostaglandin E 2 or F 2 alpha into the lateral ventricle caused sedation but slightly reduced the amount of slow-wave sleep and produced increases in heart rate and body temperature. These findings suggest that endogenous PGD 2 {{may be involved in}} the regulation of sleep by acting on the brain structures surrounding the third ventricle in the rhesus monkey...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the medium-term clinical-functional results (minimum follow-up of six years) from total uncemented hip arthroplasty performed {{by means of}} a posterior minimally invasive access, in comparison with the traditional right lateral access. METHODS: In a comparative prospective study, 224 adult patients underwent elective total hip arthroplasty due to a diagnosis of primary or secondary osteoarthrosis. A group of 103 patients with posterior minimally invasive access was compared with a group of 121 patients with the traditional right lateral access. The mean length of follow-up among the patients of this sample was 7. 2 years. We evaluated the clinical-functional and radiographic results and occurrences of loosening, along with any complications that occurred, with a minimum follow-up of six years. RESULTS: The clinical-functional analyses before the surgical procedure and six years afterwards were similar in the two groups (p = 0. 88 and p = 0. 55). One patient in the minimally invasive group underwent revision of the acetabular component and two patients in the control group underwent the same procedure (p = 0. 46). The Trendelenburg clinical test, which showed weakness of the hip abductor musculature, was present in five patients operated using the traditional <b>lateral</b> <b>route</b> and absent in all those who underwent the minimally invasive procedure (p = 0. 06). There was no difference regarding the radiographic parameters obtained, either in acetabular or in femoral positioning (p = 0. 32 and p = 0. 58). CONCLUSIONS: The medium-term clinical and radiographic results and the complication rates were similar between the patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty by means of the posterior minimally invasive access and those with the traditional lateral access...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{performance}} {{has become a}} dominant theme in all transportation sectors. As scientific evidence for global climate change mounts, social and political pressure to reduce fuel burn and C 0 2 emissions has increased accordingly, especially in the rapidly growing aviation industry. Operational improvements offer the ability to increase the performance of any aircraft immediately, by simply changing how the aircraft is flown. Cruise phase represents the largest portion of flight, and correspondingly the largest opportunity for fuel burn reduction. This research focuses on the potential efficiency benefits {{that can be achieved}} by improving the cruise speed and altitude profiles operated by flights today. Speed and altitude are closely linked with aircraft performance, so optimizing these profiles offers significant fuel burn savings. Unlike <b>lateral</b> <b>route</b> optimization, which simply attempts to minimize the distance flown, speed and altitude changes promise to increase the efficiency of aircraft throughout the entire flight. Flight data was collected for 257 flights during one day of domestic US operations. A process was developed to calculate the cruise fuel burn of each selected flight, based on aircraft performance data obtained from Piano-X and atmospheric data from. NOAA. Improved speed and altitude profiles were then generated for each flight, representing various levels of optimization. Optimal cruise climbs and step climbs of 1, 000 and 2, 000 ft were analyzed, along with optimal and LRC speed profiles. Results showed that a maximum fuel burn reduction of 3. 5 % is possible in cruise given complete altitude and speed optimization; this represents 2. 6 % fuel reduction system-wide, corresponding to 300 billion gallons of jet fuel and 3. 2 million tons of CO₂ saved annually. Flights showed a larger potential to improve speed performance, with nearly 2. 4 % savings possible from speed optimization compared to 1. 5 % for altitude optimization. Few barriers exist to some of the strategies such as step climbs and lower speeds, making them attractive in the near term. As barriers are minimized, speed and altitude trajectory enhancements promise to improve the environmental performance of the aviation industry with relative ease. by Jonathan A. Lovegren. Thesis: S.

40|$|Pre-Islamic history {{directly}} {{revolved around}} two main political and economical powers, namely the Byzantine Empire covering Europe, Africa, West Asia, and the Persian Empire in Asia. Since {{the beginning of}} the seventh and during the eighth centuries, the newly forming Muslim state became the inheritor of both these empires. From the Byzantine Empire, the Arabs gained their colonies in Asia, except Asia Minor; in the west they spread all of North Africa then expanded to Spain. It took them about a century to consolidate there, since they were the least adapted of all peoples to the building of an empire. Only occasionally Latin and Greek was replaced by the Arabic language in the main cities. New centres of urbanization were established in places which previously had started as military camps. The Arabs had always been builders. When their state took over the rule of a large tract of land, they founded many centres to control the land, rivers, routes and main strategic points. It is worth noting here that the Arabs used established numerous towns, mostly inland, but rarely far away from the sea coast; cf. for instance Al-Kūfa, Al-Fusṭāṭ or Al-Qayrawān. Many of these centres were located on <b>lateral</b> trade <b>routes,</b> which, in the course of time, became large, populous towns and gained great importance due to their location. It could be said that during that time commercial factors to a large extent motivated the foundation of many states and cities. Maciej Klimiu...|$|R
50|$|From {{its initial}} {{beginning}} up {{until it had}} to file for bankruptcy protection and reorganization in 2001, the company had developed many long-haul fiber optic routes, primarily along numerous railroad rights of way, consisting of both dark fiber and lit fiber. These long-haul routes included Chicago to New Orleans, Chicago to Denver, Chicago to Detroit, Chicago to New York, Seattle to Los Angeles, Denver to San Francisco, and many others. Other route construction was occurring in Canada, Europe, and in South America, along with the laying of submarine cables to link the continents. There were many other routes in progress and planned when the company succumbed to the telecom industry collapse. The final long-haul route the company developed, post petition, was a joint project with Time Warner Telecom between Sacramento and Ontario, California, with a long-haul <b>lateral</b> extending this <b>route</b> to the San Francisco Bay Area, which was completed in early 2002.|$|R
50|$|Citing its obsolescence, expense, {{and high}} worker {{absentee}} rate, GM announced on November 6, 1986, that the Norwood Assembly Plant would be closed along with ten other GM facilities. The plant produced its last vehicle on August 26, 1987, a Chevrolet Camaro. That date {{came to be}} known in Norwood as Black Wednesday. At the time of its closing the plant employed approximately 4,200 workers. Most of the plant was demolished in 1989. The main factory building sat vacant for nearly 10 years. The City of Norwood, having relied on the carmaker for nearly 35 percent of its taxbase, faced economic catastrophe and possible bankruptcy. The City wished to re-develop the site due to its unique and attractive location - at the juncture of Ohio State <b>Route</b> 562 (Norwood <b>Lateral</b> Expressway), U.S. <b>Route</b> 22 (Montgomery Road/Ohio State Route 3) and Ohio State Route 561 (Smith Road). Easily accessible from all directions, Norwood saw an opportunity to revitalize itself. Norwood approached GM about demolishing the plant. Initially the carmaker refused.|$|R
