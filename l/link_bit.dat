40|$|When {{transmitting}} signals one of {{the most}} important issue is to keep the transmission error as low as possible and to obtain reliable transmission <b>link</b> <b>bit</b> BER should be kept limit. If SNR is high BER should be low. In this paper, a method for wireless image transmission is proposed. Low Bit Error Rate Systems are more efficient for image transmission so this system focus on bit rates for efficient data transmission. Based on wavelet decomposition theory, an image source can be decomposed into different weight levels. Then, the bit streams with different weight are modulated by FH-OFDM system, which can give low frequency bits more protection with help of hop frequency graphic design in FH-OFDM. A joint system combined with source coding and adaptive modulation method is introduced to give the image bit streams with different subcarriers, which eliminate ISI in low frequency streams more effectively. Comparatively there is another method used for progressive image transmission over coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system with Low Density Parity Check Coding (LDPC). It is used to compansate the introduced error i. e. it improves the Low bit error rate, ability and transmission efficiency for progressive image transmission over Additive White Gaussian Noise (A WGN) channel. Therefore, a better reconstruction image can be obtained at receiver with low bit error rate. Simulation results indicate that, Low Bit Error Rate is more efficient for image transmissio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Combining the {{existing}} approaches for optical intelligence {{and the speed}} and capacity of light is undoubt-edly the only viable strategy for building future-proof, high-speed networks. Future optical networks are also expected to provide added value through service quality. However, the performance parameters included in current service level agreements (SLA) require the termination of a channel (wavelength) at an optical-electrical (O/E) conversion point to measure them. In all-optical networks, this is associated with higher cost. Therefore, the optimal monitoring solution for all-optical networks will be one that implements the minimum amount of O/E conversions required to measure or estimate the SLA parameters. This is very challenging due to the complex relations of electrical and optical parameters. Taking the bit error rate (BER) as the key performance parameter to quantify the reliability of a transmission system, this paper discusses the applicability of in-service BER estimation strategies used in current (opaque) optical networks to an all-optical framework. From this discussion, it is derived that <b>link</b> <b>bit</b> error checks are not cost-effective in an all-optical network. Then, we compare different alterna-tives for low-cost, real-time BER estimation with different levels of O/E conversions and apply the least intrusive of them to a use case consisting of an all-optical networking laboratory testbed. Through this example, we show that the combination non-intrusive monitoring of OSNR and packet statistics results in a viable estimation of the BER and at also provides additional, valuable information of packet metrics.

This communication technology is expected to play {{a prominent role in}} investigating climate changes, prediction of natural disasters, discovery of natural resources, marine biology in lake, sea, and ocean environment. Though acoustic modems have long been the default wireless communication method for under water applications due to their long range, the need for high speed communication has prompted the exploration of non-acoustic methods that `have previously been overlooked due to their distance limitations. Optical wireless communication has been proposed as the best alternative in order to overcome the limitations in acoustic underwater communication. In this paper we have presented three scenarios regarding underwater optical wireless communication. They are a) Line of sight (LOS) b) Modulating Retro Reflector link c) Reflective link.

To compute background noise, only the distance from the receiver to the noise source(s) must be entered. This determines whether or not the whole object is in the field-of-view. The program assumes that each object is a blackbody (at 5900 K) with an overall visible magnitude scaled to match the tabulated data. Also provided is a table of 19 bright stars.
