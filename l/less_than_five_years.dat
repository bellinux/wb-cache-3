However, empirical data on the effectiveness of lowland bamboo based homestead agroforestry system in rescuing woody species diversity are lacking. The study was assessed the woody species diversity, density and composition of O. abyssinica based homestead agroforestry systems in Serako, Tselemti district. Data were collected from a total of ninety nine farms and plots with 10 m* 10 m area, ninety from <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>year,</b> <b>five</b> to ten <b>years</b> and greater than ten years domestication of O. abyssinica based homesteads and one exclosure with nine plots as comparison were taken. The study revealed that species density, richness and diversity were significantly higher in the exclosure than in the three homesteads (p< 0. 000). The study showed that a total of 48 tree species in 25 families and 24 tree species in 11 families for the homestead agroforestry systems and exclosure respectively were recorded. Following the age gradient, {{there was a significant difference}} in density, richness and diversity between greater <b>than</b> ten and <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>year</b> domesticated O. abyssinica homestead agroforestry systems (p< 0. 000).

40|$|This work investigates {{nutritional}} status of children <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>year</b> old suffering anemia and night blindness in Khartoum State with particular emphasis to three central children hospitals in Khartoum, Khartoum north and Omdurman. The {{sample size was}} 138 children determined by 10 % rate of prevalence of nutritional deficiency diseases among children living in Khartoum State, and distributed proportionally according {{to the number of}} children suffering these two diseases in each hospital. In addition, hemoglobin and anthropometric measurements were done. Results depict that, physical symptoms of anemia are loss of appetite (87. 7 %), paleness (93. 5 %), exhaust, and eating clay (29 %), while for night blindness they were xerophthalmia (20 %); Pinot spots (52 %); karatomalacia (12 %), and Cornea ulceration (4 %). Acute malnutrition constituted 63 % of cases of children suffering anemia and night blindness. Children suffering anemia and night blindness distributed among different age groups have very low percent of hemoglobin concentration below 60 % standard, confirming for prevalence of Iron deficiency anemia. Malnutrition was highest among children aged 1 - 3 year old, and females are less malnourished compared to males. There was low energy (calories), Iron and Vitamin A levels of intake among these children. Some recommendations were suggested to reduce anemia and night blindness among children in Khartoum State...|$|R

40|$|Background: India has {{achieved}} remarkable economic progress in {{last couple of}} decades but the fruit of progress has failed to assure the better nutritional status to our children. The child nutritional situation remains grim {{for most of the}} states, especially in the tribal region. This paper is an attempt to measure the extent of under nutrition in terms of Height/Length-for-age (stunting), Weight-for-height/Length (wasting), and Weight-for-age (underweight) for children <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>year</b> old in predominantly tribal block Jhadol of district Udaipur, Rajasthan, India.   Methods: World Health Organization (WHO) child growth standard has been used as reference population to measure the percentage prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight from its median. Total of 1286 children (623 male and 663 female) have been considered for this study. WHO Anthro software has been used for analysis and interpretation of results. Results: The results showing the severe undernourishment among the children in this part of Rajasthan. 63 % children are moderate to severely stunted (short for age), 46 % has been found out to acutely malnourished and the composite index weight-for-age showing that 69 % children is moderate to severely underweight. Against the popular facts that girls are more malnourished, boys of Jhadol block reported to be more undernourished. Conclusion: The high prevalence of chronic malnourishment in this part of Rajasthan is a matter of grave concern. This paper calls for a region specific policy based on holistic approach of better healthcare, ensuring food security, access to drinking water, sanitation. </p...|$|R
