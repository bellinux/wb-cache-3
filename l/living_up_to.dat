5|$|Estimates of lifespans {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These {{estimates}} {{depart from the}} findings of a 2005 study, which pegged the mean age of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 75 years and female orcas <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 80 years.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the UK breed survey {{reported}} an average lifespan for the Labrador Retriever of 12 years and 3 months, with some <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 19 years of age. Labrador pups generally are not {{brought to the}} home before they are 8 weeks old.|$|E

50|$|Church ministers {{were confronted}} with a stark choice: accept the new {{situation}} or lose their <b>livings.</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> {{a third of the}} ministry refused. Many ministers chose voluntarily to abandon their own parishes rather than wait to be forced out by the government. Most of the vacancies occurred in the south-west of Scotland, an area particularly strong in its Covenanting sympathies. Some of the ministers also took to preaching in the open fields in conventicles, often attracting thousands of worshippers.|$|R
5|$|<b>Living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her nicknames, young Anastasia {{grew into}} a vivacious and {{energetic}} child, described as short and inclined to be chubby, with blue eyes and strawberry-blonde hair. Margaretta Eagar, a governess to the four grand duchesses, said one person commented that the toddler Anastasia had the greatest personal charm of any child she had ever seen.|$|E
5|$|North American river otters live {{an average}} of 21 years of age in captivity, but they can reach 25 years of age. However, they {{normally}} live about 8 to 9 years in the wild, but are capable of <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 13 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mainly positive reviews. It {{was praised}} for its graphics, animation, music and unusual wall-climbing mechanics, {{as well as}} <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the name of the}} series. However, it received criticism for its tedious and repetitive gameplay and low difficulty. Fifteen years after its release, Game Informer listed Ghost in the Shell {{as one of the best}} manga and anime-based games.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the first}} Broken Sword game, which {{garnered}} critical acclaim, The Smoking Mirror received mixed to positive reviews, mostly for not <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> its predecessor. Nevertheless, {{it was a}} commercial success, selling about one million copies in the mid-1990s. Revolution released a remastered version {{of the game in}} 2010, which unlike the original version, received highly favorable reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|First {{announced}} at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, the episode was written by Artie Johann and Shawn Ries, and directed by Brian Iles. The episode received mixed reviews, praising its structure and humor, but criticizing it for not <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 1967 drama film Cool Hand Luke, which the episode was named after. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 7.14 million people in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Ralph Garman, Bob Gunton, Sanaa Lathan, Julius Sharpe, and Jennifer Tilly, along with several recurring guest voice actors from the series.|$|E

50|$|Lupinus arboreus is an {{evergreen}} shrub {{growing to}} 2 m tall (hence the alternative common name, tree lupine) in sheltered situations, but more typically 1 - 1.5 m tall. It {{is capable of}} tolerating temperatures down to -12 °C and <b>living</b> for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> seven years.|$|R
5|$|In {{the street}} outside the theatre a street {{carnival}} took place. <b>Living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the moniker for the theater's marquee, “the Magic Sign of a Wonderful Time,” spotlights scanned the night sky, banks of Klieg lights illuminated the streets outside the theater, and flares were shot from the roofs of nearby buildings. Additionally, dance bands were placed at the closed intersections to provide entertainment and, using giant screens to project the words, a sing-along was orchestrated on Fifth Avenue {{in front of the}} theatre. An estimated crowd of between 50,000 and 100,000 people participated in the events.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{are among}} the most {{successful}} groups of insects on Earth, colonising most landmasses except for Antarctica. Their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals. Termite queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world, with some queens reportedly <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30 to 50 years. Unlike ants, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, each individual termite goes through an incomplete metamorphosis that proceeds through egg, nymph, and adult stages. Colonies are described as superorganisms because the termites form part of a self-regulating entity: the colony itself.|$|E
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E

25|$|A.L. Basham, {{citing the}} Buddhist Samaññaphala Sutta, {{suggests}} six schools of heterodox, pre-Buddhist and pre-Jain, atheistic Indian traditions in 6th century BCE, that included Charvakas and Ajivikas. Charvaka was a <b>living</b> philosophy <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 12th century in India's historical timeline, after which this system {{seems to have}} disappeared without leaving any trace.|$|R
50|$|Although {{they have}} {{excellent}} senses of smell and hearing, they have poor vision, {{being unable to}} see objects more than about 3 m away, making them vulnerable to death by road traffic. They are short-lived; their lifespan in the wild can reach seven years, with most <b>living</b> only <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a year. In captivity, they may live for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10 years.|$|R
5|$|Glenn {{remained}} {{an officer in}} the Marine Corps after his selection, but was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. A portion of the astronauts' training was in space science, but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving and work in simulators. Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialisation was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs. He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life magazine, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.|$|E
5|$|The rolls {{were all}} of roughly the same length, about 5.5m (15ft), and would most likely have been {{presented}} side by side for display on a table or hung on a wall. The {{focal point of the}} whole composition is in the second, middle roll where the exceptionally well-executed painting of the Galley Subtle is placed. That this ship was intended to be the centrepiece illustration is made clear by the presence of the pinnace Mary James in the first roll, which is otherwise reserved for (sailing) ships. This appears to have originally been placed {{at the beginning of the}} third roll, among the other pinnaces and rowbarges, but was moved to achieve more equal lengths. In his pursuit of <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the image of a Renaissance prince Henry is known to have been particularly fond of galleys, something which would have been known to Anthony.|$|E
5|$|Watts' {{performances}} in the championships saw him recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 AFL draft at seventeen years of age, a year younger than most of his fellow draftees. The hype surrounding Watts {{in his first season}} was profound until he made his debut in the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood in the 2009 season. The management of his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club because he was played despite being unready for senior football. Instead, Watts was used as a promotional tool {{to create a sense of}} hope for long-suffering fans. Criticism has followed Watts closely throughout his career due to the expectations that were placed on him being the number one draft pick and many believing he was not <b>living</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his potential.|$|E

50|$|Club naiads prefer clean, {{loose sand}} and gravel in medium to small rivers and streams, burying {{themselves}} in the bottom substrate <b>to</b> depths of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> four inches. Once settled in, club naiads are long-lived, <b>living</b> possibly <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 50 years. Club naiads are endangered, most likely because of agricultural run-off, industrial waste, {{and the proliferation of}} the exotic invasive species the zebra mussel.|$|R

40|$|Aristotle's Parva Naturalia {{culminates in}} {{definitions}} of the stages of the life cycle, from the generation of a new <b>living</b> thing <b>up</b> <b>to</b> death. Aristotle thinks of living things as food burners: they nourish themselves, and so, in some cases, possess the capacity for higher living functions such as perceiving. Their burning must be balanced, {{if it is to}} continue - and one way they do this is through breathing. Nonetheless, all such burning naturally develops and declines, thus describing the life span of the being concerned. This book provides a detailed reading {{of the end of the}} Parva Naturalia ("On the Length and Shortness of Life", "On Youth, Old Age, Life and Death", including "On Breathing"), and shows how the investigation into life begun in the De Anima is completed in the Parva Naturalia, culminating in {{definitions of the}} stages of the life cycle, from generation of a new <b>living</b> thing <b>up</b> <b>to</b> death, using the activity of nutrition...|$|R
50|$|Fulmars superficially {{resemble}} gulls, but {{are readily}} distinguished by their flight on stiff wings, and their tube noses. They breed on cliffs, laying one or rarely two eggs on a ledge of bare rock or on a grassy cliff. Outside the breeding season, they are pelagic, feeding on fish, squid and shrimp {{in the open}} ocean. They are long-lived for birds, <b>living</b> for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40 years.|$|R
