5|$|The Chief Minister {{is elected}} by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers {{alongside}} him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet. Whereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor, the <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> been able to gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly, and were in government for just over eight of the Assembly's 25-year history, mostly {{during a period of}} six and half years from 1995 and 2001, when Labor won power. At the 2004 election the Australian Labor Party, headed by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, won nine of the 17 seats and formed the ACT's first majority government, but after the 2008 election was forced into minority government {{with the support of the}} Greens. Since the 2012 elections, the ACT has been governed by a coalition of Labor and the Greens.|$|E

This {{was the first}} time the <b>Liberals</b> <b>had</b> formed government in Nova Scotia since 1999, and their first majority government victory since the 1993 election. From mid 2012, the <b>Liberals</b> <b>had</b> led every public poll and entered the campaign with a 20-point lead over the New Democratic Party (NDP).|$|R
25|$|Ontario {{is led by}} the {{majority}} government of Premier Kathleen Wynne, a Liberal. Since gaining power under former Premier Dalton McGuinty in 2003, the Ontario <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> been re-elected three times: in the 2007, the 2011, and 2014 general elections.|$|E
25|$|Later {{waves of}} modern liberal thought and {{struggle}} were {{strongly influenced by}} the need to expand civil rights. <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> advocated for gender equality and racial equality, and a global social movement for civil rights in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals.|$|E
25|$|Both {{federal and}} provincial {{politics}} in the city tend {{to be dominated by}} the Liberal and New Democratic parties.

50|$|She was Liberal {{candidate}} for the Carlisle division of Cumberland at the 1935 General Election. She had some link with the area as the Bliss family had lived in Cumberland. However, a <b>Liberal</b> <b>had</b> not won Carlisle since 1918 and no <b>Liberal</b> <b>had</b> fought the seat at the previous election in 1931. This {{was not a good}} omen and she came a poor third.|$|R

The <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> won this riding six times, and the Progressive Conservatives six, while the Alberta Reform Movement was represented very briefly.|$|E
25|$|Liberalism is {{frequently}} {{cited as the}} dominant ideology of modern times. Politically, <b>liberals</b> <b>have</b> organised extensively throughout the world. Liberal parties, think tanks, and other institutions are common in many nations, although they advocate for different causes based on their ideological orientation. Liberal parties can be centre-left, centrist, or centre-right depending on their location.|$|E
25|$|Victorian voters elect 49 {{representatives to}} the Parliament of Australia, {{including}} 37 {{members of the}} House of Representatives and 12 members of the Senate. Since 2013, the ALP has held 19 Victorian house seats, the Liberals 14, the Nationals two, the Greens one, and one held by an Independent. As of 1 July 2014, the <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> held three senate seats, the Nationals one, the ALP four, the Greens two, and the Democratic Labor Party one.|$|E
50|$|The {{specificity}} of the Red Book {{came back to}} haunt the Liberals, however, {{and much of the}} next few years were spent defending broken promises. The most notable of these was the Goods and Services Tax, which the <b>Liberals</b> <b>had</b> promised to replace but did not. Critics also said that the <b>Liberals</b> <b>had</b> broken their promises to increase the power of individual Members of Parliament and introduce a national childcare program.|$|R

50|$|Macfadyen was First Secretary of the Council for Higher Education in North Staffordshire. He was {{a member}} of Hanley County Borough Education Committee. He was Chairman of the League of Nations Union, Letchworth Branch. He was Liberal {{candidate}} for the Hitchin division of Hertfordshire at the 1923 General Election. This was a safe Unionist seat that no <b>Liberal</b> <b>had</b> won since 1906. In fact no <b>Liberal</b> <b>had</b> even run since 1911. It was however his local constituency. He did manage to capture nearly a quarter of the vote and nearly out-polled the socialist who had come second in 1922. In the 1924 General Election he again fought Hitchin, but in a bad year for the Liberals, his vote dropped. He was Liberal candidate for the Reading division of Berkshire at the 1929 General Election. No <b>Liberal</b> candidate <b>had</b> stood at the previous election and the last Liberal to contest the division came a poor third in 1923. The <b>Liberals</b> <b>had</b> not won reading since 1910 so this was not fertile territory. He finished third, matching the vote share of the 1923 Liberal candidate. He did not contest the 1931 General Election. He returned to the political fray as Liberal candidate in the Cambridge by-election, 1934. No <b>Liberal</b> <b>had</b> stood in 1931 and the last Liberal candidate in 1929 polled 25%, finishing third. The <b>Liberals</b> <b>had</b> not won Cambridge since 1906, so there could not have been much optimism about his prospects. He finished a poor third, polling just 7%. He did not contest the 1935 General Election.|$|R
25|$|During {{his second}} reading speech, then-Premier of Tasmania David Bartlett said the take-up rates were 'a good early result'; however, {{he said it}} was 'important to {{increase}} the participation rate'. In his closing remarks, Bartlett said ' NBN in Tasmania is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create jobs and contribute to a new economic direction'. In her second reading speech on behalf of the Tasmanian Opposition, Elise Archer said 'the NBN is an important infrastructure', but that 'the State <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> some concern that the NBN business model seems to rely more and more on eliminating competition and other technologies'.|$|E
25|$|The ongoing {{involvement}} of the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan may also influence voters. Desmond Morton, {{a political science professor}} at McGill University suggested that the Conservatives could be blamed for the war because they have extended the mission twice, despite the fact that it was then Liberal Leader Jean Chrétien who was Canada's prime minister when Canada's current military involvement in Afghanistan first started in 2001. Both the Conservatives and <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> at various times agreed to extend the mission(s) to at least 2011, so this may result in some Canadians who are strongly against Canada's ongoing involvement, who might have otherwise typically voted either Liberal or Conservative in the past, to take their votes elsewhere in 2008.|$|E
25|$|These {{sweeping}} changes in political authority marked the modern transition from absolutism to constitutional rule. The expansion {{and promotion of}} free markets was another major liberal achievement. However, before they could establish markets liberals had to destroy the old economic structures of the world. In that vein, liberals ended mercantilist policies, royal monopolies and various other restraints on economic activities. They also sought to abolish internal barriers to trade – eliminating guilds, local tariffs, the Commons and prohibitions {{on the sale of}} land along the way. Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand civil rights. <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> advocated gender equality and racial equality in their drive to promote civil rights and a global civil rights movement in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals.|$|E

25|$|June 15, 2005 - Paul Martin's {{minority}} government survives {{no fewer}} than 16 confidence votes in the House of Commons. A defeat on any {{of them would have}} forced an election. But in the end, there was no repeat of the single-vote squeaker win of May 19. The closest vote passed 153 to 149; Gurmant Grewal is on stress leave over the tape scandal, two other conservative MPs are sick with cancer, and Thibault from the BQ is away due to the passing away of her father. As well, a series of public opinion polls released just days earlier all showed the Liberals in the lead, one of them released just a week ago showing the <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> a 14% lead over the Tories. The Tories seem themselves to not be wanting an election now, either.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{previous}} liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole {{in which all}} individuals {{have a duty to}} promote the common good. His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and John A. Hobson. In a few years, this New Liberalism had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain, and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, <b>liberals</b> <b>have</b> tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand suffrage rights, liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the democratic decision-making process were liable to the tyranny of the majority, a concept explained in Mill's On Liberty and in Democracy in America (1835) by Alexis de Tocqueville. As a response, liberals began demanding proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the rights of minorities.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, the Liberal Party {{lost its}} {{influence}} in the early 20th century due {{to the growth of}} the Labour Party. In Russia, liberalism was defeated when the Communists came to power under Vladimir Lenin in October 1917, in Italy when Mussolini set up his dictatorship in 1922, in Poland in 1926 under Józef Piłsudski, and in Spain in 1939 after the Spanish Civil War. Before World War I, liberal parties dominated the European political scene, but they were gradually displaced by socialists and social democrats in the early 20th century. The fortunes of liberal parties since World War II have been mixed, with some gaining strength while others suffered from continuous declines. The fall of the Soviet Union and the breakup of Yugoslavia {{at the end of the}} 20th century, however, allowed the formation of many liberal parties throughout Eastern Europe. These parties developed varying ideological characters. Some, such as the Slovenian Liberal Democrats or the Lithuanian Social <b>Liberals,</b> <b>have</b> been characterised as centre-left. Others, such as the Romanian National Liberal Party, have been classified as centre-right.|$|E

25|$|In some {{countries}} the radical tendency is {{a variant of}} liberalism. Sometimes it is less doctrinaire and more moderate; other times it is more extreme. In Victorian era Britain the Radicals {{were part of the}} Liberal coalition, but often rebelled when the more traditional Whigs in that coalition resisted democratic reforms. In other countries, these left-wing <b>liberals</b> <b>have</b> formed their own radical parties with various names, e.g. in Switzerland and Germany (Freisinn), Bulgaria, Denmark, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands but also Argentina (Radical Civic Union), Chile and Paraguay. This does not mean that all radical parties were formed by left-wing liberals. In the French political literature it is normal to make a clear separation between liberalism and radicalism in France. In Serbia both radicalism and liberalism have had their distinctiveness during the 19th century, with the Radical Party being the dominant political party throughout the entire multi-parliamentary period before the unification of Yugoslavia. It had cracked in 1903 when the Independent Radical Party had left, leaving the old People's Radical Party straying far from liberalism and into right-wing nationalism and conservatism. The Independents had created the Democratic Party, whereas the Radicals of today are a far-right political group.|$|E
500|$|Disraeli's {{government}} also {{introduced a new}} Factory Act meant to protect workers, the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875, which allowed peaceful picketing, and the Employers and Workmen Act (1875) to enable workers to sue employers in the civil courts if they broke legal contracts. As {{a result of these}} social reforms the Liberal-Labour MP Alexander Macdonald told his constituents in 1879, [...] "The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> in fifty." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{unexpected}} {{defeat of}} the Liberals was ascribed to various causes. The Ottawa Citizen stated that the defeat {{could be attributed to}} [...] "the uneasy talk... that the <b>Liberals</b> <b>have</b> been in too long." [...] Tom Kent of the Winnipeg Free Press, a future Liberal deputy minister, wrote that though the Liberal record had been the best in the democratic world, the party had failed miserably to explain it. Author and political scientist H.S. Ferns disagreed with Kent, stating that Kent's view reflected the Liberal [...] "assumption that 'Nobody's going to shoot Santa Claus and that Canadians in the 1957 election were motivated by things other than material interests. Peter Regenstreif cited the Progressive Conservative strategy in the 1957 and 1958 elections [...] "as classics of ingenuity unequalled in Canadian political history. Much of the credit belongs to Diefenbaker himself; at least some must go to Allister Grosart". A survey taken of those who abandoned the Liberals in 1957 showed that 5.1% did so because of Suez, 38.2% because of the Pipeline Debate, 26.7% because of what they considered an inadequate increase in the old age pension, and 30% because {{it was time for a}} change.|$|E
