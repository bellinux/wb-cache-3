50|$|In 1853, on Sterndale Bennett's recommendation, Bache {{continued}} his musical education at Leipzig. He studied there with Moritz Hauptmann, acquiring the then-conventional prejudices against {{the music of}} Berlioz, <b>Liszt</b> and <b>Wagner.</b> (This would be {{in sharp contrast to}} his brother Walter, who would become a staunch champion of <b>Liszt</b> and <b>Wagner's</b> music.) After visiting Dresden, he returned to London by way of Paris in February 1855. He attended the 1855 Birmingham Festival and reviewed it for some of the local newspapers.

500|$|Liszt {{composed}} his symphonic poems {{during a}} period of great debate among musicians in central Europe and Germany, known as the War of the Romantics. While Beethoven's work was admired universally, conservatives that included Johannes Brahms and members of the Leipzig Conservatory considered it unsurpassable. Liberals such as <b>Liszt,</b> <b>Wagner</b> and others of the New German School saw Beethoven's innovations as a beginning in music, not an end. In this climate, Liszt had emerged as a lightning-rod for the avant-garde. Even with the innovative music being written by Wagner and Berlioz, it was Liszt, Walker says, [...] "who was making all the noise and attracting the most attention" [...] through his musical compositions, polemic writings, conducting and teaching.|$|R

5000|$|Beck was {{selected}} to create the title role in Richard Wagner's opera Lohengrin in 1850, a production directed by Franz <b>Liszt.</b> <b>Wagner</b> had written the Act III tenor monologue In fernem land (the [...] "Grail Narration") in two parts, however, he asked Liszt to cut the second part from the premiere performance, as he felt Beck could not do it justice and it would result in an anticlimax. That unfortunate circumstance established the tradition of performing only {{the first part of}} the Narration. [...] In fact, the first time the second part was ever sung at the Bayreuth Festival was by Franz Völker during the lavish 1936 production, which Adolf Hitler personally ordered and took a close interest in, to demonstrate what a connoisseur of Wagner he was.|$|R

500|$|Mahler was a [...] "late Romantic," [...] part of {{an ideal}} that placed Austro-German {{classical}} music on a higher plane than other types, through its supposed possession of particular spiritual and philosophical significance. He {{was one of the}} last major composers of a line which includes, among others, Beethoven, Schubert, <b>Liszt,</b> <b>Wagner,</b> Bruckner and Brahms. From these antecedents Mahler drew many of the features that were to characterise his music. Thus, from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony came the idea of using soloists and a choir within the symphonic genre. From Beethoven, Liszt and (from a different musical tradition) Berlioz came the concept of writing music with an inherent narrative or [...] "programme," [...] and of breaking away from the traditional four-movement symphony format. The examples of Wagner and Bruckner encouraged Mahler to extend the scale of his symphonic works well beyond the previously accepted standards, to embrace an entire world of feeling.|$|R
5000|$|... "Music of the Future" [...] (Zukunftsmusik) is {{the title}} of an essay by Richard Wagner, first {{published}} in French translation in 1860 as [...] "La musique de l'avenir" [...] and published in the original German in 1861. It was intended to introduce the librettos of Wagner's operas to a French audience {{at the time when}} he was hoping to launch in Paris a production of Tannhäuser, and sets out a number of his desiderata for true opera, including the need for 'endless melody'. Wagner deliberately put the title in inverted commas to distance himself from the term; Zukunftsmusik had already been adopted, both by Wagner's enemies, in the 1850s, often as a deliberate misunderstanding of the ideas set out in Wagner's 1849 essay, The Artwork of the Future, and by his supporters, notably Franz <b>Liszt.</b> <b>Wagner's</b> essay seeks to explain why the term is inadequate, or inappropriate, for his approach.|$|R

50|$|The next work, his epic closet drama Faust, {{was to be}} {{completed}} in stages, and only published in its entirety after his death. The first part was published in 1808 and created a sensation. The first operatic version, by Louis Spohr, appeared in 1814, and was subsequently the inspiration for operas and oratorios by Schumann, Berlioz, Gounod, Boito, Busoni, and Schnittke as well as symphonic works by <b>Liszt,</b> <b>Wagner,</b> and Mahler. Faust became the myth of many figures in the 19th century. Later, a facet of its plot, i.e., of selling one's soul to the devil for power over the physical world, took on increasing literary importance and became a view of the victory of technology and of industrialism, along with its dubious human expenses. In 1919, the Goetheanum staged the world premiere of a complete production of Faust. On occasion, the play is still staged in Germany and other parts around the world.|$|R

50|$|Johanna studied several roles {{with her}} uncle, {{especially}} Irene in Rienzi, and as her {{family moved to}} the city they became part of Richard <b>Wagner's</b> <b>circle</b> there. As he was now composing Tannhäuser, following his new musical conceptions, Johanna and Tichatschek sang the music of Elisabeth and Tannhäuser for him as it evolved. He had intended to premiere the opera to mark her 17th birthday, 13 October 1845, but she was ill, which forced its postponement for six days. The first performance, on 19 October, a six-hour staging beside Devrient as Venus, and with Dettmer and Mitterwurzer, {{was followed by a}} shortened version, with altogether eight repeats by the following January.|$|R

500|$|Upon {{completing}} his piano studies in December 1861, the 19-year-old Bache travelled to Italy, staying in Milan and Florence {{with the intent}} of soaking in Italian culture before returning to England. In Florence he met Jessie Laussot, [...] "who had founded of a flourishing musical society in the city ... and was intimately acquainted with <b>Liszt,</b> <b>Wagner,</b> Hans von Bülow and other leading musicians." [...] While Laussot remained kindly disposed towards Bache, she also quickly summed up his overly easy-going character and decided to help him. She encouraged him to teach harmony as well as piano, then arranged a harmony class that met early in the morning some ways out of town so that he would not oversleep. She eased his way into polite society and also suggested, after hearing him play at several local concerts, that he travel to Rome and seek out Liszt. However, she insisted that he do so without any introduction from her, as she wanted Liszt to judge him solely on his own merits.|$|R
50|$|Manoly {{originally}} came to Vienna {{as a boy}} soprano, who had {{an exceptional}} voice in choral music. Upon arriving in Vienna {{at the age of}} fifteen, he found his voice changing and unable to audition at the Conservatory. However, there was a scholarship to study the double bass which he took up. At the Vienna Conservatory, he studied double bass with Franz Simandl; harmony, counterpoint, and composition with Anton Bruckner; and conducting with Joseph Hellmesberger. Graduating in 1876, he moved to the United States where he performed with the Theodore Thomas Orchestra, the Mendelssohn Quintette Club of Boston, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He joined the Philharmonic Society of New York and the Philharmonic Club, which later turned into the New York Philharmonic in 1880, eventually becoming principal bass of the ensemble in 1892, and later performed with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Through his life, he came in contact with such individuals as Brahms, <b>Liszt,</b> <b>Wagner,</b> Saint-Saëns, Tchaikovsky, Anton Rubinstein, Bruckner, Richard Strauss, Mahler, Max Bruch, Carl Goldmark, Verdi, Jacques Offenbach, Johann Strauss, and Eduard Strauss.|$|R
5000|$|Schenker {{intended}} {{his theory}} to {{apply only to}} music of the common practice period, and there to a select class of mostly Austro-German composers in a line from J.S. Bach to Johannes Brahms. Developments in more recent music theory have sought to clarify {{the conditions under which}} prolongation may obtain, so that other repertoires may either be opened up or more justifiably be precluded. Schenker pupil Felix Salzer, for example, detects the rudiments of prolongational horizontalization in music as early as 12th Century plainchant, and argues that it is a musical principle that persists through post-tonal music as well, such as Paul Hindemith and Igor Stravinsky. Music theorist Robert Morgan has argued that a central tenet of Schenkerian thought—that only consonant triads are capable of prolongation—needlessly excludes a class of dissonant sonorities, such as diminished sevenths or a more arbitrarily defined set of pitches; Morgan claims that starting in the 19th Century, composers such as <b>Liszt,</b> <b>Wagner,</b> and Scriabin, began [...] "composing out" [...] these dissonant configurations as rigorous a manner as is usually ascribed to the triadic prolongation of tonal composers.|$|R
