50|$|Nevertheless, the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>Process</b> has {{provoked}} controversy as it allows some element of bypassing accountable oversight by the Council of the European Union and the elected European Parliament, thereby embodying a further {{move away from}} representative democracy towards technocracy.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>Process</b> is an {{approach}} {{to the development of}} financial service industry regulations used by the European Union. Originally developed in March 2001, the process is named after the chair of the EU advisory committee that created it, Alexandre Lamfalussy. It is composed of four [...] "levels," [...] each focusing on a specific stage of the implementation of legislation. At the first level, the European Parliament and Council of the European Union adopt a piece of legislation, establishing the core values of a law and building guidelines on its implementation. The law then progresses to the second level, where sector-specific committees and regulators advise on technical details, then bring it to a vote in front of member-state representatives. At the third level, national regulators work on coordinating new regulations with other nations. The fourth level involves compliance and enforcement of the new rules and laws.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the factors}} influencing whether a European Securities and Exchange Commission (ESEC) {{will be created}} and confirms the primary role that politics will play in its establishment. In the face of growing support for an ESEC, the paper recommends a strategy the UK should adopt towards the creation of such an institution. It is proposed that the UK adopt a three-pronged approach. First, the UK must, as it currently does, support the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>Process</b> {{in the hope that}} it works. Second, the UK must determine what criteria need to be assessed in order to evaluate whether the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>Process</b> together with the Financial Services Action Plan are in fact harming UK interests, and then make such an evaluation. Finally, if political support for an ESEC becomes unstoppable, the UK should negotiate for the creation of an appropriately structured ESEC – even though its backing for the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>Process</b> should logically preclude its support for any type of ESEC. A key attribute of the recommended strategy is thus that it is inconsistent. This is not, however, thought a problem. On the contrary, given that the creation of an ESEC is the stuff of politics and thus that a political response is called for, and given that other key participants’ policies on the creation of an ESEC are themselves inconsistent, the strategy proposed is argued as being not only constructive, but indeed rational. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process</b> was {{implemented}} from early 2001, following {{the report of}} the Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets, chaired by Alexandre Lamfalussy. Four years on, this paper concludes that, while {{it is too early to}} assess progress in areas such as implementation and enforcement (Levels 3 and 4 of the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process),</b> significant progress has been made in implementing the proposals contained in the original Lamfalussy Report. Preparation of EU legislation affecting securities markets is now more transparent, with better involvement of external stakeholders and enhanced political cooperation between all the institutions (Commission, Council and European Parliament). This has resulted in an improvement in the quality of legislation and an acceleration of the legislative process. The use of implementing measures will make it easier and faster to adapt Community legislation in the future. The process is also encouraging regulatory and supervisory convergence. Nevertheless, this paper suggests further improvements that could be made in areas such as consultation, including better involvement of consumers; timetables for transposing measures into national law; focusing more on general rules and principles in framework legislation (Level 1) and avoiding over-prescription in implementing measures (Level 2); achieving more consistent implementation across member states (Level 3); further strengthening political accountability; and strengthening efforts to foster greater understanding of the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process.</b> CESR, Commission, Council, Directive, European Parliament, European Securities Committee, Implementing measures, Lamfalussy, Legislation, Regulation, Securities...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I analyse {{the conduct}} of {{business}} rules included in the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID) which has replaced the Investment Services Directive (ISD). These rules, in addition to being part of the regulation of investment intermediaries, operate as contractual standards in the relationships between intermediaries and their clients. While the need to harmonise similar rules is generally acknowledged, in the present paper I ask whether the Lamfalussy regulatory architecture, which governs securities lawmaking in the EU, has in some way improved regulation in this area. In section II, I examine the general aspects of the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process.</b> In section III, I critically analyse the MiFID s provisions on conduct of business obligations, best execution of transactions and client order handling, taking into account the new regime of trade internalisation by investment intermediaries and the ensuing competition between these intermediaries and market operators. In sectionIV, I draw some general conclusions on the re-regulation made under the Lamfalussy regulatory structure and its limits. In this section, I make a few preliminary comments on the relevance of {{conduct of business rules}} to contract law, the ISD rules of conduct and the role of harmonisation. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{progress}} made in the process of European integration from two points of view: regulation and supervision. We first briefly outline the main steps in the development of the Financial Services Action Plan - FSAP and the process of Comitology, defined by the Committee of Wise Men (Lamfalussy Committee). We then provide an initial evaluation of the new regulatory system, with its merits and flaws: while the definition and completion of the FSAP has been an undoubted success, some aspects still have to be dealt with, several of them with problematical connotations, considered in the Financial Services Agenda 2005 - 2010 The transposition into national regulations of a complex body of wide-ranging standards is a difficult process in terms of both times and procedures, although the functioning of the Comitology structure has been met with general approval. There is also the problem of a supervisory structure which retains its national basis, but onto which the output generated by the Committees envisaged by the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process</b> is gradually being grafted, possibly leading towards a new framework of controls at a European level. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years, {{there has been}} a {{remarkable}} advance in financial integration in the EU and especially the euro area. As evidenced by European Central Bank research, money markets are now completely integrated within the euro area, and the only significant reason why government bonds are not perfect substitutes to each-other is the persistence of specific issuer risk. A large, liquid and efficient corporate bond market has been created, whose size has more than doubled since the launch of the single currency. Public (let alone private) equity markets are still less integrated and less competitive, but changes are noticeable. Finally, after having remained sheltered for a long time, the banking sector has recently experienced a recent rise in large-scale cross-border mergers. There are certainly not only bright spots in the landscape. Some markets remain segmented, and the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process</b> for legislation and regulation is a slow and cumbersome one. According to the European Commission (2004, 2005) there is very little evidence of integration, or advance towards it, in retail services such as consumer credit, mortgage credit and insurance. In these sectors, cross-border transactions are virtually nonexistent and price divergence remains important. The picture is therefore not a uniform one...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of radical and {{far-reaching}} legal, market, and institutional reforms which followed {{the completion of the}} Financial Services Action Plan, the EC regime for securities regulation now governs Community financial markets and has almost replaced national law in this area. This long-awaited second edition of EC Securities Regulation considers the extensive new regime in its legal, institutional, political, and market context and assesses the forces which have shaped it. Far-reaching reforms have followed from the coincidence of law-making reform under the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process</b> with the regulatory reforms adopted under the Financial Services Action Plan. The new edition considers key measures, including the 2003 Prospectus Directive, the 2003 Market Abuse Directive, the 2004 Transparency Directive, the reforms to the UCITS regime,the groundbreaking 2004 Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, and the extensive developments in clearing and settlement. A new chapter addresses the treatment of gatekeepers. Detailed attention is given throughout the book to the extensive rules which apply at level 2 and to the level 3 process. New chapters have also been added on law-making and supervision, following the dramatic developments which followed the establishment of the Committee of European Securities Regulators.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{prevailing}} financial regulatory structures {{and impact of}} the current financial turmoil on banking performance in four Asian economies : the People's Republic of China (PRC); Hong Kong, China; Singapore; and Taipei,China. Both the PRC and Hong Kong, China operate under a fragmented financial regulatory structure, while Singapore and Taipei,China have integrated structures. We examine {{the role of an}} integrated financial regulatory structure in helping financial institutions mitigate the impact of the financial crisis, using financial indicators of banks capital structure and operating performance in these four economies between 2003 and 2008. Our analysis of the indicators reveals that banking performance under a fragmented financial regulatory structure is not worse than under integrated regulation. This implies that financial regulatory structure is not the main reason why Asian financial institutions suffered only limited losses from the current global financial crisis. However, given the growing complexity of the global financial system, and the relative weakness of current financial regulatory structures in Asia, this paper suggests that East Asian governments should refer to the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>Process</b> in the European Union and set up an Asia Financial Stability Dialogue to facilitate policy coordination for regional financial sector stability and development.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the remaining barriers for regulatory and market integration {{through the lens}} of two alternative approaches: the Public Interest and the Public Choice approach. The first chapter explains the problematique of this thesis, defines the core questions and sets out the related questions. It also provides background information on the internationalisation of the financial sector and discusses the latest regulatory developments occurring in Europe focusing on the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>Process</b> that governs the capital market and particularly the securities markets. It goes on to define the aim of this research and its objectives and to present the outline of the thesis and the conceptual framework employed to approach the subject. Finally, this chapter reviews the literature on the subject and clarifies the contribution of this thesis to existing knowledge. The second chapter refers to the conceptual framework used in this thesis to analyse the regulatory changes and their impact on capital market. This framework builds around the comparison of public interest and public choice models and provides a considerable body of theoretical evidence that identifies and associates rationality with both public and self-interests according to which the two models are not mutually exclusive, can co-exist and even work together. Since RCT applies to both non market and market decisions, the two models, welfare and strategic, develop on two levels: the regulatory and institutional rationality level which covers legal and regulatory decisions (in this thesis EU directives) and the market rationality level, which covers market decisions (in this thesis stock exchanges' consolidation). The third chapter constitutes the primary research and empirical work, making up the first original contribution of this thesis. This chapter is based on textual analysis of the most important directives in the area (Prospectus, Market Abuse and Investment Services), including use of press clippings, published sources, classified archives and qualitative interviews. The latter are conducted with Baron Lamfalussy and with officials of the European Commission. This chapter consists of three parts. The first part refers to the directives included in the FSAP that replaced earlier directives according to the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>Process.</b> The second part refers to the Takeover Directive, which, while not included in the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>Process</b> is included in this discussion because the market for corporate control is connected with capital market since it depends on the latter's depth and liquidity, and also because it provides evidence of the involvement of domestic interest groups and the sponsoring states in the regulatory reform. The third part compares and contrasts the evidence from the. two previous different but interdependent parts and draws some preliminary concluding remarks. The fourth chapter refers to the analysis of interview material on opinions and perceptions of market and institutional actors on the issues traced in the third chapter. These interviews are conducted with senior executives of European Associations and Federations Eu, ropean regulators, and academics. The views of Baron Lamfalussy and EC officials, collected thr ough the respective interviews, are also presented in this chapter. The fifth chapter, which constitutes the market rationality level, refers to the consolidation of European exchanges, which, as seen in the third chapter, are highly affected by the new directives since the latter intensify the competition not only b~tween exchanges but also between exchanges and alternative trading systems. This chapter makes up the second original contribution of this thesis since it investigates how far the actions of the newly commercialised exchanges comply with changes in regulation and interact with integration. The sixth chapter compares and contrasts the experience from the capital market industry with the experience from banking and civil aviation industries and shows that the chosen conceptual framework can be applied to various sectors and that the cross-sectoral comparisons of regulatory and market developments add evidence to the coexistence of public interest and public choice models. The seventh chapter draws conclusions on the regulatory and market developments expected to lead to capital market integration and reviews the remaining barriers. It also discusses the impact of these developments along with those in banking and civil aviation on the whole European integration project.

40|$|After {{a hectic}} period of law reform, which has also {{provoked}} major governance {{reforms in the}} form of significantly increased levels of transparency and market consultation and major institutional innovations (with allied accountability and governance risks), the 1999 Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) 1 has now been completed. It has radically transformed the regulatory landscape for financial services in the EC, and set a seal on the recharacterization of EC financial services law from a minimum harmonization-based market construction regime to a highly interventionist and increasingly sophisti-cated market regulation system. In particular, the coincidence of legislative reform under the FSAP with {{the development of a new}} institutional process for law-making, which has rapidly become embedded in the financial market architecture (the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process),</b> 2 produced a reform agenda of immense depth and range. The FSAP period has also seen the use and development of a wide range of regulatory tools in EC financial services policy in line with the growing sophistication of the regulatory regime. While disclosure has long been a key policy tool of EC financial services law, the FSAP saw a closer focus on conflict of interest management across the financial sector, on more interventionist controls such as transparency, suitability, and best execution requirements, and on calibrating regulation to different investor profiles and different market risks. This article considers a selection of key recent developments...|$|E
40|$|In 2000 a Committee of Wise Men {{chaired by}} Alexandre Lamfalussy, former {{president}} of the European Monetary Institute was appointed by the Economics and Finance Ministers Council to make recommendations on the regulation of the European securities markets. It proposed a four-level system to improve the legislative process while ensuring what it called a democratic and institutional balance. Our paper questions to what extent the concepts of two basic modes of delegation - agency and trust relationships - are appropriate tools to interpret the new structure set up by the Committee. It formulates hypotheses about its policy effectiveness and the balance of power between Community institutions. Evidence supports the agency hypothesis: the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process</b> has reduced the average time taken to negotiate and adopt the first framework directives at level 1 and it has facilitated the removal of bottlenecks in the process through parallel working at levels 1 and 2. In this sense, delegation has enhanced policy effectiveness in the securities sector. But it is much more difficult to assess the trustee hypothesis: that is, whether the Commission and the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) in fact act as trustees of the member states for the benefit of market actors. For the time being, whether CESR might evolve into a European securities regulator remains an open questio...|$|E
40|$|After {{almost seven}} {{years of hard work}} to produce a new {{substantive}} piece of legislation updating the current banking regulation for European credit institutions and investment firms – the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) – it looks like its timely adoption is still uncertain. The main problem is the dissatisfaction of Parliament with its limited role in the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process</b> in general and in the CRD in particular, which has led it to suspend ‘temporarily’ the comitology provisions of the CRD, casting doubt over the future ability to amend the legislation. The European Constitution addresses Parliament’s concern about ensuring democratic accountability in the comitology process in Art. 36. The pause for reflection on the Constitution prompted by the no-votes in the French and Dutch referenda has re-ignited the issue and is forcing EU institutions to seek a new inter-institutional agreement on this issue. As a result, one undesirable scenario could materialise concerning the adoption of the new Directive. Unless a formal inter-institutional agreement is reached with respect to comitology, there is a high risk that the CRD will be unduly pushed towards a second reading, which in turn puts a question mark over its timely implementation. The objectives of this Policy Brief are threefold: first, it examines the role of the European Commission in the CRD legislative process; second, it identifies the main scenarios expected in the adoption episode; and third, it offers recommendations with respect to some outstanding issues in the key provisions of the forthcoming Directive...|$|E
40|$|After the {{introduction}} of the euro in 1999, the debate on the financial stability architecture in the EU focused on the adequacy of a decentralised setting based on national responsibilities for preventing and managing crises. The Financial Services Action Plan in 1999 and {{the introduction}} of the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process</b> for financial regulation and supervision in 2001 enhanced the decentralised arrangements by increasing significantly the level of legal harmonisation and supervisory cooperation. In addition, authorities adopted EU-wide MoUs to safeguard cross-border financial stability. In this context, the financial crisis {{has proved to be a}} major challenge to the ongoing process of European financial integration. In particular, momentous events such as the freezing of interbank markets, the loss of confidence in financial institutions, runs on banks and difficulties affecting cross-border financial groups, questioned the ability of the EU financial stability architecture to contain threats to the integrated single financial market. In particular, the crisis has demonstrated the importance of coupling to micro-prudential supervision a macro dimension aimed at a broad and effective monitoring and assessment of the potential risks covering all components of the financial system. In Europe, following the de Larosière Report, the European Commission has put forward proposals for establishing a European System of Financial Supervision and a European Systemic Risk Board, the latter body to be set up under the auspices of the ECB. While the details for the implementation of these structures still need to be spelt out, they should reinforce significantly – ten years after {{the introduction of}} the euro – the financial stability architecture at the EU level...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the outset}} of the {{financial}} crisis, the EU financial markets regime has been undergoing a period of turbulence which contrasts sharply with the period of relative stability which it briefly enjoyed over 2005 – 2007 and post-FSAP (Financial Services Action Plan). The FSAP reforms had been adopted. The Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) had emerged as an influential actor, driving some degree of supervisory coordination and co-operation and constructing a significant soft law ‘rule-book. ’ And the 2007 Lamfalussy Review suggested broad political, institutional and stakeholder satisfaction with the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process.</b> There was little enthusiasm for grand adventures in institutional design, albeit that supervision, an institutionally-driven concern, was presciently if belatedly emerging as a concern of the EU institutions. The Review's main concern, however, was with strengthening the pragmatic, if somewhat haphazard, network-based, ‘supervisory convergence’ model as the means for supervising the integrating EU financial market. With respect to regulation, reflecting the wider international zeitgeist pre-crisis, ‘Better Regulation’ and the need for a ‘regulatory pause’ were the watchwords of a Commission which, once the massive FSAP regime was safely in place, espoused the benefits of self-regulation and highlighted the risks of intervention without impact assessment, extensive consultation and evidence of market failure. This was most apparent with respect to credit rating agencies, debt market transparency, hedge funds, and clearing and settlement. Institutionally, a relatively sophisticated law-making apparatus, {{in the form of the}} Lamfalussy structures, a plethora of advisory bodies and stakeholder bodies (notably FIN-NET which represents the consumer and SME interest), had been established...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – To {{describe}} the 5 th May 2006 ECOFIN conclusions on supervisory convergence {{and explain why}} they represent a new departure for European financial services work. Design/methodology/approach – The article outlines the 6 th 2006 ECOFIN conclusions relating to supervisory convergence. It then reviews EU developments relating to supervisory convergence from the 2001 <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>Process</b> onwards as context for the conclusions. Finally, {{in the light of}} the review and the description of the conclusions it draws some conclusions about the likely implications for further developments in the EU in relation to EU supervisory convergence. Findings – The principal findings are that supervisory convergence is likely to increase due to enhanced political backing with member state finance ministries and regulators taking a leading role. Research limitations/implications – As this is the first paper on the ECOFIN conclusions there is considerable scope for ongoing research to establish the extent to which the predictions in the paper prove to be justified by future developments. Practical implications – The ECOFIN conclusions represent a departure from EU financial services work focused on a legislative programme, the Financial Services Action Plan, to a programme focusing on improving cross-border relationships between supervisors. This has important implications for the key European actors and gives a strong role to national finance ministries and supervisors. The practical implications will be enhanced cooperation between national supervisors on a cross-border basis. The paper argues for strong financial services industry involvement in this. Originality/value – The value of the paper is twofold – Its primary value is as the first academic analysis of the ECOFIN conclusions and as a predictor of their likely influence on EU institutional balance in the financial services area. Secondly it is a useful review of the main developments with regard to EU supervisory convergence over the five years 2001 - 2006 – something which, to be the best of my knowledge, has not previously been carried out in the academic literature.

40|$|Global {{financial}} crisis in 2008 posted numerous {{questions about the}} reasons and triggers. In past three years world’s economic literature has been full of academic articles analysing each reason or trigger and scientific explanations of possible connections. Majority outcome was, that key factor was excessive use of derivatives and synthetic financial products, which were under regulated or not regulated at all. The outcome was that countries with developed financial markets introduced new regulations and controls {{in the field of}} derivatives and synthetic financial products. Term “systemic risk” was introduced in global financial market. But will this approach really prevent such global crisis? Submission is divided in three parts. First part deals with the theory of principle based regulation. Principle based regulation was firstly introduced in UK and latter accepted by European Union in the field of capital markets. It was a way, together with the <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process,</b> to make EU regulation acceptable for all member states. Instead of detailed prescribed behaviour, legislation texts prescribe only desirable goals. Implementation is left to each state or, even worse, to each supervised subject. So the implementation should depend on the capital market’s development, capital product’s structure, tradition, investment companies’ size etc. From a distant view, principle based legislation could be seen as a great legislation writing’s technique. It could be seen as an effective solution to regulate a fast developing field without need to change the regulation. But is it true? Second part of the submission addresses the legal questions and problems, connected to the principle based regulation starting with the validity of regulations. Broad definitions in Market in financial instruments Directive (MiFID), introduced for fast adaptation to new financial products and instruments, are now turning into dinosaurs. Contrary to US’s fast action, European Union is still discussing whether spot forex trade is financial instrument or not. On the other hand, broad and unclear definitions, represents a friendly environment for new casino’s financial products. Even recognised financial instruments (like derivatives and synthetic financial instruments) are recognised as gambling contracts by national courts within European Union. Problems with legal enforcement of financial contracts are mentioned also in common law’s literature. There are numerous pages describing the economic and financial essence of each derivative or synthetic financial instrument. But the chapters, dealing with the legal aspects, are short and end with a similar advice: “due to small number of case law and the danger, that courts could interpret such contracts as a gambling contract, we strongly advise to settle all disputes outside the court. ” In case of numerous defaults unenforceability of contracts could be the poison pill for the trust in capital markets. Accepted solutions could also be a problem for administrative or criminal sanctions. Broad and unclear definitions could violate the basic principle “nullum crimen sine lege praevia. ” And least but not last, in modern financial world sins are made in interpretations of details and not of principles. Third part of submission deals with the necessary assumptions for a workable principle based legislation. It starts with basic legal culture and generally accepted rule of law. It deals with the corporate culture, consumer’s organizations, financial markets and capable supervisors. Only when all the actors perform their expected roles, the principle based legislation could work properly...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the political}} process of the EU-directive Solvency II, {{as well as the}} amending directive of Omnibus II. Solvency II is the new regulatory regime of the European insurance industry which is to take effect on the 1 st of January 2016. The result of this implementation is that life and non-life insurers across the EU will be sharing a common regulatory framework {{for the first time in}} history. Since 2001, EU regulation in the realm of financial services has been conducted under the legislative <b>Lamfalussy</b> <b>process</b> which consists of a four level structure. The first step in the process tracing study is to give a theoretical account of this system including the ways in which it was changed following the Lisbon Treaty of 2009. The description of this process also necessitates a presentation of the relevant institutions at the EU level of which CEIOPS and EIOPA are of particular importance. Furthermore, the involvement and interests of other involved actors are presented. The interests of the Member States have varied significantly as a consequence of differences in domestic insurance markets. The non-governmental stakeholders which were involved in the process – represented by the insurance industry - are identified and accounted for as well. The Solvency II process is traced through the following six distinct phases: 1999 - 2004 Solvency II – Learning phase: Preparations for the process 2004 - 2008 Solvency II – Development phase: Consultations and expert advice 2008 - 2009 Solvency II – The political phase: Co-decision procedure and trialogue 2009 - 2011 The Financial crisis and the Lisbon Treaty: Significant external shocks 2011 - 2012 Omnibus II – Pre-trialogue process: Adaptation to the Lisbon Treaty 2012 - 2016 Omnibus II – Trialogue process: Long-term guarantee issues and trialogue The analysis of these stages is conducted from three separate perspectives, namely i) the knowledge-based perspective of epistemic communities; ii) the state-centric framework of liberal intergovernmentalism; and iii) the theory of multilevel governance. None of the frameworks applied provide a reasonable explanation for every part of the directive during all six phases. Yet, each has explanatory power for some part of the legislation during some periods of the process. As might be expected, the development phase is best explained by the knowledge based approach whereas the trialogues resemble the bargaining between nation states predicted by liberal intergovernmentalism. Furthermore, evidence to support the MLG theory is to some extent identified throughout the process, particularly due to the heavy involvement of private insurance companies as providers of expert advice and as lobbyists. The period of the Financial crisis and the Lisbon Treaty appears as a breaking point in the process after which the explanatory power of all three theories changed as follows: - Epistemic communities: EIOPA which (it is argued) resembles an epistemic community, was set up as a powerful and (semi-) independent EU agency. - Liberal intergovernmentalism: For many European Member States the financial crisis implied more pressing, and diverging, national interests which raised the stakes of {{the political process}}. Hence, the relevance of this perspective was increased. - Multilevel-Governance: following the Lisbon treaty, the European Parliament gained increased powers and EIOPA was created. Hence, the independent influence of sovereign EU actors was enhanced...|$|E
