Jeremy {{appeared on}} Chappelle's Show as {{himself in a}} spoof called [...] "What if the Internet was a real place?", in which he asks Dave Chappelle if he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of his films. Jeremy also appeared as a guest commentator on the Fox News Channel late-night news and comedy talk show Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld in 2007. In the [...] "Super Karate Monkey Death Car" [...] episode of Newsradio, Jeremy can be seen sitting in the audience at Jimmy James's reading, along with Brian Posehn. Jeremy appeared in Tosh.0 as the falling prom girl's date. Jeremy appeared on , as himself, in Bourdain's [...] "Food Porn" [...] (Season 5) and [...] "Food Porn 2" [...] (Season 6) episodes. Jeremy appeared on Silent Library in 2010. In the show, he was the [...] "Mystery Creature" [...] that was concealed underneath a sheet in a cage, the contestant has to feed him carrots while being blindfolded.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Colts {{made the}} playoffs for three {{straight}} years from 1975 to 1977, there had still been no progress made on a new park for the team. Robert Irsay first spoke with Phoenix, Arizona in 1976 and then Indianapolis, Indiana in 1977 {{about the possibility of}} relocating his team to one of those cities. In 1976, he acknowledged publicly that he had received an [...] "attractive offer" [...] to move the franchise to Phoenix, Arizona. Then, in 1977, he said, [...] "I like Baltimore and want to stay there, but {{when are we going to}} find out something about our stadium? I'm getting offers from towns like Indianapolis to build me a new stadium and give me other inducements to move there. I dont want to but I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> action in Baltimore." [...] In 1979, Hoffberger sold the Orioles to Washington D.C. attorney Edward Bennett Williams, who declared 1980 to be a trial year for the fans of Baltimore. He then went on to explain his concerns with Memorial Stadium, saying it had [...] "inadequate parking and inadequate access and egress. Frankly, I don't know if those problems will ever be solvable at that location." [...] Irsay began shopping the Colts around in earnest, talking first to officials from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, Memphis, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida where he visited the Gator Bowl packed with 50,000 cheering fans trying to convince him that Jacksonville would be the best home for the Colts. That same year Irsay presented Maryland's Governor Harry Hughes with a request for $25 million in renovation to the 64,124 seat Memorial Stadium. Irsay's request for $25 million in improvements was decreased to $23 million by the Maryland legislature. The plan added more seats (but none of the revenue-generating skyboxes), improving the plumbing and would have given both teams better office space. The plan's approval was contingent on both the Colts and Baltimore Orioles signing long term leases. The Orioles challenged the requested football improvements and refused to sign anything more than a one-year lease. Irsay also refused to sign long term. As a result, the funds and improvements never came.|$|E

6000|$|He {{was kind}} enough then {{to say that he}} would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of my stories of Iowa. [...] "You have almost a clear field out there--no one but Howe seems to be tilling it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what I was thinking," [...] {{returned}} her husband, [...] "and I {{was thinking of}} something else, too. I've a notion that I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> {{of the things in}} our basket right here on this table." ...|$|E

50|$|Mostly {{abandoned}} {{since its}} {{last year of}} service in 1934, but still largely intact, its future is still the source of much debate as of 2017. Many would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> preserve the remaining stations as part of France's national heritage, while others would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> its former path transformed into parks and communal gardens, and yet others, rail enthusiasts for the most part, would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> in <b>some</b> form, the track and stations remaining become a functioning line once again.|$|R
60|$|When Mrs Bowater {{brought in}} my Christmas dinner--little but bread sauce and a sprig of holly!--I dipped in the spoon, and, as innocently as I knew how, inquired if her {{daughter}} would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> really fine sewing.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you are {{interested}} in curiosities, perhaps you may <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> that I have here in my bag. I am very fond and proud of them, because they are genuine, and have histories of old times attached to them," [...] she said presently.|$|E
6000|$|... "By all means," [...] he answered, [...] "though we {{have enough}} mice here without their {{bringing}} any more. Savage, go and tell your two friends that Mr. Here-come-a-zany is waiting {{for them in the}} drawing-room, and that the company would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of their tricks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Merrick," [...] {{said the}} boy, earnestly, [...] "you'll {{take good care}} of Miss De Graf, sir, won't you? We both live in Ohio, you know, and we've just got acquainted; and--and I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her again, <b>some</b> time, if she escapes." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{spoke of}} the {{difficulty}} of putting together a great show each year from the few acts the listeners might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> how <b>some</b> are touring or in the studio, other have prior commitments, etc. He talked about feeling that 102 JAMZ had a great show planned for 2015, then having two major acts tell the station they were not available within a few days. He spoke of how the staff had [...] "tried everything we could to put this thing together." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the liner}} notes of 1999's Music Bank box set collection, guitarist Jerry Cantrell {{said of the}} song:The song is us against the world, those people who put you down: [...] "I put up with many years of you putting us down and {{watching}} us bleed, now I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you bleed <b>some</b> back." ...|$|R
6000|$|She inquired for Mr. Jones; and then, without transition, {{asked the}} young man {{if he were the}} person of the house (and at the words, he thought he could {{perceive}} her to be smiling), [...] "because," [...] she added, [...] "if you are, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of the other rooms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Laws I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> {{one that}} isn't skeered of me. Everybody is--you are, though you're {{trying to hide}} it. And why? Of course Robert and Amelia are because I make 'em skeered on purpose. But folks always are--no matter how civil I be to them. Are you going to keep this child?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Harût, as his confederate {{returned}} with these prizes, leaving Savage collapsed in a chair, [...] "snake love that gentleman much. He earn great money in Africa.

500|$|Jean {{frequently}} {{appears on}} the Simpsons DVD audio commentaries for episodes which he has collaborated on. He told IGN that he enjoys doing them because he has not <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> of the episodes in ten to fifteen years, and [...] "it's kind of <b>like</b> a reunion <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> {{of the people that}} I worked with before, so it's a really pleasant experience." ...|$|R
50|$|Reich and his {{ensemble}} were on tour in Europe in 1972. After {{a concert}} in Brussels, the promoter asked him if they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go <b>see</b> <b>some</b> flamenco music. They ended in a club and watched a pair of musicians who by Reich's account were terrible guitarists and singers. However when they started clapping very loudly, Reich and his group, who were mainly percussionists, joined in. After the concert Reich realised that he could use this {{as the basis for}} work, not least as it could be performed with only a few people rather than taking two trucks of equipment.|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from a few}} minor {{mistakes}} or debatable statements— e. g. in {{the context}} of the discussion of the legal status of outer space vis à vis the Moon, private appropriation is too easily equated with the “national appropriation” of Article II, Outer Space Treaty, which is prohibited whether “by claim of sovereignty…or by any other means”—the only criticism which might be levelled would apply to Chapter 8 (“Conclusions”). It is a bit disappointing to find that this concluding chapter provides little more than a short and flat description of some of the possible solutions for a future regime for exploitation of the Moon’s natural resources, plus a few general statements which, by the time the reader has advanced to this chapter, have become somewhat of an open door. Perhaps it is the high level of analysis and evaluation of the many aspects of the issues discussed which has raised the standard of expectation too high, but one would have been very interested in the author’s opinion as to which solution would be preferable, at least from a legal perspective, and why. Even better, one would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> more pages of detailed elaboration of such a solution. Overall, however, this does little to diminish the value of the book, which at the highest level has also become an interesting case study of the interaction of law and policies in the international domain...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{of course}} not. But shouldn't you--Don't {{you think it}} would be a great pity--She's so superior, so very {{uncommon}} in every way, that it hardly seems--Ah, I should so <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> one really fine--not a coarse fibre in him, don't you know. Not that Mr. Mavering's coarse. But beside her he does seem so light!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right, madame; {{stand up}} for your own," [...] and her husband, who was {{accustomed}} to his wife's speeches, laughed. [...] "But for all that, commonplace or not commonplace, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of Milly's bright, healthy color in my girls' cheeks; and I should {{like to see them}} walk as if they had forgotten, for a moment, their tight boots and high heels." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have some}} {{unpleasant}} associations with diamonds," [...] Mark said, [...] "and {{on that point}} I am quite determined; but if you used pearls instead of diamonds the effect might be as good. I don't care whether the stones are emeralds or rubies; at any rate, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some,</b> and then perhaps {{you might be able}} to make me a set on the same model." ...|$|E
5000|$|Author Joe Oesterle {{said that}} it is odd how in a major city like Metropolis, main {{characters}} are the only ones out on the streets. He expressed disappointment with the Sandmans death, [...] "I’d have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> old school Sandman roughhouse, and I felt cheated when a...Golden Age legend <b>like</b> Sandman goes <b>to</b> his eternal rest {{without so much as a}} single blast from his gas gun. I suppose the argument could be made to say that’s how formidable Icicle Jr. was, or how rusty Sandman was, but I’m not buying that. Sandman deserved to go down fighting, not frozen solid while frozen in hesitation." [...] While criticizing the episode, he compared the episode to the Watchmen film and disapproved of the [...] "Batman" [...] voice the Hawkman had. He also said that there should have been more John Jones and less Lois Lane. While praising the episode, he approved of Amanda Waller and said, [...] "It’s interesting to get a whiff of how Tess Mercer became such a lethal hand-to-hand combatant." [...] He concluded by saying that the episode did not live up to its hype and thought the episode before it, [...] "Disciple", was [...] "Grade A entertainment" [...] in comparison. One reviewer praised the show by saying Smallville is [...] "quietly having its best season in at least 5 years." [...] He said the show currently does not resemble its former self and plays more like a graphic novel. He called Hawkman [...] "excellent" [...] but also disapproved of the [...] "Christian Bale"-Batman voice; he called Doctor Fate [...] "awesome".|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a terrible}} sight, and I did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. <b>Some</b> of them leapt {{into the water and}} were drowned. Others swam away madly, like wild fowl, and we shot at them as they swam; and then they dived, and when they came up again, we fired at them again, and the water was red with their blood. I hit one man on the shoulder, and broke his arm, but still he swam on with his other arm, till {{somebody}} put a bullet through his head, and he sank. I ran into the water, as did many others, and we followed them down until all the swimmers were picked off. Some of the boats crossed the river: but there was a regiment waiting on the Oude shore--some said by accident, others that the Nana had posted it there--and the sepoys hacked them all to pieces as they tried to escape. It was a dreadful sight, and I am an older man now, and do not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think of it: but I was younger then, and our blood was hot with fighting, and we {{thought we were going to}} drive the Feringhees out of the country, and that the gods would be well pleased with our day's work.|$|R
500|$|Yahoo! Voices {{wrote that}} Stevens [...] {{in the third}} season [...] "has become more condescending and passive {{aggressive}} herself, more than anyone else." [...] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I would love <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Izzie take <b>some</b> culpability.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{course it}} is absurd!' she {{repeated}} with warmth, and looking keenly at him. But, finding no harm in his face, she continued as before: 'Yet, all the time, they will do anything under the sun that they think will advance my interests. In our hearts we are one. All they ask me {{to do is to}} leave them to themselves, and therefore I do so. Now, would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> more of your acquaintance?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't wish to! ... Ah--they {{are making}} {{for the art}} department. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> {{pictures}} myself. Suppose we go that way?-- Why, if all Wessex isn't here, I verily believe! There's Dr. Vilbert. Haven't seen him for years, and he's not looking a day older than when I used to know him. How do you do, Physician? I was just saying that you don't look a day older than when you knew me as a girl." ...|$|E
60|$|The shopman (he {{knows my}} friend) was {{naturally}} a little staggered at first; but, quickly recovering himself, and {{feeling that something}} {{ought to be done}} to encourage this sort of thing, asked our hero if he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> fine old carved oak. My friend said he would, and the shopman, thereupon, took him through the shop, and up the staircase of the house. The balusters were a superb piece of workmanship, and the wall all the way up was oak-panelled, with carving that would have done credit to a palace.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinction}} {{needs to}} be made between the impact and the effectiveness of CALL. Impact may be measured quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the uptake and use of ICT in teaching foreign languages, issues of availability of hardware and software, budgetary considerations, Internet access, teachers’ and learners' attitudes to the use of CALL, changes in the ways in which languages are learnt and taught, and paradigm shifts in teachers’ and learners’ roles. Effectiveness, on the other hand, usually focuses on assessing to what extent ICT is a more effective way of teaching foreign languages compared to using traditional methods - and this is more problematic as so many variables come into play. Worldwide, the picture of the impact of CALL is extremely varied. Most developed nations work comfortably with the new technologies, but developing nations are often beset with problems of costs and broadband connectivity. Evidence on the effectiveness of CALL - as with the impact of CALL - is extremely varied and many research questions still need to be addressed and answered. Hubbard (2002) presents the results of a CALL research survey that was sent to 120 CALL professionals from around the world asking them to articulate a CALL research question they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> answered. <b>Some</b> of the questions have been answered but many more remain open. Leakey (2011) offers an overview of current and past research in CALL and proposes a comprehensive model for evaluating the effectiveness of CALL platforms, programs and pedagogy.|$|R
60|$|October 27.--Custom House, etc., {{detained}} us till near ten o'clock, so we {{had time}} {{to walk on the}} Boulevards, and <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the fortifications, which must be very strong, all the country round being flat and marshy. Lost, as all know, by the bloody papist bitch (one must be vernacular when on French ground) Queen Mary, of red-hot memory. I would rather she had burned a score more of bishops. If she had kept it, her sister Bess would sooner have parted with her virginity. Charles I. had no temptation to part with it--it might, indeed, have been shuffled out of our hands during the Civil wars, but Noll would have as soon let monsieur draw one of his grinders; then Charles II. would hardly have dared to sell such an old possession, as he did Dunkirk; and after that the French had little chance till the Revolution. Even then, I think, we could have held a place that could be supplied from our own element, the sea. Cui bono? None, I think, but to plague the rogues.--We dined at Cormont, and being stopped by Mr. Canning having taken up all the post-horses, could only reach Montreuil that night. I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> more of this place, which is fortified; and as it stands on an elevated and rocky site must present some fine points. But as we came in late and left early, I can only bear witness to good treatment, good supper, good vin de Barsac, and excellent beds.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} the {{philosophical}} and conceptual underpinnings of a program of study in Social Informatics. We examine foundational concepts and analytical tools, ideas worked out by Rob Kling and others about the key components of an ICT-oriented education (even when the intent of their discussion was not pedagogical). Our intention is to assay Kling’s program of critical inquiry for a Social Informatics education that prepares information professionals to respond appropriately and ethically in their future careers. We do not to recommend the adoption of specific courses for a Social Informatics education. We had also planned to identify those components of a Social Informatics education that I-schools and library and information science schools have incorporated in their program offerings {{to determine how much}} progress has been made to adopt a critical perspective on the relationship between technology and people. However, this proved to be nearly impossible; we discuss our limited findings based on our initial exploration. Our concluding remarks address additions to the Kling perspective on a Social Informatics education that we would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and offer <b>some</b> thoughts on ways to support a Social Informatics education for information professionals...|$|R
