5|$|On July 11, Kinsler stole {{third base}} for the 21st time in his career, {{building}} on his team record, without ever having been thrown out. On July 19, he <b>led</b> <b>off</b> {{the bottom of the}} first inning with a home run, and 12 innings later he broke a 3–3 tie with a two-run, walk-off home run. Only four times before in major league history had the same batter <b>led</b> <b>off</b> the bottom of the first inning with a home run, and ended the game with another homer. Kinsler suffered a strained left hamstring on July 28, and missed 11 games while on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, in Game 4 of {{the playoff}} {{series against the}} Rays, Kinsler <b>led</b> <b>off</b> {{the game with a}} home run, {{sparking}} the Rangers 4–3 victory over Tampa Bay to send them to the ALCS.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{he led the}} AL in {{runs scored}} (130) and stolen bases (87) {{for the second year}} in a row, and was seventh in walks (89) and extra base hits (64) while hitting 28 home runs (9 of which <b>led</b> <b>off</b> games) and had 74 RBIs.|$|E
60|$|And Creech <b>led</b> down <b>off</b> {{the high}} open land into canyons again.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{put her arm}} in Kirk's and <b>led</b> him <b>off</b> to the smoking-room.|$|R
60|$|The two cowboys linked {{their arms}} through José's and <b>led</b> him <b>off</b> towards the door.|$|R
5|$|Kipnis {{represented}} the Cleveland Indians in the 2011 All-Star Futures Game on July 10, hitting a 95-mph fastball {{for a home}} run when he <b>led</b> <b>off</b> {{the bottom of the}} first inning for the United States. Kipnis also was named to the International League All-Star team, and he doubled and walked in the game on July 13.|$|E
5|$|At {{his first}} major meet after his return, the May 2011 Charlotte UltraSwim, Tarwater placed third in the 200-meter {{butterfly}} behind China's Wu Peng and Phelps. He also joined with three other SwimMAC Carolina members to win the 4×100-meter medley relay. At the National Championships in August, Tarwater placed third in the 100-meter and 200-meter butterfly. He anchored the national title-winning 4×100-meter medley relay team for SwimMAC, and <b>led</b> <b>off</b> the club's national title winning 4×200-meter freestyle relay. The medley relay time of 3:37.70 set a new U.S. Open Record, more than six seconds ahead of the second-place team. Tarwater also placed eighth in the 100-meter freestyle during the meet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the eighth, Mueller <b>led</b> <b>off</b> with {{a single}} to right and Nixon {{followed}} with his third double of the game. Jason Isringhausen came in to pitch for the Cardinals with the bases loaded and nobody out, and was able the finish the inning without allowing a run to score. Kevin Millar pinch hit for the Red Sox starting pitcher Lowe during this inning. It was the third straight game in which the Red Sox starting pitcher had not allowed an earned run.|$|E
60|$|Much {{against my}} will I turned my back on her, and <b>led</b> her <b>off</b> to the beehives.|$|R
50|$|Because LEDs can be {{switched}} {{on and off}} more quickly than CCFLs and can offer a higher light output, it is theoretically possible to offer very high contrast ratios. They can produce deep blacks (<b>LEDs</b> <b>off)</b> and high brightness (LEDs on). However, measurements made from pure-black and pure-white outputs are {{complicated by the fact}} that edge-LED lighting does not allow these outputs to be reproduced simultaneously on screen.|$|R
60|$|Jantje {{took the}} horse, with a forced grin of {{appreciation}} at the joke, and <b>led</b> him <b>off</b> to the stable.|$|R
5|$|O'Halloran <b>led</b> <b>off</b> and put Australia in {{the lead}} with an Olympic record time of 2min 6.8s, opening a gap of 0.7s over the Soviet Union and 1.2s over the United States. The fourth-placed Italians were already a full three seconds in arrears. Australia never relinquished the lead and {{steadily}} increased it, as Devitt, Rose, and Henricks set the three fastest splits in the race, faster than all the non-Australian swimmers. O'Halloran's split was the fifth-fastest in the race; the Soviet anchor swimmer was the only non-Australian to swim faster, and only by 0.1s despite having {{the benefit of a}} flying start.|$|E
5|$|Red Sox closer Foulke came in {{to pitch}} {{the bottom of the}} ninth. Pujols <b>led</b> <b>off</b> the inning by hitting a single through Foulke's legs and into center field. After Foulke induced Rolen into a fly out and struck out Edmonds, Pujols took second base, but no stolen base due to fielder's indifference. Édgar Rentería then hit a ground ball that bounced back to Foulke on the mound. Foulke threw it underhand to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base to end the game, and secure the series.|$|E
5|$|The game {{then became}} a pitcher's duel; Maglie and Newcombe did not allow a hit in {{the third or fourth}} innings. In the fifth, Billy Cox singled on a bunt, and Thomson hit a double, but the score {{remained}} 1–0 through five innings. Duke Snider singled in the sixth inning, but was caught stealing second. Neither team got another hit until the seventh inning. Rube Walker singled for the Dodgers, and Monte Irvin <b>led</b> <b>off</b> the bottom of the seventh with a double for the Giants. He reached third base after a bunt, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Thomson, tying the score at one run each.|$|E
60|$|On {{the spur}} of the moment, Marjorie could think of no {{objection}} to the Water Garden, and he <b>led</b> her <b>off.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{passing the}} preacher's arm through his own, {{with a serious}} face, Tom <b>led</b> him <b>off</b> into {{the house at the}} back of the chapel.|$|R
60|$|Then they <b>led</b> him <b>off,</b> and {{presently}} Simeon appeared {{upon the}} gateway with Miriam's chain about his middle and Miriam's rope knotted afresh about his wrists.|$|R
5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán <b>led</b> <b>off</b> with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E
5|$|Trot Nixon {{extended}} the Red Sox lead to {{two in the}} top of the fourth, hitting a single to right field that scored Mueller, who had started the rally with a two-out double to left-center. Johnny Damon then <b>led</b> <b>off</b> the Red Sox's fifth inning with a double to right. Singles by Orlando Cabrera and Ramírez, to right and left respectively, scored Damon to make it 3–0. With two out, Mueller singled along the first base line, enabling Cabrera to score the Red Sox's fourth run. Suppan was replaced by Al Reyes, which meant none of the Cardinals three starting pitchers had finished five innings during the series.|$|E
5|$|As {{commerce}} and industry flourished {{on the lower}} river, most of the original settlers acquired farms in the upper Willamette Valley. By the late 1850s, farmers had begun to grow crops {{on most of the}} available fertile land. The settlers increasingly encroached on Native American lands. Skirmishes between natives and settlers in the Umpqua and Rogue valleys to the southwest of the Willamette River led the Oregon state government to remove the natives by military force. They were first <b>led</b> <b>off</b> their traditional lands to the Willamette Valley, but soon were marched to the Coast Indian Reservation. In 1855, Joel Palmer, an Oregon legislator, negotiated a treaty with the Willamette Valley tribes, who, although unhappy with the treaty, ceded their lands to non-natives. The natives were then relocated by the government to a part of the Coast Reservation that later became the Grande Ronde Reservation.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Is {{that because}} I {{asked you to}} dance?' she murmured. 'There--she is appropriated.' A young gentleman had at that moment {{approached}} the uninviting Miss Deverell, claimed her hand and <b>led</b> her <b>off.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the heats, the Australian team of Brooks, Fasala, Delany and Stockwell {{showed their}} {{intention}} to deny the Americans the gold {{for the first time}} at Olympic level. Drawn alongside the Americans in the third and final heat, the Australians set a new Olympic record of 3m 19.94s. Brooks <b>led</b> <b>off</b> in the heat, setting a time of 50.36s, before Stockwell made up a deficit of 0.41s during the anchor leg to beat the hosts by 0.20s. Australia and the United States had stamped their authority on the event, qualifying almost four seconds faster than third-placed Sweden. However, the Americans had more speed in reserve, having rested 200m freestyle silver medalist Mike Heath and 100m freestyle gold medallist Rowdy Gaines, whereas Australia used its full-strength team.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Pujols doubled again {{and was able}} to score on an error by Mueller. The Red Sox also scored {{in the bottom of the}} inning when Bellhorn doubled to center with two runners on base, to give them a three-run lead. Cal Eldred came in to relieve Morris in the fifth inning, after he had walked the leadoff hitter, having already given up four runs in the {{previous}} four innings. Mueller committed his World Series record-tying third error of the game, in the sixth inning; however, the Cardinals failed to capitalize. In the bottom of the inning, Trot Nixon <b>led</b> <b>off</b> with a single to center, and two more singles by Johnny Damon and Orlando Cabrera enabled two more runs to score to make it 6–1.|$|E
5|$|Lochte {{competed in}} his sixth World Championships in Kazan in 2015. He made history upon his {{win in the}} 200-meter {{individual}} medley by becoming the only person other than Grant Hackett to successfully win an event in four consecutive world championships. However, he finished a disappointing fourth in the 200-meter freestyle in 1:45.83, just off the podium. In addition, Lochte also won three relay medals. Lochte <b>led</b> <b>off</b> the 4×200-meter freestyle relay in 1:45.71, but the US team could not hold on as Great Britain pulled off a great upset and beat the US team 7:04.33 to 7:04.75. Alongside Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel, and Missy Franklin, he was {{also part of the}} winning and world record-breaking 4×100-meter mixed freestyle relay. Lochte also anchored the prelim team for the 4×100-meter medley relay and received a gold medal for his efforts since the finals team won.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{out with}} us, and I will tell you." [...] And Campbell threw down the money, and <b>led</b> him <b>off,</b> {{after he had}} gulped down his own brandy, and half Tom's beside.|$|R
50|$|Visible light {{communications}} (VLC) {{works by}} switching the current to the <b>LEDs</b> <b>off</b> and on {{at a very}} high rate, too quick to be noticed by the human eye. Although Li-Fi LEDs would have to be kept on to transmit data, they could be dimmed to below human visibility while still emitting enough light to carry data. The light waves cannot penetrate walls which makes a much shorter range, though more secure from hacking, relative to Wi-Fi. Direct line of sight is not necessary for Li-Fi to transmit a signal; light reflected off the walls can achieve 70 Mbit/s.|$|R
60|$|He <b>led</b> me <b>off</b> {{to a seat}} by {{the north}} door, between two pews, very black and silent. There we sat, he putting his gun {{carefully}} beside him. He remained perfectly still, thinking.|$|R
5|$|Marte {{recorded}} one out, a strikeout of Howard, {{in the top}} of {{the eighth}} inning. With it Howard set a new World Series record for most strikeouts by a hitter in a single series with a total of 13. After the out, Marte was relieved by the Yankees closer Mariano Rivera in a non-save situation. Rivera allowed a double to Ibáñez, but no runs, in the eighth. After retiring the first two batters in the eighth, Eyre gave way to Ryan Madson, who allowed a single to Jeter before ending the bottom of the eighth inning. Matt Stairs <b>led</b> <b>off</b> the ninth as a pinch hitter, but lined out. Ruiz worked a walk from Rivera, but successive outs by Rollins and Victorino ended the game 7–3 to clinch the World Series for the Yankees. Pettitte added to his own record for most playoff wins, bringing his career total to 18.|$|E
5|$|Now {{trailing}} by five runs, the Angels threatened {{again in}} the eighth inning with runners on second and third, but Hudler grounded out to end the threat. In the bottom of the eighth, the Mariners again had the bases loaded when Tino Martinez singled to score Edgar Martínez, followed by a Dan Wilson double that scored Jay Buhner and Blowers, and finally a sacrifice fly double play hit by Cora that scored Tino Martinez but got Wilson thrown out at third. Tony Phillips <b>led</b> <b>off</b> the ninth for the Angels with a home run to avoid a shutout, but Johnson retired the next three Angels hitters to record his sixth complete game and 18th win of the season.|$|E
5|$|Since 1963, {{the custom}} in most {{years has been}} to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, {{typically}} {{by one or more}} legendary players. The original honorary starters were Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod; this twosome <b>led</b> <b>off</b> every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{take you}} there,' said Gillis, and he <b>led</b> Georgina <b>off</b> the road, up the cliff, {{by a little}} pathway, {{to the back of}} a house set on a {{platform}} cut into the hillside.|$|R
