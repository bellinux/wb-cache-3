Foamed bituminous materials {{have been used to}} a limited extent on a global scale before the early 1990 ’s when the <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> rights Mobil Oil Australia obtained in 1968 occurred. South Africa has also seen a number of projects involving foamed bituminous stabilisation being completed since 1994, with much success (Lewis, 1994). The design of foam mixes have not received as much attention as Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) and the approaches used by the various users of the product have been secretive over the years due to the patent rights. To be more specific, over the past 10 years the HMA mix design approach has shifted from the Marshall mix design to methods that focus on investigating the fundamental material properties and relates test values to performance. Compaction of HMA {{has been the focus of}} many studies and the concept of using a standardised compaction effort for the design of different mixes have become obsolete. With the renaissance in the use of foam mixes, comes a need to establish sound compaction guidelines. Compaction methods used in the study were Marshall, Hugo, Kango, Superpave Gyratory compaction and a pedestrian roller. Marshall and Hugo compaction methods has have been used for a number of years in the design of HMA mixes in South Africa. The Kango hammer compaction method, involving the use of the Refusal Density equipment, was developed at the University of Nottingham (Brown et al, 1991). The Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC), one of the developments of the Strategic Highway Research Programme (SHRP), was used in this study (McGennis et al, 1995). Penetration grade bitumen used to produce foamed bitumen included 80 / 100 and 150 / 200 grades. Mechanical tests used in the project included the Indirect Tensile Strength Test (ITS), Indirect Tensile Test (ITT) and the Semi-Circular Bending (SCB) test.

50|$|Y {{demanded a}} trial for invalidation of X's Trademark, {{on the grounds}} that it had been {{registered}} in breach of Items (viii), (xi) and (xv) of Article 4(1) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trademark Act. In connection with demanding a trial for invalidation under these Items, Article 47 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trademark Act provided for an exclusion period to the effect that it was not possible to demand a trial decision for invalidation following <b>the</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> five years from <b>the</b> date <b>of</b> registration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant trademark. Whilst Y had lodged its demand for a trial for invalidation immediately prior to <b>the</b> expiration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exclusion period, it was further stipulated (Article 56 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trademark Act, Article 131(1)(iii) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Patent</b> Act) that a demandant for a trial for invalidation was to state <b>the</b> gist <b>of</b> its claim and the grounds for its claim in the demand for a trial. In Y's demand, under the grounds for its claim Y had stated only that X's Trademark was in breach of Items (viii), (xi) and (xv) of Article 4(1), and it had made absolutely no reference to any specific facts or events that would attract <b>the</b> operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Items. Y was subsequently issued with an amendment order by the presiding judge at <b>the</b> Japan <b>Patent</b> Office, and whilst it did add specific grounds for its claim by way of an amendment, it did so only after <b>the</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exclusion period. X argued that for a party to declare that it has complied with the exclusion period, itmust assert the specific facts or events that would fall under the relevant Items within the exclusion period. Since no specific grounds for invalidation were claimed for this demand for a trial decision prior to <b>the</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exclusion period, the demand ought to be dismissed on procedural grounds.|$|R

50|$|Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502 (1917), is United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that is notable {{as an early}} example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> misuse doctrine. It held that, because a patent grant {{is limited to the}} invention described in <b>the</b> claims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent,</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> law does not empower <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> owner, by notices attached to <b>the</b> <b>patented</b> article, to extend <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> monopoly by restricting <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patented</b> article to materials necessary for their operation but forming no part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patented</b> invention, or to place downstream restrictions on the articles making them subject to conditions as to use.

50|$|<b>The</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patented</b> {{invention}} or <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> {{protection is}} defined in <b>the</b> claims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> granted <b>patent.</b> In other words, <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> claims inform <b>the</b> public <b>of</b> what is not allowed without <b>the</b> permission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> holder.|$|R
40|$|Patents are {{peculiar}} {{legal instruments}} {{in that they}} contain both technical and legal information. This Janus-like nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> documents is important because they serve <b>the</b> legal purpose <b>of</b> affording <b>the</b> owner the right to exclude others from practicing the invention, and third parties {{need to be able}} to assess <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> that right. At the same time, through <b>the</b> <b>patent’s</b> disclosure, <b>the</b> document is intended to contribute to <b>the</b> storehouse <b>of</b> technical knowledge. Superficially, patents are generally viewed through <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypothetical person having ordinary skill in <b>the</b> art (PHOSITA), <b>patent</b> law’s “reasonable person. ” Unfortunately, the U. S. Court <b>of</b> Appeals for <b>the</b> Federal Circuit has marginalized the PHOSITA by treating the document, particularly in claim construction and in assessing <b>the</b> sufficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent’s</b> disclosure, as a purely legal document. While this shift is understandable, it is also unfortunate. Possible justifications for the court’s move are unpersuasive. For instance, from the ex ante perspective, the court may hope to encourage future applicants to provide better disclosures. As this Article explains, that argument fails because the court’s legal standards are too vague and <b>the</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> time between <b>the</b> application and a competitor’s review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> causes informational asymmetries for which the applicant cannot account. From an ex post perspective, this shift may assist lay judges and juries in evaluating patents, but such a result is the problem—this treatment reduces <b>the</b> technical value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> and incentivizes future applicants to treat the disclosure in a legal fashion, not as a technical resource. To balance the interest in public notice with <b>the</b> technical nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent,</b> this Article posits <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> presumptions. Courts should use <b>the</b> intrinsic evidence—the <b>patent</b> and <b>the</b> prosecution history—to generate a presumptive conclusion as to <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> or <b>the</b> sufficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patent’s</b> disclosure. Then, <b>the</b> court should resort to the extrinsic evidence to determine whether the legalistic conclusion reached should be rejected in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> technologists in <b>the</b> relevant field. In this way, the default position for courts is interpretation afforded by the intrinsic record, enhancing public notice. This default, however, can be rebutted when facts regarding <b>the</b> technical import <b>of</b> <b>the</b> document are brought to bear, bringing <b>the</b> viewpoint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PHOSITA into the calculus...|$|R
