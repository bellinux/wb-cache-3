40|$|The {{growth of}} clones of <b>lexA</b> <b>mutant</b> and lexA+ cells was analyzed. During normal growth <b>lexA</b> <b>mutant</b> clones {{frequently}} divided early, producing smaller newborn cells than the lexA+ clones. Some newborn {{cells in the}} lexA clones did not elongate or divide at all, a response that was never observed in the lexA+ clones. When starved for thymidine, most of the <b>lexA</b> <b>mutant</b> clones elongated and subsequently divided. The majority of lexA+ clones also elongated but did not divide.

40|$|The LexA {{regulated}} SOS {{network is}} a bacterial response to DNA damage of metabolic or environmental origin. In Clostridium difficile, a nosocomial pathogen causing {{a range of}} intestinal diseases, the in-silico deduced LexA network included the core SOS genes involved in the DNA repair and genes involved in various other biological functions that vary among different ribotypes. Here we describe the construction and characterization of a lexA ClosTron mutant in C. difficile R 20291 strain. The mutation of lexA caused inhibition of cell division resulting in a filamentous phenotype. The <b>lexA</b> <b>mutant</b> also showed decreased sporulation, a reduction in swimming motility, greater sensitivity to metronidazole, and increased biofilm formation. Changes in the regulation of toxin A, but not toxin B, were observed in the <b>lexA</b> <b>mutant</b> {{in the presence of}} sub-inhibitory concentrations of levofloxacin. C. difficile LexA is, therefore, not only a regulator of DNA damage but also controls many biological functions associated with virulence...|$|E

In this work, two different <b>lexA</b> <b>mutants</b> of S. typhimurium LT 2 have been constructed on a sulA background to prevent cell death and further characterized. The lexA 552 and lexA 11 alleles contain an insertion of the kanamycin resistance fragment into the carboxy- and amino-terminal regions of the lexA gene, respectively. SOS induction assays indicated that both <b>lexA</b> <b>mutants</b> exhibited a LexA(Def) phenotype, although SOS genes were apparently more derepressed in the <b>lexA</b> 11 <b>mutant</b> than in the <b>lexA</b> 552 <b>mutant.</b> Like lexA(Def) of E. coli, both lexA mutations only moderately increased the UV survival of S. typhimurium, and the lexA 552 strain was as mutable as the lexA+ strain by UV {{in the presence of}} plasmids encoding MucAB or E. coli UmuDC (UmuDCEc). In contrast, a lexA 11 strain carrying any of these plasmids was nonmutable by UV. This unexpected behavior was abolished when the lexA 11 mutation was complemented in trans by the lexA gene of S. typhimurium. The results of UV mutagenesis correlated well with those of survival to UV irradiation, indicating that MucAB and UmuDCEc proteins participate in the error-prone repair of UV damage in lexA 552 but not in lexA 11. These intriguing differences between the mutagenic responses of lexA 552 and <b>lexA</b> 11 <b>mutants</b> to UV irradiation are discussed, taking into account the different degrees to which the SOS response is derepressed in these mutants...|$|R

First, several dominant negative <b>lexA</b> <b>mutants</b> defective in DNA binding were isolated. The mutations altered amino acids in a region similar to the helix-turn-helix, a DNA binding domain of other repressors and DNA binding proteins. Second, the region encoding the predicted DNA recognition helix was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and <b>mutant</b> <b>LexA</b> proteins with altered or relaxed specificity for several recA operator positions were isolated. By examining {{the effects of a}} series of amino acid substitutions on repressor specificity, it was shown that a glutamic acid residue at position 45 in LexA protein is important for recognition of the first base pair (G.

To confirm the model, double and quadruple cysteine <b>LexA</b> <b>mutants</b> were engineered. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay and surface plasmon resonance showed that disulfide bond formation between the introduced cysteine residues precluded LexA specific DNA binding due to blocked domain reorientation.

40|$|We {{describe}} the isolation and characterization of amber mutations in the lexA gene of Escherichia coli K- 12. These mutations, designated spr(Am), were isolated and characterized in a lexA tif sfi genetic background. They abolished {{the sensitivity of}} the strain to UV light and resulted in high rates of synthesis of recA protein. Phage lambda+ failed to lysogenize the strains as observed with similar strains carrying non-amber spr mutations described previously, thereby indicating a constitutive expression of the phage induction pathway. Introduction of an amber suppressor mutation into a strain bearing the spr(Am) mutation restored expression of the <b>LexA</b> <b>mutant</b> phenotype. We conclude that spr mutations either inactivate or prevent synthesis of the lexA gene product and that loss of this product results in constitutive expression of the E. coli induction system in the tif sfi genetic background...|$|E
40|$|LexA {{repressor}} of Escherichia coli is inactivated by {{a specific}} cleavage reaction that requires activated RecA protein in vivo. This cleavage reaction can proceed in vitro {{in the presence}} of activated RecA or as an intramolecular RecA-independent reaction, termed autodigestion, that is stimulated by alkaline pH. Here we describe a set of <b>LexA</b> <b>mutant</b> proteins that undergo a greatly increased rate of specific cleavage in vivo, compared with wild-type LexA. Efficient in vivo cleavage of these mutant proteins also took place without RecA. Several lines of evidence suggest that cleavage occurred via a mechanism similar to autodigestion. These mutations changed Gln- 92, which lies near the cleavage site, to tyrosine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan. The latter mutation increased the rate of cleavage approximately 500 -fold. These findings imply that the rate of wild-type LexA cleavage has been optimized during evolution to make the SOS system properly responsive to DNA-damaging treatments. Availability of these mutants will aid in the understanding of rate-limiting steps in intramolecular reactions...|$|E
40|$|To {{address the}} {{question}} how the recognition helix of the LexA repressor is positioned within the major groove of operator DNA we have applied a site-specific photocrosslinking approach using a <b>LexA</b> <b>mutant</b> repressor (LexA-C 52) that harbors a single cysteine side chain in position 52, close to the COOH terminus of helix 3. The LexA-C 52 mutant repressor has been purified and modified site-specifically with the photoreactive azido compound 4 -azidophenacyl bromide, giving rise to LexA-C 52 *. Here we show that LexA-C 52 * may be selectively photocrosslinked with two adjacent bases within each operator half-site. The crosslinked bases are located, respectively, 10 and 11 base pairs from the dyad axis of the operator. The crosslinking data imply that the LexA recognition helix is oriented opposite to what is generally observed for helix-turn-helix proteins and that this helix should form a steeper angle {{with respect to the}} plane of the base pairs than is observed for standard helix-turn-helix proteins...|$|E
40|$|Two key proteins, LexA and RecA, are {{involved}} in regulation of the SOS expression system in bacteria. LexA and RecA act as the transcriptional repressor and inducer of the SOS operon, respectively. LexA downregulates the expression of at least 43 unlinked genes and activated RecA interacts with the repressor LexA and therefore, LexA undergoes self-cleavage. The ability of the LexA protein to dimerize is critical {{for its ability to}} repress SOS-regulated genes in vivo, as the N-terminal domain (NTD) alone has a lower DNA-binding affinity without the C-terminal domain (CTD) and the components for the dimerization of LexA are located in the CTD. Two antiparallel &# 946;-strands (termed &# 946;- 11) in the CTD at the dimer interface of LexA {{are involved}} in the dimerization. LexA interacts with the active form of RecA in vivo during the SOS response. It was determined experimentally that monomeric and non-cleavable LexA binds more tightly to RecA and is resistant to self-cleavage. Therefore, we reasoned that if we can produce such <b>LexA</b> <b>mutants</b> {{we would be able to}} stabilize the LexA and active RecA complex for crystallization. Therefore, in this experiment, we attempted to make a non-cleavable and predominantly monomeric LexA that interacts intimately with RecA. We produced four single mutations at the dimer interface of the non-cleavable and NTD-truncated <b>mutant</b> of <b>LexA</b> (&# 8710; 68 LexAK 156 A) in order to weaken the interactions at the interface. The predominant forms of <b>LexA</b> <b>mutants</b> and the affinities of interaction between the <b>mutant</b> <b>LexA</b> proteins and RecA were examined. &# 8710; 68 LexAK 156 AR 197 P mutant was found as predominantly monomeric at a concentration of 33. 3 &# 956;M both by gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments.

We developed a genetic screen for isolating “lariat” peptides that function as trans dominant inhibitors of protein function. A lariat consists of a lactone-cyclized peptide with a covalently attached transcription activation domain, which allows combinatorial lariat libraries to be screened for protein interactions using the yeast two-hybrid assay. We isolated lariats against the bacterial repressor protein LexA.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{identified and}} characterized a lexA gene from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri. For this study, we cloned and expressed a lexA homologue from X. axonopodis pv. citri. This gene was designated lexA 2, and the previously identified lexA gene was renamed lexA 1. The coding region of lexA 2 is 606 bp long and shares 59 % nucleotide sequence identity with lexA 1. Analyses of the deduced {{amino acid sequence}} revealed that LexA 2 has structures that are characteristic of LexA proteins, including a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain and conserved amino acid residues required for the autocleavage of LexA. The <b>lexA</b> 2 <b>mutant,</b> which was constructed by gene replacement, was 4 orders of magnitude more resistant to the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C at 0. 1 μg/ml and 1 order of magnitude more resistant to another DNA-damaging agent, methylmethane sulfonate at 30 μg/ml, than the wild type. A lexA 1 <b>lexA</b> 2 double <b>mutant</b> had {{the same degree of}} susceptibility to mitomycin C as the lexA 1 or <b>lexA</b> 2 single <b>mutant</b> but was 1 order of magnitude more resistant to methylmethane sulfonate at 30 μg/ml than the lexA 1 or <b>lexA</b> 2 single <b>mutant.</b> These results suggest that LexA 1 and LexA 2 play different roles in regulating the production of methyltransferases that are required for repairing DNA damage caused by methylmethane sulfonate. A mitomycin C treatment also caused LexA 2 to undergo autocleavage, as seen with LexA 1. The results of electrophoresis mobility shift assays revealed that LexA 2 does not bind the lexA 1 promoter. It binds to both the lexA 2 and recA promoters. However, neither LexA 2 nor LexA 1 appears to regulate recA expression, as lexA 1, lexA 2, and lexA 1 <b>lexA</b> 2 <b>mutants</b> did not become constitutive for recA transcription and RecA production. These results suggest that recA expression in X. axonopodis pv. citri is regulated by mechanisms that have yet to be identified...|$|R
40|$|The DNA damage induced SOS {{response}} in Escherichia coli is initiated by cleavage of the LexA repressor through activation of RecA. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of the SOS-inducible tisAB gene inhibits several SOS functions in vivo. Wild-type E. coli overexpressing tisAB showed the same UV sensitivity as a <b>lexA</b> <b>mutant</b> carrying a noncleavable {{version of the}} LexA protein unable to induce the SOS response. Immunoblotting confirmed that tisAB overexpression leads {{to higher levels of}} LexA repressor and northern experiments demonstrated delayed and reduced induction of recA mRNA. In addition, induction of prophage lambda and UV-induced filamentation was inhibited by tisAB overexpression. The tisAB gene contains antisense sequences to the SOS-inducible dinD gene (16 nt) and the uxaA gene (20 nt), the latter encoding a dehydratase essential for galacturonate catabolism. Cleavage of uxaA mRNA at the antisense sequence was dependent on tisAB RNA expression. We showed that overexpression of tisAB is less able to confer UV sensitivity to the uxaA dinD double mutant as compared to wild-type, indicating that the dinD and uxaA transcripts modulate the anti-SOS response of tisAB. These data shed new light on the complexity of SOS regulation in which the uxaA gene could link sugar metabolism to the SOS response via antisense regulation of the tisAB gene...|$|E

The IC 50 value in Allium cepa root growth inhibition test was recorded to be 0. 14 X and 0. 10 X for Mathura refinery and Aligarh industrial wastewaters, respectively. Significant decline in the survival of various Escherichia coli K 12 DNA repair defective mutants was observed when the tester strains {{were exposed to the}} aforementioned samples. The order of sensitivity was invariably as: AB 1157 (wild type) < AB 2494 (<b>lexA</b> <b>mutant)</b> < AB 2463 (recA mutant) < AB 2480 (uvrA recA double mutant). These results suggested a significant amount of DNA damage within the bacterial cells exposed to test wastewaters. A. cepa genotoxicity test also demonstrated a considerable amount of chromosomal damage of A. cepa brought about by the test samples. The aberration index (A.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus infections can be {{difficult}} to treat due to both multidrug resistance and the organism's remarkable ability to persist in the host. Persistence and the evolution of resistance may be related to several complex regulatory networks, such as the SOS response, which modifies transcription in response to environmental stress. To understand how S. aureus persists during antibiotic therapy and eventually emerges resistant, we characterized its global transcriptional response to ciprofloxacin. We found that ciprofloxacin induces prophage mobilization as well as significant alterations in metabolism, most notably the up-regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition, we found that ciprofloxacin induces the SOS response, which we show, by comparison of a wild-type strain and a non-SOS-inducible <b>lexA</b> <b>mutant</b> strain, includes the derepression of 16 genes. While the SOS response of S. aureus is much more limited than those of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, it {{is similar to that of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa and includes RecA, LexA, several hypothetical proteins, and a likely error-prone Y family polymerase whose homologs in other bacteria are required for induced mutation. We also examined induced mutation and found that either the inability to derepress the SOS response or the lack of the LexA-regulated polymerase renders S. aureus unable to evolve antibiotic resistance in vitro in response to UV damage. The data suggest that up-regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and induced mutation facilitate S. aureus persistence and evolution of resistance during antibiotic therapy...|$|E
40|$|In self-processing {{biochemical}} reactions, {{a protein}} or RNA molecule specifically modifies its own structure. Many such reactions are regulated {{in response to}} the needs of the cell by an interaction with another effector molecule. In the system we study here, specific cleavage of the Escherichia coli LexA repressor, LexA cleaves itself in vitro at a slow rate, but in vivo cleavage requires interaction with an activated form of RecA protein. RecA acts indirectly as a coprotease to stimulate LexA autodigestion. We describe here a new class of <b>lexA</b> <b>mutants,</b> <b>lexA</b> (Adg-; for autodigestion-defective) mutants, termed Adg- for brevity. Adg- mutants specifically interfered with the ability of LexA to autodigest but left intact its ability to undergo RecA-mediated cleavage. The data are consistent with a conformational model in which RecA favors a reactive conformation capable of undergoing cleavage. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a mutation in a regulated self-processing reaction that impairs the rate of self-processing without markedly affecting the stimulated reaction. Had wild-type lexA carried such a substitution, discovery of its self-processing would have been difficult; we suggest that, in other systems, a slow rate of self-processing has prevented recognition that a reaction is of this nature...|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli, {{damage to}} DNA induces the {{expression}} of a set of genes known collectively as the SOS response. Part of the SOS response includes genes that repair DNA damage, but another part of the response coordinates DNA replication and septation to prevent untimely cell division. The classic SOS gene product that inhibits cell division is SfiA (or SulA), which binds to FtsZ and prevents septum formation until the DNA damage has been repaired. However, another pathway acts to coordinate DNA replication and cell division when sfiA, or the sfi-dependent pathway, is inoperative. Until recently, little was known of this alternative pathway, which is called the sfi-independent pathway. We report here that sfi-independent filamentation is suppressed by lexA(Ind-) mutations, suggesting that derepression of the LexA regulon is necessary for sfi-independent induction. However, expression of LexA-controlled genes is not sufficient; DNA damage is also required to induce this secondary pathway of cell division inhibition. Furthermore, we postulate that loss of the common regulatory circuitry of the sfi-dependent and sfi-independent pathways by recA or <b>lexA</b> <b>mutants</b> uncouples cell division and DNA replication...|$|R

The three mutants behaved similarly to <b>lexA</b> <b>mutants.</b> They were sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light and X rays, and lambdaFec- phages were able to plate on them. The three mutations were called lexB because they could be distinguished from recA mutations by the last property. lexB mutants were less sensitive to UV and X irradiations than were recA mutants and were, to various degrees, recombination proficient. UV light failed to induce prophage lambda in all three lexB lysogens. In contrast, thymine starvation induced lexB 31 and lexB 34 lysogens. In lexB 34 mutants, but not in lexB 30 and lexB 31 mutants, UV reactivation occurred at a low level. In Escherichia coli K- 12, the recA gene has basic functions in the repair of deoxyribonucleic acid lesions, deoxyribonucleic acid recombination, and prophage induction. The three lexB mutations alter unequally and independently the three functions. This suggests that the recA and lexB mutations affect the same gene...|$|R

PCC 6803 was investigated. Influences of external signals on enzyme and promoter activity were measured in vivo. In order to search for signaltransduction pathways involved in {{the regulation of}} the bidirectional NiFe-hydrogenase several mutants with deleted histidine kinases were studied. The point of main effort lay on investigations on the transcriptional level. The transcription start point of the hydrogenase genes (hoxEFUYH) was located by 5 `RACE at - 168 bp relative to the ATG of hoxE. Several promoter probe vectors carrying different promoter fragments revealed that the promoter covers approximately 700 nucleotides and needs sequences far upstream from the transcription start point. This is unusual for cyanobacteria who possess a compact genome. It was shown in band-shift-assays that the transcription factor LexA binds to the examined promoter. Measurements of the promoter activity revealed that LexA activates the transcription of the hydrogenase genes. In agreement with this finding the hydrogenase activity of a merodiploid <b>lexA</b> <b>mutant</b> was decreased. The results presented in this thesis support the idea, that LexA, which functions as a repressor in E. coli regulating genes involved in DNA repair might have a different function in cyanobacteria (Domain et al. 2004).

40|$|Haemophilus influenzae has {{microsatellite}} repeat tracts in 5 ' coding regions or {{promoters of}} several genes {{that are important}} for commensal and virulence behaviour. Changes in repeat number lead to switches in expression of these genes, a process referred to as phase variation. Hence, the virulence behaviour of this organism {{may be influenced by}} factors that alter the frequency of mutations in these repeat tracts. In Escherichia coli, induction of the SOS response destabilizes dinucleotide repeat tracts. H. influenzae encodes a homologue of the E. coli SOS repressor, LexA. The H. influenzae genome sequence was screened for the presence of the minimal consensus LexA-binding sequence from E. coli, CTG(N) (10) CAG, in order to identify genes with the potential to be SOS regulated. Twenty-five genes were identified that had LexA-binding sequences within 200 bp of the start codon. An H. influenzae non-inducible <b>LexA</b> <b>mutant</b> (lexA(NI)) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. This mutant showed increased sensitivity, compared with wild-type (WT) cells, to both UV irradiation and mitomycin C (mitC) treatment. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR studies confirmed that H. influenzae mounts a LexA-regulated SOS response following DNA assault. Transcript levels of lexA, recA, recN, recX, ruvA and impA were increased in WT cells following DNA damage but not in lexA(NI) cells. Induction of the H. influenzae SOS response by UV irradiation or mitC treatment did not lead to any observable SOS-dependent changes in phase variation rates at either dinucleotide or tetranucleotide repeat tracts. Treatment with mitC caused a small increase in phase variation rates in both repeat tracts, independently of an SOS response. We suggest that the difference between H. influenzae and E. coli with regard to the effect of the SOS response on dinucleotide phase variation rates is due to the absence of any of the known trans-lesion synthesis DNA polymerases in H. influenzae. 1639...|$|E
40|$|Abstractβ-Lactam Resistance and Novel Therapeutics for Staphylococcus aureus byLiana Celene ChanDoctor of Philosophy in Infectious Diseases & ImmunityUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor George Sensabaugh, Chair	 Staphylococcus aureus is an {{important}} human pathogen capable of causing disease in otherwise healthy individuals. It causes mostly skin and soft tissue infections but can cause more invasive diseases. Treatment for S. aureus has become a problem due to increasing resistance and limited new therapeutics, particularly for more serious infections. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) displays class resistance to β-lactam antibiotics through the presence of penicillin-binding protein 2 a (PBP 2 a), encoded by mecA. Chapter 1 contains a thorough literature review on MRSA and antibiotic resistance, including epidemiology, therapeutic options, mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, modes of resistance acquisition and S. aureus animal models. MRSA has a great capacity to rapidly develop antibiotic resistance, defined as the ability of bacteria to resist a drug to which it was originally sensitive. Limited antibiotics are approved for severe MRSA infections including vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid and ceftaroline. Resistance to these drugs almost always occurs in MRSA backgrounds rather than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) backgrounds. Invasive MRSA infections {{have been associated with}} treatment failure and increased risk of mortality. The development of new antibiotics is of utmost importance. This dissertation encompasses the following areas of research: i) ability of S. aureus to develop resistance to new β-lactam antibiotics, ii) potential pathways to prevent antibiotic resistance and iii) efficacy studies of a new antibiotic as a potential alternative for MRSA treatment. Ceftobiprole and ceftaroline, members of a new class of β-lactams, target PBP 2 a with high affinity, the core component of β-lactam resistance in MRSA strains. Ceftobiprole is in phase 3 clinical trials while ceftaroline has been FDA approved. The goal of Chapters 2 and 3 was to identify mechanisms of resistance and likely targets associated with resistance. Chapter 2 determined resistance could be generated to ceftobiprole and ceftaroline by passaging MRSA strains in increasing concentrations of antibiotic. The mechanism of resistance in these mutants was mutagenesis of mecA and mutations in other PBPs. Chapter 3 analyzed mecA -independent mechanisms of resistance to determine the affect of these antibiotics in the absence of PBP 2 a. MRSA strains cured of SCC mec were passaged in ceftaroline and ceftobiprole, resulting in mutants with high-level, broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance. These mutants have mutations in pbp 4 and other genes as well as upregulaed pbp 4 mRNA levels in some mutants. Knowledge gained from these studies will provide information on novel mechanisms of β-lactam resistance and will guide development of new antibiotics. Chapter 4 is dedicated to exploring the role of the SOS stress response in antibiotic resistance. The SOS response is a stress response regulated by LexA, a transcriptional repressor, and RecA, activator of LexA. When bacteria are exposed to stimuli that break DNA (e. g. UV, antibiotics, etc.), RecA activates LexA, causing derepression of the SOS genes, including error-prone polymerases that increase mutational frequencies. β-lactams have been shown to activate the SOS response in certain strains but not in a prevalent community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) background. Given the increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA strains and &# 946;-lactam resistance, exposure of MRSA to β-lactams could potentially activate the SOS response resulting in increased antibiotic resistance. The goal of this chapter is to test the role of the SOS response in antibiotic resistance with β-lactam induction in CA-MRSA. To test this hypothesis, a non-cleavable <b>lexA</b> <b>mutant</b> was created, which constitutively represses the SOS response. The results of this study indicate that, in the USA 300 background, the SOS response was not solely responsible for increased antibiotic resistance and suggests that this pathway might not be a good therapeutic target to decrease emergence of resistance in CA-MRSA strains. Chapter 5 explores recently discovered options in the presence of ceftaroline-resistance or β-lactam intolerance. Given the emergence of strains resistant to antibiotics used for severe MRSA infections including vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid and ceftaroline, new therapeutics are needed. Tedizolid phosphate is a second-generation oxazolidinone in late stage clinical development with activity against MRSA. The goal of this chapter is to test the efficacy of tedizolid phosphate in an animal model of invasive MRSA infection. Tedizolid phosphate was compared to standard of care antibiotics used to treat MRSA bacteremia, vancomycin and daptomycin, in a rabbit model of endocarditis. At high doses, tedizolid phosphate was non-inferior to vancomycin. At doses achieving serum concentrations similar to human doses, tedizolid phosphate was not as efficacious as vancomycin or daptomycin. Our results suggest tedizolid phosphate is ineffective at treating severe infections, such as MRSA endocarditis, compared to vancomycin. The dissertation confirms the ability of S. aureus to develop resistance to new antibiotics and further describes the difficulty in developing efficacious new therapies. Discovering mechanisms of resistance will provide knowledge for potential new anti-MRSA therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|Mutagenesis {{by simple}} alkylating agents {{is thought to}} occur by either a lexA+-dependent process called {{error-prone}} repair or a lex-independent process often attributed to mispairing during replication. We show here that error-prone repair {{is responsible for the}} majority of mutants formed after a large dose of alkylating agent, but it is unlikely that it contributes significantly to mutagenesis during exposure to low concentrations of these chemicals. The mutagenicity of these low doses of alkylating agent is reduced by a repair system constitutively present in lexA+ cells but absent in <b>lexA</b> <b>mutants.</b> This system reduces mutagenesis until a second error-free system, called the adaptive responses, can be induced [P. Jeggo, M. Defais, L. Samson, and P. Schendel, Mol. Gen. Genet, 157 : 1 - 9, 1977; L. Samson and J. Cairns, Nature (London) 267 : 281 - 283, 1977]. The adaptive response is capable of dealing with a much larger amount of alkylation damage than the constitutive system and, when induced, appears to be able to reduce mutagenesis by both decreasing the number of sites available for mutagenesis and delaying the induction of error-prone repair enzymes. Finally, we discuss a model of chemically induced mutagenesis based on these findings which maintains that the observed mutation frequency is dependent on a "race" between these two error-free systems and the two mutagenic pathways...|$|R
40|$|The LexA {{repressor}} of Escherichia coli represses a set {{of genes}} that are expressed in the response to DNA damage. After inducing treatments, the repressor is inactivated in vivo by a specific cleavage reaction which requires an activated form of RecA protein. In vitro, specific cleavage requires activated RecA at neutral pH and proceeds spontaneously at alkaline pH. We have isolated and characterized {{a set of}} <b>lexA</b> <b>mutants</b> that are deficient in in vivo RecA-mediated cleavage but retain significant repressor function. Forty-six independent mutants, generated by hydroxylamine and formic acid mutagenesis, were isolated by a screen involving the use of operon fusions. DNA sequence analysis identified 20 different mutations. In a recA mutant, all but four of the mutant proteins functioned as repressor as well as wild-type LexA. In a strain carrying a constitutively active recA allele, recA 730, all the mutant proteins repressed a sulA::lacZ fusion more efficiently than the wild-type repressor, presumably because they were cleaved poorly {{or not at all}} by the activated RecA protein. These 20 mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions in 12 positions, most of which are conserved between LexA and four other cleavable proteins. All the mutations were located in the hinge region or C-terminal domain of the protein, portions of LexA previously implicated in the specific cleavage reactions. Furthermore, these mutations were clustered in three regions, around the cleavage site (Ala- 84 -Gly- 85) and in blocks of conserved amino acids around two residues, Ser- 119 and Lys- 156, which are believed essential for the cleavage reactions. These three regions of the protein thus appear to play important roles in the cleavage reaction...|$|R
40|$|We {{prepared}} {{a set of}} temperature-sensitive mutants of the EcoRI endonuclease. Under semipermissive conditions, Escherichia coli strains bearing these alleles form poorly growing colonies in which intracellular substrates are cleaved at EcoRI sites and the SOS DNA repair response is induced. Strains defective in SOS induction (<b>lexA</b> 3 <b>mutant)</b> or SOS induction and recombination (recA 56 and recB 21 mutants) are not more sensitive to this in vivo DNA scission, whereas strains deficient in DNA ligase (lig 4 and lig ts 7 mutants) are extremely sensitive. We conclude that although DNA scission induces the SOS response, neither this induction nor recombination are required for repair. DNA ligase is necessary and may be sufficient to repair EcoRI-mediated DNA breaks in the E. coli chromosome...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Trimethoprim {{was more}} potent than {{zidovudine}} as an inducer of the SOS response in Escherichia coli. The level of induction by each compound initially increased with rising drug concentration and then fell; this effect was less marked with zidovudine than with trimethoprim. The SOS response {{did not appear}} to be involved in the inhibition of bacterial multiplication as the MICs of trimethoprim or zidovudine for recA 430 and <b>lexA</b> 3 <b>mutants,</b> which are unable to induce the SOS response, were identical to the MICs for the parent strains. However, the bactericidal activity of each compound against strains deficient in the SOS response was reduced. This suggests that induction of the DNA repair system contributes to the bactericidal activity of the drugs...|$|R
40|$|Microcin B 17 {{is a novel}} peptide {{antibiotic}} of low M, (about 4000) {{produced by}} Escherichia coli strains carrying plasmid pMccB 17. The action of this microcin in sensitive cells is essentially irreversible, follows single-hit kinetics, and leads to an abrupt arrest of DNA replication and, consequently, to the induction of the SOS response. RecA- and RecBC- strains are hypersensitive to microcin B 17. Strains producing a non-cleavable SOS repressor (<b>lexA</b> 2 <b>mutant)</b> are also more sensitive than wild-type, whereas strains carrying a mutation which causes constitutive expression of the SOS response (spr- 55) are less sensitive to microcin. Microcin B 17 does not induce the SOS response in cells which {{do not have an}} active replication fork. The results suggest that the mode of action of this microcin is different from all other wellcharacterized microcins and colicins, and from other antibiotics which inhibit DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|The SOS {{response}} in UV-irradiated Escherichia coli includes the upregulation of several dozen genes that are negatively {{regulated by the}} LexA repressor. Using DNA microarrays containing amplified DNA fragments from 95. 5 % of all open reading frames identified on the E. coli chromosome, we have examined the changes in gene expression following UV exposure in both wild-type cells and <b>lexA</b> 1 <b>mutants,</b> which are unable to induce genes under LexA control. We report here the time courses of expression of the genes surrounding the 26 documented lexA-regulated regions on the E. coli chromosome. We observed 17 additional sites that responded in a lexA-dependent manner {{and a large number}} of genes that were upregulated in a lexA-independent manner although upregulation in this manner was generally not more than twofold. In addition, several transcripts were either downregulated or degraded following UV irradiation. These newly identified UV-responsive genes are discussed with respect to their possible roles in cellular recovery following exposure to UV irradiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{resistance of}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to antibiotics is generally attributed to multiple factors, most significantly the low permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall, {{the operation of}} various drug inactivating systems, and the activity of efflux pumps. This study aimed to investigate the role of various components of the "intrinsic resistome" that limit the efficacy of antitubercular agents. The DNA damage response: the SOS response was hypothesized {{to play a role}} in antibiotic- mediated cellular death, and that disabling the mycobacterial SOS response, by generating non-cleavable <b>LexA</b> <b>mutants</b> (<b>lexA</b> Ind-), could be used as a tool to validate antibiotic-mediated cell death. To this end, the M. smegmatis (Msm) cleavable LexA was shown to be essential for induced mutagenesis and damage tolerance and that an intact DNA damage repair system is required to respond to antibiotic-mediated DNA damage. In contrast, Mtb cleavable LexA was required for induced mutagenesis but not necessarily damage sensitivity. In addition, the Mtb SOS response does not contribute significantly to remediation of antibiotic-mediated DNA damage. Collectively, these data suggest that DNA repair mechanisms differ between the mycobacterial species and despite effectively inactivating the LexA-dependent DNA repair mechanism(s) in Msm and Mtb, these organisms are able to circumvent this pathway and successfully remediate damaged DNA sustained under various conditions. Furthermore, Mtb auto-bioluminescent reporter strains were generated by introducing the lux operon downstream of the recA or radA promoters. Analysis of a panel of antimicrobials against these strains allowed for the identification of true DNA-damaging agents and the evaluation of the kinetics of the DNA-damage response, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Efflux-mediated drug resistance: This study aimed to evaluate the interactions between pairwise combinations of selected antimicrobials and efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), in vitro and ex vivo, and to identify a novel verapamil (VER) -analogue with improved efficacy against Mtb. Subsequently, a candidate EPI was identified, with equivalent in vitro synergistic effects to VER when used in combination with various antibiotics but with reduced cytotoxic effects, ex vivo, when compared to VER. Mycothiol-mediated protection : It was hypothesized that undetectable levels of mycothiol (MSH) in Mtb would potentiate the use of current antibiotics. To investigate the contribution of the cellular antioxidant, MSH, to the mitigation of antimicrobial efficacy, this study aimed to disrupt MSH production by conditionally knocking-down expression of the essential gene, mshC. The mshC knock-down mutants (in all configurations) were not anhydrotetracycline (ATC) -regulatable in liquid or on solid medium, which was subsequently validate d with quantitative gene expression analysis. These data suggest that a tetracycline (Tet) -based conditional expression system may not be applicable to mshC. In conclusion, Mtb has a multitude of inherent mechanisms to subvert the effects of antimicrobial treatment. This study has contributed to the understanding of certain aspects of the intrinsic resistome and in doing so, established tools that can be used in future drug discovery programmes...|$|R
40|$|We {{inserted}} foreign DNA segments into plasmids which replicate by a rolling-circle {{mechanism in}} Escherichia coli and observed {{the appearance of}} high-molecular-weight plasmid multimers (HMW). This phenomenon, which occurs more frequently with GC-rich segments, depends on the mode of replication of the plasmid and on host homologous recombination functions. We found that (i) HMW are formed upon insertion of a foreign DNA segment into a single-stranded DNA plasmid, whereas the same DNA insert has no such effect on a theta replicon, and (ii) HMW are not present in a recA mutant strain but are found in a <b>lexA</b> (Ind-) <b>mutant.</b> Enzymatic studies allowed us to define the HMW structure as linear double-stranded tandem head-to-tail plasmid repeats. Use of heteroplasmid strains showed that HMW production by one plasmid does not affect another resident plasmid, indicating that no host functions are phenotypically inactivated. This distinguishes our system from the HMW observed with various replicons {{in the absence of}} RecBCD enzyme activity. We propose that the role of the foreign insert is to protect the DNA from RecBCD exonuclease attack...|$|R
40|$|The LexA protein of Escherichia coli represses the damage-inducible SOS regulon, which {{includes}} genes for repair of DNA. Surprisingly, lexA null mutations in Salmonella enterica are lethal {{even with a}} sulA mutation, which corrects lexA lethality in E. coli. Nine suppressors of lethality isolated in a sulA mutant of S. enterica had lost the Fels- 2 prophage, and seven of these (which grew better) had also lost the Gifsy- 1 and Gifsy- 2 prophages. All three phage genomes included a homologue of the tum gene of coliphage 186, which encodes a LexA-repressed cI antirepressor. The tum homologue of Fels- 2 was responsible for lexA lethality and had a LexA-repressed promoter. This basis of lexA lethality was unexpected because the four prophages of S. enterica LT 2 are not strongly UV inducible and do not sensitize strains to UV killing. In S. enterica, lexA(Ind−) mutants have the same phenotypes as their E. coli counterparts. Although <b>lexA</b> null <b>mutants</b> express their error-prone DinB polymerase constitutively, they are not mutators in either S. enterica or E. coli...|$|R
40|$|Wild-type {{cells and}} six DNA repair-deficient <b>mutants</b> (<b>lexA,</b> recA, recB, recA, recB, polA 1, and uvrA) of Escherichia coli K- 12 {{were treated with}} near-ultraviolet {{radiation}} plus hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). At low H 2 O 2 concentrations (6 X 10 (- 6) to 6 X 10 (- 4) M), synergistic killing occurred in all strains except those containing a mutation in recA. This RecA-repairable damage was absent from stationary-phase cells but increased in logarithmic cells {{as a function of}} growth rate. At higher H 2 O 2 concentrations (above 6 X 10 (- 4) M) plus near-ultraviolet radiation, all strains, including those with a mutation in recA, were synergistically killed; thus, at high H 2 O 2 concentrations, the damage was not RecA repairable...|$|R
40|$|Lysogenization by a c 1 ts {{variant of}} {{coliphage}} P 1, P 1 c 1. 100, markedly increased {{the frequency of}} reversion of a galT::IS 1 mutation. The formation of Gal+ colonies presumably occurs by microhomologous recombination between the 9 -base-pair repeats in galT (CGCCGCTAC) generated by the transposition of IS 1. The responsible P 1 gene, ref, has been cloned and sequenced. ref encodes a 22. 8 -kilodalton protein and is located near the P 1 site-specific recombination function, cre. Expression of ref was repressed by P 1 c+. The absence of a distinctive ribosome-binding site {{is consistent with a}} poor translation of ref from an expression vector in vivo. Placement of a ribosome-binding site before ref resulted in the extensive synthesis of the Ref protein. Ref stimulated precise excision in recB or himA cells, but not in recA mutants. Ref was active in <b>lexA</b> 3 <b>mutants,</b> suggesting that the recombination activity of RecA was directly involved in the reaction. We have constructed a P 1 c 1. 100 ref::Tn 10 mutant. The absence of Ref did not appear to restrict dramatically the ability of P 1 to grow lytically or to form lysogens. Thus, the role of ref in the physiology of P 1 remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of plasmid Flat in Escherichia coli strain SP 45 (a temperature conditional mutant which grows as spherical cells at 42 "C {{and as a}} rod at 30 "C) was studied. Flac elimination was demonstrated when bacteria exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of various chemicals were induced to form filaments. No plasmid loss was found when spherical cells were subjected to the same treatments. Plasmid loss was also observed in dnaA 46 and <b>lexA</b> 41 <b>mutants</b> when cell filamentation was induced at 42 "C, but not when they were cultured at 30 "C. Nalidixic acid promoted F l u elimination at 0. 25 pg ml-l in a recA 13 mutant and at 1. 5 pg ml-l in the r e d + counterpart. A marked difference {{was found in the}} rate of Flat elimination from thermosensitive DNA gyrase mutants [gyrA 43 (Ts) and gyrB 41 (Ts) ] between rods and their spherical (rodA 51) derivatives growing at semipermissive temperature (36. 5 "C). Plasmids carrying the ccd segment of F in DNA gyrase mutants were lost after 2. 5 generations from rods and after 6 generation from spherical cells. Plasmid segregation into non-viable minicell-like elements was found after induction of filaments. These data suggest that plasmid stability is correlated with cell shape and that curing is more easily achieved when bacteria can elongate normally...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of recombinational exchanges (FRE) that disrupt co-inheritance of transferred donor markers in Escherichia coli Hfr by F(-) crosses differs {{by up to}} a factor of two depending on physiological factors and culture conditions. Under standard conditions we found FRE to be 5. 01 +/- 0. 43 exchanges per 100 -min units of DNA length for wild-type strains of the AB 1157 line. Using these conditions we showed a cumulative effect of various mutations on FRE. Constitutive SOS expression by lexA gene inactivation (lexA 71 ::Tn 5) and recA gene mutation (recA 730) showed, respectively, approximately 4 - and 7 -fold increases of FRE. The double lexA 71 recA 730 combination gave an approximately 17 -fold increase in FRE. Addition of mutS 215 ::Tn 10, inactivating the mismatch repair system, to the double <b>lexA</b> recA <b>mutant</b> increased FRE to approximately 26 -fold above wild-type FRE. Finally, we showed that another recA mutation produced as much SOS expression as recA 730 but increased FRE only 3 -fold. We conclude that three factors contribute to normally low FRE under standard conditions: repression of the LexA regulon, the properties of wild-type RecA protein, and a functioning MutSHL mismatch repair system. We discuss mechanisms by which the lexA, recA, and mutS mutations may elevate FRE cumulatively to obtain hyperrecombination...|$|R
40|$|The dnaN and dnaQ genes encode the beta-subunit and the epsilon-subunit of the DNA {{polymerase}} III holoenzyme. By transcriptional fusions to the galK gene, translational fusions to lacZ {{and comparative}} S 1 mapping analysis, we investigated the in-vivo regulation of dnaN and dnaQ. We found that DNA {{damage caused by}} the alkylating agent methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) leads to a significant induction in dnaN and dnaQ gene expression suggesting a requirement of increased amounts of at least some DNA polymerase III holoenzyme subunits for recovery from DNA damage caused by MMS. These results are first evidences that subunits of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme are DNA damage inducible. This MMS induction of dnaN and dnaQ gene expression is unrelated to the adaptive response. It was not observed in <b>lexA</b> and recA <b>mutants</b> which abolish the induction of the SOS response...|$|R
40|$|The LexA {{protein is}} part of a large family of prokaryotic {{transcriptional}} repressors that contain an amino-terminal DNA binding domain and a carboxy-terminal dimerization domain. These domains are separated by a linker or hinge region, which is generally considered to be rather flexible and unconstrained. So far, no structure of any of the full-length repressors is available. Here we show that a <b>mutant</b> <b>LexA</b> repressor harboring several point mutations in the hinge region gets sensitive to trypsin and Glu-C cleavage over a segment of at least 20 amino acids, whereas the LexA wild-type hinge region is resistant to these proteases. These data are not compatible with the hypothesis of an fully flexible and/or unstructured inter-domain linker and suggest that the LexA hinge region is, in fact, constrained by contacts with the carboxy-terminal domain and/or a fairly stable local structure of the linker region...|$|R
