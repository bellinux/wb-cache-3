5|$|Fox Sports Detroit Plus is a game-time only {{alternate}} feed of Fox Sports Detroit. It {{was launched}} in 2007 to solve scheduling conflicts, {{such as those of}} the Detroit Tigers, Pistons and Red Wings, as well as CCHA games, MHSAA finals for football and basketball, and The Mid-American Conference Basketball Tournament (via Fox Sports Ohio). It is frequently used for live college football, college basketball, college baseball and tennis telecasts and other events distributed nationally by FSN, to avoid conflicts with <b>local</b> <b>coverage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers <b>local</b> <b>coverage</b> area {{includes}} Philadelphia, southeastern Pennsylvania, {{and southern}} New Jersey. In Pennsylvania, The Inquirer maintains bureaus in Conshohocken; Doylestown; Media; West Chester; and Norristown, while in New Jersey it has bureaus in Cherry Hill and Margate. In September 1994 The Inquirer and WPHL-TV co-produced a 10:00p.m. newscast called Inquirer News Tonight. The show lasted {{a year before}} WPHL-TV took complete control over the program and was renamed WB17 News at Ten. In 2004, The Inquirer formed a partnership with Philadelphia's NBC station, WCAU, giving the paper access to WCAU's weather forecasts while also contributing to news segments throughout the day.|$|E

5|$|The {{news agency}} {{was founded in}} 1937, when the country was still a colony in the Dutch Empire, by {{independence}} activists dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} <b>local</b> <b>coverage</b> by the Dutch-owned Aneta news agency.

The agency remained under private management until it was placed under the control of the presidency in the 1960s when the government shifted its focus from decolonization to nation-building. Antara became an institution through which the state could promote its policies.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of Cl with Pt(110) was studied in UHV by scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, temperature- programmed desorption, and DFT calculations. Up {{to half a}} monolayer (ML) of Cl forms an adsorbate structure. Compression to higher <b>local</b> <b>coverages</b> leads to erosion of Pt atoms from the top layer and formation of PtCl(4) pentamers. Anneating results in heating of the Pt defects and formation of a long- range-ordered PtCl(4) /Cl/Pt(110) adlayer that is remarkably simitar to the adtayer structure found after deposition of [PtCl(4) ](2 -) from an electrolyte onto Au(100). Coadsorption of 0. 5 ML of Cl with CO initiates PtCl(4) formation, but no volatile compounds are formed under these conditions. In similar experiments with Br, the original Pt surface is left intact, even if Br is compressed to <b>local</b> <b>coverages</b> of 0. 75 ML, {{in agreement with the}} expected tower corrosion activity of Br...|$|R

The camera was finally operational by this time and enabled the audience to see Cronkite, who was clad in shirt and tie but without his suit coat, given the urgent nature of the story. Cronkite reminded the audience, again, of the attempt made {{on the life of}} the President and tossed to KRLD news director Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart, where Kennedy was supposed to be making a speech before he was shot. Barker relayed information that Kennedy's condition was extremely critical. Then, after a prayer for Kennedy, Barker quoted an unofficial report that the President was dead but stressed it was not confirmed.|$|E
40|$|Global barrier {{coverage}} that requires much fewer sensors than full coverage, {{is known to}} be an appropriate model of coverage for movement detection applications such as intrusion detection. However, it has been proved that given a sensor deployment, sensors can not locally determine whether the deployment provides global barrier coverage, making it impossible to develop localized algorithms, thus limiting its use in practice. In this paper, we introduce the concept of <b>local</b> barrier <b>coverage</b> to address this limitation. Motivated by the observation that movements are likely to follow a shorter path in crossing a belt region, <b>local</b> barrier <b>coverage</b> guarantees the detection of all movements whose trajectory is confined to a slice of the belt region of deployment. We prove that it is possible for individual sensors to locally determine the existence of <b>local</b> barrier <b>coverage,</b> even when the region of deployment is arbitrarily curved. Although <b>local</b> barrier <b>coverage</b> does not always guarantee global barrier coverage, we show that for thin belt regions, <b>local</b> barrier <b>coverage</b> almost always provides global barrier coverage. To demonstrate that <b>local</b> barrier <b>coverage</b> can be used to design localized algorithms, we develop a novel sleep-wakeup algorithm for maximizing the network lifetime, called Localized Barrier Coverage Protocol (LBCP). We show that LBCP provides close to optimal enhancement in network lifetime, while providing global barrier coverage most of the time. It outperforms an existing algorithm called Randomized Independent Sleeping (RIS) by up to 6 times...|$|R

[...] Unlike other pro-Republican papers, such as Hearst's New York Journal-American or the Chicago Tribune-owned New York Daily News, which held an isolationist and pro-German stance, the Herald Tribune was more supportive of the British and the French as the specter of World War II developed, a similar stance was approached by the Sun and the World-Telegram, the latter of them also having an ardently liberal past as a Pulitzer newspaper.|$|E
