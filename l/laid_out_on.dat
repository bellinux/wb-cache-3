5|$|Burial 278 {{was that}} of an infant, {{deposited}} in a cist under the floor of Terrace 1 Structure 5 in the acropolis.

5|$|Burial 68 {{was found}} in the centre of the Group 18 plaza. The corpse was poorly preserved, it was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> its back with the skull towards the north. The remains were covered with small pieces of {{limestone}} mixed with brown soil. A piece of the upper jaw indicated that the remains were those of a child aged between 5 and 10 years old. Four ceramic pieces were deposited as an offering; two plates, an earthenware bowl and a bowl. Burial 68 is dated to the Late Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar was {{fortified}} for {{the first}} time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of Aragon and Castile. Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist, and a fortified town named Medinat al-Fath (the City of Victory) was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.|$|E

5|$|The Beiyue temple is <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a north-south axis {{featuring}} six extant buildings.

A large platform {{in front of the}} Dening Hall now features the remains of stone sculptures, but was formerly the site of another hall.

5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{seems to}} have been <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a single occasion and used for only a short time afterwards. It is thought that the mourners would have entered through the south side and assembled in the empty south-western area of the cemetery before proceeding to the shrine to carry out the burial rites. After interring the deceased in a grave they may have used the eastern entrance to leave the cemetery. Alternatively, different groups of people may have used the two entrances, perhaps reflecting {{the fact that some of}} the graves do not fit into the overall square plan and may therefore belong to a different group.|$|E
5|$|The largest Maya sculptures {{consisted}} of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough form was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a plain plaster base coating on the wall, and the three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted. Giant stucco masks {{were used to}} adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.|$|E

5|$|Burial 23 was a royal tomb {{inserted}} {{by destroying}} the second {{version of the}} access stairway of Temple 33. The individual interred within the tomb has not been identified but the tomb {{is one of two}} proposed locations for the burial of the late 7th-century king Nuun Ujol Chaak. The tomb was cut into the bedrock under the temple, to the south of the burial of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The king appears to have been hastily interred in a tomb that was still being prepared while the burial took place, since plaster from the walls was splashed on some of the grave goods and a flint pick was accidentally left behind by a workman. The body of the king was laid upon a litter painted with cinnabar and overlain with jaguar-pelts; the corpse was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the pelts and covered in layers of marine shells.|$|E
5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of the ceiling of the summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E
5|$|Repairs {{were made}} during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars with France, and the castle was modernised to enable it to hold 24-pounder (10.8kg) guns. Fresh fears of {{invasion}} followed in the 1850s, leading to heavier, 32-pounder (14.5kg) armament being installed and new gun batteries being <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> {{both sides of the}} castle. Technological developments rapidly made these defences obsolete, however, and a fresh phase of work between 1861 and 1874 created sixty-one gun positions in two long, granite-faced batteries alongside the older castle. These held very heavy weapons, including massive 12.5 inch, 38 ton (317mm, 39,000kg) rifled muzzle-loading guns. As the century progressed, these too became outdated and lighter, quick-firing guns were installed at the castle to replace them.|$|E

5|$|The {{miniature}} city project involved {{students from}} eighteen Springfield public high schools. The students, who were learning construction and handicraft, built {{the city of}} about 1,200 structures {{under the supervision of}} their teachers. It consisted of 1,000 miniature houses, in several neighborhoods, and 200 other structures. The miniature buildings and houses were built according to standard construction plans, and lumber and building-materials companies donated items for the project. The buildings and homes were landscaped with real grass. Their interiors were furnished and decorated like a full-sized house or building. The buildings were scaled at one-half inch to the foot. Tiny Town, with water mains and electric lights, was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> streets like a real city.|$|E
5|$|The {{next season}} began badly for Kippax.

He missed the second Test through injury, while his replacement Keith Rigg scored an impressive century on debut.|$|E

Most {{of the older}} streets in the suburb are <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> an approximately rectangular grid with some curved sections, while the more hilly eastern end of the suburb, including the embassy district, is set out with contour-guided roads. Major roads in Yarralumla include Banks Street, Novar Street and Hopetoun Circuit in a north-south direction and Schlich Street, Loftus Street and Weston Street running east-west. Being a dormitory suburb, there are no major through roads. Access {{to the rest of}} the city can be made from Adelaide Avenue, Commonwealth Avenue, Lady Denman Drive and Cotter Road, all of which run along the borders of the suburb. From these roads, entry to the suburb can be gained by turning into roads such as Coronation Drive, Hopetoun Circuit and Novar Street.|$|E
