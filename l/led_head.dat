As a result of this, impulses from the skin that pass through it are exaggerated or disordered so that a stimulus that would not usually provoke a painful reaction does so.|$|E
500|$|The Flames {{began the}} season with five games against divisional opposition. [...] Despite holding leads in four of those games, Calgary won only one game, lost three in regulation, and a fourth in overtime. [...] Goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff {{became the focus of}} the team's early struggles, as his play was argued to be a major cause of the Flames' {{inability}} to hold a lead. Calgary rebounded with a six-game winning streak, during which Kiprusoff allowed only nine goals on 152 shots. [...] The team again struggled to win games at the start of November, losing five games in seven, including a pair of 6–1 losses to the Chicago Blackhawks and San Jose Sharks that <b>led</b> <b>head</b> coach Mike Keenan to cancel a planned mini-vacation for the players. [...] The cancellation appeared to be {{a turning point in the}} season, as the Flames recorded a mark of 15–4–3 following the loss, including a dominating 5–2 victory over the Sharks at home. [...] The Flames again beat the Sharks, 3–2 in San Jose, on January 15, to end the Sharks streak of 31 games without a home loss in regulation.|$|E
40|$|To {{satisfy the}} demand for higher quality, {{manufacturers}} of <b>LED</b> print <b>heads</b> for electrophotography need effective measurement tools, both for quality and process control in production and for research and development. For LED printers, mid-tone gray-level uniformity {{is one of the}} key quality attributes. Because the print quality is very sensitive to print head performance, using carefully designed test targets with a commercially available image quality analysis system, <b>LED</b> print <b>head</b> quality can be quantified and characterized. This paper describes a measurement and diagnostic method of <b>LED</b> print <b>heads</b> and non-uniformity characterization using banding and line analysis tools. An advanced signal processing technique, discrete wavelet transform, was applied to decompose the signal and extract key information for <b>LED</b> print <b>head</b> quality. The correlation between vertical banding and <b>LED</b> print <b>head</b> defects will be discussed via a case study...|$|R
