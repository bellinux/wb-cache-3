5|$|Historically, East Asian {{cultures}} viewed <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> {{as a sign}} {{of youth}} and aesthetic beauty. <b>Long</b> <b>hair</b> is associated with private life and sexuality. East Asian cultures see long, unkempt hair in a woman {{as a sign of}} sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter, as usually their hair is tied up. Lay Buddhists have <b>long</b> <b>hair,</b> while Buddhist monks have shaved heads.|$|E
5|$|<b>Long</b> <b>hair</b> is a hairstyle {{where the}} head hair {{is allowed to}} grow to {{considerable}} length. Exactly what constitutes <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> can change from culture to culture, or even within cultures. For example, a woman with chin-length hair in some cultures {{may be said to}} have short hair, while a man with the same length of hair in some of the same cultures would be said to have <b>long</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their <b>long</b> <b>hair.</b> The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his <b>long</b> <b>hair.</b> Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E

5|$|Also, in Chinese {{ancient and}} modern poetry, <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> is a common symbol used by poets, for example Li Bai and Li Shangyin, to express their {{depression}} and sadness.|$|E

5|$|For females, {{short hair}} must be neat {{and may not}} extend past {{the bottom of the}} collar, while <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> must be pulled back into a tight bun, and may be {{contained}} by a hairnet. Very <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> may be braided or worn as a bun. Hair elastics, bobby pins and hairnets should be the same colour as the cadet's hair. When braided the cadets hair may be worn in either double or single French braids and in both cases the braids must fall behind the shoulders and not extend past the bottom of the armpit.|$|E

5|$|In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, male <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> was {{valued in}} until the seventeenth century, when the area adopted outside {{influences}} including Islam and Christianity. Invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men {{as a sign}} of servitude, as well. They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as Thailand, and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair. They came up with several mythical stories, one of which involved a king who found a <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> in his rice and, in a rage, demanded that all women keep their hair short.|$|E
5|$|In the European middle ages, shorter hair often {{signified}} servitude and peasantry, while <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> {{was often}} attributed to freemen, {{as was the}} case with the Germanic Goths and Merovingians.|$|E

5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} <b>long</b> <b>hair.</b> Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E

5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans {{did not begin}} to cut their hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued <b>long</b> <b>hair,</b> usually with a center part. Apart from in the earliest times, men's hair was usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> to be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed in learning to bother with hair. Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored <b>long</b> <b>hair,</b> he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E

5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
5|$|Ways of life {{often viewed}} as more rigid, such as {{soldiers}} and religious cultures, frequently have explicit rules regarding hair length. For example, Buddhist monks shave their heads {{as part of their}} order of worship. Similarly, religious men with <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> include the Nazarites of the Hebrew Bible (Samson being a famous example) and the Sikhs. Subservient cultures may view male <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> negatively, and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length, {{as was the case with}} the Gaelic Irish under English rule and the Moors under Spanish rule in Medieval Spain.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{and wearing}} <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> was common {{among women in}} the Western world until World War One. Long female hair never ceased in western culture, though it was rare during the 1920s and 1930s, and was {{frequent}} especially around 1970 and 1985.|$|E
