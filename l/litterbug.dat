5000|$|Two Chicago Police {{officers}} {{were called to}} investigate some suspicious noises, {{and one of them}} came across <b>Litterbug,</b> Electric Eve and Postman stealing food from a convenience store. Postman erased the officer’s memory of what he had seen, and the group left through a massive hole <b>Litterbug</b> dug in the floor, but <b>Litterbug</b> hung back a moment to rip up a “Buy American” poster on the store wall. As the Morlocks made their escape through the sewers, a young gang-banger known as Cell suddenly evolved while fleeing from the police, becoming a single-celled organism, and draining into the sewers, right at the Morlock’s feet. As the police arrived to kill Cell (as was part of their duty to kill mutants), <b>Litterbug</b> and the others rallied to his defense, and the {{officers were}} quickly defeated. <b>Litterbug</b> then dug a new escape tunnel through solid stone, as the others explained to the confused Cell that he was now a mutant. Terrified, Cell wanted to go home, and asked [...] "Who’s gonna stop me"? [...] "Sentinels". <b>Litterbug</b> replied grimly. As Postman introduced the Morlocks to Cell, his advice on <b>Litterbug</b> was “Don’t stare.” ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Litterbug</b> and Postman sat alone, as Postman {{heated up}} a jagged strip of metal. <b>Litterbug</b> {{told him to}} burn off his Army tattoo, which Postman did, and the Morlock’s {{clicking}} screams resounded throughout the tunnels. Later, Angel Dust asked <b>Litterbug</b> if he was alright, and Postman said he’d be fine, as <b>Litterbug</b> rubbed the ugly, flaming welts that now covered his tattoo. The Morlocks decided to risk going above ground, as each (except Cell), had a final wish to fulfill before they fled into the tunnels forever. <b>Litterbug</b> filled Postman in {{on the fact that}} Sentinels would take seven and a half minutes to lock on to a mutant signature, giving each Morlock that amount of time to fulfill their wish. When Angel asked how he knew that, <b>Litterbug</b> replied that he’d been watching them, but Angel Dust didn’t really believe him. Shatter’s wish was first, and <b>Litterbug</b> dug a hole beneath the local Dog Pound, so that Shatter could rescue his dog, Hank. Next was Electric Eve’s wish, supposedly to get her Grandmother’s ring back from her old “employer”, a pimp and pusher named Ricky. <b>Litterbug</b> and Trader defeated the guards as Electric Eve went to see Ricky. However, there was no ring, and Eve killed Ricky for mistreating her. As Eve and Postman argue, the Sentinels arrived and shot Shatter, blowing off his left arm.|$|E

5000|$|Postman {{carried the}} wounded Shatter {{as the others}} fled, when Trader {{suddenly}} realized that <b>Litterbug</b> was not there. They ran back to find he had apparently been crushed beneath a giant Sentinel’s foot. As the Morlocks feared the worst, scraping sounds were heard inside of the Sentinel, and <b>Litterbug</b> tore {{his way out of}} the giant robot’s left eye, jumped to the rooftop where the other Morlocks were standing, and dug them an escape tunnel.Later, back in their abandoned subway station hideout, <b>Litterbug</b> glared at Eve while Postman chided her for endangering them all, and making them accessories to murder. As Trader defended Electric Eve, the police stormed in, shooting Trader dead when he took a bullet meant for Electric Eve. A cop then shot <b>Litterbug,</b> [...] "I-I got me the ROACH!". The bullet bounced off of the mutant's armored shell, and <b>Litterbug</b> turned and tore into the cops. Infuriated by the police’s cruelty and the death of Trader, Postman completely wiped all of the surviving cops’ minds. As Postman was overcome with remorse, <b>Litterbug</b> tried to reason with him, [...] "They were going to kill us."Later, <b>Litterbug</b> tore apart a metal hospital door so that Postman could say goodbye to his comatose wife, and supported Shatter as Angel went to see her parents one last time. As the Morlocks wished that they could do something, anything, so that they could be free of the Sentinels, at least for a while, <b>Litterbug</b> replied, “We can do something”, and explained that the Sentinels had a Central Command Center, that without it, all the Sentinels would stop working, giving them a window of escape. When Eve asked how he knew so much about Sentinels, <b>Litterbug</b> tearfully revealed his darkest secret, “I was a mechanic in the army. I helped build those things.” ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper is to propose the Anti-Litterbugs Campaign as a more viable alternative to improve and maintain urban cleanliness in Malaysia compared to the conventional cleanliness campaign. Lessons drawn from {{the implementation of the}} conventional cleanliness campaign and the Anti-litterbugs Campaign suggests that the former failed to maintain urban cleanliness because it did not focus on the actual problem. Unlike the conventional approach which targets rubbish, the Anti-litterbugs Campaign targets the real cause of the problem, that is, the <b>litterbugs.</b> Fully implemented, the Anti-litterbugs Campaign has a potential to improve and maintain urban cleanliness...|$|R
5000|$|Other reviews {{praised the}} novel's harder edges. Sick Puppy is {{ultimately}} as unforgiving as nature's order. The characters are not likeable. There is no redemption or apology. But that's Hiaasen's design. In the end, we are treated {{to one of}} his favorite devices, the epilogue with thumbnail descriptions of the fates of many of his characters. Some of the scoundrels prosper, some don't. There's the sense that there is more work to be done. Sure, Hiaasen himself may not be ready to kidnap the dogs of unregenerate <b>litterbugs</b> or clobber drunken jet skiers, but it's the thought that counts.|$|R

5000|$|The game {{takes place}} in an area called The Slob Zone which is {{under the control of}} Bob the Slob, who {{controls}} the Hardcore Union of Radical <b>Litterbugs,</b> a legion of oversized creatures such as frogs and cats who give the game its name. The game provides a storyline stating that Bob the Slob has stolen the world's supply of clean underwear and {{it is up to the}} player to get it back. The player finds himself navigating through various neighborhoods from which the human population seems to have been chased out, and which are now occupied by the aforementioned sloppy animals, most of whom are armed with trash and ready to dump it on any player attempting to break in and clean up. The hero's role involves not only staying clean while navigating through the game's ten increasingly messy levels, but also cleaning up after the animals, who have dirtied the landscape with waste items such as banana peels, empty soda bottles, and apple cores. As the player gathers up this rubbish, he will be on the lookout for vending machines where it can be dropped off and traded for weapons: soap, water balloons, and deodorant, which he can use to fight back against the animals as they hurl their trash at him. If an animal is hit too many times, it will stop attacking and usually allow the player to pass. If the player is hit too many times, the screen displays the message [...] "YOU'VE BEEN SLOBBED!" [...] and the level starts over again with all the trash and animals respawned, and no weapons or trash in the hands of the player. However, the game can be saved at any point, and restoring a saved game will also restore the weapons and money the player had when it was saved.|$|R

40|$|M. A. OBJECTIVE Littering {{has become}} a serious problem in most urban areas of South Africa, and Johannesburg and Pretoria are no exceptions. Urban spaces are used for {{throwing}} away of everything from cigarette butts to shopping bags, right-through to discarded furniture. Pretoria and Johannesburg Central Business Districts are therefore used to illustrate this problem. The purpose of this research project is to study the litter problem in central Pretoria and compare its findings {{with that of a}} similar study conducted for Johannesburg. The study will further validate the results of Johannesburg and thereafter determine the practicality of Johannesburg's recommendations for both cities {{to address the problem of}} littering. The aims of the study are to determine attitudes of the general public in central Pretoria towards littering, evaluate the physical conditions in terms of litter in the immediate surroundings, as well as to make a comparative analysis between the findings of the Pretoria project and that of Johannesburg (Appendix A). RESEARCH METHOD The research was conducted by means of a supervised survey. The survey method was preceded by a preliminary study in the CBD of Pretoria. This method was used to locate taxi ranks as well as to assess provision and conditions of street waste and litterbins. Primary data were collected by using three different sets of questionnaires. The survey was conducted on a sample population of 652, which was randomly selected. Microsoft Excel software package was used in the data analysis, and Chart wizard to create diagrams. RESULTS Litter was found to be a serious and growing problem in both cities. Litter conditions were found to be at unacceptable levels and there is reason to believe that it will deteriorate even further if not given urgent and proper attention by decision-makers. A number of disciplinary actions were suggested, but the author's opinion is that those actions should be followed by disciplining <b>litterbugs.</b> The comparative analysis shows that the findings of both projects are almost identical and are in concurrence with each other. Moreover, the findings show that the two cities suffer from a similar problem with varying degree. The recommendations of the Johannesburg study are thus considered to be valid and practical for the Pretoria study as well...|$|R
