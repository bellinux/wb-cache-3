5|$|A {{powerful}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 27. As it moved west into the Atlantic, it became more organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles on September 1. Shear from an upper-level <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest slowed the development of the storm and caused uncertainties in the National Hurricane Center's forecasts, as some models indicated that the depression would dissipate and others that it would become a hurricane. The depression gradually strengthened as it moved to the northwest across the open Atlantic Ocean, becoming Tropical Storm Maria on September 2 and reaching hurricane strength on September 4.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E

5|$|Late on July13, a {{tropical}} depression developed near the Marshall Islands northeast of Kwajalein Atoll. The cyclone quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Fengshen just six hours after forming. On July14, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated warnings on Fengshen {{just two hours}} after first monitoring the disturbance. By that time, the system consisted of a distinct circulation with developing convection, located {{in an area of}} weak wind shear. The storm initially moved northwestward, emerging from the monsoon trough as a small cyclone. Quick intensification followed, and an upper-level <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest assisted in providing outflow. After a 13km (8mi) wide eye developed, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded Fengshen to a typhoon on July15 to the southwest of Wake Island; the JTWC also upgraded the storm the same day.|$|E
5|$|The Katangese Gendamerie {{conducted}} a disorganised withdrawal to two camps southeast of Kamina. Shortly after the 09:00 the Swedish battalion reached the city center. Patrols slowly mopped up resistance and took several prisoners. J-29 jets flew <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground to intimidate the remaining gendarmes and {{were hit by}} small arms fire in return. At 09:55 the Swedish troops attacked the nearest gendarmerie camp, encountering only sporadic resistance. At 13:00 they secured the second camp unopposed, as the remaining Katangese had fled. The Swedes commandeered it and began working with municipal authorities to stabilize the local situation. The Swedish battalion had sustained no casualties and had seized about 40 vehicles, two armoured cars, a Bofors 40 mm gun, a recoilless rifle, several heavy machine guns, tons of ammunition, and {{a large amount of}} supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Jeanne {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 7. Containing a scattered area of moderate convection, the wave tracked westward at 12–17mph (19–28km/h), located to the south of a large ridge. The system initially showed no signs of development, with unfavorably dry air persisting across the region. On September 11, convection became slightly better organized, and the next day broad cyclonic turning became evident. However, overall development was hindered by upper-level wind shear from Hurricane Ivan in the Caribbean Sea, as well as from an upper-level <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the wave.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Imbudo {{were from a}} disorganized area of {{convection}} near Chuuk in the open western Pacific in mid-July. With weak wind shear, the system slowly became better organized. On July15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA), noting that outflow had increased due to an upper-level <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast. At 1800UTC on July16, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 09W about 665km (415mi) east of Yap. A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west-northwest for much of its duration. With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, the depression quickly organized, and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July17.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Dean caused minor {{flooding}} along {{portions of}} the East Coast of the United States in September1983. The seventh tropical cyclone and fourth named storm the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season, Dean developed from a frontal <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast of the Bahamas on September26. Initially subtropical, it gained characteristics of a tropical cyclone while tracking slowly north-northeastward. By September27, the system was reclassified as Tropical Storm Dean. While tracking northward on September28, Dean peaked with winds of 65mph (100km/h), shortly before curving west-northwestward and slowly leveling-off in intensity. Eventually, Dean made landfall in Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula on September29 as a weakening tropical storm. Dean rapidly weakened over land and was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by early on October1.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} the South China Sea, Chanchu encountered {{an area of}} warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. After an upper-level <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east provided favorable outflow {{to the south and}} the east, Chanchu rapidly intensified on May14. While the storm was active, the JTWC upgraded Chanchu to a super typhoon with peak 1minute winds of 250km/h (155mph), although the agency later downgraded the peak winds to 230km/h (145mph). By contrast, the JMA estimated peak 10minute winds of 175km/h (110mph) at 00:00UTC on May15. According to the Hong Kong Observatory, the 10minute winds reached 185km/h (115mph), which made Chanchu the strongest typhoon in the South China Sea in the month of May.|$|E
5|$|After re-attaining {{tropical}} storm status, Kyle turned {{more to the}} northeast and parallel to the coastline, making landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina as a minimal {{tropical storm}}. The storm briefly moved over open waters before again making landfall near Long Beach, North Carolina late on October 11. By early on October 12, the storm had weakened to tropical depression status. At the time of it moving ashore, there was a separate non-tropical <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast of the depression, and shear had greatly increased, which made re-intensification unlikely. However, convection redeveloped baroclinically with the approaching cold front, and Kyle attained tropical storm status {{for the fifth time}} over the eastern Pamlico Sound. The restrengthening was short-lived, as the wind field expanded while the convection transitioned into that of a frontal band. After emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Kyle merged with a cold front late on October 12. The remnants of Kyle continued eastward, executing a loop on October 14 before turning northeastward and impacting the Azores on October 17. The next day, the remnants of Kyle were absorbed by an extratropical cyclone to its northwest, which continued northeastward and moved near the British Isles on October 23.|$|E

5|$|Gunports {{for early}} {{gunpowder}} artillery {{had begun to}} be installed in English castles during the 15th century. At Kirby Muxloe, six gunports were constructed in the ground floor walls of both the gatehouse and west tower; these were then temporarily filled with bricks, probably to prevent vermin and to limit the drafts. Several more gunports were built lower down in the gatehouse, presumably in error as they were ultimately below the waterline of the moat and permanently blocked up. The range of any guns at the castle would have been quite limited, as they were positioned relatively <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Historians are uncertain to what extent any guns at Kirby Muxloe would have been useful in a conflict. The gunports are of early design {{and may have been}} intended to be symbolic rather than practical; they were well positioned across the castle's defences, however, and might well have been intended to deter a serious attack.|$|E
5|$|Located to {{the south}} of a mid-level ridge, the {{depression}} moved to the west-northwest. With weak to moderate upper-level wind shear over the system, the depression gradually organized, and intensified into Tropical Storm Erin on September 2. Though Erin had favorable upper-level outflow and developing convection, the inner core of the storm remained disorganized. The storm slowly strengthened, and attained an initial peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h) while located about 1,150miles (1,855km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Favorable conditions were expected to allow Erin to continue to strengthen to reach winds of 85mph (135km/h). However, an upper-level <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest of Erin produced strong vertical shear over the storm, and Erin quickly weakened as the low-level circulation became exposed {{to the south}}west of the deep convection. The shear slightly abated on September 4, allowing Erin to briefly re-strengthen. However, the storm remained disorganized, and following an increase in southwesterly wind shear Erin began a weakening trend. On September 5, Erin weakened to a tropical depression, and hours later the low-level circulation dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after it}} was named, Dujuan quickly {{intensified}} after an upper level <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest improved outflow to the north. On August30, the ridge to the north built eastward, causing the storm to slow and turn more to the northwest. That day, an eye developed in center, and the JMA upgraded Dujuan to typhoon status. Subsequently, the typhoon accelerated to the west-northwest and later to the west. On September1, the JMA estimated Dujuan attained peak 10minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph). Around the same time, the JTWC assessed peak 1minute winds of 230km/h (145mph), making it {{the equivalent of a}} Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. While near peak intensity, the center of Dujuan passed about 45km (30mi) south of the southern tip of Taiwan. While moving westward through the South China Sea, the typhoon weakened slightly after its peak intensity due to an eyewall replacement cycle. Radar from the Hong Kong Observatory indicated an inner eye about 20km (12mi) in diameter, and an outer eye about 100km (60mi) in diameter. At around 1200UTC on September2, Dujuan made landfall just east of Hong Kong, near Shenzhen. The JMA estimated the typhoon had weakened into a severe tropical storm by the time of landfall, while the JTWC estimated winds of 185km/h (115mph). It was considered the strongest typhoon to strike the Pearl River Delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979. Dujuan rapidly weakened while continuing westward through China, dissipating on September3 over Guangxi.|$|E
