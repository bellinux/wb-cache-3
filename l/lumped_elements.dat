5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} used {{in many of the}} same {{applications}} as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with <b>lumped</b> <b>elements</b> (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{various types}} of {{resonator}} are all particularly suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with <b>lumped</b> <b>elements</b> of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few kilohertz (kHz) are rare. The lower part of this range, below 100kHz, is best covered with bar flexural resonators. The upper part is better done with torsional resonators. Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300kHz.|$|E
5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using <b>lumped</b> <b>elements.</b> They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
500|$|Waveguide filters {{have much}} {{more in common with}} {{transmission}} line filters than <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> filters; they do not contain any discrete capacitors or inductors. [...] However, the waveguide design may frequently be equivalent (or approximately so) to a <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> design. [...] Indeed, the design of waveguide filters frequently starts from a <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> design and then converts the elements of that design into waveguide components.|$|R
500|$|Another kind of {{discontinuity}} {{is caused}} when both sections of line have an identical characteristic impedance {{but there is}} a <b>lumped</b> <b>element,</b> , at the discontinuity. For the example shown (figure 6) of a shunt <b>lumped</b> <b>element,</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual <b>lumped</b> <b>elements</b> in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
500|$|The cochlea {{portion of}} the circuit uses a finite element {{analysis}} of the continuous transmission line of the cochlear duct. [...] An ideal representation of such a structure would use infinitesimal elements, and there would thus be {{an infinite number of}} them. [...] In this model the cochlea is divided into 350 sections and each section is modelled using a small number of <b>lumped</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{some cases}} it is {{possible}} to continue using a topological network diagram even when components needing a distributed element analysis are present. [...] In the electrical domain, a transmission line, a basic distributed element component, can be included in the model with the introduction of the additional element of electrical length. [...] The transmission line is a special case because it is invariant along its length and hence the full geometry need not be modelled. [...] Another way of dealing with distributed elements is to use a finite element analysis whereaby the distributed element is approximated by a large number of small <b>lumped</b> <b>elements.</b> [...] Just such an approach was used in one paper to model the cochlea of the human ear. [...] Another condition required of electrical systems for the application of the lumped element model is that no significant fields exist outside the component since these can couple to other unrelated components. [...] However, these effects can often be modelled by introducing some virtual <b>lumped</b> <b>elements</b> called strays or parasitics. [...] An analog of this in mechanical systems is vibration in one component being coupled to an unrelated component.|$|E

500|$|The line {{constants}} {{cannot be}} simply represented as <b>lumped</b> <b>elements</b> in a circuit; {{they must be}} described as distributed elements. [...] For instance [...] "pieces" [...] of the capacitance are in between [...] "pieces" [...] of the resistance. [...] However many pieces the R and C are broken into, it can always be argued they should be broken apart further to properly represent the circuit, and after each division the number of meshes in the circuit is increased.

500|$|The {{mechanical}} analogies of lumped electrical {{elements are}} also <b>lumped</b> <b>elements,</b> that is, {{it is assumed}} that the mechanical component possessing the element is small enough [...] that the time taken by mechanical waves to propagate {{from one end of the}} component to the other can be neglected. [...] Analogies can also be developed for distributed elements such as transmission lines but the greatest benefits are with lumped element circuits. [...] Mechanical analogies are required for the three passive electrical elements, namely, resistance, inductance and capacitance. [...] What these analogies are is determined by what mechanical property is chosen to represent effort, the analogy of voltage, and the property chosen to represent flow, the analogy of current. [...] In the impedance analogy the effort variable is force and the flow variable is velocity.|$|E

500|$|Electrical {{systems are}} {{commonly}} described {{by means of}} a circuit diagram. [...] These are network diagrams that describe the topology of the electrical system using a specialised graph notation. [...] The circuit diagram does not try and represent the true physical dimensions of the electrical components or their actual spatial relationship to each other. [...] This is possible because the electrical components are represented as ideal <b>lumped</b> <b>elements,</b> that is, the element is treated as if it is occupying a single point (lumped at that point). [...] Non-ideal components can be accommodated in this model by using more than one element to represent the component. [...] For instance, a coil intended for use as an inductor has resistance as well as inductance. [...] This can be represented on the circuit diagram as a resistor in series with an inductor. [...] Thus, the first step in forming an analogy of a mechanical system is to describe it as a mechanical network in a similar way, that is, as a topological graph of ideal elements. [...] Alternative, more abstract, representations to the circuit diagram are possible, for instance the bond graph.|$|E
500|$|Theoretical work {{following}} the war included the commensurate line theory of Paul Richards. Commensurate lines are networks {{in which all}} the elements are the same length (or in some cases multiples of the unit length), although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances. Richards' transformation allows any lumped element design to be taken [...] "as is" [...] and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation. [...] In 1955 K. Kuroda published the transformations known as Kuroda's identities. [...] These made Richard's work more usable in unbalanced and waveguide formats by eliminating the problematic series connected elements, but it was some time before Kuroda's Japanese work became widely known in the English speaking world. [...] Another theoretical development was the network synthesis filter approach of Wilhelm Cauer in which he used the Chebyshev approximation to determine element values. [...] Cauer's work was largely developed during World War II (Cauer was killed towards the end of it), but could not be widely published until hostilities ended. [...] While Cauer's work concerns <b>lumped</b> <b>elements,</b> it is of some importance to waveguide filters; the Chebyshev filter, a special case of Cauer's synthesis, is widely used as a prototype filter for waveguide designs.|$|E

40|$|A compact {{one-dimensional}} {{phase shifter}} is proposed using alternating sections of negative refractive index (NRI) metamaterials and printed transmission lines (TL). The NRI metamaterial sections consist of <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> capacitors and inductors, {{arranged in a}} dual TL (high-pass) configuration. By adjusting the NRI-medium <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> values, the phase shift can be tailored to a given specification. Periodic analysis {{is applied to the}} structure and design equations are presented for the determination of the <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> parameters for any arbitrary phase shift. To validate the design, various phase shifters are simulated and tested in coplanar waveguide (CPW) technology. It is demonstrated that small variations in the NRI-medium <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> values can produce positive, negative or 0 /spl deg/ phase shifts while maintaining the same short overall length. Thus, the new phase shifter offers some significant advantages over conventional delay lines: it is more compact in size, it exhibits a linear phase response around the design frequency, it can incur a phase lead or lag which is independent of the length of the structure and it exhibits shorter group delays...|$|R

The dual transmission line structure can be implemented in practice by loading a host transmission line with lumped element series capacitors (C) and shunt inductors (L). In this periodic structure, the loading is strong such that the <b>lumped</b> <b>elements</b> dominate the propagation characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the circuit}} size is {{comparable}} to a wavelength of the relevant signal frequency, a more sophisticated approach must be used. Wires are treated as transmission lines, with (hopefully) constant characteristic impedance, and the impedances at the start and end determine transmitted and reflected waves on the line.

Another way of viewing the validity of the <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> model is to note that this model ignores the finite time it takes signals to propagate around a circuit. Whenever this propagation time is not significant to the application the <b>lumped</b> <b>element</b> model can be used.
