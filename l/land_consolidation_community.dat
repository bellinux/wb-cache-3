40|$|This paper aims {{to give an}} {{overview}} of the main technical and policy issues that have {{to be taken into account}} when <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> is implemented in the most practicable way. The paper focuses on <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> for agricultural purposes, that is <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> as an instrument to abolish fragmentation of agricultural holdings. <b>Land</b> <b>consolidation</b> for specific non-agricultural purposes such as nature and landscape is not an issue in this paper. <b>Land</b> <b>consolidation</b> on a voluntary basis implies too much uncertainty with respect to its final results. <b>Land</b> <b>consolidation</b> can only be carried out in an efficient way when it is based on special legislation. Therefore the description of the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> process in this paper emanates from a process provided by law. In countries where <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> already has a long history, procedures have become rather complicated, because over the years the instrument of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> has been developed in such a way that the fulfilment of a variety of different goals with respect to the development of the rural area can be achieved.

40|$|The Danish <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> {{tradition}} {{has its roots}} in the land reform launched in the 1780 s. The first “modern ” <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> law was adopted in 1924. The <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedure is today basically the same as the system which was introduced in 1955. Until 1990, <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> was used as an instrument for agricultural development (i. e. mainly through reduction of land fragmentation and increase in agricultural holding sizes). In 1990, the objective of implementing <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> was broadened. It was explicitly included in the preamble of the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> law that the objective is both to contribute to agricultural development and to the implementation of nature and environmental projects as well as to provide land as compensation for agricultural holdings affected by such projects. Since 1990, the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> and <b>land</b> banking instruments have proven to be absolutely essential in the process of reaching voluntary agreements with the landowners affected by nature projects. Public funding of the traditional <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> projects with agricultural development as main objective was discontinued in 2006. At the same time, the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> projects implemented in recent years (after a public initiative often in connection with the implementation of a nature project) may only include land transactions which contribute to the implementation of the public initiated project. Thus, the multi-purpose potential which could be expected after the amendment of the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> law in 1990 has so far not been realized. The volume of the Danish <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> program has in the last years been reduced more than half compared to the previous decades.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the position of the landowner and his/her degree of influence on <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> in general and specially within the municipality of Pedersöre. This study is divided into two fields: a) the decision-making and the degree of influence of a private landowner and b) the general development of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation.</b> This study emphasizes the real possibilities the landowner has of influencing <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> and how these possibilities appear in practise. The continuity of Finnish <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> activity is also investigated. The aim was to find out if the land reform process has been a slow and long lasting or if the cadastral procedures have been separate technical procedures. The empiric data for this study was collected from <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> records and articles published in a local newspaper from Pedersöre during the 20 th century. The method used in this study was a qualitative content analysis. Financial measures taken by the state in <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedures has, according to this study stimulated the implementation of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedures. But this alone has not been sufficient to start the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> process. Opinion leaders among the landowners and the economic results of the procedures have been central internal factors. These have also influenced the implementation of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedures. The long duration of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedures has made it significantly difficult for a landowner to estimate the economic outcome of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation.</b> This study suggests that there has been a long lasting and almost continuous land reform within the research area (Pedersöre). Its main purpose has been to correct the defects of early <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> and to lower the costs of production on the farms by improving draining, access roads and the division of land. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In the thesis, {{the role}} of {{municipalities}} by <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> in Slovenia is studied and a comparative analysis of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> process between Slovenia and Bavaria is presented. In the first part, international guidelines {{in the field of}} <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> are given, exposing <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> as an instrument for rural development. In Slovenia, the municipality usually has two main tasks considering <b>land</b> <b>consolidation,</b> namely project preparation and help by its financing. Furthermore, an important role of the municipality is providing assistance for implementation of agromelioration. For the purpose of our study, a survey has been conducted among Slovenian municipalities, wherein over 100 municipalities have participated. The majority of municipalities are highly interested in getting more information on <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> due to their mostly poor knowledge on this procedure. In the last fifteen years, only a third of the participating municipalities received an initiative for <b>land</b> <b>consolidation,</b> whereby merely in 21 municipalities those procedures have actually been carried out. The main two reasons for failure of <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> initiatives are landowners’ disapproval and the fact that <b>land</b> <b>consolidations</b> had not beforehand been foreseen in the municipal spatial plan. Municipalities experienced in <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> have exposed the problems they face by preparation of the necessary documentation, financing, lengthy appeals procedures and land valuation. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, the good practices in Bavaria are presented. It has to be emphasized, that <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> there is an instrument for holistic development of the countryside, whereby all inhabitants, not only the landowners, are actively involved and educated about land consolidation; the local inhabitants are therefore important actors at shaping development plans and their actual implementation in the countryside. Professional assistance is systematically provided by inter-municipal regional public offices for rural development, which are also responsible for projects’ operational aspects.
