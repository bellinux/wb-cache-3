50|$|Ancona Cathedral, {{dedicated}} to Judas Cyriacus, was consecrated {{at the beginning}} of the 11th century and completed in 1189. Some writers suppose that the original church was in the form of a basilica and belonged to the 7th century. An early restoration was completed in 1234. It is a fine Romanesque building in grey stone, built in the form of a Greek cross, and other elements of Byzantine art. It has a dodecagonal dome over the centre slightly altered by Margaritone d'Arezzo in 1270.

40|$|A nine {{year old}} boy {{presented}} with an eight month history of neck and back pain. The {{child had been}} experiencing persistent progressive neck and upper back pain {{for at least one}} year. The pain was typically worse at night and was immediately relieved by the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The child also complained of progressive right shoulder and arm pain with some loss of strength and numbness. There was no history of trauma, but he did report being relatively active in sports prior to the development of these symptoms. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the lower cervical spine as well as pain on both flexion and extension of the neck. Rotation of the neck was also limited, to a greater extent on the right than on the left. Sensory and motor examinations were normal. Further examination revealed that the pain associated with cervical movement radiated along the distribution of the C 5 nerve root to the right shoulder and arm. Radiographic evaluation of the cervical spine revealed sclerosis of the right <b>lateral</b> <b>arch</b> of C 5. This was compared to a normal plain radiograph of the same area six months prior on initial presentation. Bone scan demonstrated a corresponding area of increased uptake and CT scan showed sclerosis of the right <b>lateral</b> <b>arch</b> of C 5 with a central nidus calcification. An MRI showed low signal on TI-weighted images and a high signal on T 2 -weighted images.

40|$|Background: We {{report on}} our {{experience}} with using a distally based island flap for soft tissue {{reconstruction of the}} foot in limb salvage surgery for malignant melanoma patients. Methods: A distally based sural flap was used for 10 cases for the hindfoot reconstruction, and a lateral supramalleolar flap was used for 3 cases for the <b>lateral</b> <b>arch</b> reconstruction of the mid- and forefoot after wide excision of malignant melanomas. Results: The length of the flap varied from 7. 5 cm to 12 cm (mean, 9. 6 cm) and the width varied from 6. 5 cm to 12 cm (mean, 8. 8 cm). Superficial necrosis developed in four flaps, but this was successfully treated by debridement and suture or a skin graft. All thirteen flaps survived completely and they provided good contour, stable and durable coverage for normal weight bearing. Conclusions: The distally based sural flap {{is considered to be}} useful for reconstructing the hindfoot, and the lateral supramalleolar flap is good for reconstructing the lateral archs of the mid- and forefoot after resection of malignant melanoma of the foot...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Great Hall of Trajan's Markets in Rome using {{equilibrium}} analysis {{to determine the}} limits of stability of its main vault under gravity loading. In particular, the capacities of three structural components were analyzed individually and as one system to compare the difference in stability limits. Recent studies of the hall that used Finite Element Methods predicted high tensile stresses in the structure, suggesting {{that there was a}} danger of further damage and potential collapse under seismic loads. This led to the installation of steel reinforcement systems within the vault and supporting structure. The objective of this thesis is to show that equilibrium methods are able to give an accurate sense of the viable states of the structure, and generally, that equilibrium methods are a more appropriate technique for analyzing highly indeterminate historic masonry structures. The results show that the range of horizontal thrust values increases dramatically when the supporting structures (<b>lateral</b> <b>arch</b> and buttress) are included. Hence, the supporting structures are critical to the stability of the vault under static loading. Furthermore, sliding between the travertine blocks is not a consideration under static loading of the vault. by Miryam Y. Dreyfuss. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|SummaryIntroductionPes planovalgus (PPV) is {{a complex}} {{three-dimensional}} deformity of which routine radiographs provide only a two-dimensional analysis. HypothesisAngles and other radiographic parameters of the foot in children and adolescents, when studied on both the dorsoplantar and the lateral view, {{can be used to}} establish a radiographic classification system for PPV that provides useful therapeutic guidance in clinical practice. Materials and methodsA retrospective single-centre study was conducted on 65 feet in 35 patients aged 7 to 18 years and having adequate ossification. All patients had a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic or neurologic PPV and available weight-bearing dorsoplantar and strict lateral radiographs. We excluded pes planus due to tarsal coalition, congenital bone deformities, or overcorrection of talipes equinovarus (n= 25). All possible axes were drawn and angles measured after an evaluation of interindividual agreement. ResultsWe identified four patterns of PPV: subtalar pes planus (n= 16) with marked subtalar valgus and longitudinal sag predominating at the talonavicular joint, midtarsal pes planus (n= 12) without subtalar valgus but with marked midtarsal abduction and sag predominating at the cuneonavicular joint, mixed pes planus (n= 28) with subtalar valgus, midtarsal abduction, and sag at both the talonavicular and cuneonavicular joints, and pes planocavus (n= 9) with sag of the medial arch and cavus deformity of the <b>lateral</b> <b>arch.</b> ConclusionThis original classification system provides therapeutic guidance by helping to match the surgical procedure to the nature and location of the deformities.

40|$|Background A {{clinical}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the intra and inter-rater reliability of digital scanning and the neutral suspension casting technique to measure six foot parameters. The neutral suspension casting technique is a commonly utilised method for obtaining a negative impression of the foot prior to orthotic fabrication. Digital scanning offers an alternative to the traditional plaster of Paris techniques. Methods Twenty one healthy participants volunteered {{to take part in the}} study. Six casts and six digital scans were obtained from each participant by two raters of differing clinical experience. The foot parameters chosen for investigation were cast length (mm), forefoot width (mm), rearfoot width (mm), medial arch height (mm), <b>lateral</b> <b>arch</b> height (mm) and forefoot to rearfoot alignment (degrees). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to determine the intra and inter-rater reliability. Measurement error was assessed through the calculation of the standard error of the measurement (SEM) and smallest real difference (SRD). Results ICC values for all foot parameters using digital scanning ranged between 0. 81 - 0. 99 for both intra and inter-rater reliability. For neutral suspension casting technique inter-rater reliability values ranged from 0. 57 - 0. 99 and intra-rater reliability values ranging from 0. 36 - 0. 99 for rater 1 and 0. 49 - 0. 99 for rater 2. Conclusions The findings of this study indicate that digital scanning is a reliable technique, irrespective of clinical experience, with reduced measurement variability in all foot parameters investigated when compared to neutral suspension casting...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{properties}} of vergence and saccade eye move-ments as well as posture in quiet stance, and the effects of thin plantar inserts upon postural and oculomotor control. The performances of 36 young healthy subjects were recorded by a force platform and an eye tracker in three testing conditions: without plantar stimulation, with a 3 millimetre-thick plantar insert, either a Medial or a <b>Lateral</b> <b>Arch</b> Support (MAS / LAS). The results showed a decrease of the Surface and Variance of Speed and a more posterior position of the CoP with either stimulation compared with the control condition. The fractal analysis showed a decrease with MAS. Wavelet analysis in the time-frequency domain revealed an increase in the Cancelling Time of the low frequency band with MAS. These results suggest a better stability for a lower energy cost. Concerning eye movements, the inserts influenced only vergence (not saccades) : MAS caused an increase of the phasic amplitude of divergence, and conversely a decrease of the tonic amplitude. In contrast, LAS caused an increase of the tonic amplitude of convergence. Thus, MAS renders divergence less visually driven, while LAS renders convergence more visually driven. We conclude that the CNS uses the podal signal for both postural and vergence control via specific mecha-nisms. Plantar inserts have an influence upon posture and vergence movements in a differ-ent way according to the part of the foot sole being stimulated. These results can be useful to clinicians interested in foot or eye...|$|E
40|$|Fossil {{evidence}} for longitudinal arches {{in the foot}} is frequently used to constrain the origins of terrestrial bipedality in human ancestors. This approach rests on the prevailing concept that human feet are unique in functioning with a relatively stiff lateral mid-foot, lacking the significant flexion and high plantar pressures present in non-human apes. This paradigm has stood for more than 70 years but {{has yet to be}} tested objectively with quantitative data. Herein, we show that plantar pressure records with elevated lateral mid-foot pressures occur frequently in healthy, habitually shod humans, with magnitudes in some individuals approaching absolute maxima across the foot. Furthermore, the same astonishing pressure range is present in bonobos and the orangutan (the most arboreal great ape), yielding overlap with human pressures. Thus, while the mean tendency of habitual mechanics of the mid-foot in healthy humans is indeed consistent with the traditional concept of the lateral mid-foot as a relatively rigid or stabilized structure, it is clear that <b>lateral</b> <b>arch</b> stabilization in humans is not obligate and is often transient. These findings suggest a level of detachment between foot stiffness during gait and osteological structure, hence fossilized bone morphology by itself may only provide a crude indication of mid-foot function in extinct hominins. Evidence for thick plantar tissues in Ardipithecus ramidus suggests that a human-like combination of active and passive modulation of foot compliance by soft tissues extends back into an arboreal context, supporting an arboreal origin of hominin bipedalism in compressive orthogrady. We propose that the musculoskeletal conformation of the modern human mid-foot evolved under selection for a functionally tuneable, rather than obligatory stiff structure...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{case report}} of a 12 year old girl with a past history of spina bifida at L 5 /S 1, {{presented}} with bilateral mobile pes cavus deformities and clawing of the toes. Bilateral Jones ' procedure and Steindler's release were carried out to improve ankle dorsi flexion. Fifteen months later she developed identical pressure ulcers on the planter aspects of both feet, opposite the heads of 5 th metatarsal bones, which resulted in bone infection. Dorsiflexion of the paralysed drop foot can best be improved by performing Robert Jones procedure where the extensor hallucis longus power is normal, the big toe may be hyperextended at the metatarsophalangeal joint and flexed at the interphalangeal joint 1 - 3. The procedure consists of {{the transfer of the}} extensor hallucis longus to the neck of the first metatarsal and the arthrodesis of the interphalangeal joint 3. Most of our experience has been with post poliomyelitis deformities where there is an isolated motor paralysis and the patient can easily adapt to the new position of the feet and therefore alter them to prevent excessive pressure on any part, especially the <b>lateral</b> <b>arch</b> which is made to bear more weight {{as a result of the}} surgery. The problem in spina bifida is complicated by the fact that some muscles may contract strongly without being under conscious control 4.
