5|$|He is {{responsible}} for describing one subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), the southern black-and-white ruffed lemur (V. v. editorum) in 1952; one subspecies of toque macaque (Macaca sinica), the highland toque macaque (M. s. opisthomelas) in 1942; one subspecies of red slender <b>loris</b> (<b>Loris</b> tardigradus), the Horton Plains slender <b>loris</b> (L. t. nycticeboides) in 1942; and two subspecies of grey slender <b>loris</b> (<b>Loris</b> lydekkerianus), the highland slender <b>loris</b> (L. l. grandis) in 1932 and the dry zone slender <b>loris</b> (L. l. nordicus) in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Nycticebus bengalensis, {{commonly}} known as the Bengal slow <b>loris</b> or northern slow <b>loris,</b> is a strepsirrhine primate in the slow <b>loris</b> genus, Nycticebus. Formerly considered a subspecies of the Sunda slow <b>loris</b> (N.coucang), it was recognized as a distinct species in 2001 by taxonomist and primatologist Colin Groves. It is difficult to distinguish from the other species in its genus.|$|E
5|$|Both the Bengal slow <b>loris</b> and pygmy slow <b>loris</b> {{are found}} in more than 20 {{protected}} areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded. The pygmy slow <b>loris</b> is protected in most of its range states: in Cambodia, China, and Vietnam. This makes hunting and capture illegal, and in China and Vietnam, possession and storage are also illegal. Under Vietnamese law it has had {{the highest level of}} wildlife protection since 1992, all exploitation and use of the pygmy slow <b>loris</b> is illegal. However, enforcement is poor while minor penalties have little deterring effect. In terms of international protection, the species was elevated to Appendix I of CITES in 2007. In addition, since October 2001, the European Union prohibits imports for all wild specimens of pygmy slow <b>loris</b> from Laos and Cambodia for conservation reasons.|$|E
5|$|Five {{species are}} {{currently}} recognized. The Javan slow <b>loris</b> (N.javanicus) {{is native to}} the Indonesian island of Java, whereas the Bornean slow <b>loris</b> (N.menagensis) {{can be found on}} Borneo and nearby islands, including the Sulu Islands in the Philippines. The Sunda slow <b>loris</b> is found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra as well as Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. The other two species are found entirely on the mainland, with the Bengal slow <b>loris</b> (N.bengalensis) native to Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China, Northeast India, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam and the pygmy slow <b>loris</b> (N.pygmaeus) found in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and southern China.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{primatologist}} James Thorn used environmental niche modelling in Indonesia {{to supplement}} the poor population data gathered to date to predict the remaining available habitat for slow lorises on the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. These estimates indicated that the Javan slow <b>loris</b> was the most threatened by habitat loss, followed by the Sunda slow <b>loris</b> from Sumatra. The Bornean slow <b>loris</b> was in a better situation since much of its range consists of low-risk areas. Both the Bengal slow <b>loris</b> and pygmy slow <b>loris</b> are found in more than 20protected areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow <b>loris</b> is {{sympatric}} (shares its range) {{with the}} Bengal slow <b>loris</b> in Thailand and hybridisation has occurred.|$|E
5|$|All slow <b>loris</b> species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on {{the insides of}} their elbows. This is spread across their bodies and those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow <b>loris</b> can bite, roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up and drop from the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow <b>loris.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carl Linnaeus, {{the founder}} of modern {{binomial}} nomenclature, gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. He included three species under the genus Lemur: Lemur tardigradus (the red slender <b>loris,</b> now known as <b>Loris</b> tardigradus), Lemur catta (the ring-tailed lemur), and Lemur volans (the Philippine colugo, now known as Cynocephalus volans).|$|E
5|$|In Cambodia, {{the deeply}} rooted {{tradition}} {{of using the}} Bengal and pygmy slow lorises in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow <b>loris</b> is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Some {{people in the country}} believe dried slow <b>loris</b> can cure cancer. Slow lorises are also smoked for other traditional remedies. Traditional Khmer medicine practitioners in that region claim that medicines made from slow lorises can cure 100diseases, with some practitioners from the National Centre for Traditional Medicine reporting that slow <b>loris</b> are sometimes roasted alive under the assumption that this increases the medicine's potency. Slow lorises are also burned alive, causing their eyes to burst and release a liquid called minyak kukang (or <b>loris</b> oil), which is used in black magic and traditional medicine and is supposed to have life-giving qualities and act as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of the Bengal slow <b>loris,</b> every part—including the brain, urine, and skin—is used in {{traditional}} medicine in order to heal wounds and rheumatism. With the Sunda slow <b>loris,</b> people trade the skin, feet, skeletons, and skulls. The fur is reported to heal wounds, the flesh to cure epilepsy, eyes are used in love potions, and the meat is reported to cure asthma and stomach problems. The pygmy slow <b>loris</b> is primarily valued for the medicinal use of its hair, but it is also used to make bone glue of monkey, a medicine used mostly by local people, but sometimes sold to visitors. In general, wearing slow <b>loris</b> bones is considered good luck and the meat is sometimes thought to cure leprosy.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are omnivores, eating insects, other arthropods, small {{birds and}} reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, nectar and {{miscellaneous}} vegetation. A 1984 {{study of the}} Sunda slow <b>loris</b> indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and other animal prey. A more detailed study of another Sunda slow <b>loris</b> population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions, consisting of 43.3% gum, 31.7% nectar, 22.5% fruit, and just 2.5% arthropods and other animal prey. The most common dietary item was nectar from flowers of the Bertram palm (Eugeissona tristis). The Sunda slow <b>loris</b> eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell.|$|E
5|$|The Javan slow <b>loris</b> (Nycticebus javanicus) {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically in 1812, by the French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The species name javanicus refers to its place of origin. However, the species was not recognized for long; by 1840, René Primevère Lesson classified {{it as one}} of several varieties of a single species of slow <b>loris,</b> which he called Bradylemur tardigradus. In 1921, Oldfield Thomas named a second species of slow <b>loris</b> from Java, Nycticebus ornatus.|$|E
5|$|The Javan slow <b>loris</b> {{is larger}} than both of the other Indonesian slow lorises, the Sunda slow <b>loris</b> and the Bornean slow <b>loris.</b> Based on averages {{determined}} from six specimens obtained from the illegal wildlife trade in Java, other morphometric parameters are as follows: head length, 59.2mm; muzzle length, 19.9mm; head breadth, 43.6mm; body breadth, 250.8mm; head and body length, 293.1mm; chest girth, 190.8mm; dark percentage girth (girth measurement of zone with dark dorsal hair, measured {{as a percent of}} girth circumference), 48.0mm; neck circumference, 136.7mm; tail length, 20.4mm; humerus length, 67.2mm; radius length, 71.8mm; femur length, 83.2mm; tibia length, 85.9mm; hand span, 59.1mm; foot span, 70.3mm; and ear length, 16.8mm.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Zoo {{has also}} written {{husbandry}} manuals for slow lorises, promoted public awareness, conducted field surveys, and supported slow <b>loris</b> rescue facilities. The Vietnamese postal service recognized slow lorises on a postage stamp by using {{a picture of a}} Bengal slow <b>loris</b> and her infant published by the San Diego Zoo in February 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow <b>loris</b> has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow <b>loris</b> due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head. It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring around the eyes, and a browner coat than the Bengal slow <b>loris</b> which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow <b>loris</b> has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow <b>loris.</b> Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow <b>loris</b> has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n=50. Although the banding patterns on the chromosomes of all slow lorises are similar, this species may be distinguished from the Bengal slow <b>loris</b> (N.bengalensis) by distinct differences in the number and location of nucleolus organizer regions.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow <b>loris</b> mates {{once every}} 12–18 months and has {{one or two}} {{offspring}} after an average gestation period of six months. For the first few days, the young <b>loris</b> clings to the belly of its mother. After six months the baby will be weaned, the females reach sexual maturity by 16 months, while the male reaches maturity by about 18 months. The pygmy slow <b>loris</b> is seasonally fertile during the months of July and August. Chemical signals {{play a role in}} the reproductive behavior of female pygmy slow lorises. Urine scent markings have a strong characteristic odor and are used to communication information about social relationships.|$|E
5|$|To help clarify {{species and}} {{subspecies}} boundaries, {{and to establish}} whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D-loop and cytochrome b. Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus (including the pygmy slow <b>loris</b> (N.pygmaeus), Bornean slow <b>loris</b> (N. menagensis) and the Javan slow <b>loris</b> (N.javanicus)) were shown to be genetically distinct, the analysis suggested that DNA sequences from selected individuals of Sunda slow <b>loris</b> (N.coucang) and Bengal slow <b>loris</b> (N.bengalensis) shared a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than {{with other members of}} their own respective species. The authors suggest that this result may be explained by introgressive hybridization, as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand; the precise origin of one of the N.coucang individuals was not known. This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between N.bengalensis and N.coucang, and suggested that there has indeed been gene flow between the two species.|$|E
5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow <b>loris</b> hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow <b>loris</b> is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam, confiscated pygmy lorises {{are usually}} {{taken to the}} Endangered Primate Rescue Centre in Cúc Phương National Park, to be reintroduced into the wild. Non-experts may find it {{difficult}} to distinguish between the pygmy slow <b>loris</b> and the Sunda slow <b>loris,</b> as both have similarly reddish fur, which is variable in colors. In international shipments, pygmy lorises may be even mixed up with pottos or lemurs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the pygmy slow <b>loris</b> is seriously threatened by hunting and trade. Within its geographic range and neighbor countries, {{the trade in}} the pygmy slow <b>loris</b> has recently increased due to economic changes and human population growth, and the trend is expected to continue. Decreased sightings {{in the field and}} at animal markets indicate that wild populations are being depleted since the low reproduction rate of the pygmy slow <b>loris</b> cannot keep pace with these large-scale off-takes. Accordingly, conservationists and field biologists fear local extinctions in the near future. Between 1998 and 2006, 70% of pygmy slow lorises seized by authorities died before reaching a sheltering zoo, resulting in replacement demand and additional captures from the wild.|$|E
5|$|In northeastern South Carolina, {{the outer}} rainbands {{produced}} moderate winds reaching 45mph (72km/h) at Myrtle Beach. Rainfall was light, peaking at 1.34inches (34mm) in <b>Loris.</b>|$|E
5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all <b>loris</b> species is locomotion: the Sunda slow <b>loris</b> moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow <b>loris</b> changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{is one of}} the {{few times}} the Sunda slow <b>loris</b> {{aggregates}} with conspecifics, as it is largely solitary. One study recorded that the most slow lorises ever seen together was six; this appeared to be a female in estrus and five males following her. This may suggest a more promiscuous mating system, where females mate with more than one male. Despite this, its testis size is small compared with similar sized promsimians, which is indicative of monogamy. In the wild the mating system of the Sunda slow <b>loris</b> is thought to vary between populations.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal slow <b>loris</b> {{is not a}} {{seasonal}} breeder, unlike the pygmy slow <b>loris.</b> Females in an estrous cycle attract males with a loud whistle. Females reproduce every 12–18months and have a six-month gestation. Because they are not seasonal breeders, females could become pregnant when their offspring are approximately 6 months old, making possible for females to produce two offspring per year. Females typically {{give birth to a}} single offspring, although twins rarely occur. This differs from the sympatric pygmy slow <b>loris,</b> which commonly has twins. The mother carries her young about three months before they become independent, although they may be temporarily left on branches while the mother searches for food. Sexual maturity is reached at approximately 20months of age. The species is known to live up to 20years.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the pygmy slow <b>loris</b> is seasonal. In north Vietnam, for example, {{the winter}} is {{characterized}} by low rainfalls and temperatures as low as , when there is little growth of vegetation in forests, few insects, and limited food resources. The pygmy slow <b>loris</b> will also consume insects that have been exposed by its bamboo-gouging activities. It will use its toothcomb to clean an area of lichens and fungi prior to gouging. The animals conserve energy in the colder winter months by reducing movement, often {{to the point of}} complete inactivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{lacrimal}} fossa, {{a depression}} in the skull, {{is located on the}} upper surface of the skull in most lorisids, but Schwartz found that it was further to the back, inside the orbit (eye socket) in the false potto and the slow <b>loris.</b> Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 pottos examined. The coronoid process of the mandible is said to be more hooked in the false potto than in the potto and slow <b>loris.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebrate}} fauna of {{the region}} includes 24 species of mammals, 87 species of birds, nine species of reptiles and eight species of amphibians. The ] disappeared from {{the region in the}} 1940s at the latest. At present, the largest and the most commonly seen mammal is the sambar deer. Some research findings estimate the population of sambar deer to be around 1500 to 2000, possibly more than the carrying capacity of the plains. Other mammal species found in the park include Kelaart's long-clawed shrews, toque macaques, purple-faced langurs, rusty-spotted cat, Sri Lankan leopards, wild boars, stripe-necked mongooses, Sri Lankan spotted chevrotains, Indian muntjacs, and grizzled giant squirrels. Fishing cats and European otters visit the wetlands of the park to prey on aquatic animals. A subspecies of red slender <b>loris,</b> the Horton Plains slender <b>loris</b> (<b>Loris</b> tardigradus nycticeboides formerly sometimes considered as <b>Loris</b> lydekkerianus nycticeboides) is found only in highlands of Sri Lanka and {{is considered one of the}} world's most endangered primates. In July 2010 a group of researchers from the Zoological Society of London was able to photograph the mammal for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Vocalizations of the pygmy slow <b>loris</b> {{include a}} short whistle, mother-infant contact calls, and a {{whistling}} sound produced during estrus.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow <b>loris</b> has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow <b>loris</b> it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow <b>loris</b> is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow <b>loris</b> skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal slow <b>loris</b> {{has a small}} {{swelling}} on the {{ventral side}} of its elbow called the brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The oil has been analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, {{and it has been}} shown that almost half of the several dozen volatile or semi-volatile chemicals present do not occur in the closely related pygmy slow <b>loris.</b> The most predominant component was the phenolic compound m-cresol. The authors of the study suggest that the chemically complex oils may help the lorises communicate with each other, allowing them to transmit by scent information about sex, age, health and nutritional status, and dominance.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow <b>loris</b> may grin or bare its teeth. When stressed, infants may grin, while adults bear {{their teeth}} to show {{aggression}} or fear, but also during play.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow <b>loris</b> has {{declined}} in numbers {{as a result}} of extensive habitat degradation throughout its range, including north-eastern Cambodia, the Yunnan Province of China, and Vietnam. In Yunnan province, nearly all primary evergreen forests have vanished and secondary forests have been heavily degraded; as of 2005, forest cover has been reduced by 42% since the mid-1990s. The use of defoliants, such as Agent Orange, during the Vietnam War and the ongoing clearing of forests in Vietnam have resulted in a considerable loss of habitat. As of 2003, the forest cover had been reduced to 30% of its original area, with only 10% of the remaining forest consisting of the closed-canopy forests preferred by the pygmy slow <b>loris.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow <b>loris</b> {{produces}} an apocrine secretion on scent glands near their elbow (brachial glands). This clear liquid, when mixed with its saliva, creates a volatile, noxious toxin. When startled, the slow <b>loris</b> licks its brachial glands and applies the secretion to its heads. The oily secretion contains a complex mixture of volatile and semi-volatile components; one chemical analysis indicated over 200 components were present. One {{of the components}} {{is a member of}} the secretoglobin family of proteins, and similar to an allergenic protein found in cat dander. The similarity between the brachial gland secretions and domestic cat allergens may account for anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two forms}} of the Javan slow <b>loris,</b> {{distinguished}} mainly by differences in hair length. These have occasionally been recognized as separate species, N.javanicus and N.ornatus, but are currently both classified as a single species, although their exact taxonomic status remains unclear.|$|E
