The fs laser used was configured in a four-wave mixing (FWM) system {{which can be used}} to distinguish graphene layer thickness and count the number of layers using the linear relationship between the FWM signal intensity and the graphene thickness. Furthermore, FWM imaging has been successfully applied to achieve in situ, real-time monitoring of the fs laser graphene thinning process.

40|$|A {{new theory}} for {{predicting}} the windprofile over a canopy has been evaluated. The theory was first presented by Harman and Finnigan (2007). The theory {{relies on the}} forming of a mixing-layer above the canopy, due to different mean wind in and above the canopy. Characteristics from both mixing-layer and Monin Obukhov similarity theory {{have been used to}} develop the governingequations that give the wind profile. The theory has been used to calculate wind profiles for sixdifferent atmospheric stabilities. In order to evaluate the theory, profiles from the theory have beencompared to measurements from Jädraås forest, Sweden. Profiles from Monin Obukhov similarity theory were also used for comparison. In general the mixing-layer theory gives better results than Monin Obukhov similarity theory. Agreement with measurements is good in neutral conditions, but fails when the atmospheric stability is altered, especially in convective conditions. This is believed to be due to the canopy <b>lacking</b> in <b>thickness.</b> The mean wind speed is systematically underestimated and this is also believed to be caused by insufficient thickness of the canopy.

Methods: We surveyed patients, pathology, and treatment for invasive BCCs and SCCs in 1 Australian region in 2000 through 2001. Results: BCC size increased with increasing time since first noticed. Relative to mean size at 0 to 2 months, the mean size ratio was 1. 10 at 2 to 8 months and increased steadily to 1. 81 at 5 to 10 years (P <. 001). Few BCCs were untreated beyond 10 years. There was no consistent evidence that SCC size increased with increasing time. Larger BCCs were independently associated with older age, male sex, no skin checks by a physician, aggressive tumor type, ulceration and lesion-associated scar tissue, and larger SCCs with male sex, skin checks by a physician every 1 to 3 months, and location on limbs. Limitations: Patient recall of dates and <b>lack</b> of <b>thickness</b> for SCCs are limitations.

40|$|AbstractThere {{is a lot}} {{of local}} {{corrosion}} damage on the upper flanges under rail sleepers in the plate girder railway bridges. Since the sleepers are put on the upper flanges directly, the corrosion at the boundary progresses faster and causes a lack of the flange thickness through erosion, wet conditions among others due to contact of sleepers. Consequently, the strength of the plate girder decreases. Since the local corrosion often occurs on the upper flange under the sleepers, evaluation of the remaining strength of the plate girder with such corrosion damage is a very important problem for the maintenance. This paper presents an evaluation method for the remaining strength of a plate girder with local corrosion on the upper flange under sleepers, in which the remaining strength can be derived easily based on the buckling stress of the upper flange with <b>lack</b> of <b>thickness</b> due to corrosion. The ultimate behavior of the plate girder with corrosion is analyzed using the non-linear finite element method, and also some loading tests are conducted. In order to discuss the applicability of the evaluation formula, a comparison of the remaining strengths with the experimental and FEM results is made and it is concluded that the remaining strength can be accurately evaluated by the presented method...|$|R
50|$|Linear enamel {{hypoplasia}} (LEH) is {{a developmental}} dental deficiency that indicates the <b>lack</b> of <b>thickness</b> of enamel. LEHs {{are caused by}} periodic physiological disturbance to enamel matrix secretion during people at young age when teeth are growing. In archaeological researches, teeth are well preserved in the fossil remains and enamel is the hardest tissue of the human body, which is not easily to be destroyed. Mature human dental enamel {{is made up of}} 96% inorganic material (crystalline hyproxypaite),which is not likely to decay through time, and only contents 2% water and 2% protein. Ameloblast cells form hard outermost layers for enamel forming surface crowns. Any systematic disturbance that disrupts the ameloblast cells processing the enamel in human early age, alters the direction of movement. If the ameloblast cells do not recover from a disturbance, these ameloblasts cells will stop forming further enamel and results in enamel hypoplasia. There are four types of enamel hypoplasia: pits, vertical grooves, missing enamel and horizontal grooves and horizontal grooves presenting a single sharp line on the crown surface is commonly regarded as linear hypoplasia. The mark of teeth due to enamel hypolasia is permanent, since EH is formed in the premature time of teeth and teeth is not likely to change or decay after it gets matured.|$|R

The salt diapirs of the Late Proterozoic Hormoz Formation in the area are present only in southeast and northwest of the Qatar Arch, while they are absent around the crest of this arch (Husseini 2000) (Fig.  3).

We show that key institutional developments such as the development of formalized IP exchanges suggest that effective market design may be possible for some innovation markets. Finally, our analysis suggests that markets for ideas are beset by the "repugnance" problem: from the perspective of market design, Open Science is an institution that places normative value on "free" disclosure and so undermines the ability of ideas producers to earn market-based returns for producing even very valuable "pure" knowledge.

Analysis of current Analytic modeling indicated that that current COPV models <b>lacked</b> sufficient <b>thickness</b> corrections to predict impact damage. After a comprehensive study of available published data and numerous numerical studies based on observed data from Langley, the analytic framework for modeling the behavior was determined lacking and both Poe and Bogan suggested any short term (3 yr) result for Jove would be overly ambitious and emphasis should be placed on transverse shear moduli studies. Transverse shear moduli determination is relevant to the study of fatigue, fracture and aging effects in composite structures.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Two-dimensional {{transition}} metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently come under intense investigation as {{building blocks for}} van der Waals heterostructure electronics. One {{of the most promising}} TMDs is MoS₂, which transitions from an indirect bandgap (1. 3 eV) in its bulk state to a direct band gap (1. 8 eV) in its single layer state making it suitable for optoelectronic and transistor applications. The synthesis of high quality single layer MoS₂ on large substrates, however, remains a challenge. Although, mechanical exfoliation is capable of producing the highest quality material, it is limited by small surface areas and is not scalable. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is also widely utilized but exhibits a <b>lack</b> of <b>thickness</b> control, poor process stability, and requires high deposition temperatures (typically above 650 °C). Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is natural technique for the synthesis of 2 D materials. ALD is a CVD technique in which reactants are introduced to the chamber sequentially rather than simultaneously. Sequential self-limiting surface reactions allow for precise thickness control, high conformality, and scalability to large surface areas. The objective of this work is to demonstrate low temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) of monolayer to few layer MoS₂ uniformly across 150 mm diameter SiO₂/Si and quartz substrates. Purge separated cycles of MoCl₅ and H₂S precursors were used at reactor temperatures of up to 475 °C. Raman scattering studies show clearly the in-plane (E¹₂g) and out-of-plane (A₁g) modes of MoS₂. The separation of the E¹₂g and A₁g peaks is shown to be a function of the number of ALD cycles, shifting closer together with fewer layers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that stoichiometry is improved by post deposition annealing in a sulfur ambient.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 80 - 90). Vanadium dioxide (VO 2) is a material that {{has attracted a}} lot of attention for its prospective potential to be utilized in the eld of electrical and ultrafast optical switching in one hand, and for the fundamental physics that can be revealed through studying this strongly correlated material on the other hand. One of the most attractive qualities of VO 2 is the metal-insulator transition (MIT) which takes place slightly above room temperature in this material. Controlling such phase transition through external stimuli would open unprecedented avenues of electrical and optical applications. However, thin VO 2 nanocrystal are required to overcome the limitation imposed thought the Thomas-Fermi screening length which limits the changes and the control that external electrical stimuli would have on any crystal that exceeds this length. The screening length in VO 2 is known to be no more than 6 nm. Here, we avoided the use of epitaxial and sputtered lms for the complications in such materials that arise from the stress due to lattice mismatch and the interdi usion with substrates in epitaxial lms, and the polycrystalline nature of sputtered lms. In this work, vapor-phase grown VO 2 nanocrystals are used instead. One reason behind this is that unlike epitaxial lms vapor-phase grown VO 2 nanocrystals can be released out of the growth substrate and transferred in order to eliminate the stress induced on the crystals due to adhesion to the substrate. The main shortcoming of this type of crystals, which is addressed thoroughly in this study, is that vapor-phase grown VO 2 nanocrystals are produced with dimensions no less than 30 nm due to the <b>lack</b> of <b>thickness</b> control in physical vapor deposition technique. Mainly in this study, a systematic method to mill down vapor-phase grown VO 2 nanocrystals to sub- 5 nm thicknesses is developed. Ar-ion milling is utilized to achieve this goal.

The findings implicate myelin as an underlying neurobiological factor to brain alterations in normal development and aging, with cognitive links, as well as suggesting a clinical application in dementia. The human brain undergoes large structural changes through life with contemporaneous alterations in most cognitive functions. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s dementia are characterized by deviations from these normal age-related change patterns. The advent of modern neuroimaging has yielded important new knowledge concerning brain development and aging, its aberrant path in disease, {{and its relation to}} cognition. Based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for instance, structural measures such as volume and cortical thickness can be derived. A plethora of studies demonstrate that these measures show age-related differences, correlate with memory, attention and other cognitive functions, and demonstrate significant atrophy in specific regions in Alzheimer’s dementia. Still, both volume and <b>thickness</b> <b>lack</b> specificity regarding the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Interestingly, studies demonstrate that, by using signal intensity derived from T 1 - and T 2 -weighted MRI scans, more information about underlying neurobiological processes can be obtained. For instance, a recent report shows how increased sensitivity to myelin could be obtained by dividing the T 1 w signal by a co-registered T 2 w image, enabling the opportunity to putatively assess myelin in vivo. The present thesis aims to assess myelin structure across the lifespan using signal intensity, and test for cognitive links to intracortical myelin maturation and senescence. In addition, we probe the ability to increase detection of Alzheimer’s dementia to potentially show clinical relevance...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} how geometric factors affect arterial-to-venous (AV) oxygen shunting, {{a mathematical model}} of diffusive oxygen transport in the renal cortex was developed. Preglomerular vascular geometry was investigated using light microscopy (providing vein shape, AV separation, and capillary density near arteries) and published micro-computed tomography (CT) data (providing vessel size and AV separation; Nordsletten DA, Blackett S, Bentley MD, Ritman EL, Smith NP. IUPS Physiome Project. [URL] A "U-shaped" relationship was observed between the arterial radius and {{the distance between the}} arterial and venous lumens. Veins were found to partially wrap around the artery more consistently for larger rather than smaller arteries. Intrarenal arteries were surrounded by an area of fibrous tissue, <b>lacking</b> capillaries, the <b>thickness</b> of which increased from ∼ 5 μm for the smallest arteries (200 -μm diameter). Capillary density was greater near smaller arteries than larger arteries. No capillaries were observed between wrapped AV vessel pairs. The computational model comprised a single AV pair in cross section. Geometric parameters critical in renal oxygen transport were altered according to variations observed by CT and light microscopy. Lumen separation and wrapping of the vein around the artery were found to be the critical geometric factors determining the amount of oxygen shunted between AV pairs. AV oxygen shunting increases both as lumen separation decreases and as the degree of wrapping increases. The model also predicts that capillaries not only deliver oxygen, but can also remove oxygen from the cortical parenchyma close to an AV pair. Thus the presence of oxygen sinks (capillaries or tubules) near arteries would reduce the effectiveness of AV oxygen shunting. Collectively, these data suggest that AV oxygen shunting would be favored in larger vessels common to the cortical and medullary circulations (i. e., arcuate and proximal interlobular arteries) rather than the smaller vessels specific to the cortical circulation (distal interlobular arteries and afferent arterioles) ...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This study reports an investigation of the structure and stratigraphy of the downdip Yegua sandstones at Edna Field, Jackson County, South Texas. The study is based on 22. 9 square miles of three dimensional (3 -D) seismic data, well-logs from 15 wells, 9 paleontologic reports, 3 check-shot velocity surveys and 2 synthetic seismograms. The seismic sequence stratigraphic approaches are used to infer structural and stratigraphic features that may have been overlooked from the previous interpretations. Four sequence boundaries or correlative paleohorizons are interpreted within the Yegua interval: Discorbis yegua (38. 2 Ma), Nodosaria mexicana (38. 8 Ma), Anomalina umbonatus (39. 5 Ma), and one horizon denoted as Noforaminifera. Information generated from structure and isochron maps are used to delineate the depositional history of the downdip Yegua. Seismic data indicated that the study area is dominated by a long southwest northeast oriented normal growth fault. Several growth-fault-related antithetic faults developed on the downthrown side of the major fault, creating a series of subparallel fault system. Analysis of the time structure and-isochron maps suggests the growth fault {{plays an important role in}} providing sediment accomodation space. Sediments were accumulated in a number of small depocenters and were scattered largely along the downthrown side of the growth fault. The growth-fault-related antithetic faults are believed to control the sediment fairways and sediment <b>thickness.</b> <b>Lack</b> of good biostratigraphic control made it difficult to identify depositional sequences and system tracts in Yegua interval with confidence. On the basis of seismic data and well-log data, the Yegua sequences are interpreted as either lowstand basin floor fan or lowstand slope fan. This lowstand fan is deposited during the latest part of relative sea level fall and beginning of relative sea level rise...|$|R
40|$|Through {{my studies}} of 3 D Design and International Studies I have {{developed}} an interest in applying my knowledge to reconstruction of destroyed or deteriorated antiquities. After speaking with Björn Anderson, a professor in Art History, I decided to apply my 3 D modeling skills to the reconstruction of a heavily damaged Nabatean sculpture on a tomb (known as Tomb 70) that {{date back to the}} 1 st century BCE/CE. Because of the damage, archaeologists are unable to fully understand how this tomb originally appeared and whether, indeed, it was a tomb at all. Anderson believes that the sculpture above the pediment on the north façade of the tomb is the key to understanding this structure’s purpose in ancient Nabatean society; however, the damage has made the sculpture unrecognizable. In order to assist in his research, I created a model of the sculpture as it appears today so that he can more closely analyze its form. To further understand the sculpture in context, I created a scaled replica of the tomb itself showing how I believe it would have appeared in its prime. Professor Anderson provided me with his measurements and photos of Tomb 70 and the sculpture, as well as a 3 D file he created of the sculpture using PhotoScan. I began by analyzing Anderson’s 3 D model of the sculpture. This file gave me an accurate model of the sculpture as it appears today, yet <b>lacked</b> a <b>thickness</b> needed to be 3 D printed. To remedy this issue I imported the file into another 3 D software to add the necessary thickness. I then began to model the tomb to scale starting by drafting an initial layout of the building in AutoCAD. I took these schematics and modeled the initial structure in 3 Ds Max. Then I studied the pictures of Tomb 70 in comparison with other structures in Petra to infer how the details that are heavily worn would have originally appeared. I then added these details to my 3 D model resulting in a scaled replica of how I believe the tomb would have appeared. The final step was to have both finished models 3 D printed. I choose to print the Tomb in powder in a color similar to sandstone, to match the texture and color of the original structure. The sculpture I had printed in ABS plastic, which is much more durable than powder, so that the model could be handled for close research of its form. Finally, I created various renders of both models to be used as quality illustrations for publication. My goal is that these models will assist Professor Anderson in understanding the original structure and analyzing what the sculpture represents. Through the process of recreating ancient structures, I learned how to apply my technical skills and knowledge of 3 D modeling to analyze a deteriorated building and perform research of similar structures to recreate what the structure might have looked like in history as accurately as possible. Modern processes such as 3 D printing can provide researchers with physical models of ancient objects {{that would not have been}} possible otherwise. I believe that I could use 3 D modeling to recreate ancient artifacts, buildings, and even entire cities. Overall I hope to continue using my skills to assist in furthering our research and understanding of the people and places lost to us in history...|$|R
