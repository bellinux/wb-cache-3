40|$|Restoration of ligase {{activity}} {{has been observed}} in E. coli K 12 ligts 7 strain lysogenic for Mu, in presence as well in absence of <b>lysogenic</b> <b>immunity.</b> This restoration consist in phenotypic reversal of temperature sensitivity of E. coli ligts 7 which also regain the ability to sustain the complete growth cycle of T 4 lig-phages. It is possible to put {{under the control of}} the gal operon the expression of the viral gene responsible for the restoration effect. This new gene of Mu has been named 'lig'. A 5 kb fragment responsible for the reported effects and localized between genes gam and lys of Mu genome has been cloned in pBR 322. This recombinant plasmid used for transforming ligts 7 strain restores in it normal behaviour for ligation of Okazaki pieces...|$|E
40|$|Shigella dysenteriae {{cells were}} {{infected}} with phage P 1 or P 1 cl. The outcome of superinfection of these cells with phage T 1. Sh or T 1. Sh(P 1) or P 1 cl was studied {{as a function}} of time after the initial infection. Cells undergoing either a lytic response or a lysogenic response to the primary infection develop the ability to specifically restrict T 1. Sh between 30 and 45 min. Between 15 and 30 min, the cells seem to develop the ability to produce T 1. Sh(P 1) after infection by T 1. Sh. However, reasons are given for believing that this apparent time difference is consistent with a simultaneous development of the two capacities (restriction and modification) within the cell. This development occurs between 30 and 45 min. Cells infected with P 1 cl and superinfected 45 or more min later with T 1. Sh(P 1) can yield both P 1 cl and T 1. Cells infected with P 1 become resistant to infection by P 1 cl within 5 to 10 min. It is argued that this early immunity is not necessarily different in mechanism from true <b>lysogenic</b> <b>immunity...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} mutants {{derived from the}} {{temperate}} corynebacteriophages βtox+, γtox−, and Ltox+ was isolated and characterized. In three-factor crosses between mutant β phages the relative map order of the genetic markers determining extended host ranges (h and h′) and loss of ability to lysogenize (c) {{was found to be}} h [...] c [...] h′. Recombination between markers was observed in matings between phage β and the heteroimmune corynebacteriophages γ and L. In such matings between heteroimmune phages the c markers of phages β and γ failed to segregate from the imm markers which determine the specificity of <b>lysogenic</b> <b>immunity</b> in these phages. The factor which directs the synthesis of diphtherial toxin during infection of appropriate corynebacterial hosts by toxinogenic corynebacteriophages is designated tox+. It was possible to show that the tox+ determinant of phage β behaves as a single genetic element which occupies a position between the loci h and imm on the genetic map of this phage. Genetic recombination between mutants of phage β occurred at very low frequencies in biparental matings performed by mixed infection of Corynebacterium diphtheriae C 7 s(−) tox−. Considerably higher recombination frequencies were observed when lysogenic bacterial strains carrying one parental phage as prophage were induced by ultraviolet irradiation and then superinfected by the second parental phage. Maximal stimulation of genetic recombination between mutant β phages was detected when superinfection followed ultraviolet irradiation of the lysogenic cells within a limited period of time. In matings between phages with incomplete genetic homology, the stimulation of recombination by ultraviolet radiation was much less effective...|$|E
40|$|The injudicious use of {{antibiotics}} not only in medicine but also to promote the growth of farm animals {{has led to the}} development of antibiotic resistance against many bacterial diseases. One of the remedy against such drug resistant bacterial infections is the application of phage (Bacteriophage) therapy. Phage therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infections. There are two types of phages based on their type of life cycle: the lytic and the lysogenic phages. Only the lytic phages are used in phage therapy, because of the disadvantages of <b>lysogenic</b> pahges (Superinfection <b>immunity,</b> <b>lysogenic</b> conversion, specialized transduction). Apart from live phages the phage byproducts like phage lysins can also be used specifically against certain bacterial infections. The reports indicate that appropriate administration of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by bacteria, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus etc. In the coming time the phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of antimicrobial therapy, particularly the appearance of multidrug resistance bacteria (super bugs) ...|$|R
