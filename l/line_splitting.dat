5|$|A First Avenue line, {{consisting}} of four tracks, would stretch from the Harlem River to City Hall. At 10th Street, the line would {{cease to be}} a four-track line, with the <b>line</b> <b>splitting</b> into two branches. One branch would run to a loop near City Hall, while the other {{would go to a}} new Lafayette Avenue line in Brooklyn, running via Third Avenue and the Bowery. On the northern end, at 161st Street, the line would split into two 3-track lines. One of the lines would go to Southern Boulevard and Fordham Road; the other would continue to 241st Street after merging with the existing IRT White Plains Road Line at Fordham Road and Webster Avenue.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this is not}} to {{say that}} the Bohr-Sommerfeld model was without its successes. Calculations based on the Bohr–Sommerfeld model were able to {{accurately}} explain a number of more complex atomic spectral effects. For example, up to first-order perturbations, the Bohr model and quantum mechanics make the same predictions for the spectral <b>line</b> <b>splitting</b> in the Stark effect. At higher-order perturbations, however, the Bohr model and quantum mechanics differ, and measurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths helped confirm the correctness of quantum mechanics over the Bohr model. The prevailing theory behind this difference lies in the shapes of the orbitals of the electrons, which vary according to the energy state of the electron.|$|E

25|$|Construction on {{the southernmost}} {{section of the}} line to 89th Street, {{just south of the}} 86th Street station, began in late October 1912. The lower section of the line was {{constructed}} along with several branch lines, which replaced former surface railroads. These lines are the BMT West End <b>Line</b> <b>splitting</b> south of 36th Street, and the BMT Sea Beach Line leaving south of 59th Street. In anticipation of the opening of the subway, several housing and development booms occurred along Fourth Avenue, particularly in Bay Ridge. On January 24, 1913, construction begun on Route 11B2, the section between 61st Street and 89th Street. This section was built as a two-track structure under the west side of Fourth Avenue with plans for two future tracks {{on the east side of}} the street. The bridge across the Long Island Rail Road's Bay Ridge Branch, but under Fourth Avenue, was built for four tracks, but only the space for the two west tracks were ever used. The 86th Street station was designed for eventual conversion into a four-track, two island platform express station. If the two additional tracks were built, the east platform on all local stops south of 59th Street would be removed. Construction was completed on this section in 1915. On March 15, 1913, construction began on Route 11B1, the section between 43rd Street and 61st Street. Originally, this section was planned to have two tracks, but after the connection to the Sea Beach Line was added to the plan during the middle of construction, the plan was changed to four tracks. This section was completed in 1915.|$|E

A branch would split to run under Ovington Avenue and Senator Street, with a tunnel under the Narrows to Staten Island at the St. George Terminal. The line would split, {{with the north}} branch ending at Westervelt Avenue around Hamilton Avenue, and the south branch ending at Grant Street around St. Pauls Street. It was presumably {{designed}} this way to provide future service to both the Main Line and North Shore Staten Island Railway lines. The Staten Island Tunnel commenced construction in 1923 to serve the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, but was not completed.|$|E

60|$|What {{actually}} met my eye {{was very different}} from this childish expectation of mine. To the north there was a long low cape, the name of which has now escaped me. In the evening light it had been of the same greyish green tint as the other headlands; but now, as the darkness fell, it gradually broke into a dull glow, like a cooling iron. On that wild night, seen and lost with the heave and sweep of the boat, this lurid streak carried with it a vague but sinister suggestion. The red <b>line</b> <b>splitting</b> the darkness might have been a giant half-forged sword-blade with its point towards England.|$|E
