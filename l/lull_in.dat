5|$|Although {{there were}} minor exchanges {{of fire and}} some patrol activity, there was a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the battle on 14March in the {{northern}} sector. The following day, three Japanese infantry battalions fell on the US positions before dawn. They made some progress around Cox's Creek, but US forces counterattacked with air support, bazookas and flamethrowers, retaking part of the line. A platoon of M4 Sherman tanks arrived during the afternoon, and at around 3:00pm they attacked the Japanese with supporting artillery fire and regained more of the perimeter. From there, the battle followed a similar pattern, with a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the fighting on 16March, followed by a renewed effort by the Japanese the next day, with several US positions being overrun.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the civil}} {{conflict}} came a small <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> fighting between the expanding Ottomans and Byzantines. In 1361 Didymoteichon fell to the Turks. Orhan's successor, Murad I was more concerned with his Anatolian positions. However, just like Alp Arslan of the Seljuk Turks, Murad I left the taking of Byzantine territory to his vassals with Philippopolis falling after major campaigning between 1363–4 and Adrianople succumbing to the Ottomans in 1369.|$|E
5|$|French and Wabanaki Confederacy raiding {{activity}} {{continued in}} northern Massachusetts in 1705, {{against which the}} English colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the raiding while the French and English leaders negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. Raids by Indians persisted {{until the end of}} the war, sometimes with French participation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception, with some reviewers concerned {{that it is}} too derivative and predictable, while others were more positive. The producers were happy to have started well, survived the ratings <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the middle, and ended with an upward curve in the last two weeks. Audience breakdowns indicate that a higher proportion of younger viewers were tuning in to Survivors than many other shows.|$|E

5|$|There was a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> {{fighting}} over the winter of 1812–13 while both the Russians and the French rebuilt their forces; Napoleon was able to field 350,000 troops. Heartened by France's loss in Russia, Prussia joined with Austria, Sweden, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal in a new coalition. Napoleon assumed command in Germany and inflicted a series of defeats on the Coalition culminating in the Battle of Dresden in August 1813.|$|E
5|$|At 21:50 the British {{artillery}} opened fire, and the Germans {{responded with}} their own artillery and mortars which forced most of the British to take cover, for the next fifteen minutes, until a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the German fire allowed them to continue. In the lead 'C' Company had crossed the start line at 22:00, however all its officers and the company sergeant major (CSM) became casualties and a senior non-commissioned officer took command of the company. They continued to advance through the artillery and mortar bombardment, guided towards their objective by tracer rounds from the Hussars tanks. Repeatedly hit by the artillery and tanks, Bréville was in flames {{by the time the}} company's fifteen survivors reached the village.|$|E
5|$|Back at the front, Potemkin {{won more}} {{military}} acclaim, but then fell ill; rejecting medicine, he recovered only slowly. After a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> hostilities in 1772 his movements are unclear, {{but it seems}} that he returned to St. Petersburg where he is recorded, perhaps apocryphally, to have been one of Catherine's closest advisers. Though Orlov was replaced as her favourite, it was not Potemkin who benefited. Alexander Vasilchikov, another Horse-Guardsman, replaced Orlov as the queen's lover. Potemkin returned to war in 1773 as Lieutenant-General to fight in Silistria. It appears that Catherine missed him, and that Potemkin took a December letter from her as a summons. In any case Potemkin returned to St. Petersburg as a war hero.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} 198284 Suresh Srivastava, a GSI {{geologist}} at the Palaeontology Division of the GSI's Western Region, collected {{large numbers of}} bone fossil fragments from Rahioli, and also precisely mapped the area.

Pant, meticulously cleaned many of the skeletal parts (braincase, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, sacrum, thigh bone, upper arm, shin bones, and others), leading to the publication of multiple research papers. There was a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> further activity until a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with Punjab University in 199495.|$|E
5|$|Estate house design {{declined}} in {{importance in the}} twentieth century. An exception was the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890, he undertook a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller in the Adam style. Skibo Castle was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912–14) for {{the owner of a}} Moscow department store. There was a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> building after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural country houses.|$|E
5|$|The attack {{followed}} a two-year <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> Allied aircraft carrier operations against Norway, {{and took the}} German forces by surprise. The choice of the target area was guided by intelligence gained from decoding German radio signals and reports from Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service agents, and two Norwegian airmen flew with the attack force to provide advice on the local geography. While historians have {{found it difficult to}} determine the exact number of ships sunk, Operation Leader damaged the German war effort by considerably disrupting the convoy system in the region and reducing shipments of iron ore.|$|E

5000|$|Variable-speed wind {{turbines}} can (very briefly) produce {{more power than}} the current wind conditions can support, by storing some wind energy as kinetic energy (accelerating during brief gusts of faster wind) and later converting that kinetic energy to electric energy (decelerating, either when more power is needed elsewhere, or during short <b>lulls</b> <b>in</b> the wind, or both).|$|R
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the plague caused a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the fighting during the year 543. The following year Khosrau defeated a Byzantine army of 30,000 men, but unsuccessfully besieged the major city of Edessa. Both parties made little headway, and in 545 a truce was agreed upon for {{the southern part of}} the Roman-Persian frontier. After that the Lazic War in the North continued for several years, until a second truce in 557, followed by a Fifty Years' Peace in 562. Under its terms, the Persians agreed to abandon Lazica in exchange for an annual tribute of 400 or 500 pounds of gold (30,000 solidi) to be paid by the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The {{version of}} events {{recorded}} by history {{is based on the}} accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes's column. Burnham, Ingram and Gooding's stories closely corroborate each other; their {{version of events}} was accepted as true by the Court of Inquiry at Bulawayo in December 1893. First-hand Matabele accounts such as Mjaan's, which were first recorded during 1894, appear to confirm the character of the break-out, saying that three of the white men they were fighting—including Burnham, whom several of them recognised—left during a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the battle, just after Wilson withdrew to his final position.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} several species {{left over from}} the synonymizations of Creosaurus and Labrosaurus with Allosaurus. Creosaurus potens was named by <b>Lull</b> <b>in</b> 1911 for a {{vertebra}} from the Early Cretaceous of Maryland. It is now regarded as a dubious theropod. Labrosaurus stechowi, described in 1920 by Janensch based on isolated Ceratosaurus-like teeth from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, Although Donald F. Glut listed it as a species of Allosaurus, it is now considered a dubious ceratosaurian related to Ceratosaurus. L. sulcatus, named by Marsh in 1896 for a Morrison theropod tooth, which like L. stechowi is now regarded as a dubious Ceratosaurus-like ceratosaur.|$|E

5|$|After this {{there was}} a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> {{fighting}} in the Zadar area {{until the end of}} the month, with only sporadic small-arms fire and minor skirmishes. During that period, the JNA's efforts were concentrated on the Battle of Šibenik and an advance towards Sinj. Although the ZNG defended Šibenik and Sinj it lost Drniš, abandoning it before the JNA's arrival on 23 September. During the last week of September the JNA returned its focus to Zadar, stepping up its artillery bombardment of the city and ending its naval blockade on 23 September. On 29 September the JNA edged towards Zadar, capturing the villages of Bulić, Lišane Ostrovičke and Vukšić and announcing its intention to evacuate its Zadar barracks (which was affected by desertions).|$|E
5|$|Constant news of Ottoman {{campaigns against}} Bosnia and Morea but not against Albania {{seemed to suggest}} to Skanderbeg that Mehmed II had been {{considering}} an armistice with Skanderbeg. The latter took advantage of this <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the fighting by preparing for his voyage to Italy and by securing his northern frontiers from a possible attack by Skanderbeg's elusive ally in northern Albania, Lekë Dukagjini, who {{had been trying to}} expand his realm by reaching an agreement with the Turks. In order to curb his ambitions, Skanderbeg seized Shat Fortress and presented it as a gift to Venice. Skanderbeg then established an alliance with Venice against Dukagjini, while Dukagjni was strengthening his Turkish alliance. The new pope issued a bull against Dukagjini, giving him fifteen days to break his alliance with the Ottomans and to reconcile with Skanderbeg, or be subject to interdiction; Dukagjini conceded and chose the former option. He then reestablished his alliance with Skanderbeg and Venice and accepted all of its losses.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{previous}} failures, the Chinese launched another series of attacks from 11:30 and these attacks continued {{for the next}} two hours, again targeting 12 Platoon under the command of Lieutenant John Ward. Failing to break through again, the Chinese suffered heavy casualties before the assault ended. From 13:30 there was another <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> the fighting {{for an hour and a}} half, although D Company continued to endure Chinese mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire. Believing that the battle may continue into the night, Gravener made the decision to pull 12 Platoon back in order to adopt a tighter company perimeter, lest his forward platoon be overrun and destroyed. The movement was completed without incident and, shortly after, the newly vacated position was assaulted by a large Chinese force which had failed to detect the withdrawal. The Chinese moved quickly as they attempted to establish their position on the northern end of the ridge, only to be heavily engaged by Australian machine-gun and rifle fire, and artillery.|$|E
50|$|Availability must be {{measured}} to be determined, ideally with comprehensive monitoring tools ("instrumentation") that are themselves highly available.
