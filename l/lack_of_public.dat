5|$|Perry {{was made}} a platypus because of the animal's {{striking}} appearance and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> knowledge of the animal, which allowed the writers to make things up about the species. Critical reception for the character from both professionals and fans have been considerably positive. Merchandising of the character include plush toys, t-shirts, wooden toys, glasses, and coloring books, along with appearances in literature and a 2009 video game for the Nintendo DS.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1920 Bruce {{made many}} {{journeys}} to the Arctic regions, both for scientific and for commercial purposes. His failure to mount any major exploration ventures after the SNAE is usually attributed to his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> relations skills, powerful enemies, and his fervent Scottish nationalism. By 1919 his health was failing, and he experienced several spells in hospital {{before his death}} in 1921, after which he was almost totally forgotten. In recent years, following the centenary of the Scottish Expedition, efforts have been made to give fuller recognition to his role in the history of scientific polar exploration.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E

5|$|Gliding did {{not return}} to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> interest.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, as details {{surrounding}} {{the crash of}} Flight 1907 began to emerge, the investigation seemed {{to be at least}} partly focused on possible air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, limiting their ability to communicate with foreign pilots, which played a role in crash of Flight 1907. In addition, the military's complete control of the country's aviation was criticized for its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> accountability.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 in the Colonial Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, {{wrote of the}} need for an {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the current Czech law on public procurement. Its aim is to describe the most important problems that occur in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> procurement, and cause ineffi ciency in the management <b>of</b> <b>public</b> fi nance, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> transparency and possible corruption. In this context the paper mainly mentiones the following: <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> motivation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> authorities to demand innovative, more sophisticated solutions through public contracts and thereby making them more effi cient, unused potential of small and medium-sized enterprises within the framework <b>of</b> <b>public</b> contracting, economic ineffi ciency <b>of</b> <b>public</b> contracts, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> openness <b>of</b> <b>public</b> contracts, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> transparency <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> contract process resulting in leaving room for corruption or discrimination of bidders etc. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} propose concrete measures to help solve the problems identifi ed. The most important are these: 50 % reduction in the current limit for "minor contracts",obligation for public authorities to assure three bids, removing rigidities in the act (clarifying the legislation), mandatory publication of the procurement process on the Internet etc. urban development, ineffi ciency, transparency, public procurement, public procurement act, místní rozvoj, neefektivita, transparentnost, veřejná zakázka, zákon o veřejných zakázkách...|$|R

5|$|In {{his first}} inaugural speech in August 1816, Jennings called {{attention}} to the need for an educational plan. In his 1817 annual message to the state legislature, he encouraged the establishment of a free, state-funded education system, as called for in the state constitution, but few of the state's citizens were willing to impose taxes to fund public schools. The state legislature believed priority should be given to creating government infrastructure. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B.

5|$|Smaller squares do exist, {{including}} Dortmund Square, St Peters Square, Queen Square, Woodhouse Square and Hanover Square. While {{the rest}} of Leeds has large open parks, this is something the city centre lacks and most free recreational space is contained within these squares. Since 2000, both City Square and Millennium Square have been redeveloped with hard landscaping. In an interview with Martin Wainwright, the northern editor of The Guardian, architect Irena Bauman, praised City Square for being a well designed and well used public space, however she criticised The Plaza Tower development for its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> space, stating that the only space made available was for service vehicles.|$|E

5|$|With Poland being {{a member}} of the Soviet Bloc, the party's pursuits of power and reform were {{permanently}} hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, acutely conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> support and Soviet reaction).

5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of lithium-ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, {{so it would be}} a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E

Of these eight, Atlanta-based EarthLink and Minnetonka-based US Internet were selected as semifinalists, and each company set up a trial program in Minneapolis before the final decision was made. During this process, outcry arose from both members of the Institute for Local Self Reliance about the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> hearings {{on the subject of the}} network, and from Qwest, another internet service provider who had placed a bid to build and run the network, about the city's plan to be involved in the wireless internet business at all. The deputy chief information officer of Minneapolis, Bill Beck, stated that the city was worried about legal restrictions and lawsuits, which were key reasons for the lack of transparency in the process.|$|E

5|$|The 2/33rd {{remained}} at Mersa Metruh, undertaking defensive duties, until May 1941, {{but did not}} see combat. After this, the 7th Division began to prepare for an invasion of Vichy French-held Syria and Lebanon. A short-lived campaign, from early June until mid-July, the 2/33rd {{took part in the}} fighting around Merdjayoun– attacking Fort Khiam {{in the early stages of}} the campaign– and Jezzine, fighting mainly in disparate company groups. Following the French capitulation, the battalion undertook garrison duties in Lebanon as part of the Allied occupation force established there to defend against a possible German invasion through Turkey; in September the battalion occupied a position around the port of Tripoli. They remained there until early 1942 when the Australian government requested the return of the 7th Division to Australia, following Japan's entry into the war. The battalion's role, and indeed that of the whole 7th Division, in the fighting against the Vichy French was largely censored at the time due to concerns about negative public opinion in Australia and the battalion's historian, William Crooks, notes that later this caused some friction between 7th Division personnel and those from the 6th and 9th Divisions, and a general <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> awareness of what they had done. Casualties sustained by the battalion in Syria and Lebanon numbered 21 dead, 84 wounded and 26 captured.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on 2 December 1917 an {{armistice}} {{was signed}} between Russia and the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk and peace talks began. The newly formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Germans on 3 March 1918, formally {{ending the war}} on the Eastern Front and permitting the redeployment of German forces to the Western Front, altering the balance of power. The treaty also permitted the occupation of large areas of European Russia, and within these territories were large stocks of military equipment previously supplied by the allies. In particular, there were large stocks of such supplies in the northern ports of Murmansk and Archangel. The Allied intervention involved fourteen nations and was conducted over a vast expanse of territory. The initial goals of the Western powers had been to rescue the Czechoslovak Legion which had been fighting the Central Powers on the Eastern Front and had later fought the Bolsheviks, {{as well as to}} secure the supplies of munitions and armaments in Russian ports in order to prevent their capture by German forces, and possibly also to re-establish the Eastern Front. However, with the end of World War I and fearful of Bolshevism, the Allies openly, if only half-heartedly, intervened in the Russian Civil War, giving support to the pro-tsarist anti-Bolshevik White forces as part of the North Russia Campaign. Opposition for the ongoing campaign became widespread however, mostly due to a combination of a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> support and war-weariness; while divided objectives and a lack of an overarching strategy also hampered the effort. These factors, together with the evacuation of the Czechoslovak Legion and the deteriorating military situation, compelled the Allies to withdraw by 1920. With the end of allied support, the Red Army soon defeated the remaining White government forces, leading to their eventual collapse.|$|E
