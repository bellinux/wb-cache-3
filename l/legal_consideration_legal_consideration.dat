This research is conducted using a field survey method along with the techniques of interview, observation and library research. The method of the research is a judicial-normative one.

Meanwhile, public equity consideration deals with fact that a marriage frequently is considered as an alternative solution for the coming social issues.

40|$|There {{are three}} current formats for re-porting the {{performance}} of orthopaedic implants: prospective, randomized clin-ical trials; meta-analyses; and retrospec-tive case series. Maloney 1 argued {{that none of these}} approaches is suitable as an early warning system for problems related to total joint implants because of the long delays between the perfor-mance of the studies and the publica-tion of the results. To address this problem, he proposed the creation of a national joint registry that would ac-complish three goals: it would define the epidemiology of joint replacement surgery in a particular patient popula-tion, provide timely information to the orthopaedic community on the out-comes of joint replacements, and iden-tify risk factors for a poor outcome and then improve results through continu-ous feedback to participating centers and surgeons. The Swedish hip registry is often cited {{as an example of a}} well-functioning national joint registry that fulfills these three goals 2.
