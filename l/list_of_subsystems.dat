40|$|During the 2012 summer {{shutdown}} {{a pair of}} electron lenses will {{be installed}} in RHIC, allowing the beam-beam parameter to be increased by roughly 50 percent. To realize the corresponding luminosity increase bunch intensities have to be increased by 50 percent, to 2. 5 {center_dot} 10 {sup 11 } protons per bunch. We list the various RHIC subsystems that are most affected by this increase, and propose beam studies to ensure their readiness. The proton luminosity in RHIC is presently limited by the beam-beam effect. To overcome this limitation, electron lenses will be installed in IR 10. With the help of these devices, the headon beam-beam kick experienced during proton-proton collisions will be partially compensated, allowing for a larger beam-beam tuneshift at these collision points, and therefore increasing the luminosity. This will be accomplished by increasing the proton bunch intensity from the presently achieved 1. 65 {center_dot} 10 {sup 11 } protons per bunch in 109 bunches per beam to 2. 5 {center_dot} 10 {sup 11 }, thus roughly doubling the luminosity. In a further upgrade we aim for bunch intensities up to 3 {center_dot} 10 {sup 11 } protons per bunch. With RHIC originally being designed for a bunch intensity of 1 {center_dot} 10 {sup 11 } protons per bunch in 56 bunches, this six-fold increase in the total beam intensity by far exceeds the design parameters of the machine, and therefore potentially <b>of</b> its <b>subsystems.</b> In this note, we present a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> major <b>subsystems</b> that are <b>of</b> potential concern regarding this intensity upgrade, show their demonstrated performance at present intensities, and propose measures and beam experiments to study their readiness for the projected future intensities...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose and}} {{objective}} of this analysis is to systematically identify and evaluate hazards related to the Yucca Mountain Project Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF) surface and subsurface conveyor system (for a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> conveyor <b>subsystems</b> see section 3). This process {{is an integral part}} of the systems engineering process; whereby safety is considered during planning, design, testing, and construction. A largely qualitative approach was used since a radiological System Safety Analysis is not required. The risk assessment in this analysis characterizes the accident scenarios associated with the conveyor structures/systems/components in terms of relative risk and includes recommendations for mitigating all identified risks. The priority for recommending and implementing mitigation control features is: (1) Incorporate measures to reduce risks and hazards into the structure/system/component (S/S/C) design, (2) add safety devices and capabilities to the designs that reduce risk, (3) provide devices that detect and warn personnel of hazardous conditions, and (4) develop procedures and conduct training to increase worker awareness of potential hazards, on methods to reduce exposure to hazards, and on the actions required to avoid accidents or correct hazardous conditions. The scope of this analysis is limited to the hazards related to the design of conveyor structures/systems/components (S/S/Cs) that occur during normal operation. Hazards occurring during assembly, test and maintenance or ''off normal'' operations have not been included in this analysis. Construction related work activities are specifically excluded per DOE Order 5481. 1 B section 4. c...|$|R

40|$|Over its 30 {{years of}} space flight history, plus the nearly 10 years of design, {{development}} test and evaluation, the Space Shuttle Orbiter {{is full of}} lessons learned {{in all of its}} numerous and complex subsystems. In the current paper, only selected lessons learned in the areas of the Orbiter propulsion and power subsystems will be described. The particular Orbiter subsystems include: Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), Hydraulics and Water Spray Boiler (WSB), Mechanical Flight Controls, Main Propulsion System (MPS), Fuel Cells and Power Reactant and Storage Devices (PRSD), Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), Reaction Control System (RCS), Electrical Power Distribution (EPDC), electrical wiring and pyrotechnics. Given the complexity and extensive history of each <b>of</b> these <b>subsystems,</b> and the limited scope of this paper, it is impossible to include most of the lessons learned; instead the attempt will be to present a selected few or key lessons, in the judgment of the authors.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{existence}} and uniqueness {{of a state}} of a joint system with given restrictions to subsystems is studied for a Fermion system, where a novel feature is non-commutativity between algebras <b>of</b> <b>subsystems.</b> For an arbitrary (finite or infinite) number <b>of</b> given <b>subsystems,</b> a product state extension is shown to exist if and only if all states <b>of</b> <b>subsystems</b> except at most one are even (with respect to the Fermion number). If the states <b>of</b> all <b>subsystems</b> are pure, then the same condition is shown to be necessary and sufficient for the existence of any joint extension.

For a pair <b>of</b> <b>subsystems,</b> with one <b>of</b> the given <b>subsystem</b> states pure, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a joint extension and the form of all joint extensions (unique for almost all cases) are given.
