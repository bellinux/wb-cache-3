5|$|There are {{different}} {{accounts of the}} rise of Darius to the throne from both Darius himself and Greek historians. The oldest records report a convoluted sequence of events in which Cambyses II <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> murdered his brother Bardiya, and was killed by an infected leg wound. After this, Darius and a group of six nobles traveled to Sikayauvati to kill an usurper, Gaumata, who had taken the throne by pretending to be Bardiya during the true king's absence. Many modern historians believe that Gaumata, in fact, was the true heir Bardiya, with the historical account being altered by Darius to make the coup d'etat appear more legitimate.|$|E
5|$|Von Stroheim's {{original}} edit contained {{two main}} sub-plots that were later cut. The point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible outcomes of Trina and McTeague's life together. The first depicted {{the lives of}} the junkman Zerkow and Maria Miranda Macapa, the young Mexican woman who collects junk for Zerkow and sold Trina the lottery ticket. Maria often talks about her imaginary solid gold dining set with Zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. Eventually, believing she has riches hidden away, Zerkow marries her. He often asks about it, but she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. Zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. He murders her and after having <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> leaps into San Francisco Bay.|$|E
25|$|In 573, Khosrow sent an army under Adarmahan {{to invade}} Syria, while he himself {{along with the}} three Mihranid {{military}} officers Izadgushasp, Fariburz and Bahram Chobin led an army towards Dara, where they captured the city after four months, while Adarmahan sacked several cities in Syria, which included Apamea. Justin reportedly <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> after these Byzantine disasters, and abdicated.|$|E

25|$|Around 1809, Sequoyah began {{creating}} {{a system of}} writing for the Cherokee language. At first he sought to create a character for each word in the language. He spent a year on this effort, leaving his fields unplanted, so that his friends and neighbors thought he had <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> His wife {{is said to have}} burned his initial work, believing it to be witchcraft. He realized that this approach was impractical because it would require too many pictures to be remembered. He tried making a symbol for every idea, but this also caused too many problems to be practical.|$|E
25|$|Wolf's last concert appearance, which {{included}} his early champion Jäger, was in February 1897. Shortly thereafter Wolf slipped into syphilitic insanity, with only occasional spells of wellbeing. He left sixty pages of an unfinished opera, Manuel Venegas, in 1897, {{in a desperate}} attempt to finish before he <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> completely; after mid-1899 he could make no music at all and once even tried to drown himself, after which he was placed in a Vienna asylum at his own insistence. Melanie visited him faithfully during his decline until his death on 22 February 1903, but her unfaithfulness to her husband tortured her and she killed herself in 1906.|$|E
25|$|Believing Kang to have <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> Masterson fires him {{and issues}} {{a warrant for}} his arrest. However, with Velasco's help, Kang tails Rafferty to a {{warehouse}} where he hears Rocky tell Rafferty that Kang must be killed. Rafferty protests that he never wanted Henry killed, and doesn't want his son to die as well. Kang attacks them, but both Rocky and Rafferty escape. Kang is then led into a trap at Santa Monica Airport by Rocky's girlfriend Jill (Grey Griffin). Rocky explains that in the 1970s, he and Rafferty were smuggling cocaine into L.A., but Henry found out. Rocky tried to pay him off, but he refused, so Rocky shot him and dumped his body in the ocean. Rafferty then planted evidence to make Henry look dirty. Rocky tries to kill Kang, but Rafferty intervenes, saving Kang's life {{at the cost of}} his own.|$|E

60|$|On they played, and the Duke <b>lost</b> more. <b>His</b> <b>mind</b> was jaded. He floundered, he made desperate efforts, but plunged {{deeper in}} the slough.

25|$|In July 1883, Macedonski {{undertook}} one of {{his most}} controversial anti-Junimist actions. That month, Literatorul published an epigram signed with the pseudonym Duna, deriding an unnamed author who had <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> Mihai Eminescu—whom many had already come to see as Romania's national poet—had by then developed a mental disorder which had become known to the general public. Ever since that moment, Macedonski has generally been believed to be Duna, and as a result, was faced with much criticism from both readers and commentators. The intense anti-Literatorul press campaign was initiated in August, when writer Grigore Ventura issued an article condemning Macedonski's attitude (published in the Bucharest-based newspaper L'Indépendance Roumaine), with Macedonski responding in the National Liberal organ Românul. During one evening, Macedonski is reported to have been assaulted by anonymous supporters of Eminescu. His previous conflict with Nădejde was also affected by this renewed controversy: while opposed to Junimist policies, the socialists at Contemporanul voiced their admiration for Eminescu's art.|$|E
500|$|Joplin's [...] "last period" [...] is {{a strange}} {{collection}} of contradictions. Some of his rags reach more toward concert music than did any Jazz up to Lennie Tristano's, while others seem to revert to his 1900 style. [...] Profoundly ambitious passages lie {{side by side with}} meaningless, mechanical ditties. It is not hard to find in these compositions a reflection of approaching derangement—he <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> in 1916.|$|E

2500|$|The story follows Amin, (Dougray Scott) {{a lonely}} {{drunkard}} beggar who meets the ruthless Sultan Harun Al-Rashid (a {{play on the}} real Caliph Harun al-Rashid), played by James Frain. Al-Rashid [...] kidnaps the unconscious Amin and dresses him as the Sultan. Al-Rashid then orders his servants to pretend Amin is the Sultan, as he watches the events unfold from secret chambers behind the palace walls. When Amin wakes, he at first thinks he has <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> but soon begins to enjoy being Sultan. He eventually takes the job much more seriously as well, with the Grand Vizier and Commander of the army noting that Amin has gotten more done in a day, than the real Sultan [...] has in years. Overhearing this, Harun becomes angered and puts sleeping powder in Amin's drink. Al-Rashid then throws {{him back into the}} streets as a beggar. When Amin awakes, he is traumatized and insists he is the Sultan, prompting the city guards to put him in an insane asylum.|$|E
2500|$|De León hesitated at the beginning, but Constanzo {{hit him in}} {{the face}} and told him that he would suffer in hell if he did not do as he commanded. Constanzo then hugged Quintana Rodríguez, and De León stood in front of them before he opened fire and killed the two with a machine gun inside a closet. When the police climbed up the stairs and made it to Constanzo's smoke-filled apartment, Aldrete ran from the door {{screaming}} that Constanzo was dead. De León later confessed that Constanzo had <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> and was saying that [...] "everything was lost" [...] and that [...] "no one was going to have [...] money" [...] when the police raid forced him to barricade himself in his apartment. He also stated that he participated in Kilroy's murder and in other killings at Santa Elena, but both agreed that Constanzo did most of the killings himself. Aldrete denied participation in the killings and stated that she was unaware of them until she saw the victims on national television. She said she was sorry to hear about Kilroy's murder. She stated that she not an official member of the cult and was barely going through the initiation. In addition, she stated she was held prisoner during Constanzo's hiding in Mexico City. When asked if {{she was in love with}} Constanzo, she denied it and said that she was only his follower.|$|E
60|$|So {{hard and}} earnestly did he work, so <b>lost</b> was <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> {{that he never}} heard the {{accustomed}} warning sound which announces that the Museum is about to close. Hidden behind an altar as he was, in his distant, shadowed corner, the guardian of the room never saw him as he cast a last perfunctory glance about the place before departing till the Saturday morning; for the morrow was Friday, the Mohammedan Sabbath, on which the Museum remains shut, {{and he would not}} be called upon to attend. So he went. Everybody went. The great doors clanged, were locked and bolted, and, save for a watchman outside, no one was left in all that vast place except Smith in his corner, engaged in sketching and in measurements.|$|R

5000|$|Once a King named Shurasena {{did some}} wrong {{action and the}} sin caused by the act humiliated him very much and he <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> peace of <b>mind.</b> He asked {{different}} Vedic scholars, priests for the remedy of how {{to come out of}} this sin. But Brahmin Vedic scholars told him to cut down his hands himself, as the very cause of the sin was his hands only and advised him to worship upon Lord Mahavishnu.

2500|$|John's [...] "joy {{became more}} {{for him the}} more he was diminished. … This was John, {{and this is how}} the single {{individual}} is to fulfill something similar in lesser situations. If he has first of all learned to deny himself humbly and to master his mind, then joy will also be victorious. But the first must be learned first-later, that which is greater; one is first initiated into the lesser mystery, later into the mystery." [...] Kiedrkegaard says, what about the single individual who wants to be like John? Do we all know how to deny ourseves with humility? He says, Who does not know that things like these have happened and do happen in the world-that someone who once ruled over countries and kingdoms has ceased to rule and is obliged to see a more powerful ruler take his place; that someone who once was hailed with jubilation soon, yes, so soon that the whole things {{seems to have been a}} dream, hears the same jubilation shouting another name, that someone whose commanding figure was familiar to everyone regards himself in the next moment with the anxiety of uncertainty about whether he has <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> or the world its memory so that it confused with him someone else; that the master whole pupil only yesterday sat at his feet must bow his shoulders today under the other's advancement; that the businessman who was kind enough to set his servant on his path now sees that his path means the benefactor's downfall; that the girl who once filled her beloved's thoughts now sits and sees his bold ambition pursuing a higher goal; that the singer whose words were on everyone's lips is forgotten today and his songs have been more than replaced; that the orator whose words echoed everywhere must now seek the solitude of the desert if he wants echo; that the friend from youth who was on an equal basis with his fellows now with amazement perceives the distance; that the lowly cottage where the parents lived, where the humble cradle stood, is now collapsing like a recollection that cannot catch up with the mighty. And yet, how strange-if you let your thoughts dwell on those distinguished people whose memory the generations have preserved, you will find that the way each individual distinguished himself is different, and you will find in turn that several are distinguished by the same thing. But in that select group you still seem to lack one place, and yet the lack is indeed a contradiction; how would the one whose task it was to be reconciled-to being forgotten-find a place in recollection? But for this very reason it is important to consider it by itself, and it is especially beautiful to do this-because no earthly reward is beckoning.
