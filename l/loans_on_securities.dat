40|$|Commercial {{banks were}} leading {{participants}} in the U. S. securities markets during the great bull markets of the 19202 ̆ 7 s and the 19902 ̆ 7 s. Those stock market booms and the crashes that followed were extraordinary events. Is it merely a coincidence that the two most dramatic stock market booms and crashes in U. S. history occurred during periods when commercial banks played major roles in our securities markets? Or did the exercise of universal banking powers contribute to the financial and economic conditions that produced both episodes? This essay is the first installment of a larger project that seeks to answer these questions. This essay offers a preliminary assessment of {{the role played by}} universal banks in the economic boom-and-bust cycle of 1921 - 33. Part I reviews the reasons for Congress 2 ̆ 7 decision to prohibit universal banking in 1933. Senator Carter Glass and other proponents of the Glass-Steagall Act (GSA) maintained that banks and their securities affiliates encouraged speculative behavior and helped to promote unsustainable booms in the securities markets and the broader economy. Glass and his colleagues also contended that universal banking powers created conflicts of interest that prevented commercial banks from acting as impartial lenders or objective investment advisors. Part II examines the role of commercial banks during the economic boom of the 19202 ̆ 7 s. In response to a relaxation of legal rules governing bank powers, banks greatly expanded their financing of business firms and consumers through five channels - <b>loans</b> <b>on</b> <b>securities,</b> securities investments, public offerings of securities, real estate mortgages, and consumer credit. This surge of new financing enabled business firms and consumers to assume heavy debt burdens and to make risky investments that proved to be unviable when the U. S. economy entered a sharp recession in the summer of 1929. In addition, the entry of commercial banks into the securities markets created competitive pressures that caused commercial banks and traditional investment banks to abandon prudential standards and promote speculative domestic and foreign ventures. Commercial banks re-entered the securities markets during the 19902 ̆ 7 s as a result of court decisions and administrative rulings that opened loopholes in the GSA. In 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which effectively repealed the GSA and authorized the creation of financial holding companies. GLBA reflected a widely-shared view among modern scholars that the 1933 legislation was misguided from the outset. However, due to the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000 and the revelation of scandals involving universal banks (e. g., Enron and WorldCom), some commentators have begun to reconsider the benefits and risks of universal banking. Part III of the essay offers a preliminary response to the modern scholarly critique of the GSA. First, contrary to the claims of some scholars, Congress did not adopt the 1933 legislation for the purpose of protecting investment banks from competition with commercial banks. Instead, Congress separated commercial and investment banking in order to prevent speculative booms and to ensure that banks acted impartially in making loans and providing investment advice. Second, there was substantial evidence for Congress 2 ̆ 7 belief that universal banks posed serious risks to the banking system. Universal banks undermined the soundness of smaller correspondent banks by encouraging them to purchase speculative securities during the 19202 ̆ 7 s. Losses on securities were a major cause of bank failures during the 19302 ̆ 7 s. In addition, several large universal banks failed between 1930 and 1933, due in part to risky investments and loans they made to support their own stock prices and to prop up affiliates. Those failures triggered regional banking panics and also contributed to the widespread loss of depositor confidence in the banking system. Third, modern scholars have attacked the conclusions reached by the Pecora investigation of 1933 - 34. However, earlier scholars concluded that the Pecora hearings produced credible evidence of conflicts of interest and other abuses involving universal banks during the 19202 ̆ 7 s. Given recent episodes of similar misconduct by universal banks during the 19902 ̆ 7 s, {{further research is needed to}} evaluate the risks created by universal banks during both periods...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{problems}} of the new state was finance. Since {{the amount of money}} in circulation was not sufficient {{to meet the demands of}} the increasing population, a system of state banks was instituted. State bonds were issued and public lands were sold to secure capital, and the notes of the banks, <b>loaned</b> <b>on</b> <b>security,</b> became a medium of exchange. Prospects of an income from the banks led the legislature of 1836 to abolish all taxation for state purposes. The Panic of 1837 wiped out a large portion of the banks' assets, leaving the state poor. Next came revelations of grossly careless and corrupt management. In 1843 the banks were placed in liquidation. After disposing of all their available assets, the state assumed the remaining liabilities, for which it had pledged its faith and credit.|$|R

50|$|RALs (Refund Anticipation Loans) {{are short}} term <b>loans</b> <b>on</b> the <b>security</b> of an {{expected}} tax refund, and RACs (Refund Anticipation Checks) are temporary accounts specifically {{to wait to}} receive tax refunds, which are then paid by a check or debit card from the bank less fees. The combination of Earned Income Credit, RALs, and RACs has created a major market for the storefront tax preparation industry. A 2002 Brookings Institution study of Cleveland taxpayers found that 47 percent of filers claiming EIC purchased RALs, as compared to 10 percent of those not claiming EIC. The tax preparation industry responded that at least one-half of RAL customers included in the IRS data actually received RACs instead.|$|R

Heavily in debt and unable to meet demands for cash on its banknotes, the bank was forced to close on 25 June 1772. The Dukes of Queensberry and Buccleuch, along with the Earl of Douglas and the Earl of Heron approached the Bank of England to try to secure <b>loans</b> <b>on</b> the <b>security</b> of their lands. The Bank of England offered £300,000, but the terms were considered extortionate. Subsequent approaches to Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank were rejected.

The timber from the houses was used as fuel that was needed because the King's forces had sabotaged the coal mines, but the demolitions continued into the summer. The Castilians seem to have been trying to extort loans from the wealthy burgesses who had resorted to Leith, and as many as 50 houses were dismantled by the [...] "Captain of the Chimneys." [...] Grange was more successful in raising money from <b>loans</b> <b>on</b> the <b>security</b> of the crown jewels, which were [...] "laid in wed and pledge" [...] with wealthy merchants and aristocratic allies.

50|$|Baring's {{knowledge}} of North American merchants and trade made him especially {{useful in the}} closing years of the American War of Independence when Shelburne, anxious for a liberal settlement, invited his comments on commercial aspects of the proposed peace treaty with the United States. Shelburne introduced Baring to Isaac Barré, his paymaster-general, and to such leading luminaries as William Pitt the Younger, Henry Dundas, Jeremy Bentham, Edmund Burke, Sir Samuel Romilly, and Lords Erskine, Camden and Sydney. However, Baring's friendship with Lord Lansdowne (as Shelburne became in 1784), Dunning, and Barré ran particularly deep, and in 1787 he drew public attention to it by commissioning their triple portrait from Sir Joshua Reynolds. A private financial connection also existed. For six years from 1783 Baring <b>loaned</b> Lansdowne £5000, <b>on</b> <b>security</b> of a debt owing to Lansdowne. In 1805, on Lansdowne's death, Baring became a trustee of his estate, charged {{with the task of}} liquidating debts of £90,000.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{attempts}} {{to clarify the}} development of middle-scale landlords in modern Japan, taking the Takato family as a case study. The Takato's accumulation ofland proceeded from the 1880 s to 1890 s {{and they were in}} possession of 20 cho in the 1890 s. The main_ sources of Takato's income were farm rents, and interest <b>loans</b> <b>on</b> the <b>security</b> of Somen Noodles. In the 1890 s, new industries developed in Japan. Takato had invested their surplus funds in stocks and gained dividends. Ikuzo Takato established Kamogata-Warehouse Bank with some middle-scale landlords in July 2, 1896 and had selected head of this bank. Then he borrowed money from the bank to invest in stocks. By the effective management, his profits increased. So, the investment in stocks soon exceeded the investment in land. Therefore, the income from dividends increased gradually in the early 1900 s. Takato was elected {{as a member of the}} prefectural assembly from 1899 to 1911, and took the chair from 1907 to 1909. Further, he was a member of the House of Representatives from 1917 to 1920. During this period he had been to Korea as part of an inspection party. As a result of this experience, upon his return to Okayama, he and the other member formed a group to purchase land in Korea. Takato had continued to purchase land in Malaya and New York. The Takato family succeeded in accumulating property through such diversified management. Other middle-scale landlords failed in their business, and disposed of their land. It can be summarized as follows: many middle-scale landlords attempted to make different styles of diversified management of land, stocks, bank and other enterprises during the time of the Japanese Industrial Revolution. Consequently, some succeeded whereas others failed...|$|R

5000|$|In {{introducing}} the Federal Reserve's {{response to the}} 2008-9 financial crisis, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke distinguished the new program, which he termed [...] "credit easing", from Japanese-style quantitative easing. In his speech, he announced, Our approach—which {{could be described as}} [...] "credit easing"—resembles quantitative easing in one respect: It involves an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet. However, in a pure QE regime, the focus of policy is the quantity of bank reserves, which are liabilities of the central bank; the composition of <b>loans</b> and <b>securities</b> <b>on</b> the asset side of the central bank's balance sheet is incidental. Indeed, although the Bank of Japan's policy approach during the QE period was quite multifaceted, the overall stance of its policy was gauged primarily in terms of its target for bank reserves. In contrast, the Federal Reserve's credit easing approach focuses on the mix of loans and securities that it holds and on how this composition of assets affects credit conditions for households and businesses.|$|R
