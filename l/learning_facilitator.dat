We present SIDE 1 (the Summarization Integrated Development Environment), {{which is}} an {{infrastructure}} that facilitates the construction of reporting interfaces that support group <b>learning</b> <b>facilitators</b> in the task of getting a quick sense of the quality and effectiveness of a collaborative learning interaction. The SIDE framework offers flexibility in the specification of which conversational behavior {{to take note of}} as well as how noted behavior should be reported to instructors, making it a valuable research tool. It is said that a facilitator of effective collaborative learning should be a “guide on the side ” rather than a “sage on the stage”. In classrooms, instructors roam around the room, listen to conversations, and jump in at key moments to offer guidance. In online settings, group <b>learning</b> <b>facilitators</b> are responsible for a larger number of groups. Listening in on conversations involves reading a high volume of text based chat, often paired with data streams in other modalities such as a digital whiteboard. The challenge is to enable group <b>learning</b> <b>facilitators</b> to quickly {{get a sense of the}} collaborative interaction so his resources can be strategically invested. In this poster...|$|R

5000|$|Humanistic {{education}} (also called person-centered education) is {{an approach}} to education {{based on the work}} of humanistic psychologists, most notably Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers. Carl Rogers has been called the [...] "Father of Humanistic Psychology" [...] and devoted much of his efforts toward applying the results of his psychological research to person-centered teaching where empathy, caring about students, and genuineness on the part of the <b>learning</b> <b>facilitator</b> were found to be the key traits of the most effective teachers. He edited a series of books dealing with humanistic education in his [...] "Studies of the Person Series," [...] which included his book, Freedom to Learn and Learning to Feel - Feeling to Learn - Humanistic Education for the Whole Man, by Harold C. Lyon, Jr. In the 1970s the term [...] "humanistic education" [...] became less popular after conservative groups equated it with [...] "Secular Humanism" [...] and attacked the writings of Harold Lyon as being anti-Christian. That began a successful effort by Aspy, Lyon, Rogers, and others to re-label it [...] "person-centered teaching", replacing the term [...] "humanistic education." [...] In a more general sense the term includes the work of other humanistic pedagogues, such as Rudolf Steiner, and Maria Montessori. All of these approaches seek to engage the [...] "whole person": the intellect, feeling life, social capacities, and artistic and practical skills are all important focuses for growth and development. Important objectives include developing children's self-esteem, their ability to set and achieve appropriate goals, and their development toward full autonomy.|$|E

In the present research a literature study as well as an empirical investigation, conducted from a number of angles, were undertaken in order to identify the most irksome problems and to accordingly make recommendations towards the development of an in-service program. The literature study serves as the backdrop against which the empirical study was undertaken. The empirical study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the process of triangulation, i. e. deductions were only made after the data presented by each of the empirical components was diagonally compared and verified. The overarching purpose of the empirical study was to pinpoint the shortcomings in the professional outfit of both the teachers and the <b>learning</b> <b>facilitators,</b> and to subsequently determine to what extent the Free State Department of Education succeeds in rectifying them. The study revealed that the teachers experience a number of teaching-related problems and that their interaction with the <b>learning</b> <b>facilitators</b> does not bear much fruit.

These changes brought about inter alia changed work environments and job demands. One of the new job demands is the need to incorporate technology in teaching and learning, viz. e-learning. Not all job incumbents, however, adapted successfully to these changes, particularly with regard to e-readiness. Such a lack in e-readiness is likely to influence the effectiveness with which an academic employee will fulfil his/her online learning duties. Therefore, it is important to find solutions to overcome the lack of e-readiness.

The main focuses {{of this study were}} (1) identifying the approach and roles implemented by English teachers of MAU in teaching reading, and (2) investigating the correlation of the approach and role implemented by the English teachers of MAU in teaching reading. This research was a descriptive qualitative research. The subjects of this study were two English teachers who taught at tenth and eleventh grade of MAU. The data were collected through interview and class-room observation. The results obtained were as follows. First, the two English teachers implemented different approaches in teaching reading. Teacher 1 tended to apply teacher-centred approach while teacher 2 applied student-centred approach. Second, the two English teachers investigated applied different and similar roles in teaching reading. There were 5 similar roles implemented by both teachers (a lecturer, the job role model, a mentor, a student’s assessor, a resource material creator). However, there were 3 roles of teacher 1 which were different from those of. Teacher 1, besides the 5 roles above, acted as a curriculum planner, a course planner and a study guide producer as well.

Action learning is understood to be a dynamic process where a team meets regularly to help individual members address issues through a highly structured, facilitated team process of reflection and action. The key findings from evaluation {{of the students and}} facilitators’ experiences are reflected on, together with plans for improving the experience for all stakeholders for the next academic year.

The principles state that a learning college: 1) creates substantive change in individual learners; 2) engages learners {{in the learning}} process as full partners who must assume primary responsibility for their own choices; 3) creates and offers as many options for learning as possible; 4) assists learners to form and participate in collaborative learning activities; 5) defines the roles of <b>learning</b> <b>facilitators</b> in response {{to the needs of the}} learners; and 6) succeeds with its <b>learning</b> <b>facilitators</b> only when improved and expanded learning can be documented for learners. Opportunities for creating a learning college include capitalizing on a natural trigger event, identifying needs through an assessment, building on existing innovations, and initiating conversations on learning. Finally, key factors for launching a learning college are building a critical coalition, creating an emerging vision, creating action plans, involving all stakeholders, ensuring appropriate support, creating an open system of communication, considering consultants and established processes, paying attention to language, reallocating resources, evaluating, and committing to the "long haul". Each of these principles, opportunities, and key factors are discussed in the document. Contains 31 references.
