50|$|Data {{exclusion}} {{involves the}} removal of specific data elements to restrict them from being accessed.

In addition, data exclusion from EHR’s is most commonly applied for when external researchers are investigating the nature of patient health outcomes. To protect individual privacy, patient identifiers and demographics such as name, date of birth and address, are removed from the copied EHR's, whilst researchers evaluate clinical information such as diagnoses and performed procedures. The process ensures that patients’ sensitive information remains anonymous whilst gains in research can still be made.|$|E

5000|$|Online {{self-development}} {{begins when}} soldiers, {{family members and}} Army civilians take the Global Assessment Tool (GAT), which is a survey for individuals to confidentially assess their psychological health based on four dimensions of strength: emotional, social, spiritual, and family. Upon completing the survey, the individual receives a score for each dimension. Users also receive their RealAge® and Performance Triad score. RealAge® is a metric that looks at responses to the GAT 2.0 and tells users their biological age compared to their calendar age. The Performance Triad looks at the three main areas that affect mental and physical performance: sleep, activity, and nutrition. The user then enters an online interactive self-development site called ArmyFit™ that enables soldiers, family members and Army civilians to access experts in each of five dimensions of resilience (physical fitness is added as a dimension), communicate with each other, set personal goals and earn recognition badges as those goals are achieved. It is located within the [...]mil environment and allow users to set their own <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> ArmyFit™ serves as the portal to comprehensive resilience/performance modules (CRMs). CRMs are web-based, self-development training videos that teach skills to support each of the dimensions of resilience. Individuals taking the GAT receive recommendations on specific CRMs to view based on their individual scores in each dimension. They are typically around 15 minutes, but that varies with the user, as many are scenario-based and self-paced. Topics range from “blended families” and “building your teen’s resilience” to “effective communication” and “goal setting”.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Security {{protocols}} stipulate how remote principals of {{a computer}} network should interact {{in order to obtain}} specific security goals. The crucial goals <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and authentication may be achieved in various forms. Using soft (rather than crisp) constraints, we develop a uniform formal notion for the two goals. They are no longer formalised as mere yes/no properties as in the existing literature, but gain an extra parameter, the security level. For example, different messages can enjoy different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> or a principal can achieve different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> authentication with different principals. The goals are formalised within a general framework for protocol analysis that is amenable to mechanisation by model checking. Following the application of the framework to analysing the asymmetric Needham-Schroeder protocol [BB 01], we have recently discovered a new attack on that protocol. We briefly describe that attack, and demonstrate the framework on a bigger, largely deployed protocol consisting of three phases, Kerberos. ...|$|R

Therefore an infrastructure supplying security services like user-authentication, secure connections and access control is necessary.

For example, integrity policy rules provide resilience to the threat of internal fraud, while cryptographic protocols provide resilience to the threat of replay and related attacks. The framework is modelled using (soft) constraints and analysis corresponds to the soft constraint satisfaction problem. Soft constraints facilitate a quantitative approach to analyzing integrity, confidentiality and authentication.
