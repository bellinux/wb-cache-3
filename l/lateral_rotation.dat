25|$|The psoas major {{joins the}} upper body and the lower body, the axial to the appendicular skeleton, the inside to the outside, and the back to the front. As part of the iliopsoas, psoas major {{contributes}} to flexion in the hip joint. On the lumbar spine, unilateral contraction bends the trunk laterally, while bilateral contraction raises the trunk from its supine position. In addition, attachment to the lesser trochanter, located on the postero-medial aspect of the femur, causes <b>lateral</b> <b>rotation</b> and weak adduction of the hip.|$|E

50|$|Some dancers {{will use}} an {{anterior}} pelvic tilt (shortening the hip flexors) because hip flexion reduces the {{tension on the}} ligament and allows <b>lateral</b> hip <b>rotation</b> to occur more easily.

2500|$|To {{examine the}} shoulder, {{the patient is}} lying and the {{concerned}} arm is in <b>lateral</b> <b>rotation.</b> For signal detection it is recommended to use a surface-coil. To find pathologies of the rotator cuff in the basic diagnostic investigation, T2-weighted sequences with fat-suppression or STIR sequences have proven [...] value. In general, the examination should occur in the following three main planes: axial, oblique coronal and sagittal.|$|E
2500|$|Flexing {{the trunk}} (bending forward) is {{essentially}} a movement of the rectus muscles, while lateral flexion (bending sideways) is achieved by contracting the obliques together with the quadratus lumborum and intrinsic back muscles. [...] <b>Lateral</b> <b>rotation</b> (rotating either the trunk or the pelvis sideways) is achieved by contracting the internal oblique {{on one side and}} the external oblique on the other. [...] The transversus' main function is to produce abdominal pressure in order to constrict the abdominal cavity and pull the diaphragm upward.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{anterior}} thigh muscles the largest are the four {{muscles of the}} quadriceps femoris: the central rectus femoris, which is surrounded by the three vasti, the vastus intermedius, medialis, and lateralis. Rectus femoris {{is attached to the}} pelvis with two tendons, while the vasti are inserted to the femur. All four muscles unite in a common tendon inserted into the patella from where the patellar ligament extends it down to the tibial tuberosity. Fibers from the medial and lateral vasti form two retinacula that stretch past the patella on either sides down to the condyles of the tibia. The quadriceps is the knee extensor, but the rectus femoris additionally flexes the hip joint, and articular muscle of the knee protects the articular capsule of the knee joint from being nipped during extension. The sartorius [...] runs superficially and obliquely down on {{the anterior}} side of the thigh, from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pes anserinus on the medial side of the knee, from where it is further extended into the crural fascia. The sartorius acts as a flexor on both the hip and knee, but, due to its oblique course, also contributes to medial rotation of the leg as one of the pes anserinus muscles (with the knee flexed), and to <b>lateral</b> <b>rotation</b> of the hip joint.|$|E

50|$|Hip flexion and hip {{extension}} {{take place}} in the sagittal plane while hip abduction and adduction move the femur in the frontal plane. Hip external and internal rotation laterally and medially moves the femur in the transverse plane, respectively. Anterior and posterior pelvic rotation involves anterior and posterior movement of the upper pelvis in the sagittal plane, respectively. <b>Lateral</b> pelvic <b>rotation</b> (left and right) occurs in the frontal plane, whereas transverse pelvic rotation (left and right) occurs in the horizontal plane.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gluteus maximus {{strengthening}} {{exercises are}} employed in clinical practice as options {{for the treatment of}} low back and sacroiliac disorders. However, no studies were found that investigated which were the best exercises to activate this muscle and justify its employment in physical therapy practice. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the gluteus maximus and semitendinosus muscles during four modalities of therapeutic exercises. METHODS: Thirty-one participants (16 men, 15 women) were selected. The EMG activities of the gluteus maximus and semitendinosus was recorded and quantified while the participants performed four modalities of therapeutic exercises, involving active prone hip extension in four positions: knee extension (KE), knee flexion (KF), <b>lateral</b> hip <b>rotation</b> and knee extension (LHRKE), and <b>lateral</b> hip <b>rotation</b> and knee flexion (LHR-KF). RESULTS: Repeated-measures ANOVAs showed that the addition of KF or LHR increased gluteus maximus activity, whereas, KE decreased the activation of this muscle. In contrast, the exercises performed with KE increased semitendinosus activity. CONCLUSIONS: Exercises performed with KF or LHR, or a combination of the two, may be effective choices for gluteus maximus strengthening, however both KF and LHR decreased semitendinosus activity. The exercises performed with KE appeared to be an acceptable choice for semitendinosus activation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{analytical}} method that determines {{the short and}} long-term response of prestressed and non-prestressed concrete beam-columns reinforced with any combination of FRP bars or/and plates, steel rebars, bonded and/or unbonded prestressed tendons is proposed. Beams and columns encased with FRP fabrics and FRP tubes filled with concrete are covered with the proposed model. The effects of tension stiffening, creep and shrinkage of the concrete, and the relaxation of the prestressed steel reinforcement are considered. The models proposed by Vecchio and Collins [1] and by Popovics [2, 3] for the stress-strain relationships of the concrete in tension and compression are adopted, respectively. The strain-stress relationships of the steel and FRP reinforcements are modeled using multiple straight lines (polygonal lines). The method of the fibers (modified) {{is used to calculate}} the moment-curvature diagrams at different levels of the applied axial load (i. e., the M-P-f curves), and the Gauss method of integration (for the sum of the contributions of the fibers parallel to the neutral axis) to calculate the <b>lateral</b> <b>rotations</b> and deflections along the span of the beam-column. The validity of the proposed model and corresponding equations were tested against experimental data available in the technical literature (see part II of this publication) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{model will}} be {{presented}} in which mirror image confusion is employed {{as an example of}} perception of shape orientation, occurring as a result of evolutionary change in vision and movement. In the most primitive condition, vertical and horizontal coordinates are absent and shapes are equivalent in terms of orientation. In this condition directionality in external space is not objectified and movement is reflexively toward or away from the visual target. In the second condition, only the horizontal axis is present. Changes in orientation from upward to downward are perceptually salient. Quadrupedal movement patterns and locomotion across land, dominated by the horizon, are associated with the evolution of a mammalian eye with enhanced acuity across the vertical axis. Vertical mirror image confusion ceases to exist. In the third condition, the vertical axis appears. Factors in primate evolution associated with the appearance of enhanced acuity along these visual axes are related to perception of <b>lateral</b> <b>rotations.</b> In the fourth condition, upright posture and development of lateral bias in eye movement are related to the human proclivity to differentiate right and left orientation of shapes while exhibiting increased difficulty in tasks that involve changes in the vertical orientation. Thus structural changes in evolution associated with posture and movement are demonstrated to account for differences in perceptual responses to orientation of shapes...|$|R

50|$|In the flexed position, the {{collateral}} ligaments are relaxed while the cruciate ligaments are taut. Rotation {{is controlled by}} the twisted cruciate ligaments; the two ligaments get twisted around each other during medial rotation of the tibia — which reduces the amount of rotation possible — while they become unwound during <b>lateral</b> <b>rotation</b> of the tibia. Because of the oblique position of the cruciate ligaments at least a part of one of them is always tense and these ligaments control the joint as {{the collateral}} ligaments are relaxed. Furthermore, the dorsal fibers of the tibial collateral ligament become tensed during extreme medial rotation and the ligament also reduces the <b>lateral</b> <b>rotation</b> to 45-60°.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} results of {{reconstruction}} in terms of complications, functional restoration and cosmetic restoration of <b>lateral</b> cheek <b>rotation</b> flap. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted between April 2004 and January 2005. Patient's particulars and history were documented. The cause, whether trauma or tumor resection, and dimensions of the defects were recorded. All the patients underwent a "cheek rotation flap" procedure to reconstruct the defect. Post-operative complications like haematoma formation, infection and flap necrosis were noted. Results were assessed in terms of functional as well as aesthetic restoration. Results: A total of 30 patients were included with a male to female ratio of 3 : 1 and {{an average age of}} 46 + 14. 7. The majority of the defects (76 %) were post tumour excision, while the rest (24 %) followed trauma. The average defect diameter was 7. 5 cms. There was no peri-operative mortality or total flap loss. There were three cases (10 %) of transient facial nerve palsy who recovered spontaneously. The final reconstruction was deemed satisfactory in terms of functional and cosmetic restoration in the majority of cases (93 %). Conclusion: Our results with the <b>lateral</b> cheek <b>rotation</b> flap to reconstruct the defects involving medial cheek have prompted us to recommend it as a first line reconstructive option for many varieties of defects in this area (JPMA 56 : 227; 2006) ...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{relation}} between their insertions {{on the sides of}} the metacarpal head and the axis of rotation in the joint, the collateral ligaments are taut in flexion but lax in extension, while the accessory collateral ligaments are lax in flexion but taut in extension.The collateral ligaments are lengthened 3-4 mm when the joint flexes 0-80° while the accessory collateral ligaments are shortened 1-2 mm. During hyperextension the accessory ligaments are lengthened while the proper ligaments are shortened.As a result, the joint is stable during full flexion while the relaxed collateral ligaments allows <b>lateral</b> and <b>rotation</b> movements during extension.|$|R
