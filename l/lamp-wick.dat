60|$|Pith.--Many {{kinds of}} pith are {{remarkable}} as tinders; that whence the well-known pith hats are made, {{is used as}} tinder in India. Pieces of pith are often sewn round with thin cotton or silk, so as to form a long cord, like the cotton <b>lamp-wick</b> I have described above, and they are carried in tubes for the same reason.|$|E
60|$|Lamps had {{certainly}} not the conventional appearance of one, as he stood modestly rubbing his squab nose with a handkerchief so exceedingly oily, {{that he might have}} been in the act of mistaking himself for one of his charges. He was a spare man of about the Barbox Brothers time of life, with his features whimsically drawn upward as if they were attracted by the roots of his hair. He had a peculiarly shining transparent complexion, probably occasioned by constant oleaginous application; and his attractive hair, being cut short, and being grizzled, and standing straight up on end as if it in its turn were attracted by some invisible magnet above it, {{the top of his head}} was not very unlike a <b>lamp-wick.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tinder.--General Remarks.--There are two {{divisions}} of tinder: {{those that are}} of a sufficiently strong texture to admit of being grasped in the hand, {{and those that are}} so friable as to require a box to hold them. In the first division (a) are the following:--amadon, a roll of rag, a cotton <b>lamp-wick,</b> a roll of touch-paper, a mass of hair of certain plants, and a long string of pith sewed up in a sheath. To ignite these, we must hold them as in fig. 1, and use the steel to strike downwards upon the flint. In the second division (b) are:--tinder of burnt rags, tinder of any kind with grains of gunpowder strewed over it, and touch-wood. All these require tinder-boxes, as explained below. There are also many other substances belonging to both divisions of tinder, in use. A traveller should inform himself about those peculiar to the country that he visits.|$|E

George Washington, the eldest blossom, was shearing a resigned kitten; Gusty and Ann Eliza were concocting mud pies in the ashes; Adelaide Victoria was studying the structure of <b>lamp-wicks,</b> while Daniel Webster and Andrew Jackson were dragging {{one another in a}} clothes-basket, to the great detriment of the old carpet and still older chariot.|$|R

Then they would perhaps meet one of Mr. Beeton's friends, and Dick, standing aside a little, would hold his peace till Mr. Beeton was willing to go on again.|$|R

40|$|What a wonderful, beautiful, {{marvelous}} country! Oh [...] h [...] h!!",says Pinocchio {{at the end}} of the Chapter XXX of “The Adventures”, after <b>Lamp-Wick</b> explained him {{the amazing}} features of the "real country [...] the best in the world [...] a wonderful place!": the Land of Toys, also named “blessed place” and portrayed as a sort of heaven on heart for lazy boys. In reality, the approaching road to the Land of Toys, before as a mental process, - a persuasion of himself – and then as real journey, it’s like a fall to hell. The master of ceremonies of this fall to hell is just the fellow Lamp-Wick,in fact in the original version of the book <b>Lamp-Wick</b> is “Lucignolo”, a name reminiscent of Lucifer, the famous fallen angel. <b>Lamp-Wick</b> and Pinocchio work up to the Land of Toy in a wagon conducted by a spineless, shifty driver: “a little, fat man, muchwiderthan he was long, round and shinyas a ball of butter, with a face beaminglike an apple, a little mouth that always smiled, and a voice small and wheedling like that of a catbegging for food”. This “little, fat man” is a sort of Charon, and the wagon: “wasdrawn by twelve pair of donkeys, all of the same size, but all of different color. Some weregray, otherswhite, and still others a mixture of brown and black. Here and there were a few with large yellow and blue stripes. ”. These queerd on keys, recurring frequently in the fairytale and they are full of double meaning: in half way point between the numinoso Christ’s whitehorse and the demonic Cambridge Bestiary. Pinocchio and <b>Lamp-Wick</b> glorify the life in the Land of Toys: they feel free and happy like in heaven, but the hard truth is very different: this land looks like the Hell, everywhere is noise, disorder, insecurity. During the development of the story, it’s possibile to detect different elements of the Pinocchio’s rise and fall between Heaven and Hell. For example the double nature of the Fairy: during the tale she can be the ghost of the little girl (de facto an angel) or she can be a goat (a devil’s mark). Talking about rise and fall, the end of the story is paradigmatic: Pinocchio will get a real boy. Acquiring the human nature, he will be able to find the Heaven on earth, after a long series of ups and downs, starting with a “badhell night”.  </p...|$|E
