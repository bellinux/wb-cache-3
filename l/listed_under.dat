5|$|The diet of the cloudy {{catshark}} {{consists of}} molluscs, crustaceans, and bony fishes. It is oviparous, with females laying encapsulated eggs {{two at a}} time in nursery areas. The claspers of the male bear numerous hooks that likely serve to facilitate copulation. This harmless shark can be readily maintained in captivity and is used as a model organism for biological research. It is caught incidentally, and generally discarded, by commercial fisheries. These activities do not appear to have negatively affected its population, leading it to be <b>listed</b> <b>under</b> Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
