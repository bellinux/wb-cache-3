40|$|Incineration is a {{promising}} technique for {{the disposal of}} organic hazardous wastes. However, the waste destruction characteristics of turbulent spray flames have not been characterized. In the present research two reactors are used to simulate various aspects of <b>liquid</b> <b>injection</b> <b>incinerator</b> flame zones. The following questions are addressed: (1) Under what conditions do flames quantitatively destroy waste compounds, and (2) how must the flame be perturbed to cause it to fail to quantitatively destroy wastes. The two reactors operated on a simulated waste stream consisting of acrylonitrile, benzene, chlorobenzene, and chloroform. A microspray reactor was used to investigate destruction processes associated with individual droplets of waste compounds. A turbulent flame reactor used a heptane-fueled waste-doped turbulent spray flame to simulate incinerator flame-zone processes. The flames {{were found to be}} capable of quantitative waste destruction without the necessity of using common post-flame processes such as afterburners. Furthermore, the high waste destruction efficiency conditions corresponded to high combustion efficiency conditions (i. e., minimum CO and hydrocarbon emissions). Failure to achieve high destruction efficiency resulted from the perturbation of flame parameters. Failure conditions were identified with high and low theoretical air, low temperature, poor atomization quality, and flame impingement on a cold surface. Each failure condition also resulted in elevated CO and hydrocarbon emissions. Thus, the results suggest that CO and hydrocarbon measurements can be used as an indirect, continuous means of monitoring incinerator flame-zone performance. © 1985 Combustion Institute...|$|E

Low costs and rapid turnaround time in this technique lower the barrier to iteratively designing and prototyping complex elastomer devices. Furthermore, CAD models developed in this process can be later adapted for metal mold tooling design, enabling an easy transition to a traditional injection molding process. We have used this technique to manufacture intravaginal probes involving complex geometries, as well as overmolding over metal parts, using tools commonly available within an academic research laboratory.

40|$|Pipes with a {{corrugated}} inner surface, {{as used in}} flexible pipes for {{gas production}} and transport, can generate a high amplitude tonal sound (singing).

To evaluate different potential mechanisms, <b>liquid</b> <b>injection</b> tests were done in both a horizontal and vertical small scale (49 mm) setup including high speed camera recordings using a transparent corrugated section. The singing amplitude decreased linearly with the <b>liquid</b> <b>injection</b> rate for both orientations, although the effect in the vertical setup was even faster. <b>Liquid</b> <b>injection</b> resulted also in higher onset velocities. The video recordings showed partially filled corrugations. For horizontal corrugations, liquid crept upward in the corrugations. In the vertical test, liquid accumulated at the upward edge with intermitted liquid spill over to downstream corrugations. The liquid fill up did not change significantly with higher liquid loads. Taking the fill-up grade and additional damping into account, a match could be made between the measured singing amplitude and a predicted singing amplitude as function of liquid rate. However, no model has been found to predict the liquid fill-up yet. Copyright © 2013 by ASME...|$|R
