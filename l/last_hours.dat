At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> {{can be a}} misnomer. One {{hour before}} the {{scheduled}} end of the game, the <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> starts. An agreed minimum number of overs (usually 15 in Test match cricket and 20 in other first-class cricket games) is bowled. The <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> therefore <b>lasts</b> either for the longer of 60 minutes, or {{the time it takes}} to bowl the agreed minimum number of overs. This rule is there to prevent time wasting by a team that looks likely to lose a game.|$|R
5|$|Cyclone Bonita in January 1996 struck both Madagascar and Mozambique, causing severe damage. The {{long-lived}} storm began {{developing in}} the <b>last</b> <b>hours</b> of 1995, and slowly consolidated over the open {{waters of the}} South-West Indian Ocean. Tracking generally toward the west-southwest, the disturbance received its name from Météo-France on January 5. Ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone, Bonita bypassed Mauritius and Réunion to the north before striking northeastern Madagascar late on January 10. There, the storm affected up to 150,000 people, flooded wide tracts of croplands, and killed 25 people. In the aftermath, disaster relief came from both the government of Madagascar and the international community, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs); the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs assisted {{in the distribution of}} about $450,000 in monetary donations.|$|E

25|$|The game is {{centered}} on the Polish romantic pianist and composer Frédéric Chopin, who died of tuberculosis {{at the age of}} 39. The story envisions a fictional world dreamed by Chopin during his <b>last</b> <b>hours</b> that is influenced by Chopin's life and music, and in which he himself is a playable character, among others. The game's battle system centers on musical elements and character-unique special attacks. Light and darkness play a part in the appearance and abilities of enemies on the battlefield, as well as the types of magic that can be cast.|$|E

25|$|Light {{restriction}} in the evening, {{sometimes called}} darkness therapy or scototherapy, is another treatment strategy. Just as bright light upon awakening should advance one's sleep phase, bright {{light in the}} evening and night delays it (see the PRC). It is suspected that DSPD patients may be overly sensitive to evening light. Thus, one might be advised to keep lights and computer screens dim for the <b>last</b> <b>hours</b> before bedtime and even wear amber-colored (blue-blocking) goggles. The photopigment of the retinal photosensitive ganglion cells, melanopsin, is excited by light mainly in the blue portion of the visible spectrum (absorption peaks at ~480 nanometers).|$|E

25|$|Soon after Webb's 1949 {{arrival in}} England, he was {{confined}} to a mental asylum following a suicide attempt. His younger sister Leonie flew to England and retrieved her brother in 1950, stopping off at Rome on the trip home. Once back in Australia, he endured a period of itinerancy combined with ecstatic episodes of writing in Galston, New South Wales; Melbourne; Semaphore, South Australia; and Jamestown, South Australia until 1953. The creative product of these years, including his famous poems 'Birthday' (about Adolf Hitler's <b>last</b> <b>hours)</b> and 'The Canticle' (a poem {{about the life of}} Francis of Assisi), was self-published in his third collection simply entitled Birthday (1953).|$|E
25|$|Strawhead {{takes place}} in New York City {{during the last few}} days of Monroe's life in August 1962, a period in which she is alone with her memories, most of which revolve around the days when she lived in New York City. The play largely is {{composed}} of a fanciful collection of interviews that never took place between Monroe and Mailer during Marilyn Monroe's <b>last</b> <b>hours.</b> The play made its Off Broadway debut in January 1986, which included Mailer's wife Norris Church in the cast and subsequently his daughter Kate Mailer in the Monroe role. Kate Mailer additionally appeared on the April 1986 Vanity Fair cover as the Marilyn Monroe character in Strawhead.|$|E

25|$|Although several {{theories}} of the ultimate cause of the singer's death persist to this day (including a few rather sinister ones), given what is now known about cardiovascular disease, {{it seems likely that}} by {{the time of his death}} Vysotsky had an advanced coronary condition brought about by years of tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse, as well as his grueling work schedule and the stress of the constant harassment by the government. Towards the end, most of Vysotsky's closest friends had become aware of the ominous signs and were convinced that his demise was only a matter of time. Clear evidence of this can be seen in a video ostensibly shot by the Japanese NHK channel only months before Vysotsky's death, where he appears visibly unwell, breathing heavily and slurring his speech. Accounts by Vysotsky's close friends and colleagues concerning his <b>last</b> <b>hours</b> were compiled in the book by V. Perevozchikov.|$|E
25|$|The two {{return to}} Port Charles. Soon after, Sam finds out she's pregnant. She and Jason have a {{paternity}} test done, which establishes Jason as the father. However, Sam {{finds out that}} Franco is Jason's twin brother. Sam has another paternity test run, and is devastated when it says that Franco {{is the father of}} her baby. She tells Jason, {{and the two of them}} start to drift apart trying to deal this news. While they're separated, Sam gives birth to a baby boy during a rainstorm. Her son is switched at birth with Victor Lord III, who was stillborn, by Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) and Todd Manning (Roger Howarth). Jason finds them, and the two mourn when they believe that the baby died. It's revealed that Jason is the father of Sam's son because Heather switched the paternity test. Their son is given to Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano), Victor's mother, who believes he's her son. Though Jason wants to make things right with Sam, she blames him for the death of her son. The two separate, and file for divorce. During the poisoning of the Port Charles water supply, Sam and Jason are admitted to the hospital in what seems to be the <b>last</b> <b>hours</b> of their life. Sam shares with Jason a dream she had where her son was still alive. Afterwards, Jason gets information that starts to make him suspect the baby that died wasn't Sam's.|$|E
