5|$|A 2010 wiretap {{of another}} suspect {{picked up a}} {{conversation}} with al-Kuwaiti. CIA paramilitary operatives located al-Kuwaiti in August 2010 and followed him back to the Abbottabad compound, which <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> speculate it was bin Laden's location.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, Hatfield and {{his wife}} were {{passengers}} on a tour bus when a car collided with the bus. They received only minor injuries, but the experience <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> advocate for seat belts to be required on buses.|$|E
5|$|Infinity Ward {{spent a lot}} of time on WWII battlefields, which <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> scrap whole {{levels for}} parts of the game that took place in France, since they found the {{location}} a lot different than what they imagined.|$|E
50|$|The {{people of}} King Limhi were {{ultimately}} rescued by Ammon, who journeyed {{from the land}} of Zarahemla, helped <b>them</b> <b>to</b> escape and <b>led</b> <b>them</b> back <b>to</b> Zarahemla.|$|R
60|$|Hermione, very remarkable, and {{distinguishing}} the Brangwens very much, <b>led</b> <b>them</b> along <b>to</b> where Laura Crich stood {{receiving the}} guests.|$|R
60|$|The others laughed, and he <b>led</b> <b>them</b> on <b>to</b> general chatter, {{under cover}} of which Vane {{presently}} drew Drayton to the door.|$|R
5|$|On April 2017, in {{his fourth}} season as head coach, Stevens led the Celtics to the 2017 playoffs as the first seed in the Eastern Conference with a 53–29 record.

5|$|Sidney Luckman (November 21, 1916 – July 5, 1998) was an American {{football}} {{quarterback for}} the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) from 1939 through 1950. During his twelve seasons with the Bears he <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> four NFL championships.|$|E
5|$|The {{petroleum}} industry influenced long-term trends in Texas and American culture. Conservative views among the early business leaders in Texas <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> help finance {{the emergence of}} the modern Christian right and the American conservative movement.|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>led</b> <b>them</b> back <b>to</b> the table, {{and when}} the {{decanter}} had gone round, one of the younger men stood up.|$|R
50|$|Brownies {{appear as}} small, leather-skinned humans and enjoy helping out with {{domestic}} chores around the home. They were particularly abused {{during the reign}} of King Magnus, whose prejudice towards <b>them</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> being treated as little more than domestic slaves.|$|R
60|$|Puck <b>led</b> <b>them</b> up <b>to</b> her {{and bowed}} solemnly. Una {{made the best}} dancing-lesson curtsy she could remember. The lady {{answered}} with a long, deep, slow, billowy one.|$|R
5|$|As underdogs on {{the road}} against the Charlotte 49ers, the Dukes' new 10–40strategy <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> an 83–77upset victory. This {{was the first time}} of the season the team had managed to win two {{consecutive}} conference games. On February 21, Duquesne again returned home for a nationally-televised game against the Dayton Flyers. Senior Jason Duty was honored in a pre-game ceremony, and the game's attendance of 5,144was only 214short of the A.J. Palumbo Center's capacity. A late layup drive by Damian Saunders put the Dukes up by one, and they went on to win 73–71.|$|E
5|$|Fishlock {{spent the}} 2014–15 Reign FC {{off-season}} on loan in the Frauen Bundesliga with FFC Frankfurt. She was {{a vital part}} of the team's success, starting in all available matches. Frankfurt was unbeaten in the second half of the season, a run which <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be crowned the champions of Europe. Although Fishlock returned to Seattle prior to the 2015 UEFA Women's Champions League Final, she was considered a huge part of the team's journey to the championship title by players, staff and fans and subsequently earned a UEFA Women's Champions League medal.|$|E
5|$|For 1943 and 1944, Clarence Spears was the Maryland head coach. Like Shaughnessy, Spears {{had taken}} an underachieving team and turned them around. In 1925, he took over Minnesota, which had posted a 3–3–2 record the prior season, and <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{a share of the}} 1927 Big Ten championship. However, at Maryland, when Spears {{accumulated}} a record of 5–12–1 after two seasons, he too was replaced.|$|E
60|$|Her {{uncle had}} turned round. They {{had reached the}} end of the dyke. A little grass-grown {{footpath}} <b>led</b> <b>them</b> now <b>to</b> the side of the harbor, beyond which lay the village.|$|R
60|$|The others laughed, and Vane, {{anxious to}} turn the {{conversation}} away from Miss Horsfield's action, <b>led</b> <b>them</b> on <b>to</b> general chatter, under cover of which he drew Drayton to the door.|$|R
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>them</b> aft <b>to</b> {{a little}} cabin, {{and left them}} there until a young officer came in. He {{sat down on the}} {{opposite}} side of the little table and looked at them.|$|R
5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> believe the enemy was breaking. Another four or five days, they thought, would be sure to break them.|$|E
5|$|Hussein Saeed {{started playing}} {{football}} {{in the streets}} before joining Al-Iskan's youth center. He <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> an Iraq Youth Centers' Championship, scoring a hat-trick in a 4–2 win against Al-Zawra'a youth team and catching the eye of Dawoud Al-Azzawi, {{the manager of the}} Iraq national under-17 football team and Iraq national varsity football team.

5|$|In 1943, {{as soon as}} {{the season}} had ended, Luckman volunteered as an ensign with the U. S. Merchant Marine. He was {{stationed}} stateside and while he could not practice with the team, he did receive permission to play for the Bears on game days during the following seasons. He returned again to the Bears, as a full-time occupation, in 1946 and <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a fifth NFL championship.|$|E
60|$|This {{was all a}} made story; but, {{however, the}} tale told so well, that they {{believed}} it thoroughly, and received our men very kindly, <b>led</b> <b>them</b> up <b>to</b> their camp, and gave them some victuals.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's first-class, boys," [...] {{said the}} guide. [...] "Couldn't be better. Now, all they got were two wild turkeys, some rabbits and one small deer. I <b>led</b> <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> a fine herd o' deer, {{but they wanted}} to do the shootin' all alone. When it came time to let drive, Felps and one o' the other men got buck fever and shot wild, and most of the deer got away. That was one thing made me sick. They can't shoot fer sour apples." ...|$|R
60|$|One of {{the young}} men complied; and having succeeded in {{detaching}} the hounds from the place, around which, until then, they had not ceased <b>to</b> hover, he <b>led</b> <b>them</b> down <b>to</b> the margin of the thicket.|$|R
5|$|In May 2013 he was {{appointed}} manager of Royal Antwerp in the Belgian Second Division, where he stayed for one season. In November 2014, {{he was hired by}} Burton Albion, and in his first season he <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their first ever promotion to League One as champions of League Two. In December 2015, he {{was appointed}} manager of Queens Park Rangers in the Championship, and lasted 11 months in the job until he was dismissed in November 2016. He was appointed as manager at Northampton Town in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|In {{developing}} {{the character of}} a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children's identities in {{the final version of the}} script.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{month before}} the start of the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, Durant {{announced}} that he would be dropping out of the competition, citing mental and physical exhaustion as reasons for his departure. He rejoined Team USA in 2016 for the Olympics, where he <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a gold medal. In recognition of his performances, Durant was named the 2016 co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, along with Carmelo Anthony, for the second time in his career.|$|E

60|$|When {{the steamer}} at length made the landing, Rollo and Mr. George {{got out and}} went up to the shore. They came out in a street called Bridge Street, which <b>led</b> <b>them</b> up <b>to</b> another street called Whitehall.|$|R
50|$|Already a tribune {{during the}} dogeship of Giovanni Galbaio, {{he and other}} Venetian pro-Frankish leaders fled to Treviso. There they elected Obelerio their leader and he <b>led</b> <b>them</b> back <b>to</b> Venice, whence the Galbaii fled, and was elected doge at Malamocco.|$|R
5|$|Natalizumab and {{mitoxantrone}} {{are considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2011, Electronic Arts {{announced}} that the online game servers would be shut down on January 11, 2011 for the Xbox 360 format of the game. The PC version of the game was shut down on December 31, 2010. Electronic Arts noted that their discontinuation {{of support for the}} game was partly because the licensing deal with New Line Cinema (holders of the Lord of the Rings license) had expired, which <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> no other option than to shut down all online services for the game.|$|E
5|$|Schneider next {{appeared}} for the United States at the 2004 IIHF World U18 Championships in Minsk, Belarus. He {{recorded the}} third-best GAA (1.71) and second-best save percentage (.929) {{of the tournament}} {{en route to a}} silver medal. The United States were defeated in the gold medal game by Russia 3–2. He was later named the David Peterson Goalie of the Year by USA Hockey, having <b>led</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> two medals in the 2003–04 season.|$|E
60|$|Skallagrim did likewise, {{though with}} no good grace. Then men came with strong cords and bound them fast hand and foot, {{handling}} them fearsomely as men handle a live bear in a net. Then they <b>led</b> <b>them</b> forward <b>to</b> the prow.|$|R
60|$|Sarchedon and his {{followers}} broke from trot to canter--canter to gallop--and soon were cracking their hard hoofs on the stony court. Like a swarm of bees the riders swooped down upon the racers, caught <b>them,</b> and <b>led</b> <b>them</b> up <b>to</b> Bostil.|$|R
60|$|He {{tried the}} same game next night, but the other two wouldn't 'ave it, and they stayed in so long that at last 'e lost 'is temper, and, arter {{wondering}} wot Ginger's father and mother could ha' been a-thinking about, and saying that he believed Peter Russet 'ad been changed at birth for a sea-sick monkey, he put on 'is cap and went out. Both of 'em follered 'im sharp, but when he <b>led</b> <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> a mission-hall, and actually went inside, they left 'im and went off on their own.|$|R
