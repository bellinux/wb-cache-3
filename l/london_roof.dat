5000|$|A {{butterfly}} roof (sometimes {{called a}} V roof or <b>London</b> <b>roof)</b> {{is a form}} of roof characterised by an inversion of a standard roof form, with two roof surfaces sloping down from opposing edges to a valley near the middle of the roof. [...] It is so called because its shape resembles a butterfly's wings. [...] Butterfly roofs are associated with mid-century modern architecture. The form has no gutter as rainwater can run off the roof in no more than two locations - {{at either end of the}} valley, often into a scupper or downspout. The form may be symmetrical, with the valley located in the center, or asymmetrical with an off-center valley. The valley itself may be flat, with a central roof cricket diverting water towards the valley ends, or sloping if the entire roof form is tilted towards one end of the valley. The roof also allows for higher perimeter walls with clerestory windows allowing light penetration without impacting privacy.|$|E

Away before them spread the phantasmagoria of a {{wilderness}} of <b>London</b> <b>roofs,</b> softened and melting into the dim blue obscurity of the falling twilight. Lights were flashing out everywhere, and above them shone the stars. Norgate drew a long breath of content.|$|R

25|$|Most of the Bristol VRs were {{withdrawn}} {{after the}} 1999 season, although 936 and 937 {{were sold to}} Dart Pleasure Craft to operate services in connection with their boats on the River Dart. Eight Scania N113s were then transferred from <b>London.</b> Their <b>roofs</b> were removed on arrival but five (numbers 15322 – 15326) were done {{in such a way}} as to be convertible back to roofed buses. and they generally operate in this form, open top services being in the main provided by 15327–15329. They are all named and, like the Leyland Atlanteans of 1961, are named after British sailors. The Scania's were withdrawn from use on 3 November 2013 (The closing day of Devon Cliffs holiday park), 15329 being the last in service. They were replaced by an Alexander ALX400-bodied Dennis Trident 2.|$|R
50|$|The {{designers}} {{liked the}} idea that like the 1851 Great Exhibition in <b>London,</b> the <b>roof</b> of the Symbol Zone could be a unifying entity for the expo. They {{did not want the}} constraint imposed by the London Exhibition of having everything contained under one roof, so the space frame contained only the Festival Plaza and themed pavilions. Tange compared the concept to a tree. The idea was that although the national pavilions were like individual flowers they needed to be connected to the whole via branches and a trunk. Thus the Symbol Zone became the trunk and the moving pedestrian walkways and sub-plazas became the branches. These elements were reinforced with colour, with the trunk and branches in plain white and the pavilions in their own colours that were determined by the national architects.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} {{varies in}} height from 3 to 23 storeys negotiating an abrupt shift in urban scale from the Barkantine Estate to the West with the emerging Millennium Quarter to the East. Family sized units are {{located at the}} base of the building having direct access to rear gardens, a playground and communal courtyard areas. Smaller sized units are located higher up in the towers enjoying views across <b>London</b> from <b>roof</b> terraces and balconies. A community space was designed as an integral part of the project and incorporates a rooftop sports pitch. The development makes use of a local 'Combined Heat and Power' system and includes greenwalls, bird boxes, bat boxes, insect bricks and biodiversity roofs to help develop local eco-systems. The distinctive skyline and elevations of the building include coloured fibre cement cladding panels, large overhanging canopies and projecting balconies which contrast with the restrained aesthetic of Canary Wharf. Piers Gough described the development as 'humanist architecture of raw funky collage'.|$|R
2500|$|On December 19, 1960, the Capitol was {{declared}} a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service. The building was ranked #6 in a 2007 survey {{conducted for the}} American Institute of Architects' [...] "America's Favorite Architecture" [...] list. The Capitol draws heavily from other notable buildings, especially churches and landmarks in Europe, including the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican and St. Paul's Cathedral in <b>London.</b> On the <b>roofs</b> of the Senate and House Chambers are flagpoles that fly the U.S. flag when either is in session. On September 18, 1993, to commemorate the Capitol's bicentennial, the Masonic ritual cornerstone laying with George Washington was reenacted. U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond {{was one of the}} Freemason politicians {{who took part in the}} ceremony.|$|R
2500|$|Within {{six years}} of opening, {{the rapid growth of}} the {{railways}} required expansion of the original station. A plan was formed to erect an iron roof similar to that found at Euston station in <b>London,</b> a ridge <b>roof</b> supported by iron columns. However, Richard Turner and William Fairburn submitted a design for a single curved roof, which won the approval of the station committee. The work cost £15,000 (...) and was completed in 1849 with the involvement of William Tite. Meanwhile, in 1845, the L had been absorbed by its principal business partner, the Grand Junction Railway (GJR); the following year the GJR became part of the London and North Western Railway. A group of four columns, adjoining platform 1 and attributed to Edward Woods, date to the 1846–1850 rebuild of the station.|$|R
60|$|There was one {{inevitable}} {{result of}} magnificent publicity which Amelius failed to consider. His advertisements were certain {{to bring people}} together, who might otherwise never have met in the great world of <b>London,</b> under one <b>roof.</b> All over England, Scotland, and Ireland, he invited unknown guests to pass the evening with him. In such circumstances, recognitions may take place between persons who have lost sight of each other for years; conversations may be held, which might otherwise never have been exchanged; and results may follow, for which {{the hero of the}} evening may be innocently responsible, because two or three among his audience happen to be sitting to hear him on the same bench. A man who opens his doors, and invites the public indiscriminately to come in, runs the risk of playing with inflammable materials, and can never be sure at what time or in what direction they may explode.|$|R
50|$|Robert Barker {{conceived}} {{the concept of}} the panorama in 1787. While walking on a hill overlooking Edinburgh, the idea struck him and he obtained a patent for it the same year.Barker’s vision was to capture the magnificence of a scene from every angle so as to immerse the spectator completely, and in so doing, blur the line where art stopped and reality began.Barker’s first panorama was of Edinburgh. He exhibited the Panorama of Edinburgh in his house in 1788, but to little success. The first panorama disappointed Barker, not because of its lack of success, but because it fell short of his vision. The Edinburgh scene was not a full 360 degrees; it was semi-circular.After the limited success of his first panorama, Barker and his son Henry Aston Barker completed a panorama of London from the Albion Mills. A reduced version was originally shown in their house with a larger one on display later.To fulfill his dream of a 360 panorama, Barker and his son purchased a rotunda at Leicester Square. <b>London</b> from the <b>Roof</b> of the Albion Mills christened the new rotunda, all 250 square meters of it. The previously reduced version, in contrast, measured only 137 square meters.The rotunda at Leicester Square was composed of two levels, although they varied in size. Spectators observed the scenes from a platform {{in the center of the}} rotunda.The main goal of the panorama was to immerse the audience to the point where they could not tell the difference between the canvas and reality, in other words, wholeness. To accomplish this, all borders of the canvas had to be concealed. Props were also strategically positioned in the foreground of the scene to increase realism. Two windows laid into the roof allowed natural light to flood the canvases, also making the illusion more realistic.Two scenes could be exhibited at the rotunda in Leicester Square simultaneously, however the rotunda at Leicester Square was the only rotunda to house two panoramas. Houses with single scenes proved more popular. While at Leicester Square, the audience was herded down a long, dark corridor to clear their minds. The idea was to have spectators more or less forget what they just saw, leaving their minds blank to view the second scene.Despite the audience’s “mind blanking” walk in the dark, panoramas were designed to have a lingering effect upon the viewer. For some, this attribute placed panoramas in the same category as propaganda of the period: no more than an illusion meant to deceive.The panorama evolved somewhat and in 1809, the moving panorama graced the stage in Edinburgh. Unlike its predecessor, the moving panorama required a large canvas and two vertical rollers. The scene or variation of scenes passed before the audience between the rollers, eliminating the need to showcase and view the panoramas in a rotunda. Peter Marshall added the twist to Barker’s original creation, which saw success throughout the 19th and into the 20th century.Despite the success of the moving panorama, Barker's original vision maintained popularity through various artists, including Pierre Prévost, Charles Langlois and Henri Félix Emmanuel Philippoteaux among others. The revival in popularity for the panorama peaked in the 1880s, having spread through Europe and North America.|$|R
