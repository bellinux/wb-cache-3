40|$|Image {{retargeting}} aims to resize {{an image}} to {{one with a}} prescribed aspect ratio. Simple scaling inevitably introduces unnatural geometric distortions on the important content of the image. In this paper, we propose a simple and yet effective method to resize an image, which preserves the geometry of the important content, using the Beltrami representation. Our algorithm allows users to interactively label content regions as well as <b>line</b> <b>structures.</b> <b>Image</b> resizing can then be achieved by warping the image by an orientation-preserving bijective warping map with controlled distortion. The warping map is represented by its Beltrami representation, which captures the local geometric distortion of the map. By carefully prescribing {{the values of the}} Beltrami representation, images with different complexity can be effectively resized. Our method does not require solving any optimization problems and tuning parameters throughout the process. This results in a simple and efficient algorithm to solve the image retargeting problem. Extensive experiments have been carried out, which demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. Comment: 13 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} content-aware image {{resizing}} method which simultaneously preserves both salient image features and important <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> properties: parallelism, collinearity and orientation. When there are prominent <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> in the <b>image,</b> image resizing methods without explicitly taking these properties into account could produce <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> distortions in their results. Since the human visual system is {{very sensitive to}} <b>line</b> <b>structures,</b> such distortions often become noticeable and disturbing. Our method couples mesh deformations for image resizing with similarity transforms for line features. Mesh deformations are used to control content preservation while similarity transforms are analyzed in the Hough space to maintain <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> properties. Our method strikes a good balance between preserving content and maintaining <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> properties. Experiments show the proposed method often outperforms methods without taking <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> into account, especially for scenes with prominent <b>line</b> <b>structures.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an annotation and retrieval framework {{that uses a}} semantic image representation by contextual modeling of images using occurrence probabilities of concepts and objects. First, images are segmented into regions using clustering of color features and <b>line</b> <b>structures.</b> Next, each <b>image</b> is modeled using the histogram {{of the types of}} its regions, and Bayesian classifiers are used to obtain the occurrence probabilities of concepts and objects using these histograms. Given the observation that a single class with the highest probability is not sufficient to model image content in an unconstrained data set with a large number of semantically overlapping classes, we use the concept/object probabilities as a new representation, and perform retrieval in the semantic space for further improvement of the categorization accuracy. Experiments on the TRECVID and Corel data sets show good performance. Â© 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|<b>Line</b> or linear <b>structure</b> {{detection}} {{is a very}} basic, yet important {{problem in}} image processing and computer vision. Many line detection algorithms are based on edge detection and consider lines as extended or contiguous edges. Most techniques require that a binary edge map be first extracted from the image before line detection is performed. In this paper, we propose a new line detection technique {{that is based on}} a model that describes spatial characteristics of <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> in an <b>image.</b> This line model uses simple properties of lines that include both graylevel and geometric features. The performance of the line detector on natural scenes and medical images will be shown.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will discuss}} {{structure}} and motion problems for curved surfaces. These will be studied using the silhouettes or apparent contours in the images. The problem of determining camera motion from the apparent contours of curved three-dimensional surfaces, is studied.

A generalised epipolar constraint is introduced, which applies to points, curves, as well as to apparent contours of surfaces. The theory is developed for both continuous and discrete motion, known and unknown orientation, calibrated and uncalibrated, perspective, weak perspective and orthographic cameras. Results of an iterative scheme to recover the epipolar <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> from real <b>image</b> sequences using only the outlines of curved surfaces, is presented.

40|$|Humans {{are capable}} of {{recognizing}} a whole line if gaps divide it into line segments. This is achieved {{by looking at the}} context and applying the Gestalt laws of proximity, closure and smoothness. The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that makes it possible for a computer application to also recognize the whole line. Mathematical techniques for image analysis are used to close the gaps in <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> in an <b>image.</b> This is done by transforming a 2 -dimensional image into an orientation score consisting of two spatial dimensions and one orientation dimension. On this orientation score it is possible to do a linear, Euclidean invariant operation, known as the G-convolution. By G-convolving an orientation score with a special kernel, one can create a probability density field for the continuation of a line segment. If two of these fields overlap, the most likely connection of the two line segments can be found and this way the gap can be filled. It is important to perform a non-linear operation on the orientation score before the G-convolution, to enhance the <b>line</b> <b>structures.</b> Afterwards an enhanced image can be reconstructed from the orientation score. The method is tested on several artificially generated images and some medica...|$|R
40|$|Micromagnetic {{computer}} simulation and {{magnetic force microscopy}} have been employed to study micromagnetic structures in soft ferromagnetic materials (iron). (1) 2 -D 180 deg. 'C', 'S', Neel and 90 deg. domain wall structures, energies, and their MFM images in thin (100) iron films were computed. (i) For the 180 deg. walls, when the film is thinner than a out 30 nm, the Neel wall has the least energy, the 'C' wall has the least energy at greater film thickness. The Neel wall is stable (or metastable) when the film is thinner than about 50 nm, the 'C' wall is stable (metastable) when the film is thicker than 16 nm, and the 'S' wall is stable (or metastable) when the film is thicker than 30 nm. (ii) For films of thickness {{in the range of}} 30 nm to 110 nm, both symmetric and asymmetric stable 90 deg. Neel wall structures were obtained. Below 45 nm, the former has the lower energy, above 110 nm, only the asymmetric structure could be obtained. The asymmetric 90 deg. wall in 200 nm thick film was found to be inclined 30 deg. to the film normal, this result is comparable with the 42 deg. obtained by Lorentz microscopy. (iii) Using a magnetic force microscope (MFM), {{it is very difficult to}} distinguish (a) 'S' and 'C' type 180 deg. domain walls in a thick magnetic film. (b) symmetric and asymmetric 90 Neel walls. However, 'S' and 'C' 180 domain walls can more readily be distinguished in thin magnetic films. It was shown that the MFM signal can be distorted to give a double peak if the scale of magnetic structure is smaller than the nose width of the tip employed. (2) 3 -D simulations: (i) Two kinds of Bloch line separating 'S' walls in 80 nm thick (100) iron film and one Bloch line separating 'C' walls in 60 and 80 nm thick films have been calculated. The Bloch line separating 'C' walls has least energy for the same film thickness. (ii) Two micromagnetic structures in 60 nm thick (100) iron square platelet were obtained. Both of them consist of four triangular domains, magnetized parallel to the edges of the platelet, separated by asymmetric 900 walls along its diagonals and meeting in a 'swirl' at its center. One of them, that having higher energy, has been observed by Lorentz microscopy. Periodic cross tie wall structures were obtained in 30 nm thick rectangular iron platelets and the results are compare well with MFM images. (iiii) The displacement and distortion of the domain wall by a 3 -D model MFM tip were calculated. They were much weaker than that obtained in earlier simulations that used 2 -D model tips. (3) The disturbance of a Bloch <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> on a #left brace# 110 #right brace# surface of a 0. 3 mm thick crystal of FeSi (3. 25 %Si) by the tip was clearly observed by comparing two MFM images obtained using the probe with upward and downward magnetic moments. It was also found that the three kinds of Bloch <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> <b>imaged</b> by MFM can be created by disturbing a single Bloch <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> with the tip probe. A micromagnetic model was employed to interpret the MFM images obtained. The ideal MFM signal from an undisturbed wall was obtained by combining MFM images obtained with oppositely magnetic tips and compared with results from micromagnetic simulation. The magnetization directions of the Bloch cores of two 180 deg. domain wall sections separated by Bloch lines were determined from MFM images.

40|$|The {{frontier}} of a curved surface is the envelope of contour generators showing the boundary, at least locally, {{of the visible}} region swept out under viewer motion. In general, the outlines of curved surfaces (apparent contours) from different viewpoints are generated by different contour generators {{on the surface and}} hence do not provide a constraint on viewer motion. Frontier points, however, have projections which correspond to a real point on the surface and can be used to constrain viewer motion by the epipolar constraint. We show how to recover viewer motion from frontier points and generalise the ordinary epipolar constraint to deal with points, curves and apparent contours of surfaces. This is done for both continuous and discrete motion, known or unknown orientation, calibrated and uncalibrated, perspective, weak perspective and orthographic cameras.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 60 - 64. Content-based image indexing and retrieval {{have become}} important research {{problems with the}} use of large databases {{in a wide range of}} areas. Because of the constantly increasing complexity of the image content, low-level features are no longer sufficient for image content representation. In this study, a content-based image retrieval framework that is based on scene classification for image indexing is proposed. First, the images are segmented into regions by using their color and <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> information. By using the <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> of the <b>images</b> the regions that do not consist of uniform colors such as man made structures are captured. After all regions are clustered, each image is represented with the histogram of the region types it contains. Both multi-class and one-class classification models are used with these histograms to obtain the probability of observing different semantic classes in each image. Since a single class with the highest probability is not sufficient to model image content in an unconstrained data set with a large number of semantically overlapping classes, the obtained probability values are used as a new representation of the images and retrieval is performed on these new representations. In order to minimize the semantic gap, a relevance feedback approach that is based on the support vector data description is also incorporated. Experiments are performed on both Corel and TRECVID datasets and successful results are obtained. ÃavuÅ, ÃzgeM. S...|$|R

In this paper, a {{large-scale}} indoor model test with water pressure is conducted {{in order to}} investigate the stress and deformation properties of reinforced concrete <b>lining</b> <b>structures</b> with circular cross-sections.

Grass and herbal {{dominated}} small <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> possess high {{significance for}} the conservation of species and biotopes in the actual cultural landscape of Germany. This paper categorizes and specifies herbal ridges, central stripes of lanes and pasture fences. These biotope-types are then differentiated to herbaceous seams. The floristic and vegetational composition of herbal <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> elements is analysed at four different levels, which are: species inventory, floristic types, phytocoenoses and nano vegetation complexes. Each level is characterized by its species and biotope conservation value. While floristic types are useful for ecohabitat aspects and species conservation, nano vegetation complexes are advised for work on large areas. The ecological significance of a herb-dominated small line biotope depends decisively on the production intensity of the land use above it (uplier), its cultivation state and its breadth. <b>Line</b> <b>structures</b> serve as refugial habitats. Starting from here the recolonization of adjacent grasslands and arable ground takes place. In order to perform this function in the future, preservation of these <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> is needed. An extensivation in agriculture over large areas will secure these efforts. Biotope-binding measures without large area extensivation of agriculture will only delay the destruction of the line biotopes left. Care should be spent on the methods used to maintain <b>line</b> <b>structures,</b> especially whether they are realistic.
