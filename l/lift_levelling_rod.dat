50|$|A normal <b>levelling</b> <b>rod</b> can be {{used for}} stadia {{measures}} at shorter distances (up to about 125 m). For longer distances, special stadia rods are better suited. In order to provide good visibility at long distances, stadia rods are typically wider than <b>levelling</b> <b>rods</b> with larger markings. Since very fine gradations are not necessary for long sights, they may be left off the dedicated stadia rod.|$|R

50|$|Slip joints can be {{designed}} to allow continuous relative motion of two components or it can allow an adjustment from one temporarily fixed position to another. Examples of the latter are tripods, hiking poles, or similar telescoping device. The position is fixed using a clamping mechanism based on a cam, a set screw or similar locking mechanism. Slip joints can also be non-telescoping, such as the joints on some older wooden surveyor's <b>levelling</b> <b>rods.</b> These use a joint that keeps the sections offset from each other but able to be slid together for transport.|$|R

50|$|Jump forming, {{also known}} as {{climbing}} forming, is a method of construction whereby the walls are cast in discrete lifts. It is a stop-start process with day joints formed at each <b>lift</b> <b>level.</b> Similar to slip forming, jump forming is only efficient for structures with repetition of wall arrangement. Moreover, it is convenient for adding connections and extrusions at the floor level due to the discrete features. Nevertheless, the inclusion of day joints leaves higher chances for defects and imperfections.|$|R
