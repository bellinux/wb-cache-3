Two <b>larger</b> <b>motor</b> vessels, the Manchester Faith and Fame, 4,460 grt, were commissioned in April 1959, and the Faith quickly became the first commercial vessel to transit the newly opened St Lawrence Seaway with its larger locks.|$|E

The force split up on the way to Norway. MTB 345 and MTB 620 spotted Utvær Lighthouse at 23:50 and made landfall further south at around 24:00, with MTB 345 being refuelled by MTB 620.|$|E
25|$|Local {{transportation}} is primarily by bus or taxi. Anshan {{used to have}} a single tram line—along Zhonghua Avenue, through the city centre and past Angang main gate—but this has been closed and the tracks removed. Due to the flat topography of the city centre, bicycles are popular. Almost all roads have a wide cycle lane on each side. Often this lane is further protected by a traffic island that separates the bikes from <b>larger</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles.|$|E

With the computer network technology, system testing technology, signal analysis and fault diagnosis technology, <b>large</b> <b>motor</b> based on high speed wire rod production line as the object, the online monitoring method of <b>large</b> <b>motor</b> is present. Based on it, the signal processing approach of <b>large</b> <b>motor</b> under complex circumstance is proposed, and the software of on-line monitoring system for <b>large</b> <b>motor</b> is developed. Through monitoring the key parameters of the distributed signals of temperature, pressure, current and so on, the developed system can accurately analyze and locate critical faults of equipments, reduce faults rate, extend the service life and increase productivity of the motor equipment...|$|R

25|$|The {{distribution}} of motor unit size {{is such that}} there is an inverse relationship between the number of motor units and the force each generates (i.e., the number of muscle fibers per motor unit). Thus, there are many small motor units and progressively fewer <b>larger</b> <b>motor</b> units. This means that at low levels of recruitment, the force increment due to recruitment is small, whereas in forceful contractions, the force increment becomes much larger. Thus the ratio between the force increment produced by adding another motor unit and the force threshold at which that unit is recruited remains relatively constant.|$|E
25|$|Finally, motor-skill {{rehabilitation}} {{has been}} proposed as another possible way in which games {{can be used for}} rehabilitation purposes. Stroke patients suffering upper extremity motor difficulties have been the primary focus of this subject and, in this case, a variety of gaming environments have been experimented with. Output has shown that their Fugl-Meyer UE scores and their Functional Independence Measure scale score increase after a period of engaging in virtual rehabilitation, suggesting that their mobility dysfunction decreased and their degree of independence increased due to the intervention. Additionally, output has suggested improved motor skills on a higher level, having several researchers suggesting positive improvements in their stroke patients as a result of virtual rehabilitation methods. At this higher level, researchers have suggested improved ability to walk, or ambulation, and improved use of <b>larger</b> <b>motor</b> skills after intervention. One other class of patients that has been studied less frequently in this category of rehabilitation is cerebral palsy patients. Ability to walk certain distances without the use of an assistive device was the method of measurement for this category. After a period of working with a Wii-based system, it was shown that a patient who struggled with walking large distances before, was able to walk a noticeably longer distance. This suggests an improvement in <b>larger</b> <b>motor</b> skills, whereas the stroke patients demonstrated an improvement in finer motor skills, focused strictly on their use of upper extremities during the gaming rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid {{table saws}} are {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with high-end contractor table saws. They offer some of the advantages of cabinet saws at a lower price than traditional cabinet saws. Hybrid saws on the market today offer an enclosed cabinet to help improve dust collection. The cabinet can either be similar to a cabinet saw with a full enclosure from the table top to the floor or a shorter cabinet on legs. Some hybrid saws have cabinet-mounted trunnions and some have table-mounted trunnions. In general, cabinet-mounted trunnions are easier to adjust than table-mounted trunnions. Hybrid saws tend to be heavier than contractor saws and lighter than cabinet saws. Some hybrid saws offer a sliding table as an option to improve cross cutting capability. Hybrid saw drive mechanisms vary more than contractor saws and cabinet saws. Drive mechanisms can be a single v-belt, a serpentine belt or multiple v-belts. Hybrid saws have a 1.5 or 2hp motor and thus the ability to run on a standard 15 or 20 amp 120 volt American household circuit, while a cabinet saw's 3hp or <b>larger</b> <b>motor</b> requires a 240 volt supply.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of those against Jazani, were the followers of Masoud Ahmadzadeh and Amir Parviz Pooyan, two {{of the founders of}} Iranian People's Fadaee Guerrillas. Although these two individuals were killed in 1972, their teachings were the official teachings of the movement up to 1976. Jazani thought these two individuals teachings were distractive and his book [...] "Armed struggle in Iran: The road to mobilization of the masses" [...] was written in response to a book written by Ahmadzadeh [...] "Armed struggle, both tactic and strategy". Even though Jazani did not mention Parviz Pooyan or Ahmadzadeh in his book; when discussing and offering his thoughts he disapproves those offered by these two individuals. Even though there were major differences between the teachings of Jazani and Ahmadzadeh. There were two focal items that were discussed between these two schools of thoughts. These were that the revolutionary situation of the country and the method of struggle. The ones that disagreed with Jazani and approved Ahmadzadeh were under the belief that the country is in a revolutionary status and situations for a revolution exists. Therefore, a guerrilla fighter must fight with artillery to make the people aware of the revolutionary status of the country. A smaller motor, military uprising will turn a <b>larger</b> <b>motor,</b> the population; and the larger population will support the military uprising and bring down the Shah's government. In Ahmadzadeh's opinion, not believing the revolutionary situation shows a sense of individualism, which in the opinion of the leftist movement is that of a traitor.|$|E

40|$|In {{this survey}} paper, we show by {{straightforward}} mathematical scaling considerations that small inverter-fed ac motors of tip to typical 20 kW at 1500 /min {{are likely to}} suffer from discharge (electric discharge machining) bearing currents, whereas <b>larger</b> <b>motors</b> are likely to be subjected to high-frequency (HF) circulating bearing currents. When comparing motors that operate at the same voltage level, the resulting bearing-current density is high for very small and very <b>large</b> <b>motors.</b> Smaller values occur in between these two extremes with medium size motors in the range of 10 - 100 kW. Therefore, electric bearing insulation is useful for <b>larger</b> <b>motors</b> to interrupt the HF circulating bearing-current path, whereas small motors need rotor shielding, common-mode voltage filters, or hybrid bearings. ...|$|R
