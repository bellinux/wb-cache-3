25|$|Due to {{his fame}} as an illustrator, Leyendecker {{was able to}} indulge in a very luxurious {{lifestyle}} which in many ways embodied the decadence of the Roaring Twenties. However, when commissions began to wane in the 1930s, {{he was forced to}} curtail spending considerably. By the time of his death, Leyendecker had <b>let</b> <b>all</b> of the household staff at his New Rochelle estate go, with he and Beach attempting to maintain the extensive estate themselves. Leyendecker left a tidy estate equally split between his sister and Beach. Leyendecker is buried alongside parents and brother Frank at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. Charles Alwood Beach died in 1954 and is buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery, East Orange, New Jersey.|$|E

O God, who for the salvation of the human race has built Thy greatest mysteries in the substance, in your kindness hear our prayers, and with the element to this, for many kinds of purifications of his well-prepared, the power of Thy blessing, Serve it; the creation of Thy mysteries, serving as an agent of divine grace; is sprinkled with this water in their houses or in the buildings of the faithful, that whatever might be free from all uncleanness, he is freed from every harm.

500|$|Before Selena signed her {{contract}} with EMI Latin in 1989, Behar and Stephen Finfer requested Selena for an English-language debut album. She {{was asked to}} make three demonstration recordings for Charles Koppelman, chairman of EMI Records. After reviewing them, Koppelman declined a crossover attempt, believing Selena should first strengthen her fan base. In a 2007 interview, Behar spoke about the difficulty of recording Selena's English-language debut. He said EMI [...] "had <b>let</b> <b>all</b> of {{us to believe that}} she would record in English, and it just wasn't materializing for whatever reason". Behar said the record company [...] "didn't believe, they didn't think it could happen", and continuously told Selena and her father [...] "it wasn't the right time" [...] for an English-language debut.|$|E
500|$|Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum {{disguise}} {{themselves as}} wizards and sneak into Wizard City {{in order to}} secure a spell to cure a cold that is plaguing Starchy (a sentient malt ball, voiced by Tom Kenny). They approach potion-seller Ron James (voiced by Duncan Trussell), but he sees through their charade and calls the wizard police on the trio. Finn, Jake, and Bubblegum steal a cold spell and then run from the scene of the crime. After a long chase, the three run into Abracadaniel (a meek and somewhat feeble-powered wizard with whom the three are familiar, voiced by Steve Little), who is accidentally roped into their conspiracy. The four are soon arrested and stand trial before the Grand Master Wizard (voiced by Maurice LaMarche), who offers to <b>let</b> <b>all</b> of them go free if Princess Bubblegum will concede that [...] "wizards rule".|$|E

500|$|On 18 October 1869, {{a warrant}} for a {{commission}} of inquiry into {{the state of the}} College was established. The warrant issued on the behalf of the Duke of Norfolk, stated: [...] "that it is desirable that the College of Arms should be visited, and an inquiry instituted with the view of ascertaining whether the Rules and Orders for the good government of the said College... are duly obeyed and fulfilled... and whether by change of circumstances or any other cause, any new Laws, Ordinances or Regulations are necessary to be made... for the said College." [...] The commission had three members: Lord Edward Fitzalan-Howard (the Deputy Earl Marshal), Sir William Alexander (Queen's Counsel) and Edward Bellasis (a Sergeant at Law). Sir Bernard Burke (of the famous Burke's Peerage), at the time Ulster King of Arms, gave the commission the advice that the College should: [...] "be made a Government Department, let its Officers receive fixed salaries from Government, and <b>let</b> <b>all</b> its fees be paid into the public exchequer. This arrangement would, I am sure, be self-supporting and would raise at once the character of the Office and the status of the Heralds." [...] Burke's suggestion for reform was the same arrangement that had already been applied to the Lord Lyon Court in Scotland in 1867, and was to be applied to his own office in 1871. However unlike the Lyon Court, which was a court of law and part of the Scottish Judiciary, the College of Arms has always been an independent corporate body overseen by the Earl Marshal. While the Lord Lyon depended on the Government for its reforms and statutes, the College has always been able to carry out changes from within itself. The commission also drew attention to the fees, annulments and library of the College, as well as the general modernisation of the chapter as a whole. When the commission made its report in 1870, it recommended many changes, and these were duly made in another warrant dated 27 April 1871. Burke's recommendation, however, was not implemented.|$|E
