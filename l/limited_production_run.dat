5|$|The Rolls-Royce R was a British {{aero engine}} {{designed}} and built specifically for air racing purposes by Rolls-Royce Limited. Nineteen R engines were assembled in a <b>limited</b> <b>production</b> <b>run</b> between 1929 and 1931. Developed from the Rolls-Royce Buzzard, it was a 37-litre (2,240cu in) capacity, supercharged V-12 capable of producing just under 2,800horsepower (2,090kW), and weighed 1,640pounds (770kg). Intensive factory testing revealed mechanical failures which were remedied by redesigning the components, greatly improving reliability.|$|E
5|$|The XJ220 was not {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a production car, but, following the reception of the concept and financial interest from serious buyers, a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar. Its conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} financially viable. The announcement of a <b>limited</b> <b>production</b> <b>run</b> of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts. The offer was four times oversubscribed, and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) were taken from around 1400 customers; first deliveries were planned for mid-1992.|$|E

25|$|Cagiva {{purchased}} the MV Agusta name trademarks in 1991. In 1997 it introduced {{the first new}} MV Agusta motorcycle. The new bikes were four-cylinder 750cc sports machines, the F4 range, which included a series of <b>limited</b> <b>production</b> <b>run</b> models, such as the all black paint work SPR model (Special Production Racing) which was featured in the movie I, Robot. In 2004 they introduced their first 1,000cc bike. 2004 {{marked the end of}} production for the 750 Sport machines, with limited production of 300 SR (Special Racing) models in the traditional red and silver livery.|$|E

25|$|Tony Rolt and Duncan Hamilton debuted the {{prototype}} at Le Mans in 1950. It was the first-ever Le Mans entry {{to have an}} overdrive transmission. Not only was the car one of the 29 finishers {{from the field of}} 66, but also finished in fourth place. This outstanding achievement sealed Healey’s contract with Nash for a <b>limited</b> <b>production</b> <b>run</b> of the road cars. Roger Menadue, head of Healey’s experimental department, {{played a significant role in}} the success: He filed slots in the backplates of the brakes and extended the adjusting mechanism to a small exterior lever. Thus in a matter of seconds he could adjust the brakes during pit stops without jacking the car up—an innovation that was said to save as much as half an hour at each stop.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, between December 1942 and January 1943, a <b>limited</b> <b>production</b> <b>run</b> of nine Il-2s {{armed with}} Sh-37 guns was {{delivered}} to the 688th Attack Air Regiment (ShAP) of the 228th Attack Air Division (16th Air Army) for military trials. These aircraft {{took part in the}} combat around Stalingrad that winter. The Sh-37 gun proved somewhat effective against the German tanks of the day. It could pierce the armor of light tanks without problem and at favorable angles it was effective against German medium tanks as well. However, effective use of the gun required a high degree of skill from the pilots. Besides the diving issue, poor firing synchronization between the guns (as installed in these aircraft) caused them to also veer laterally off-course when the Sh-37 guns were fired. Consequently, bursts of only two or three rounds were practical. To compound the problems, the Sh-37 guns were also rather unreliable, with frequent jamming occurring. Even though the Sh-37s were installed in pairs, this actually decreased the overall reliability of the aircraft as a weapon system, because the jamming of a single gun meant that the Il-2 could not fire safely any longer, due to the strong, asymmetric recoil from a single gun having a very strong destabilizing effect on the aircraft. After these experiences, the Il-2 with Sh-37 guns was not ordered in mass production.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, USAF {{initiated}} {{a study to}} determine the costs of retaining F-22 tooling for a future Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). A RAND Corporation paper from this study estimated that restarting production and building an additional 75 F-22s would cost $17billion, resulting in $227million per aircraft, or $54million higher than the flyaway cost. [...] Lockheed Martin stated that restarting the production line itself would cost about $200million. Production tooling will be documented in illustrated electronic manuals stored at the Sierra Army Depot. Retained tooling will produce additional components; due to the <b>limited</b> <b>production</b> <b>run</b> there are no reserve aircraft, leading to considerable care during maintenance. Later attempts to retrieve this tooling found that the containers were empty.|$|E
50|$|Grueby's work incited mass-market {{competition}} and the company went bankrupt in 1909. Grueby emerged from bankruptcy and began <b>limited</b> <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> that included statues, pottery, and tiles until 1911. There was {{a fire in the}} manufactory in 1913, but Grueby rebuilt. In 1917, the C. Pardee Works in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, bought out the company's works; the Grueby company closed for good in 1920.|$|R

Two primary options were also available; a three-speed JATCO 3N71B automatic transmission and air conditioning. Other GS options such as cassette tape deck, splash guards, padded center console arm rest and others could be added by the dealer. The LS model was only ever available in three different exterior colors: Aurora White, Brilliant Black, and Solar Gold. No official production records are known to exist or to have been released.

2500|$|As of August 2013, the USAF {{believes}} that the LRS-B can reach Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 2025. Reportedly, the main risk is funding, {{in light of the}} F-35 Lightning II's acquisition difficulties and a lack of an [...] "urgent threat". Prior bomber programs were hindered by a lack of funding, only 21 B-2 Spirits were produced out of 132 planned and fewer B-1 Lancers were built than were envisioned; both programs were scaled down due to spiraling per aircraft costs. Research funding was allocated, as stealthy technologies to counter anti-access/area-denial threats were spared from budget cuts. The USAF stated the LRS-B is a top priority as it is believed that China will overcome the B-2's low-observable features by the 2020s. Where possible, existing technologies and proven subsystems will be used in order to keep it within budget, instead of developing new and riskier ones. Components such as engines and radars may be off-the-shelf or adaptions of existing models, such as derivative technologies of the F-35. The LRS-B is intended to perform any long range mission, rather than one specialized mission, which drove up the cost of the B-2. The USAF expects it to cost $1 billion each with development costs factored in, and aims for a per-aircraft cost of $550 million, considered reasonable for a <b>limited</b> <b>production</b> <b>run</b> military aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, due to {{increasing}} interest from manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Panoz, the FIA took {{over control of}} the expanding BPR Global GT Series, standardizing the race-length at 500 km instead of the usual four hours, liberalizing the technical regulations and leaving commercial exploitation in the hands of one of BPR's founders, Stéphane Ratel, who managed to get TV support from the pan-European TV station Eurosport. The new manufacturers built [...] "homologation specials", racing-bred cars that took full advantage of the new rules, to build quasi-prototypes with very <b>limited</b> <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> of 25 cars.
