We performed and analysed an antibiotic binding on Dacron (polyethyleneterephtalate, PET) vascular grafts, previously coated with CDs based polymers. MethodsThe CDs coating process {{was based on}} the pad-dry-cure method patented in our laboratory. The Dacron prostheses were immersed into a solution containing a polycarboxylic acid, a cyclodextrin and a catalyst, and placed into a thermofixation oven before impregnation with an antibiotic solution (Vancomycin). Biocompatibility tests were performed with L 132 human epithelial cells. The antibiotic release in an aqueous medium was assessed by batch type experiments using UV spectroscopy.
