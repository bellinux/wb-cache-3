She began creating the album's demos with Pettibone in his apartment in October 1991. Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics on top of the basic music which Pettibone produced in the style of his remixes. During the sessions, they had problems during sequencing, and, as a result, Pettibone kept trying to move development as fast as possible as he did not want Madonna to <b>lose</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the music. According to him, Madonna's compositions were serious and intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into a deeply personal territory.|$|E

5|$|In 1904 the Wrights {{built the}} Flyer II. They decided {{to avoid the}} expense of travel and {{bringing}} supplies to the Outer Banks and set up an airfield at Huffman Prairie, a cow pasture eight miles (13km) northeast of Dayton. They received {{permission to use the}} field rent-free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman. They invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May 23, on the condition that no photographs be taken. Engine troubles and slack winds prevented any flying, and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present. Library of Congress historian Fred Howard noted some speculation that the brothers may have intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to <b>lose</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> their experiments. Whether that is true is not known, but after their poor showing local newspapers virtually ignored them for the next year and a half.|$|E

5|$|Roger Clifford died at Skipton Castle in 1389, and the Clifford family {{began to}} <b>lose</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Westmorland. The Cliffords {{preferred}} their properties in Yorkshire to their dilapidated castles in Westmorland, {{which had been}} ravaged by wars with Scotland. Brougham Castle is not {{known to have been}} in use as a residence again until 1421, when a man was accused of forging coins in the castle. Although little is known about Brougham during this period, historians believe it likely that repairs were undertaken, and a rivalry emerged between the Clifford family and the House of Neville that would later have consequences for Brougham. The familial enmity meant that the Earl of Salisbury, a Neville, used his position as lord of Penrith to antagonise the Cliffords; it is likely that Brougham Castle was kept garrisoned due to its proximity to Penrith. In the Wars of the Roses (1455–1485), the two families were on opposing sides, the Cliffords supporting the House of Lancaster and the Nevilles supporting the House of York. When the Yorkist EdwardIV took the throne in 1461 the lands of John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford were confiscated. In 1471, EdwardIV granted Sir William Parr Brougham Castle and other properties which had belonged to the Cliffords. A year later Henry Clifford, John's son and heir, was pardoned and when the Lancastrian Henry Tudor took the throne as HenryVII, Henry Clifford appealed for the return of the Clifford estates. This was granted in November 1485.|$|E

25|$|Self-perception is a {{specialized}} form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior.

A Dutch-Kongo force attacked Portuguese bases on the Bengo River in 1643 in retaliation for Portuguese harassment.

25|$|Mating occurs {{immediately}} after emergence. No courting behaviors {{have been observed}} and each female is fertilized by only one male. Once fertilized, the males <b>lose</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the female and the female also loses interest in further mating.

In P. aquatica, Anagres incarnatus, A. armatus, and Anaphes nipponicus, females outnumber males in each brood; from two to 20 females for each male. In Polynema striaticorne, it is the opposite, with males outnumbering females by a ratio of three or more to one. In Anagrus atomus, A. frequens, A. optabilis, A. perforator, and Polynema euchariformes, females are able to reproduce without males (parthenogenesis), though males may still sometimes be found within broods.|$|E
