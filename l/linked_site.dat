Entitled [...] "African American Attitudes toward the Civil War: The War of Jubilee: Tell Our Stories and We Will Come," [...] is a partnership of Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park (KEMO) and the Kennesaw State University Center for the Study of the Civil War. Conducted in 2010, with the three goals of understanding the perspectives of the local African American community, inquiring how African Americans would like their history interpreted and finally, facilitating the incorporation of these desired interpretations into KEMO's presentations. Fifty-seven African American Participants with a history of involvement in heritage and/or preservation groups and also member participants with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) interact and discuss with the Facilitators. Questions are posed {{to get a sense of}} the Participants' attitudes about the Civil War and also about the displays presently offered at KEMO. The Participant's responses indicate that inclusive representation of the range of African American history remains doubtful. There persists the sense among Black citizens that the Southern White population is resistant to any change in the [...] "Lost Cause" [...] narrative and instead prefers and only supports the marginalization of African Americans by being represented as enslaved persons.The men and women of the Participant group suggest changes in data collection from African American families and communities, preferring more personalized histories be found and represented when telling their history. Facilitators list the inclusion of the USCT history as well as the stories of the diversity of the African American lives and communities both before and after the Civil War is included in an updated KEMO interpretation. The Facilitators are also recommending that the histories of the local, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and religious communities that grew from the post-War, mid-19th century are represented and that the educational community will engage in these efforts.|$|E

According to most of the webmasters, delinking is done as often as required but less than 20 times a year. Reasons for delinking a web site are categorized into obvious (e. g., broken/dead links, and content of <b>linked</b> <b>site</b> is no longer current or relevant) and unobvious (e. g., political/philosophical difference with the owner of the <b>linked</b> <b>site,</b> and request from the webmaster of the <b>linked</b> <b>site).</b> Measures to minimize delinking are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Population genetic theory {{predicts that}} {{selectively}} driven changes of allele frequency for both beneficial and deleterious mutants reduce polymorphism at tightly <b>linked</b> <b>sites.</b> All else being equal, these reductions in polymorphism {{are expected to}} be greater when recombination rates are lower. Therefore, the empirical observation of a positive correlation between recombination rates and amounts of DNA polymorphism across the Drosophila melanogaster genome can be explained by two very different types of natural selection. Here, we evaluate alternative models of effects of selection on <b>linked</b> <b>sites</b> by comparison of X-linked and autosomal variation. We present polymorphism data from 40 genes distributed across chromosome arms X and 3 R of Drosophila simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster. We find significantly less silent polymorphism in D. simulans on the X chromosome than on 3 R, but no difference between arms for silent divergence between species. This pattern is incompatible with predictions from theoretical studies on the effect of negative selection on <b>linked</b> <b>sites.</b> We propose that some form of positive selection having greater effects on sex chromosomes than on autosomes is the better explanation for the D. simulans data...|$|R

On the RDF level, the semantics of the tags are specified by a system programmer in terms of logical rules based on the RDF(S) repository.
