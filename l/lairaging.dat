The thermal variables (temperature and relative humidity), distance, <b>lairage</b> time and density of birds per cage were considered in the analysis. The effects of distance and <b>lairage</b> time were important in the variation of rectal temperature of the animals and on the number of dead animals per truck. Two models were developed (mean and dispersion), for each response variable in function of the interaction between <b>lairage</b> time and distance. As the <b>lairage</b> time in the holding area increased, the rectal temperature of the birds was reduced for all the studied distances. In farm-abattoir distances higher than 25 km, mortality was low when <b>lairage</b> time was lower than 1 hour. However, for distances below 25 km, in the same time interval, the number of dead birds was two-fold higher than in the first situation.

The prevalence and variety of serotypes of Salmonella in the <b>lairages</b> of two pig slaughterhouses were determined, and the efficacy of the usual cleaning and disinfection on the presence of Salmonella was estimated. <b>Lairages</b> of two pig slaughterhouses were sampled three times when pigs were present. Furthermore, these <b>lairages</b> were sampled after the usual cleaning and disinfection, whereas the <b>lairage</b> of one slaughterhouse was sampled an additional time after improved cleaning and disinfection.

In this study we assessed {{the influence of a}} controlled <b>lairage</b> environment on preslaughter mortality rates of broiler chickens that were transported during different seasons of the year and had varying <b>lairage</b> times in the subtropical climate. Preslaughter data from 13, 937 broiler flocks were recorded daily during 2006 in a commercial slaughterhouse in southeastern Brazil. The main factors that influenced daily mortality rate were mean dry bulb temperature and RH, <b>lairage</b> time, daily periods, density of broilers per crate, season of the year, stocking density per lorry, transport time, and distance between farms and slaughterhouse. A holding area at the slaughterhouse with environmental control was assessed. Using a double GLM for mean and dispersion modeling, the seasons were found to have significant effects (P < 0. 05) on average mortality rates.

A study {{involving}} {{two groups}} of feedlot cattle (n = 84 and 112) was undertaken to compare the effect of two preslaughter <b>lairage</b> (L) durations (3 h v. 18 h) on carcass and meat quality properties. The cattle were grainfed for 150 days before slaughter and had a mean carcass weight of 347. 0 ± 25. 4 kg. Cattle from the same feedlot pen were randomly allocated to the two treatments {{on the day before}} slaughter. One group was transported to the abattoir the day before slaughter and held overnight (L– 18 h) whereas the other group remained at the feedlot and was transported the following morning and remained in the <b>lairage</b> for 3 h before slaughter (L– 3 h). After slaughter, meat quality was evaluated on a subset of 15 carcasses/lairage treatment from the two slaughter groups. Objective meat quality measures were made on unaged and 14 -day-aged striploins (longissimus lumborum) from these carcasses. Cattle from the reduced <b>lairage</b> treatment had heavier bled bodyweights at slaughter (P 0. 05) on carcass weight, muscle glycogen concentration, pH 3 h, ultimate pH, shear force or Minolta lightness values. Significant interactions (P< 0. 05) between <b>lairage</b> duration and aging were observed for cooking loss percentage and Minolta a ∗ and b ∗ values but these were relatively small in magnitude.

Thirty-nine Limousine bulls supplied by one farm located near to Saragoza (Spain) were examined after 5 consignments at the final destination, following a journey of 2, 550 km to the “San Giorgio” abattoir (Palermo, Italy). Transport time was of 53. 6 ± 10. 9 h; <b>lairage</b> duration for bulls of the 1 st, 3 rd and 5 th consignments was of 31 h on average (“Short Lairage” group), whereas, for those of the 2 nd and 4 th consignments, was of 59 and 57 h, respectively (“Long Lairage” group). As regards the blood cell counts, data showed a significant effect (P 0. 05) affect the incidence of slight and severe carcass bruises. As regards meat quality, <b>lairage</b> duration significantly influenced the pHu which was higher (P< 0. 01) in the muscle of the “Long Lairage” group, the luminosity at 24 h post mortem which was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in animals of the “Short Lairage” group, and the red and yellow indices which were higher in the “Long Lairage” group.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of pre-slaughter stress of pigs on the levels of cortisol, creatine kinase (CK) and their subsequent relationship with pork quality. From our knowledge, there is paucity of information on transportation, <b>lairage</b> duration and sex effects on saliva cortisol and its relation with serum cortisol, urine cortisol and other meat quality traits. Stage one of the study assessed the effect of sex and time to slaughter (transport and <b>lairage</b> duration) on the levels of cortisol and CK in crossbred pigs. The second stage of the study evaluated the effect of sex and <b>lairage</b> duration on pork quality. The trials comprised of 60 22 -weeks old commercial crossbred pigs [(30 boars vs. 30 gilts) with an average body weight of 76. 9 kg for gilts and 78. 3 kg for boars. Thirty pigs (15 Boars vs. 15 Gilts) were slaughtered on arrival after a 120 km road journey and the other 30, after travelling the same road and distance, were slaughtered after having been in the <b>lairage</b> for 20 hours. Saliva samples were obtained during three time periods: between 07 : 00 - 10 : 00 on the day before the journey, on arrival at the abattoir and after <b>lairage.</b> Levels of cortisol in serum and urine and CK in serum samples collected at slaughter were determined. The samples (saliva and serum) were centrifuged at 20 oC for 10 min at 3550 x g and stored at - 20 oC in separate vials until analysis. Pork quality was assessed using muscle pH, colour, thawing and cooking losses and Warner-Bratzler Shear Force. Correlations between cortisol levels in saliva, serum and urine and meat quality were assessed. The effect of sex and time to slaughter on saliva cortisol was significant. Statistical analysis showed significant interaction of sex by time to slaughter on serum cortisol. It was only the effect of sex that demonstrated higher (P < 0. 05) serum creatine kinase levels in gilts. Likewise, urine cortisol was influenced (P < 0. 05) only by time to slaughter. Saliva cortisol after transportation (r = 0. 52) was correlated (P < 0. 05) with urine cortisol. The study suggests that there are greater responses of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following time to slaughter (transport and <b>lairage</b> duration) between gilts and boars. This can be used in measuring cortisol in saliva, serum and urine, and serum creatine kinase to determine stress levels in pigs. Besides the lightness (L*) colour value which was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) in meat from gilts than from boars, {{the results of this study}} showed no interaction or individual effect (sex or <b>lairage</b> duration) on pH and other colour measurements. Meat cooking loss was affected (P < 0. 05) by gender x <b>lairage</b> interaction. Effect of <b>lairage</b> duration (as an individual effect) on the measured meat quality traits was not significant (P < 0. 05). Correlation analysis showed significant (P < 0. 05) negative relation between baseline saliva cortisol (r = - 0. 40) and the pork L* value. Saliva cortisol after <b>lairage</b> duration (r = - 0. 38 and r = 0. 38) was correlated (P < 0. 05) with pH 45 and pork a* value, respectively. Serum cortisol (r = - 0. 35) was negatively correlated (P < 0. 05) with pH 45. Moreover, there were negative correlations (P < 0. 05) between saliva cortisol after transportation (r = - 0. 35), saliva cortisol after <b>lairage</b> duration (r = - 0. 44), serum cortisol (r = - 0. 40) and meat cooking loss.

40|$|Pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica is {{frequently}} isolated from pig tonsils, {{but can also}} be found in the feces and lymph nodes of infected animals; which represent potential sources for the surface carcass contamination during slaughter. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the respective effects of the transportation and <b>lairage</b> steps on the overall contamination of the carcass, taking also into account the contamination of their environment. Each Trial was conducted in two abattoirs, whose environmental contamination was assessed. In each abattoir, 6 trucks and 6 <b>lairage</b> pens were sampled in duplicate at the end of the day, for 5 consecutive days, in spring and autumn. Four groups of 8 pigs from the Anses Specific Pathogen-Free herd (SPF) were mixed with conventional pigs for different contact times during transportation (1 h) or <b>lairage</b> (2, 4 or 8 h) prior to slaughter, and one group had no contact with other pigs. Each group of SPF pigs was sampled at the end of the slaughter line for the presence of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica for internal (tonsils, caecal content, mesenteric lymph nodes) and external (carcass surface) contamination. Samples were placed in ITC broth for enrichment at 25 °C for 48 h. Broth was streaked on CIN plates. After 24 H at 30 °C, typical colonies were streaked on YeCM plates. Biochemical tests were done to confirm Y. enterocolitica and to identify the biotype. The environmental contamination of trucks and <b>lairage</b> was very low. Y. enterocolitica was only detected in 11 / 240 <b>lairage</b> swabs. All internal and external samples from SPF pigs mixed with conventional pigs during transportation or <b>lairage</b> were negative after slaughter. Four tonsils of the SPF pigs slaughtered directly on the slaughter line after 4 hours of activity, with no prior contact with conventional pigs, and one of the corresponding surface carcasses, were found positive in one abattoir. In our experimental conditions with SPF pigs, we were not able to demonstrate contamination by contact with conventional pigs during transportation and <b>lairage</b> steps, whose environmental contamination appeared to be scarce. Limited cross contaminations were observed during the slaughter process, which emphasizes the importance of good hygiene procedures to limit carcass contamination by pathogenic Y. enterocolitica...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} effect of transport on inflammatory, adrenocortical, metabolic and behavioural responses of weanling heifers transported from Ireland to Spain. Background At the end of the grazing season, 60 Charolais × beef heifers (mean live weight 245, s. e. 4. 3 kg and mean weaning age 219, s. e. 4. 9 days) were abruptly weaned from their dams on day 0. The animals were assigned by live weight to two treatments, transport (T) (n = 40) (mean 246, s. e. 5. 4 kg) and control (C) (n = 20) (mean 247, s. e. 7. 2 kg) on day 0. The T animals were transported from Ireland to France on a roll-on roll-off ferry at a stocking density of 0. 93 m 2 /animal and then by road for 9 h to a French <b>lairage</b> while C animals remained in Ireland and were not transported. On arrival at the French <b>lairage</b> (d 2), 20 T animals were unloaded (ULT) and rested for 12 h in the French <b>lairage</b> and 20 animals rested (RT) on the transporter. All animals had access to hay and water. After the rest period, the ULT animals were re-loaded. The subsequent journey by road from France to Spain was 9 h travel, 7 h rest (on the transporter) and a further 7 h travel by road. All T animals were blood sampled prior to transport (day (d) 0; baseline), on arrival in the French <b>lairage</b> (d 2), after 12 h rest in the French <b>lairage</b> (d 2), on arrival at the feedlot in Spain (d 4) and on d 6, d 8, d 10 and d 34.

40|$|Information on {{the effect}} of road {{transportation}} conditions and <b>lairage</b> times on the meat quality of pork under South African conditions is very sparse. In this investigation, the effects of 2 road conditions (rough road with frequent stops - A; smooth road, few stops - B) and 2 <b>lairage</b> holding periods (2 h and 24 h) on the physical meat quality attributes of commercially produced pigs during summer (ambient temperatures > 30 °C) in the Western Cape (South Africa) were investigated. Pig meat from pigs transported on a road that caused more stress (A), had lower pH 45 (measured 45 min post mortem) values after 2 h <b>lairage</b> than pigs transported over a smoother road. Pigs B had a lower muscle pH 24 (measured 24 h post mortem) than group A, indicating that they had more glycogen reserves available for post mortem glycolysis. Road conditions A were more stressful resulting in a higher incidence of PSE pork, as shown by the percentage drip loss and the L* values. When the <b>lairage</b> period was increased to 24 h prior to slaughter, pigs transported under road conditions A had time to replenish their energy reserves and the pH 45, drip loss and L* values were within an acceptable range. However, pigs transported under road conditions B had lower pH 45 and higher pH 24 values, indicating that the <b>lairage</b> period was too long and that energy reserves were depleted in order to adapt to the stressful conditions. Results from this investigation indicate that improvement of the transport/road conditions will result in better pork quality. Articl...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{different}} <b>lairage</b> times on meat quality was investigated in pigs with different halothane genotype previouslysubmitted to controlled pre-slaughter treatments. One hundred and ninety nine Italian heavy pigs were loaded by ramp or lift andtransported unmixed for 1 h to the abattoir at a stocking density of either 0. 6 m 2 per 100 kg pigs. After unloading, anequal number of animals within each previous treatment was held in <b>lairage</b> for 2 h or overnight (22 h) before slaughter. Carcassand meat quality and incidence of skin damage were evaluated. Longer <b>lairage</b> did not negatively affect carcass traits and reducedthe incidence of PSE meat without increased DFD occurrence. It also seriously increased the amount of skin damage due to fighting,resulting in long fasting. Pre-slaughter treatments and halothane genotype showed a negligible effect on the response to theresting time. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR) was shown to be 10, 000 Salmonella colony forming units (cfu) of bacteria per gram of fecal matter; this means that this rapid and specific test is {{a useful tool for}} the industry. The study found a trend toward a reduced, but not statistically significant, amount of Salmonella in <b>lairage</b> pens from standard hygiene practices of washing pens between groups of swine. This reduction of Salmonella in <b>lairage</b> pens may result in decrease transmission between groups, and, ultimately, in fewer numbers of contaminated carcasses at slaughter. It might also allow one to determine if on farm and transport methods are reducing Salmonella fecal incidence in <b>lairage</b> pens. The lack of significance is partially due to the low number of positive pens in this study before washing. Due to the low numbers found in pens in this study, samples were not collected from transport as they would have not lead to significant differences between various treatments...|$|R
