5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} iodine {{are the highest}} among the halogens, {{conforming}} to the increasing trend down the group, since iodine has the largest electron cloud among them {{that is the most}} easily polarised, resulting in its molecules having the strongest van der Waals interactions among the halogens. Similarly, iodine is the least volatile of the halogens. Because it has the largest atomic radius among the halogens, iodine has the <b>lowest</b> first ionisation energy, <b>lowest</b> electron affinity, <b>lowest</b> electronegativity and <b>lowest</b> reactivity of the halogens.|$|E
