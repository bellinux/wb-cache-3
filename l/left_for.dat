40|$|Studies {{show that}} {{emerging}} <b>left</b> hemisphere lateralization <b>for</b> word reading is correlated with emerging <b>left</b> hemisphere lateralization <b>for</b> high spatial frequency (HSF) information. However, {{it is currently}} unclear whether left lateralization is partially caused by a pre‐ existing <b>left</b> hemisphere bias <b>for</b> high spatial frequency visual information (such as that found in words), or if the <b>left</b> hemisphere tuning <b>for</b> HSF {{is a consequence of}} reading experience. This study seeks to determine whether lateralization for HSF information exists prior to <b>left</b> lateralization <b>for</b> reading. We use a divided visual field task to examine <b>left</b> hemisphere bias <b>for</b> words and for high spatial frequency Gabor patches in pre‐readers, early readers, and adults. If <b>left</b> hemisphere specialization <b>for</b> reading occurs due to pre‐ existing HSF bias in the left hemisphere, than LH specialization for HSF information will be present before children have word‐reading ability, i. e., in the pre‐readers. In addition, children who demonstrate greater left than right lateralization for HSF may exhibit better word recognition ability. Adults show the predicted <b>left</b> hemisphere lateralization <b>for</b> HSF information and for words, but in pre‐readers, neither of these hemispheric biases is apparent. However, it is the case that in both children and adults, a higher <b>left</b> hemisphere bias <b>for</b> high spatial frequency visual information was correlated with a higher <b>left</b> hemisphere bias <b>for</b> words, indicating an early relationship between these two hemispheric biases...|$|R
