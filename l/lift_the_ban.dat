5|$|Sigismund {{took the}} {{customary}} oath of the Transylvanian monarchs on 23December 1588. Pope Sixtus V excommunicated {{him for the}} expulsion of the Jesuits. Sigismund's cousin, Cardinal Andrew Báthory, urged the pope to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>ban,</b> saying that the prince's Protestant advisors had forced him {{to throw out the}} friars. The pope authorized Sigismund to employ a confessor in May 1589, and the excommunication was revoked on Easter 1590.|$|E

The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.

5|$|A {{day after}} announcing the attempt on his life, Nasser {{established}} a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly (400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria) and {{the dissolution of}} all political parties. Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt, and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria. Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev. At the meeting, Khrushchev pressed Nasser to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> on the Communist Party, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the UAR's affairs. The matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries.|$|E

5|$|At the Hospitallers' request, Pope Gregory IX {{repeated}} the excommunication of Bohemond in March 1230. He authorized Gerald of Lausanne, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> if Bohemond {{agreed to make}} peace with the Hospitallers. With the mediation of Gerald and the Ibelins, Bohemond and the Hospitallers made a treaty which was signed on 26 October 1231. Bohemond confirmed the Hospitallers' right to hold Jabala and a nearby fortress and granted them money fiefs in both Tripoli and Antioch. The knights renounced the privileges that Raymond-Roupen had granted to them. Before long, Gerald of Lausanne lifted the excommunication and sent the treaty to Rome to be confirmed by the Holy See.|$|E
5|$|Goebel died of {{his wounds}} on February 3. He {{remains the only}} American {{governor}} ever assassinated while in office. With Goebel, the most controversial figure in the election, dead, tensions began to ease somewhat. Leaders from both sides drafted an agreement whereby Taylor and Lieutenant Governor Marshall would step down from their respective offices; in exchange, they would receive immunity from prosecution in any actions they may have taken with regard to Goebel's assassination. The state militia would withdraw from Frankfort, and the Goebel Election Law would be repealed and replaced with a fairer law. Despite the agreement of his allies, Taylor refused to sign the agreement. He did, however, <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> on the General Assembly meeting in Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 {{added to a}} litany of complaints about the state's first constitution. Some {{believed that it was}} undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, the UNTAC {{administration}} had banned forest logging and timber exports, a major industry and source of foreign earnings. In October 1993, Ranariddh issued {{an order to}} <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> on a temporary basis so as to allow trees that were already felled to be exported for timber. The Khmer Rouge still controlled large tracts of forests in the regions of western and northern Cambodia bordering Thailand, and helped finance its operations by selling timber to Thai forestry companies The Cambodian government was unable to impose its will in Khmer Rouge territory, and was eager to regain the logging revenues. In January 1994, Ranariddh and Hun Sen signed a bilateral agreement with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. The agreement provided for felled trees to be legally exported to Thailand on a temporary basis until 31 March 1994. The agreement also arranged for specially-designated customs zones to be created within Thai territory, which allowed Cambodian custom officials to inspect the logs and collect export duties.|$|E
5|$|Lucy {{returns and}} Chris rejects her offer of being father to her child when Nate confesses {{he does not}} want children; however, Chris changes his mind when Nate {{supports}} him. Nate later helps Chris and Lucy see that they need to think the idea through more thoroughly, and they draw up a contract detailing how their child will be raised. When they learn that they are both carriers of spinal muscular atrophy, Chris tells Lucy that she should find another donor. But when Chris sees how down Lucy is, he changes his mind and they go ahead with the insemination. A couple of weeks later, Lucy calls Chris to tell him that she is pregnant. Chris plans to visit New York for the scan, but Nate confesses he is banned from the States for overstaying his visa there previously. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) agrees to help <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>ban,</b> but Nate misses a meeting and Chris accuses him of not taking it seriously. Lucy returns for a visit and Chris decides he wants to split his time between Erinsborough and New York when the baby comes, although Nate is against this idea. Nate realises that they want different things, and they break-up. Chris then decides to move to New York with Lucy and leaves after a farewell party at The Waterhole. A few months later, Amber contacts Chris and Lucy via video call after learning that they have had a daughter. Chris and Lucy introduce her to Anne, and Chris asks Amber to say hello to Nate for him.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>ban.</b> His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E
