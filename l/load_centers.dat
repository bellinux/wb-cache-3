Simple air-break manual switches produced hazardous arcs when interrupting high voltages; these gave way to oil-enclosed contacts, and various forms using directed flow of pressurized air, or of pressurized oil, to cool and interrupt the arc. By 1935, the specially constructed circuit breakers used at the Boulder Dam project use eight series breaks and pressurized oil flow to interrupt faults of up to 2,500 MVA, in three cycles of the AC power frequency.|$|E
5000|$|Coal supply: Despite {{abundant}} {{reserves of}} coal, the country isn't producing {{enough to feed}} its power plants. India's monopoly coal producer, state-controlled Coal India, is constrained by primitive mining techniques and is rife with theft and corruption. Poor coal transport infrastructure has worsened these problems. To expand its coal production capacity, Coal India needs to mine new deposits. However, most of India's coal lies under protected forests or designated tribal lands. Any mining activity or land acquisition for infrastructure in these coal-rich areas of India, has been rife with political demonstrations, social activism and public interest litigations. By the end of year 2015, the international coal prices have dropped to US$42.55 per ton which is below the local coal producers sale price. This situation is transforming coastal power station's generation cheaper than pit head power station's generation when electricity is made available to major <b>load</b> <b>centers.</b> Being massive consumer of local and imported coal, India should end the Coal India's coal pricing monopoly and implement coal trading in commodities stock exchange to arrive at market determined coal price on daily basis. This is possible by devising standard coal grades / trading instruments and identifying coal supply hubs in central India, eastern India, west coast and east coast to facilitate trading in imported and local coal.|$|E
5000|$|The Philippine {{transmission}} system {{is composed of}} three grids, the Luzon Grid, Visayas Grid, and Mindanao Grid. One characteristic of the grids is that most bulk generation sites are found far from the <b>load</b> <b>centers,</b> necessitating use of long-distance transmission lines. The Luzon Grid is interconnected with the Visayas Grid through HVDC Leyte-Luzon, a high voltage direct current transmission line and submarine cable with a transfer capacity of 440 MW between Naga and Ormoc. The Visayas Grid is composed of five small grids (sub-grid) connected with submarine cables, but arranged in a radial configuration, that may disconnect one sub-grid in case a fault develop on one submarine cable interconnection. The Mindanao Grid is composed of 138,000 volt lines for long-distance transmission, and primarily relies on hydropower, usually from Agus Hydroelectric Power Plant in Iligan and Pulangi IV Hydroelectric Power Plant in Bukidnon. The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines placed proposals for submarine cable links between Visayas and Mindanao, to unify the three principal grids, [...] and between off-grid Mindoro and Luzon, to increase power reliability in the off-grid island [...] While the three main grids encompass each island group, many islands still remain off-grid, relying on localized power plants or power barges for supply.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new technique}} {{for the design of}} high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system to transmit the electrical energy generated by sustainable energy sources to <b>load</b> <b>center</b> located at far distances. The problems with high power capacity and power loss of high voltage alternating current (HVAC) system particularly in long distance transmission, has led to emerge new technology which is HVDC transmission. Therefore, with the development of high voltage valves, it is possible to transmit DC power at high voltages and over long distances. Simulation results show that the HVDC has the capability to produce ± 1000 kV with high power capacity of 3 GW and efficiency equal to 98 % for <b>load</b> <b>center</b> located at 1000 km. The simulation of this study is implemented using MATLAB/Simulink software.
