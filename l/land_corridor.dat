5|$|The {{extent of}} the kingdom of the East Angles can be {{determined}} from a variety of sources. Isolated to the north and east by the North Sea, there were mainly impenetrable forests to the south and the swamps and scattered islands of the Fens on its western border. The main land route from East Anglia would at that time have been a <b>land</b> <b>corridor,</b> along which ran the prehistoric Icknield Way. The southern neighbours of the East Angles were the East Saxons and across {{the other side of the}} Fens were the Middle Angles. It has been suggested that the Devil's Dyke (near modern Newmarket) at one time formed part of the kingdom's western boundary, but as its construction can only be dated from between the 4th and 10th centuries, it cannot be established to be of Early Anglo-Saxon origin.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Čegar {{allowed the}} Ottomans to {{establish}} a <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> extending along the Morava River valley from Niš to the Danube. The advance was brought to a halt after the Russians crossed the Danube in September 1809 and attacked the Ottomans in northern Bulgaria, offering the rebels temporary respite. The rebels soon recaptured all the land that they had lost, but were exhausted by the fighting. Henceforth, they were continuously on the defensive. The rebel leaders quarrelled among themselves, blaming {{each other for the}} recent defeats. Karađorđe blamed the Russians for not intervening earlier on the rebels' behalf. His behaviour became more volatile as battlefield setbacks mounted. In late 1809, he shot and wounded one of his commanders, Petar Jokić, for making a poor military decision in the vicinity of Ćuprija.|$|E

25|$|The lower Thames was {{of great}} {{strategic}} significance as {{the location of}} major military installations including the dockyard and arsenal at Woolwich, the powder magazine at Purfleet, and the victualling stores and shipyard at Deptford. In addition, it was essential to ensure that an enemy could not make a landing along the Thames, which offered a potential <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to London. The crossing between Gravesend and Tilbury was also of considerable importance, which had prompted the Tudors to build fortifications {{on both sides of}} the river at that point.|$|E
25|$|On Jan. 12, Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts {{launched}} Operation Iskra, {{which by}} the end of the month had finally opened a <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to the besieged city, but this also did not directly involve the 54th. However, the success of Iskra, as well as the encirclement and destruction of German Sixth Army at Stalingrad and the subsequent offensives in the south, led STAVKA to plan a larger operation near Leningrad, to be called Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda (Pole Star), with the objective of the complete destruction of Army Group North.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} opening of the <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to the Negev on October 20, the capture of Beersheba was the top {{priority}} of the Negev Brigade following its replenishment and resupply enabled by Operation Avak. On the night of October 19–20, the Israelis sent much of the 8th Brigade and Negev's 7th Battalion to the enclave, as well as Negev Brigade infantry forces (from the 9th Battalion) engaged in raids in the Gaza–Rafah corridor (today the Gaza Strip). On October 20, the commanders of the respective forces met in the Negev Brigade headquarters in Shoval for a final briefing.|$|E
50|$|Corridors {{can be made}} in two {{distinct}} areas—either water or <b>land.</b> Water <b>corridors</b> are called riparian ribbons and usually {{come in the form of}} rivers and streams. <b>Land</b> <b>corridors</b> come on a scale as large as wooded strips connecting larger woodland areas. However, they can also be as simple as a line of shrubs along a sidewalk (Fleury 1997). Such areas can facilitate the movement of small animals, especially birds, from tree to tree, until they find a safe habitat to nest in. Not only do minimal corridors aid in the movement of animals, they are also aesthetically pleasing, which can sometimes encourage the community to accept and support them.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{bottlenecks}} for {{the recent}} increase in air traffic density is near the airport, where wake vortices, bounded by the terrain, could easily rebound into the <b>landing</b> <b>corridor</b> and remain {{there for a long}} period of time while maintaining their strength. The threat of near-ground wake vortex could be mitigated by the plate-line technology, which places a series of thin plates across the <b>landing</b> <b>corridor</b> before the runway; the technology was shown to significantly reduce the time it takes for wake vortex dissipation. The current investigation aims to better understand factors such as plate dimension and lateral position influences on the generation of secondary vortex structure and ultimately the dissipation rate of a wake vortex pair. It is found that the wake dissipation could be sped up further by optimizing the lateral position of the plate relative to the obstacle–vortex contact location, while the height of the plate could be significantly reduced without noticeably affecting the performance of the obstacle set...|$|R

25|$|After {{the failure}} {{to open up a}} {{permanent}} <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to the Negev through Iraq al-Manshiyya, the head of the Southern Command, Yigal Allon, decided to shift the major efforts to the west. On the night of October 16–17, the Givati Brigade's 51st Battalion set out from Julis to capture the Junction. It moved in three separate prongs—the 2nd Company in the west, the 3rd in the center and the 4th in the east. Another force set out from Negba to intercept possible Egyptian reinforcements from Iraq Suwaydan. The Egyptian forces in the area consisted of one battalion spread out through the hills north of the Junction, the Junction itself, and the positions of Kawkab and Huleiqat.|$|E
25|$|The plan of Operation Yoav {{called for}} the {{creation}} of a permanent <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to the Negev through Iraq al-Manshiyya. The attack was meant to be carried out on October 17, 1948. It was, however, brought forward 24 hours to October 16 after a recommendation by Yitzhak Sadeh, commander of the 8th Armored Brigade. The attack would mark the first time that tanks would be used by Israel in the southern front. The Israelis hoped that Egypt would concentrate its main defenses in Fallujah, the locality that overlooked the vital Junction position, and therefore leave Iraq al-Manshiyya lightly defended. The village's two main positions were a tell just north, and the village school.|$|E
25|$|During the Second Siniavino Offensive, {{which began}} on August 19, the {{division}} was employed on a secondary sector, {{south of the}} main assault front of 2nd Shock Army. It nevertheless distinguished itself {{in the first week}} of September by enveloping and capturing the German strongpoint at Voronovo, on the Naziia River, with the help of 286th Rifle Division; both units dug in late on September 7. On January 12, 1943, Volkhov and Leningrad Fronts launched Operation Iskra, which finally opened a <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to the besieged city. The 327th distinguished itself again in this fighting, to the east of Siniavino, and on January 19 was redesignated as the 64th Guards Rifle Division, one of a relative handful of formations to win Guards status in the fighting on the northern sector of the Soviet-German Front.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{issues related to}} the {{trailing}} vortex wake hazard beyond the take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>corridors.</b> The operational procedures adopted by the FAA in the 1970 s for avoiding wake turbulence encounters in the take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>corridors</b> have been very successful in providing commercial aviation {{with a high degree of}} safety. However, there is a growing body of evidence that encounters well beyond the immediate airport area could also prove to be hazardous. A review of commercial airline accidents for which a wake vortex encounter was considered to be a contributing factor in the accident are reviewed. Another problem that is addressed is wake encounters at cruise altitude. With the introduction of the regional jet transports into the commercial fleet we have created a very large disparity in the size of aircraft that can cruise at the same altitude. Furthermore there is evidence that wake encounters at cruise altitude do occur and should be investigated more extensively than has been done to date. In the current study the vortex induced loads created by wake vortices at cruise altitude are examined. The two cases that are presented include penetration perpendicular to the trailing vortex wake and penetration along the vortex core axis. The cross track penetration focuses on the structural loading while the along track penetration examines the potential roll excursion from the intended flight path...|$|R

The department developed the trajectories for all Surveyor spacecraft flights. Additionally, he managed the Liftoff and Translation experiment. It proved that spacecraft engines can be reignited on the lunar surface, a task which was not a Surveyor technical requirement. The Surveyor was the first unmanned spacecraft to soft land on the moon. In addition to collecting and analyzing lunar samples, and photographing {{the surface of the}} moon, it proved the principle of soft landing a spacecraft on the lunar surface, and selected the <b>landing</b> <b>corridor</b> for the future Apollo manned flights.|$|R

A rail road was swiftly built through the corridor which allowed more supplies to reach the city than the Road of Life across the frozen surface of Lake Ladoga, significantly reducing the possibility of the capture of the city and a German–Finnish linkup.|$|E
500|$|Army Group North land {{lines of}} {{communication}} were permanently severed from Army Group Centre and it was relegated to the Courland Pocket, an occupied Baltic seashore area in Latvia. On 25 January, Adolf Hitler renamed Army Group North the [...] "Courland", implicitly realising {{that there was no}} possibility of restoring a new <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> between Courland and East Prussia. The Red Army commenced the encirclement and reduction of the pocket, enabling the Soviets to focus on operations towards East Prussia. The Army Group Courland retained a possibility of being a major threat. Operations by the Red Army against the Courland Pocket continued until the surrender of Army Group Courland on 9 May 1945, when close to 200,000 Germans were taken prisoner there.|$|E

Kelbajar and Lachin districts guarantee solid <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> between Armenia proper and Nagorno-Karabakh. Between 500,000 and 600,000 Azerbaijanis were displaced from the area. In the meantime, almost all Armenians from Azerbaijan (between 300,000 and 400,000) and Azerbaijanis from Armenia (over 150,000) were forced to move to their respective countries as remaining in their homes became nearly impossible since tensions between the two groups have grown worse {{since the start of the}} conflict in 1988.|$|E
30|$|Proportionality further demands (amongst others) {{to check}} that no less {{restrictive}} measures {{could have been used}} to satisfy the public interest. Voluntary cooperation between farmers may be considered as an option. However, they would not solve situations where no consensus can be obtained. Therefore binding measures are unavoidable. As to whether individual or systemic measures should prevail the shifting of conflict resolution to the local and individual level appears to be less restrictive than binding agricultural planning. But, as shown above, individual measures do not effectively ensure co-existence. For instance, given the fact that pollen is transported over long distances, <b>land</b> <b>corridors</b> around GMO fields may fail to separate productions over the long term. Therefore, also binding measures would pass the test of proportionality.|$|R
