On February 24, 1911, Curtiss made his first amphibian demonstration at North Island by taking off and alighting on both land and water. Back in Hammondsport, six months later in July 1911, Curtiss sold the U.S. Navy their first aircraft, the A-1 Triad. The A-1, which was primarily a seaplane, was equipped with retractable wheels, also making it the first amphibian. Curtiss trained the Navy's first pilots and built their first aircraft. For this, he is considered in the USA to be [...] "The Father of Naval Aviation". The Triad was immediately recognized as so obviously useful, it was purchased by the U.S. Navy, Russia, Japan, Germany and Britain. Curtiss won the Collier Trophy for designing this aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The PS-1 ASW variant carried homing torpedoes, depth {{charges and}} 127mm Zuni rockets as {{offensive}} armament {{but had no}} defensive weapons. It was equipped with dipping sonar, which had limited use as it required the aircraft to <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> deploy. It could also carry up to 20 sonobuoys. It had a crew of ten: pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, navigator and six sensor/weapons operators.|$|E

5000|$|Through {{the course}} of that winter, Curtiss was able to develop a float (pontoon) design that would enable him to take off and land on water. On January 26, 1911, he flew the first {{seaplane}} from the water in the United States. Demonstrations of this advanced design were of great interest to the Navy, but more significant, as far as the Navy was concerned, was Eugene Ely successfully landing his Curtiss pusher (the same aircraft used to take off from the Birmingham) on a makeshift platform mounted on the rear deck of the battleship USS Pennsylvania. This was the first arrester-cable landing on a ship and the precursor of modern-day carrier operations. On January 28, 1911, Ellyson took off in a Curtiss “grass cutter” to become the first Naval aviator.Curtiss custom-built floats and adapted them onto a Model D so it could take off and <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> prove the concept.

50|$|In the 1950s, {{some models}} of {{helicopter}} {{such as the}} Bell 47 and 48 were fitted with pontoons {{so that they could}} rest <b>on</b> both <b>water</b> and <b>land.</b> Other helicopters such as the Sea King and the Seaguard were made with a water-resistant hull which allowed them to settle directly onto the water for long enough to effect a rescue. Such amphibious helicopters came to the fore in the 1960s but have been largely replaced by helicopters unable <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>water,</b> due <b>to</b> high aircraft development costs. Amphibious helicopters paid dividends for rescue personnel who enjoyed greater safety and success during operations. Operations that use non-amphibious helicopters rely to a higher degree on hoists, rescue baskets, and rescue swimmers.|$|R
25|$|T. Keith Glennan {{had been}} {{appointed}} the first Administrator of NASA, with Hugh L. Dryden (last Director of NACA) as his Deputy, at {{the creation of the}} agency on October 1, 1958. Glennan would report to the president through the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The group responsible for Project Mercury was NASA's Space Task Group, and the goals of the program were to orbit a manned spacecraft around Earth, investigate the pilot's ability to function in space, and to recover both pilot and spacecraft safely. Existing technology and off-the-shelf equipment would be used wherever practical, the simplest and most reliable approach to system design would be followed, and an existing launch vehicle would be employed, together with a progressive test program. Spacecraft requirements included: a launch escape system to separate the spacecraft and its occupant from the launch vehicle in case of impending failure; attitude control for orientation of the spacecraft in orbit; a retrorocket system to bring the spacecraft out of orbit; drag braking blunt body for atmospheric reentry; and <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> <b>To</b> communicate with the spacecraft during an orbital mission, an extensive communications network had to be built. In keeping with his desire to keep from giving the U.S. space program an overly military flavor, President Eisenhower at first hesitated to give the project top national priority (DX rating under the Defense Production Act), which meant that Mercury had to wait in line behind military projects for materials; however, this rating was granted in May 1959, {{a little more than a}} year and a half after Sputnik was launched.|$|R

Sea terns have deeply forked tails, and at least a shallow [...] "V" [...] is shown by all other species. The noddies (genera Anous, Procelsterna and Gygis) have unusual notched-wedge shaped tails, the longest tail feathers being the middle-outer, rather than the central or outermost.

50|$|In the Republic of Ireland, almost 1,000 {{officers}} from the Garda Síochána mounted a security operation along the border. Eight temporary border checkpoints were manned by Garda units backed up by the Irish Army. The Garda's elite tactical team, the Emergency Response Unit (ERU), and the special operations forces from the Defence Forces, the Army Ranger Wing (ARW), were deployed <b>on</b> <b>land</b> and <b>water</b> <b>to</b> secure the border from unauthorised crossings. Some of the delegations attending the summit stayed in the Republic, and protesters announced their intention to hold demonstrations in Dublin. Like in Northern Ireland, a special court had also been {{set up in the}} Republic to deal with protesters who were arrested there. The court operated day and night at Cloverhill Prison in Dublin. Suspects remanded in custody would then be moved through a tunnel from the courthouse to the adjoining jail. Meanwhile, American warships were deployed off the coast of County Donegal and in the Irish Sea as security measures.|$|R

(The twin 40 mm mount was moved to the fantail, just forward of the depth charge racks, where most ships of the class carried 20 mm mounts.) It was intended that the float plane be used for scouting for the destroyer flotilla which the ship was attached to. It would be launched by the catapult, <b>land</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> next <b>to</b> the ship, and be recovered by the aircraft crane. It turned out to be not operationally suitable for the intended purpose, and the three ships were ultimately converted to the standard Fletcher-class configuration.|$|R

Two ships constructed in 1943, the USS Stevens and the USS Halford, had redesigned derricks. Stevens became the first of the five ships to successfully launch and recover the plane. All were ultimately converted to the standard Fletcher-class configuration.|$|R
