40|$|Using {{secondary}} {{data from}} multiple sources, this study empirically examines {{the factors that}} contribute to the popularity of loyalty programs in the airline and hotel industries in the context of emerging market economies. We find that the number of partners, the number of redemption options, and the threshold for obtaining elite status all positively contribute to a loyalty program’s popularity. However, the award redemption requirement has the opposite effects on a program’s popularity. Our results show that the redemption requirement of top-tier preferential treatment negatively affects the program’s popularity. Surprisingly, the redemption requirement of entry-tier preferential treatment positively affects the program’s popularity. As one of the few program-level empirical studies, this study contributes new insights to the extant literature on <b>loyalty</b> program <b>management</b> and provides managerial guidelines for practitioners in the hospitality sector...|$|R

This review is organized around three categories of drivers that affect loyalty program effectiveness: program structure, reward structure, and customer factors.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{analyzes}} {{the conflict of}} interests between shareholders and other stakeholders, including when such conflicts of interests may arise. It is argued that shareholder value cannot be justified simply by referring to any prerogative property rights of the shareholders. Instead, shareholder value coincides with the efficient hypothetical perfect contract. However, due to contractual failures in certain bargain situations, management {{may be unable to}} "internalize the firms externalities". This means that in these situations there is a tradeoff between a broad duty of <b>loyalty</b> for <b>management</b> in listed firms and other traditional remedies. The theoretical insights are applied on a case from the Danish Supreme Court (Louis Poulsen A/S) where the interests of the stakeholders were decisive. However, it is shown that the verdict may instead harm the relevant stakeholders illustrating how cautious the legal system should use a doctrine based on the "company’s interests". In addition, the notion of a firm’s social responsibility is critically evaluated together with the associated pitfalls of accepting this concept...|$|R

The validation process aimed to validate the items that measure each of the brand loyalty influences; assess the sampling adequacy of each of the influences; test the applicability of the data for multivariate statistical analysis (such as an exploratory factor analysis); determine the importance of each of the brand loyalty influences; and test the reliability of each of the brand loyalty influences in the model.
