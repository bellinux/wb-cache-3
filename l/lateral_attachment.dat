A previously suggested relationship between <b>lateral</b> <b>attachment</b> scars and ammonoid hyponome is confirmed, however, a new interpretation is proposed for dorsal attachment scars: {{they could have}} been areas not only for attachment of the dorsal (nuchal) retractors, but also of the cephalic retractors.

40|$|Proper cell {{division}} relies on equal distribution of sister chromatids over daughter cells. This process is executed by a bipolar mitotic spindle, which via microtubule plus ends connects kinetochores of both sister chromatids to opposite poles. Various control systems {{have evolved to}} ensure equal segregation, such as destabilization of erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments. How these destabilizing actions are eventually repressed to allow for establishment of correct attachments {{has not yet been}} completely elucidated. Here, I will discuss a model that explains how destabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachments can be overcome. In this model, attachments of kinetochores to the sides of microtubules play a crucial role.

40|$|Chromosome bi-orientation occurs after {{conversion}} of initial <b>lateral</b> <b>attachments</b> between kinetochores and spindle microtubules into stable end-on attachments near the cell equator. After bi-orientation, chromosomes experience tension from spindle forces, which {{plays a key}} role in the stabilization of correct kinetochore-microtubule attachments. However, how end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments are first stabilized in the absence of tension remains a key unanswered question. To address this, we generated Drosophila S 2 cells undergoing mitosis with unreplicated genomes (SMUGs). SMUGs retained single condensed chromatids that attached laterally to spindle microtubules. Over time, laterally attached kinetochores converted into end-on attachments and experienced intra-kinetochore stretch/structural deformation, and SMUGs eventually exited a delayed mitosis with mono-oriented chromosomes after satisfying the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC). Polar ejection forces (PEFs) generated by Chromokinesins promoted the conversion from lateral to end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments that satisfied the SAC in SMUGs. Thus, PEFs convert lateral to stable end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments, independently of chromosome bi-orientation...|$|R
40|$|Established {{disturbance}} theory {{aimed at}} understanding community structure maintains that externally imposed disturbances occur randomly over {{the landscape and}} interrupt competitive exclusion, thereby increasing community diversity. In contrast to this idea, our detailed landscape surveys show that disturbances happen most frequently in sub regions of the bed that support the greatest productivity and hence thickest cover of Mytilus californianus. Crowding reduces the attachment strength of mussels, making them more susceptible to dislodgment, and also lowers the reproductive condition of those imbedded individuals. A layer of empty shells and debris develops above the rock surface, barring direct rock <b>attachment</b> and promoting <b>lateral</b> <b>attachments</b> in the surface layers.

The Portersville Shale, outcropping in southeastern Ohio, is a highly fossiliferous Pennsylvanian unit. Within this fauna is the solitary rugose coral Lophophyllidium sp. These Pennsylvanian rugose corals from the Portersville Shale have very well preserved <b>lateral</b> <b>attachment</b> scars. Ordinarily, basal and <b>lateral</b> <b>attachment</b> scars suggest attachment only during the brephic stage of growth. In the specimens collected at the Muskingum-Guersney Countyline Quarry, studies of the attachment scars suggest post-brephic attachment. A study of the trophic position and life habits of the remaining faunal elements of the Portersville Shale has yielded evidence for a highly diverse community. The community was relatively stable, food resources were intermediate, and there was high space variance.

40|$|For proper {{chromosome}} segregation, sister kinetochores must {{interact with}} microtubules from opposite spindle poles (bi-orientation). To establish bi-orientation, aberrant kinetochore-microtubule attachments are disrupted (error correction) by aurora B kinase (Ipl 1 in budding yeast). Paradoxically, during this disruption, new attachments are still formed efficiently to enable fresh attempts at bi-orientation. How {{this is possible}} remains an enigma. Here we show that kinetochore attachment to the microtubule lattice (<b>lateral</b> <b>attachment)</b> is impervious to aurora B regulation, but attachment to the microtubule plus end (end-on attachment) is disrupted by this kinase. Thus, a new <b>lateral</b> <b>attachment</b> is formed without interference, then converted to end-on attachment and released if incorrect. This process continues until bi-orientation is established and stabilized by tension across sister kinetochores. We reveal how aurora B specifically promotes disruption of the end-on attachment through phospho-regulation of kinetochore components Dam 1 and Ndc 80. Our results reveal fundamental mechanisms for promoting error correction for bi-orientation...|$|E

After complete mobilization of the colon, the lower pole of the kidney is identified. Upward traction on Gerota’s fascia and the lower pole tissues will allow identification of the gonadal vein, ureter, and psoas muscle. The ureter is swept laterally and followed proximally to the lower pole of the kidney until identification of the renal hilum.

40|$|Chromosome {{segregation}} requires stable bipolar attachments of spindle microtubules to kinetochores. The dynein/dynactin motor complex localizes transiently to kinetochores and is {{implicated in}} chromosome segregation, but its role remains poorly understood. Here, {{we use the}} Caenorhabditis elegans embryo to investigate the function of kinetochore dynein by analyzing the Rod/Zwilch/Zw 10 (RZZ) complex and the associated coiled-coil protein SPDL- 1. Both components are essential for Mad 2 targeting to kinetochores and spindle checkpoint activation. RZZ complex inhibition, which abolishes both SPDL- 1 and dynein/dynactin targeting to kinetochores, slows but does not prevent the formation of load-bearing kinetochore–microtubule attachments and reduces the fidelity of chromosome segregation. Surprisingly, inhibition of SPDL- 1, which abolishes dynein/dynactin targeting to kinetochores without perturbing RZZ complex localization, prevents the formation of load-bearing attachments during most of prometaphase and results in extensive chromosome missegregation. Coinhibition of SPDL- 1 along with the RZZ complex reduces the phenotypic severity to that observed following RZZ complex inhibition alone. We propose that the RZZ complex can inhibit the formation of load-bearing attachments and that this activity of the RZZ complex is normally controlled by dynein/dynactin localized via SPDL- 1. This mechanism could coordinate the hand-off from initial weak dynein-mediated <b>lateral</b> <b>attachments,</b> which help orient kinetochores and enhance their ability to capture microtubules, to strong end-coupled attachments that drive chromosome segregation...|$|R

Both the medial tibial plateau and the lateral tibial plateau were convex and sloped posteriorly similar to previous anatomic descriptions (Crum et al. 2003). This study found the posterior meniscotibial ligament {{to be present in}} all specimens. In agreement with Crum et al., we found that the lateral posterior meniscus terminates and blends into the ligament of Wrisberg and attaches to the femur via the ligamentous structure (Crum et al. 2003). Proffen et al. found that anterior <b>lateral</b> meniscus root <b>attachment</b> is further medial than the anterior horn attachment of the medial meniscus (Proffen et al. 2012).

Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to (1) determine the failure properties of the meniscal horn attachments, and (2) determine the strain distribution over their surfaces. Eight bovine knee joints were used to study the mechanical response of the meniscal attachments. Three meniscal attachments from one knee of each animal were tested in uniaxial tension at 2 %/s to determine the load deformation response. During the tests, the samples were marked and local strain distributions were determined with a video extensometer.
