Both sexes share equally in brood-rearing responsibilities, and in some species the male is known to participate in incubation as well.

500|$|The duck {{was first}} {{described}} by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 {{and given the}} name Anas fulva but the name was [...] "preoccupied," [...] or already used, by Friedrich Christian Meuschen in 1787 for another species. This led to the next available name proposed by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816 from a Paraguayan specimen as Anas bicolor The whistling ducks were moved to their current genus, Dendrocygna, by British ornithologist William John Swainson in recognition of their differences from other ducks. The genus name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek dendron, [...] "tree", and Latin cygnus, [...] "swan", and [...] bicolor is Latin for [...] "two-coloured".

5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} <b>duck</b> or fulvous <b>tree</b> <b>duck</b> (Dendrocygna bicolor) is a whistling duck that breeds {{across the}} world's tropical regions {{in much of}} Mexico and South America, the West Indies, the southern US, sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It has mainly reddish brown plumage, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight. Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a whistling call which is given in flight or on the ground. The preferred habitat is shallow lakes, paddy fields or other wetlands with plentiful vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Formerly named <b>tree</b> <b>ducks,</b> the {{wandering}} whistling duck has its new name {{because of their}} loud whistling calls and the whistling noise their wings make during flight.

The breast contains black spotting and the feathers are mostly dark brown. They range in size from 54-60 cm in height and weigh on average 750 grams. They mainly feed on grasses, waterlillies, water plants and occasionally insects and aquatic vertebrae.|$|R
