40|$|The society's {{dependency}} of {{a reliable}} power supply is increasing, and properly identifying {{the distance to}} the stability limits of the power system and avoiding large disturbances is thus becoming increasingly important. In this thesis, a system integrity protection scheme (SIPS) for voltage instability is proposed. First, six voltage stability indicators are studied and compared, and their performance is tested in several power system models. They are first tested in a two-bus system where the load impedance is gradually increased until the load-side voltage reaches zero. The performance of the indicators is then tested under circuit contingencies in models of the IEEE Reliability Test System and of the Norwegian power system. From the results, the most reliable indicators seem to be the ones that are based on local measurements (SDI, ISI and VSIscc). Several actions to mitigate voltage instability are described and tested in the power system models, including <b>load</b> <b>shedding,</b> <b>switching</b> of reactive compensation equipment, increasing AVR set points and increasing the active power generation. Of the unconventional actions, increasing AVR set points appears to be the most effective mitigation action. A SIPS is proposed based on the above mitigation actions, voltage stability indicators and signals from activation of OELs. The principle behind the scheme is to avoid <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> as far as possible by using indicator values and OEL activation signals to initiate preventive mitigation actions to relieve the situation when the system is approaching instability. This also reduces the necessary amount of <b>load</b> to <b>shed</b> to stabilise the system. Simulations show that the proposed SIPS works as long as it has an adequate amount of mitigation actions available. In the simulations in the model of the Hammerfest/Skaidi region in Northern Norway, there was a general lack of possible mitigation actions, providing no alternative other than shedding large amounts of load to prevent voltage collapse after critical contingencies. </p...|$|R

In Sri Lanka, Ceylon Electricity Board being the major power network authorizer {{practice}} „under-frequency load shedding‟ with the support of under-frequency <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> relays. There are some drawbacks of this under frequency <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> scheme which promotes power system authorizers to shift into a computerized power management system to form an „automated <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> scheme‟. An intelligent <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> system can provide faster and optimal load relief by utilizing actual operating conditions and knowledge of past system disturbances [1] As the first step in this study, a research survey was done about present <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> system practiced in Ceylon Electricity Board. Past failure analysis was done to identify major drawbacks of the system. During literature survey characteristics of an intelligent <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> system were observed and the way of forming an intelligent <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> system in a power network was studied. Through selection of southern part of CEB network including seven grid substations, two major hydro power plants, two thermal power plants and three mini hydro power plants, model was designed using MATLAB software. Initially a data bank was formed including load data, generation data for the selected network. Load data at each grid substation for a week day, Saturday and for Sunday were formed based on the load equations derived depending on the time of the day (off-peak, day-peak, night-peak). Generation data was adjusted according to the total load requirement. Feeders that can be shed were selected considering the category of load connected at each feeder and categorization by System Control center as high priority feeders and low priority feeders. Coding was built up in MATLAB software after importing excel sheets consisting all the data collected and modeled to create a „Graphical User Interface‟(GUI). Further code was extended for the <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> process which activates once a power imbalance occurs between generation and demand.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{adaptive}} <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> approach for windowed stream joins. In {{contrast to the}} conventional approach of dropping tuples from the input streams, we explore the concept of selective processing for <b>load</b> <b>shedding,</b> focusing on costly stream joins such as those over set-valued or weighted set-valued attributes. The main idea of our adaptive <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> approach is two-fold. First, we allow stream tuples to be stored in the windows and <b>shed</b> excessive CPU <b>load</b> by performing the stream join operations, not on the entire set of tuples within the windows, but on a dynamically changing subset of tuples that are highly beneficial. Second, we support such dynamic selective processing through three forms of runtime adaptations: By adaptation to input stream rates, we perform partial processing based <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> and dynamically determine the fraction of the windows to be processed by comparing the tuple consumption rate of join operation to the incoming stream rates. By adaptation to time correlation between the streams, we dynamically {{determine the number of}} basic windows to be used and prioritize the tuples for selective processing, encouraging CPU-limited execution of stream joins in high priority basic windows. By adaptation to join directions, we dynamically determine the most beneficial direction to perform stream joins in order to process more useful tuples under heavy load conditions and boost the utility or number of output tuples produced. Our <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> framework not only enables us to integrate utility-based <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> with time correlation-based <b>load</b> <b>shedding,</b> but more importantly, it also allows <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> to be adaptive to various dynamic stream properties. Inverted indexes are used to further speed up the execution of stream joins based on set-valued attributes. Experiments are conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} our adaptive <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> approach in terms of output rate and utility...|$|R
