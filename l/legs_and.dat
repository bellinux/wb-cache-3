On physical examination, two dimple-like, old operation scars were observed in the right buttock (Fig. 1 A).

Deep compression in his right lower buttock prom-ptly elicited a cramping pain in the right buttock which radiated in the distal <b>leg</b> <b>and,</b> more excruciating pain, in dorsum and sole of the foot.
