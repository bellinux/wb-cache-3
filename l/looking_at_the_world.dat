This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations. As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

The song deals with Armstrong's anxiety attacks {{and feelings of}} [...] "going crazy" [...] prior to being diagnosed with a panic disorder. [...] In the third verse, [...] "Basket Case" [...] references soliciting a male prostitute; Armstrong noted that [...] "I wanted to challenge myself and whoever the listener might be. It's also <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and saying, 'It's not as black and white as you think. This isn't your grandfather's prostitute – or maybe it was.'"

500|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire were {{developed}} by Game Freak and Nintendo {{under the direction of}} Junichi Masuda. As with its predecessors, Ken Sugimori was the art director, although these were the first games in which he did not single-handedly produce all of the art. When asked where his design team came up with the ideas for all of the new Pokémon, Sugimori stated that they got their ideas from past experiences in their childhood involving nature, animals, and the media and then base them on insects. Even <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in a different perspective sometimes provided inspiration for the creatures. [...] "First we select an insect and after that we add essential elements to the insects to make it more like Pokemon, such as adding some hard shape to it, to be more like steel," [...] Sugimori said, describing the process of creating a Pokémon.|$|E
500|$|After On the Origin of Species was published, Darwin became {{involved}} in producing revised editions as well as working on Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication as {{the first part of}} his planned [...] "Big Book". By the spring of 1860 he had tired of the grind of writing, and needed something fresh and interesting to study. During a family visit to relatives at Hartfield, he was searching for orchids when he noticed a sundew. He collected it and tried to feed it insects, thus beginning a long-term study of insectivorous plants. He investigated other botanical questions raised by his ideas of natural selection, including the advantages of sexual dimorphism in primulas, and the adaptive mechanisms that ensure cross-pollination in orchids. As an enthusiastic practical scientist, such investigations gave him a strong sense of personal enjoyment. He relished pitting his wits against nature, and following lucky hunches. His theory was a way of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> enabling him to find creative solutions to problems that traditional approaches could not solve. He later wrote, [...] "I am like a gambler, & love a wild experiment." ...|$|E
500|$|Escher's work is inescapably mathematical. This {{has caused}} a {{disconnect}} between his full-on popular fame {{and the lack of}} esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world. His originality and mastery of graphic techniques is respected, but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical. Movements such as conceptual art have to a degree reversed the art world's attitude to intellectuality and lyricism, but this did not rehabilitate Escher because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective. However, these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public. Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes: Parmigianino (1503–1540) had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524 Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, depicting his own image in a curved mirror, while William Hogarth's 1754 Satire on False Perspective, foreshadows Escher's playful exploration of errors in perspective. Another early artistic forerunner is Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720–1778), whose dark [...] "fantastical" [...] prints such as The Drawbridge in his Carceri ("Prisons") sequence depict perspectives into complex architecture with many stairs and ramps, peopled by walking figures. Only with 20th century movements such as Cubism, De Stijl, Dadaism and Surrealism did mainstream art start to explore Escher-like ways of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> with multiple simultaneous viewpoints. However, while Escher had much in common with, for example, Magritte's surrealism, he did not make contact with any of these movements.|$|E

[...] They also wondered whether any previous generations had acted along similar lines, and their research discussed historical analogues to the current generations. [...] The two ultimately described a recurring pattern in Anglo-American history of four generational types, each with a distinct collective persona, and a corresponding cycle of four different types of era, each with a distinct mood. The groundwork for this theory was laid out in Generations in 1991. [...] Strauss and Howe expanded on their theory and updated the terminology in The Fourth Turning in 1997. Generations helped popularize the idea that people in a particular age group tend to share a distinct set of beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors because they all grow up and come of age during a particular period in history.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} intellectual and political influences on Sullivan is Michael Oakeshott. Sullivan describes Oakeshott's thought as [...] "an anti-ideology, a nonprogramme, a way of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> whose most perfect expression might be called inactivism." [...] He argues [...] "that Oakeshott requires us to systematically discard programmes and ideologies and view each new situation sui generis. Change should only ever be incremental and evolutionary. Oakeshott viewed society as resembling language: it is learned gradually and without us really realising it, and it evolves unconsciously, and for ever." [...] In 1984, he wrote that Oakeshott offered [...] "a conservatism which ends by affirming a radical liberalism." [...] This [...] "anti-ideology" [...] is perhaps the source of accusations that Sullivan [...] "flip-flops" [...] or changes his opinions to suit the whims of the moment. He has written, [...] "A true conservative—who is, above all, an anti-ideologue—will often be attacked for alleged inconsistency, for changing positions, for promising change but not a radical break with the past, for pursuing two objectives—like liberty and authority, or change and continuity—that seem to all ideologues as completely contradictory." ...|$|E
2500|$|The entire {{discussion}} in England was over by 1696, {{and yet it}} seems to have fired Swift's imagination. Swift saw in the opposing camps of Ancients and Moderns a shorthand of two general ways of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> (see the historical background, below, for some of the senses in which [...] "new men" [...] and [...] "ancients" [...] might be understood). The Tale of a Tub attacks all who praise modernity over classical learning. Temple had done as much, but Swift, unlike Temple, has no praise for the classical world, either. There is no normative value in Rome, no lost English glen, no hearth ember to be invoked against the hubris of modern scientism. Some critics have seen in Swift's reluctance to praise mankind in any age proof of his misanthropy, and others have detected in it an overarching hatred of pride. [...] At the same time, the Tale revived the Quarrel of Ancients and Moderns at least enough to prompt Wotton to come out with a new edition of his pamphlet attacking Temple, and he appended to it an essay against the author of A Tale of a Tub. [...] Swift was able to cut pieces from Wotton's [...] "Answer" [...] to include in the fifth edition of the Tale as [...] "Notes" [...] {{at the bottom of the}} page. [...] Swift's satire also gave something of a framework for other satirists in the Scriblerian circle, and Modern vs. Ancient is picked up as one distinction between political and cultural forces.|$|E
