5000|$|According to the National Association of Legal Fee Analysis (NALFA), <b>legal</b> <b>auditing</b> is a {{litigation}} {{management practice}} and risk management tool, used by insurance and other consumers of legal services, {{to determine if}} hourly billing errors, abuses, and inefficiencies exist by carefully examining and identifying unreasonable attorney fees and expenses. [...] Because the majority of corporate law firms charge clients on an hourly basis, and base attorney promotion and compensation almost entirely {{on the number of}} hours billed, rather than the results achieved for clients, lawyers and law firms have much incentive to bill as many hours as possible, and little incentive to work efficiently or to bill fewer hours. According to the California State Bar, most lawyers who block-bill their time inflate each client bill by 10-30 percent, and at the average national billing rate of $661 per hour (as of April 2012) that means that most big-firm lawyers overcharge clients anywhere from $150,000 to $400,000 each year.|$|E
40|$|A auditoria legal na União Europeia, encontra-se, presentemente, numa grande encruzilhada. Imposta pelos poderes públicos e pelas directivas comunitárias, é criticada pelos empresários por não acrescentar valor ao negócio, e, duma maneira geral, pela sociedade que ao atribuir-lhe a característica de bem público, esperava dela respostas mais amplas do que aquelas que os auditores, espartilhados por um quadro normativo e jurídico-técnico construído pelas suas associações profissionais, conseguem ou querem facultar ao público em geral. Com efeito, as normas de auditoria que tratam do planeamento, execução e avaliação do trabalho do auditor, têm sido o refúgio eleito pelos auditores e uma justificação esgrimida, unanimemente, pela classe, para recusar liminarmente o alargamento das funções de auditoria à análise da viabilidade da empresa e à detecção de erros e fraudes. Neste contexto, a função de auditoria legal está sendo, na actualidade, fortemente criticada por não proporcionar ao público "certezas" de que: as declarações financeiras estão correctas, a empresa não falirá, não houve fraudes ou irregularidades, a empresa agiu dentro da lei, foi administrada de forma competente e adoptou uma atitude responsável face aos assuntos ambientais e sociais. É, pois, o objectivo deste trabalho, apresentar em relação à União Europeia, a origem da auditoria legal, e, em termos mais gerais, as inquietações do presente e perspectivar a função, num futuro não muito distante. Nowadays, <b>legal</b> <b>auditing</b> in the European Union {{finds itself}} facing a great crossroads. Imposed by governments and communitarian guidelines, it is criticized by {{entrepreneurs}} for not aggregating {{value to the}} business, {{as well as by}} society in general which, characterizing <b>legal</b> <b>auditing</b> as a public good, expected it to give more elaborate answers than those which the auditors, closed in by a standardizing and legal-technical framework made up by their professional associations, manage or want to provide to the public in general. Actually, the auditing standards that deal with the planning, execution and evaluation of the auditor's work have been the shelter chosen by the auditors. The auditing profession had unanimously used them as a justification for rejecting the expansion of the functions of auditing to the analysis of the company's viability and the detection of errors and fraud. In this context, nowadays, the function of legal accounting lies under heavy criticism, since it does not provide the public with the "certainties" related to such questions as correct financial statements, the going-concern of the company, the absence of fraud or irregularities, whether the company acted within the law, was administered in a competent way and adopted a responsible attitude with respect to environmental and social issues. The objective of this paper is, then, to present the origin of <b>legal</b> <b>auditing</b> with respect to the European Union and, more generally speaking, to give a picture of the current preoccupations and draw a perspective for the function in relation to the not very distant future...|$|E
40|$|Research on {{professional}} service firms emphasizes similarities in their organization and management and distinctiveness from {{other types of}} organization. In this paper we take a different tack {{and focus on the}} differences between professional service firms, that is, on heterogeneity across different professional sectors. We argue that differences between professions on a number of dimensions affect the nature of professionals' work and, in turn, the organization and management of firms across different professional sectors. Drawing on the sociology of professions literature we focus on three key dimensions of knowledge, jurisdictional control and client relationships to compare <b>legal,</b> <b>auditing</b> and engineering consulting firms. We consider how differences in these dimensions across the three professional services sectors impact upon the way firms are organized. We offer a number of propositions explicating how differences in the nature of knowledge, jurisdictional control and client relationships have implications for organizational form, team-working and pricing systems.

40|$|The links among better {{financial}} reporting, better markets, {{and better}} economy and society are arguable, but they remain poorly understood. The addition of IFRS {{to the set}} of available alternatives may improve these linkages, but granting them monopoly status does not. Claims that the universal adoption of IFRS as a single set of high-quality principles-based standards will yield global comparability are overblown. Accounting standards operate less like a uniform system of weights and measures {{and more like a}} single currency, in that both play multiple roles in modern economies. An IFRS monopoly is evolutionarily disadvantageous in that it eliminates the opportunity to compare alternative practices and learn from them. It also disallows the tailoring of financial reporting to local variations in economic, business, commercial, <b>legal,</b> <b>auditing,</b> regulatory, and governance conditions across the globe. Empirical studies of statistical covariation across financial reports produced by IFRS have yielded mixed results and, in any case, provide little insight as to the merits of granting IFRS a world monopoly. The vociferous campaign in support of IFRS monopoly is reminiscent of the 1990 s campaign in support of the now-discredited “Washington Consensus. ” Then, as now, {{it was a case of}} promoting theoretical benefits while obscuring potential costs and risks.

However, Li Quan and her husband, investment banker Stuart Bray, became concerned that the Vartys were misusing the project's funds to buy land for themselves. Later, in July 2002, the Vartys admitted to borrowing a small portion of Bray's money. After a <b>legal</b> <b>audit,</b> it was discovered that over R5-million had been borrowed by the Vartys, having been used to pay off the Vartys' Londolozi Productions debt on unauthorized salaries. Some of the money was also said to have gone into the Vartys' personal loan accounts and towards paying off their Betty's Bay seaside property. Finally, in October 2002, a few weeks before an agreement was due to be signed with Chinese authorities after the Chinese Wildlife Department began to recognize the project's conservation value, the Vartys pulled out of the project. John Varty has since founded his own [...] "tiger rewilding" [...] project, Tiger Canyons, also near Philippolis, using the land he acquired with Bray's funds.
