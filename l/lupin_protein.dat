40|$|Lupin {{proteins}} {{have repeatedly}} {{been shown to}} exhibit lipid lowering properties and reduce aortic calcification in atherosclerosis models. Despite many efforts on its identification, the component {{which is responsible for}} the observed effects is still under debate. Phytic acid which is generally associated with <b>lupin</b> <b>protein</b> isolates has currently been described as bioactive plant compound. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the role of associated phytic acid for the described <b>lupin</b> <b>protein</b> effects. A two-factorial study with ApoE knockout mice was conducted in which mice received <b>lupin</b> <b>protein</b> isolate or casein with or without phytase. Phytic acid was added to the casein diets to a final concentration identical to the <b>lupin</b> <b>protein</b> diets. Here we show that the serum concentrations of cholesterol, lathosterol and desmosterol were lower and the faecal bile acid excretion was higher in the groups fed lupin proteins than in the groups fed casein (p <  0. 05). Mice that received the <b>lupin</b> <b>protein</b> diet containing phytic acid were characterized by a lower aortic calcification than mice of the other three groups (p <  0. 05). In conclusion, our results show that the cholesterol lowering properties of <b>lupin</b> <b>protein</b> isolate were not caused by phytic acid. However, the hypocalcific action of lupin proteins appears to depend on the combination of lupin proteins and phytic acid...|$|E

Significant differences in the protein reactivities were observed. In particular, there was a direct relationship between the level of peanut-specific IgE’s and the cross-reactivity to lupin proteins; also the reactivity of each serum appeared to be unique.

40|$|AbstractMany common {{foods like}} salad {{dressings}} or milk products are processed by high-pressure homogenization. Compared to conventional treatments, dynamic high pressures {{have been found}} to induce significant changes in the protein layer at the interface of these emulsions. But until now the influence of high-pressure homogenization on the functionality of proteins itself has only been scarcely studied. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the influences of high-pressure homogenization on the functional properties of <b>lupin</b> <b>proteins</b> of different <b>lupin</b> species because these proteins exhibit good functionality and can be applied as natural emulsifiers in food systems. Especially, the influences on the emulsifying and gelling properties of <b>lupin</b> <b>proteins</b> were studied. The gel strength and the emulsifying capacities of L. albus proteins were increased significantly after high-pressure homogenization with pressures up to 150 MPa at 35 and 60 °C, respectively. The protein solubilities were only barely influenced by homogenization. Completely different results were obtained for L. angustifolius proteins. The emulsifying properties could not be enhanced by high pressure homogenization, which might be due to the presence of different protein fractions in protein isolates of these two species. These results imply that high-pressure homogenization has interesting potential for enhancing functional properties of <b>lupin</b> <b>proteins</b> of L. albus L., while the functional properties of L. angustifolius proteins after homogenization remained similar. High-pressure homogenization is therefore likely to be a tool for enhancing protein functionality, especially for proteins having inferior functionality due to heat treatment or prior processing...|$|R

Rheological investigations revealed higher firmness and a viscoelastic solid-like behavior of ILP, in contrast to MLP that showed viscoelastic, liquid-like properties. Protein solubility of MLP was higher compared to ILP and solubility minima were slightly different for both <b>lupin</b> <b>protein</b> isolates. The protein isolates exhibited different technofunctional properties with ILP showing higher water binding capacity, lower oil binding capacity and lower emulsifying capacity than MLP.

In the last decade, reports assessing the benefits of <b>lupin</b> seed <b>proteins</b> have proliferated and, nowadays, the pharmaceutical industry is interested in <b>lupin</b> <b>proteins</b> for human health. Modern genomics and proteomics have hugely contributed to describing the diversity of lupin storage genes and, above all, proteins. Most of these studies have been centered on few edible lupin species. However, Lupinus genus comprises hundreds of species spread throughout the Old and New Worlds, and these resources have been scarcely explored and exploited. We present here a detailed review of the literature on the potential of <b>lupin</b> seed <b>proteins</b> as nutraceuticals, and the use of -omic tools to analyze seed storage polypeptides in main edible lupins and their diversity at the Lupinus inter- and intra-species level. In this sense, proteomics, more than any other, has been a key approach. Proteomics has shown that <b>lupin</b> seed <b>protein</b> diversity, where post-translational modifications yield a large number of peptide variants with a potential concern in bioactivity, goes far beyond gene diversity. The future extended use of second and third generation proteomics should definitely help to go deeper into coverage and characterization of lupin seed proteome. Biological significance Some important topics concerning storage <b>proteins</b> from <b>lupin</b> seeds are presented and analyzed in an integrated way in this review. Proteomic approaches have been essential in characterizing <b>lupin</b> seed <b>protein</b> diversity, which goes far beyond gene diversity since the protein level adds to the latter differential proteolytic cleavage of conglutin pro-proteins and a diverse array of glycosylation forms and sites.

Upon thermal treatment, <b>lupin</b> <b>proteins,</b> namely β-conglutin and α-conglutin, were stepwise denatured, which was accompanied by the exposure of masked sulfhydryl groups, the decrease of free sulfhydryl groups and reoxidation to disulfide bridges. Moreover, quaternary structure of <b>lupin</b> <b>proteins</b> was influenced upon heat treatment displayed with molecular weight distribution (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to optimise the yield percentage of blue lupins in mixed cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted at two locations in Northern Germany (Institute of Organic Farming near Hamburg and Institute of Plant and Soil Science at Braunschweig). Two types of blue lupins, the determinate and branched type were cultivated together with spring barley, spring wheat or fodder peas in different seeding ratios (SR) : 50 % : 50 %, 62, 5 % : 37, 5 % and 75 % : 25 % of the respective pure cropping seeding rate.

Total grain yield decreased with increasing SR of blue lupins whereas, in contrast, the yield of blue <b>lupins,</b> <b>protein</b> content and protein yield increased. This shows the low competitive ability of blue lupins against the mixed cropping partners, particularly cereals. Therefore, the yield percentage of blue lupins in mixed cropping with cereals did not reach more than 25 %.

40|$|The need {{of quality}} protein in the {{aquaculture}} sector {{has forced the}} incorporation of alternative plant proteins into feeding diets. However, most plant proteins show lower digestibility levels than fish meal proteins, especially in carnivorous fishes.

A reduction of low digestibility proteins will not only increase feed efficiency, but also reduce water pollution. Little is known about specific digestible protein profiles and/or molecular identification of more bioavailable plant proteins in fish diets. In this study, we identified low digestibility L. luteus seed proteins using Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) crude digestive enzymes in an in vitro assay.

The fermentation with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis led to a significant decrease in flatulence causing oligosaccharides. During fermentation with Lactobacillus plantarum the phytic acid content was partially degraded. Conclusions: Neither the secondary plant metabolites nor the antinutritives of lupin flour inhibited the growth or metabolic activity of the tested micro-organisms. Therefore, lupin flour is suitable for lactic fermentation. Some strains showed the ability to degrade oligosaccharides or phytic acid. Significance and Impact of the Study: This work contributes to the fundamental knowledge of the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria during fermentation of lupin substrates. Fermentation of lupin raw materials could be used to improve the nutritional value of the substrates due to the reduction of antinutritives...|$|E
40|$|Lupin is a legume that is {{used for}} human nutrition. Unfortunately lupin is known to trigger {{allergic}} reactions and therefore a mandatory declaration on the label of foodstuffs is required (Directive 2007 / 68 /EC). To protect the allergic consumer lupin detection methods are needed. Here we present the development of two real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods that allow the detection of lupin-specific DNA. In cookies lupin could be detected {{at a level of}} only 5 mg per kg food matrix ELISA analyses were performed to compare the detection of lupin DNA with that of <b>lupin</b> <b>protein,</b> and the real-time PCR method targeting d-conglutin was shown to yield results comparable to those obtained by ELISA.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} with Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua (L.), to determine the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) of protein and energy and the digestible energy (DE) content in feed ingredients widely available in Canada. We also tested the assumption of 2 ̆ 01 cindependency 2 ̆ 01 d used in digestibility studies. The feed ingredients included two fish meals (herring, anchovy), three crustacean by-product meals (whole krill, crab, shrimp), two animal by-product meals (poultry by-product, hydrolyzed feather), six oilseed meals (soybean, soy protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, canola, canola protein concentrate, flaxseed), two pulse meals (white <b>lupin,</b> pea <b>protein</b> concentrate) and two cereal grain meals (corn gluten, wheat gluten). Protein ADCs were high for wheat gluten meal (99. 9...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of our studies were seeds of two lupin species Lupinus luteus L. and Lupinus angustifolius L. cvs. Lord and Graf respectively. Lupin seeds were germinated at 15 and 24 o C and during two, {{three and four}} days. In the lupin sprouts antinutritional factors: alkaloids and raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) and five nitrogen fractions: non protein (Nnp), albumin (A), globulin (G), glutelin and prolamin (Gt+P) and nitrogen residue fraction (Nr) were determined. The level of these compounds was compared with the proper ones of initial material (not germinated seeds). These studies showed that the germination process clearly affects the decrease of antinutritional factors: RFOs and alkaloids. The decrease level of these compounds depended on such factors like, lupin species and used germination conditions. It {{was found on the}} base of nitrogen analysis of particular protein fractions that the germination process of lupin seeds causes deep quantitative and qualitative changes in fractional composition of <b>lupin</b> <b>proteins.</b> It especially concerns the decrease of globulin and residual fraction content and distinct increase of Nnp fraction. The changes in other fractions were not so unequivocal in comparison with the mentioned above and depended on lupin species, temperature and time of germination. Qualitative changes of A, G and Gt+P fractions caused by germination were confirmed by gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The amino acid analysis of seeds and sprouts of Nnp fractions showed an increased content of Asp, Ser, Ala, Pro - non essential amino acids (NEAA), and Val, Met, iLeu, Leu, Thr - essential amino acids (EAA). Simultaneously a decrease of Glu, Arg (NEAA), Phe, Lis, Cys (EAA) contents was observed. Generally the germination process causes the decrease of total NEAA and an increase of total EAA in Nnp fractions of both lupin species...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} {{was to assess the}} use and acceptability of the lupin seed and sprout as a human food. Two studies were designed. 1. The first study involved the biochemical analysis and nutritional evaluation of the <b>lupin</b> sprout. <b>Protein</b> Efficiency Ratio, and Apparent Biological Value, Net Protein Utilization, and Digestibility tests measure protein quality. Biochemical assays included nitrogen and hexane extracts, amino acid profile, and selected minerals and anti-nutritive factors. 2. The second quality study investigated the changes that occur as a result of in the eating partial substitution of lupin flour into a wheat flour-based, standard shortbread biscuit. This was achieved through recipe development, and scientifically designed and controlled sensory evaluation. Lupin was incorporated into the product at 10 % and 30 % of the total flour...|$|R
