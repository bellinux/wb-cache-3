50|$|Monica {{is able to}} {{find some}} ropes and goes down the <b>ladder</b> <b>shaft</b> to an empty landing. She finds Kylie's body {{in one of the}} tunnels. The fake firefighter/prisoner then tries to kill her but an {{aftershock}} occurs and Monica is able to kill him with the axe instead. Monica finally manages to escape through the tunnel and onto a beach. She walks around the beach, bewildered {{that she was able to}} escape to safety at last. As she turns around, she sees a tsunami rushing toward her.|$|E
50|$|The ship {{consists}} of several levels, or decks, connected vertically with an elevator and a <b>ladder</b> <b>shaft.</b> Operating the elevator notifies the security robot, {{so most of}} the time the player uses the shaft. Much of the game {{consists of}} an attempt to collect DNA samples that will allow access to other areas of the ship, where samples of higher-ranking crew members can be found. This process will eventually allow access to the bridge. In addition, the crew left several video recordings in the dataports that contain access codes needed to destroy the Defender through a variety of methods - crushing it or throwing it into space for instance. Once this is complete the player has five minutes before another Defender appears, during which they have to get to the bridge and set the ship to self-destruct. Like the mission to destroy the Defender, there are several ways to destroy the ship.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Matt {{commits suicide}} by jumping down the {{elevator}} shaft. After climbing down a <b>ladder</b> in the <b>shaft</b> to the underground tunnels of the hospital, Sasha becomes violently ill and starts coughing up blood. The two stop to rest, {{and while they}} sleep, Sasha is covered by a strange mist and disappears. Lance alone wanders down the seemingly endless corridors as his mental health spirals downward, feeding on rats to survive.|$|R
50|$|British {{soldiers}} of the 170th Tunneling Company established a listening system {{at the bottom of}} shaft 8bis which picked up sounds of activity in August 1917.In early September there was an underground struggle in which the Germans were forced out of the mine.Around midnight of 25-26 September 1917 the 38th German Pioneer Regiment poured about 8 tons of the suffocating gas chloropicrin into Mine 8, and carried by the ventilation systems the gas took under four hours to travel the 6 km to Mine 9 and the shaft of Mine 12.The people around the base of Shaft 8 died, but those further away escaped via the <b>ladders</b> of <b>Shaft</b> 9.After the attack a thick masonry wall was built in the main haulage gallery to isolate the sectors near shafts 8 and 8bis.The Germans blew up the casing of Shaft 8 and the heads of Shafts 8 and 8bis.The mine was reopened after the war, and finally closed in 1961.|$|R
50|$|The Cherry Mine {{had been}} opened in 1905 by the St. Paul Coal Company to supply coal for the trains of its {{controlling}} company, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad. The mine {{consisted of three}} horizontal veins, each deeper than the last. The veins were connected vertically by two shafts set some 100 yards apart. Both the main shaft and the secondary shaft contained wooden stairs and <b>ladders.</b> The main <b>shaft</b> was capped by an 85-foot steel tower which controlled a mechanical hoisting cage. A large fan, located in a shunt off the secondary shaft, pushed fresh air into the mine.|$|R

50|$|The {{property}} was originally considered too far east to contain valuable ore deposits. It was first considered a mining location in 1896, after lumberman Ernest Koch first discovered copper there. The company was later established in November 1898, after Joseph E. Gay had conducted a successful exploration for copper {{on the property}} earlier that year. When established, John Stanton was president.Stocks were offered at a price $7.50, {{and by the end}} of 1899 there were 594 individual stockholders.In 1899, construction on the property began, after the company had raised $7,517.50. Shafts No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 were dug. Each shaft had three compartments with two skiproads, and a separate pipe and <b>ladder</b> way compartment. <b>Shaft</b> No. 2 had an 8 drill air compressor and No. 3 had a 25 drill air compressor. Both were Ingersoll Sergeant make, with Rand drills for underground use. A fourth shaft was constructed in 1901.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{impression}} of it is, of course, imperfect; but I {{know it was}} a dull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all-fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instant's pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw {{for the first time a}} number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of <b>ladder</b> down the <b>shaft.</b> Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|Then, that I {{might be}} more alone with thee, [3] [...] Three years I lived upon a pillar, high [...] Six cubits, and three years on one of twelve; [...] And twice three years I crouch'd on one that rose [...] Twenty by measure; last of all, I grew [...] Twice ten long weary weary years to this, [...] That numbers forty cubits from the soil. [...] I think that I have borne as much as this-- [...] Or else I dream--and for so long a time, [...] If I may measure time by yon slow light, [...] And this high dial, which my sorrow crowns-- [...] So much--even so. And yet I know not well, [...] For that the evil ones comes here, and say, [...] "Fall down, O Simeon: thou hast suffer'd long [...] For ages and for ages!" [...] then they prate [...] Of penances I cannot have gone thro', [...] Perplexing me with lies; and oft I fall, [...] Maybe for months, in such blind lethargies, [...] That Heaven, and Earth, and Time are choked. But yet [...] Bethink thee, Lord, while thou and all the saints [...] Enjoy {{themselves}} in Heaven, and men on earth [...] House {{in the shade of}} comfortable roofs, [...] Sit with their wives by fires, eat wholesome food, [...] And wear warm clothes, and even beasts have stalls, [...] I, 'tween the spring and downfall of the light, [...] Bow down one thousand and two hundred times, [...] To Christ, the Virgin Mother, and the Saints; [...] Or in the night, after a little sleep, [...] I wake: the chill stars sparkle; I am wet [...] With drenching dews, or stiff with crackling frost. [...] I wear an undress'd goatskin on my back; [...] A grazing iron collar grinds my neck; [...] And in my weak, lean arms I lift the cross, [...] And strive and wrestle with thee till I die: [...] O mercy, mercy! wash away my sin. [...] O Lord, thou knowest what a man I am; [...] A sinful man, conceived and born in sin: [...] 'Tis their own doing; this is none of mine; [...] Lay it not to me. Am I to blame for this, [...] That here come those that worship me? Ha! ha! [...] They think that I am somewhat. What am I? [...] The silly people take me for a saint, [...] And bring me offerings of fruit and flowers: [...] And I, in truth (thou wilt bear witness here) [...] Have all in all endured as much, and more [...] Than many just and holy men, whose names [...] Are register'd and calendar'd for saints. [...] Good people, you do ill to kneel to me. [...] What is it I can have done to merit this? [...] I am a sinner viler than you all. [...] It may be I have wrought some miracles, [4] [...] And cured some halt and maim'd; but what of that? [...] It may be, no one, even among the saints, [...] May match his pains with mine; but what of that? [...] Yet do not rise: for you may look on me, [...] And in your looking you may kneel to God. [...] Speak! is there any of you halt or maim'd? [...] I think you know I have some power with Heaven [...] From my long penance: let him speak his wish. [...] Yes, I can heal. Power goes forth from me. [...] They say that they are heal'd. Ah, hark! they shout [...] "St. Simeon Stylites". Why, if so, [...] God reaps a harvest in me. O my soul, [...] God reaps a harvest in thee. If this be, [...] Can I work miracles and not be saved? [...] This is not told of any. They were saints. [...] It cannot be but that I shall be saved; [...] Yea, crown'd a saint. They shout, [...] "Behold a saint!" [...] And lower voices saint me from above. [...] Courage, St. Simeon! This dull chrysalis [...] Cracks into shining wings, and hope ere death [...] Spreads more and more and more, that God hath now [...] Sponged and made blank of crimeful record all [...] My mortal archives. O my sons, my sons, [...] I, Simeon of the pillar, by surname Stylites, among men; [...] I, Simeon, The watcher on the column till the end; [...] I, Simeon, whose brain the sunshine bakes; [...] I, whose bald brows in silent hours become [...] Unnaturally hoar with rime, do now [...] From my high nest of penance here proclaim [...] That Pontius and Iscariot by my side [...] Show'd like fair seraphs. On the coals I lay, [...] A vessel full of sin: all hell beneath [...] Made me boil over. Devils pluck'd my sleeve; [5] [...] Abaddon and Asmodeus caught at me. [...] I smote them with the cross; they swarm'd again. [...] In bed like monstrous apes they crush'd my chest: [...] They flapp'd my light out as I read: I saw [...] Their faces grow between me and my book: [...] With colt-like whinny and with hoggish whine [...] They burst my prayer. Yet this way was left, [...] And by this way I'scaped them. Mortify [...] Your flesh, like me, with scourges and with thorns; [...] Smite, shrink not, spare not. If it may be, fast [...] Whole Lents, and pray. I hardly, with slow steps, [...] With slow, faint steps, and much exceeding pain, [...] Have scrambled past those pits of fire, that still [...] Sing in mine ears. But yield not me the praise: [...] God only thro' his bounty hath thought fit, [...] Among the powers and princes of this world, [...] To make me an example to mankind, [...] Which few can reach to. Yet I do not say [...] But that a time may come--yea, even now, [...] Now, now, his footsteps smite the threshold stairs [...] Of life--I say, that time is at the doors [...] When you may worship me without reproach; [...] For I will leave my relics in your land, [...] And you may carve a shrine about my dust, [...] And burn a fragrant lamp before my bones, [...] When I am gather'd to the glorious saints. [...] While I spake then, a sting of shrewdest pain [...] Ran shrivelling thro' me, and a cloudlike change, [...] In passing, with a grosser film made thick [...] These heavy, horny eyes. The end! the end! [...] Surely the end! What's here? a shape, a shade, [...] A flash of light. Is that the angel there [...] That holds a crown? Come, blessed brother, come, [...] I know thy glittering face. I waited long; [...] My brows are ready. What! deny it now? [...] Nay, draw, draw, draw nigh. So I clutch it. Christ! [...] 'Tis gone: 'tis here again; the crown! the crown! [6] [...] So now 'tis fitted on and grows to me, [...] And from it melt the dews of Paradise, [...] Sweet! sweet! spikenard, and balm, and frankincense. [...] Ah! let me not be fool'd, sweet saints: I trust [...] That I am whole, and clean, and meet for Heaven. [...] Speak, if there be a priest, a man of God, [...] Among you there, and let him presently [...] Approach, and lean a <b>ladder</b> on the <b>shaft,</b> [...] And climbing up into my airy home, [...] Deliver me the blessed sacrament; [...] For by the warning of the Holy Ghost, [...] I prophesy that I shall die to-night, [...] A quarter before twelve. [7] But thou, O Lord, [...] Aid all this foolish people; let them take [...] Example, pattern: lead them to thy light.|$|R
