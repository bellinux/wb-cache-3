6000|$|Cecily. [Sternly, {{in a calm}} voice.] Yes, as usual. [Merriman {{begins to}} clear table and <b>lay</b> <b>cloth.</b> A long pause. Cecily and Gwendolen glare at each other.] ...|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} last page of the noble story as Toff came in to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth</b> for dinner.|$|R
60|$|In {{a minute}} more {{one of the}} {{apprentices}} came in to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth,</b> and Amyas questioned him about his master.|$|R
60|$|COOK. Tt! Tt! Well! Here's the pickled onions. Miss Mary loves 'em! Now then, {{let me see}} you <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth.</b>|$|R
60|$|The waiter entered {{with the}} cocktails {{and began to}} <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth</b> for dinner. Philip paced the room uneasily until he had gone.|$|R
60|$|Jane {{slipped off}} Philip's knees, {{and they all}} {{went back to the}} kitchen. Sally began to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth</b> on the long Spanish table.|$|R
60|$|There was a gas {{stove in}} the kitchen, {{and when she}} had put the liver on, Mildred came into the sitting-room to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Now {{the cook}} sent up to signify that supper was almost ready, and sent one to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth,</b> the dishes, {{and to set}} the salt and bread in order.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why don't {{you go and}} {{see about}} it, you old fool?" [...] Stephen replied. [...] "Pick up those pieces of glass there, <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth,</b> and get some supper ready." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took the}} {{miniature}} from its shelf. There {{would be no}} harm now in learning her name. So I stood with it in my hand till a little later my landlady entered to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Lord Glenvarloch then {{applied to}} old Deborah the char-woman, by whose {{intermediation}} he was {{provided with a}} tolerably decent dinner; and the only embarrassment which he experienced, was from the almost forcible entry of the old dotard his landlord, who insisted upon giving his assistance at <b>laying</b> the <b>cloth.</b> Nigel had some difficulty {{to prevent him from}} displacing his arms and some papers which were lying on a small table at which he had been sitting; and nothing short of a stern and positive injunction to the contrary could compel him to use another board (though there were two in the room) for the purpose of <b>laying</b> the <b>cloth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Jekyl entered accordingly, {{and broke}} out with [...] "I {{am glad to}} see one of your fellows <b>laying</b> a <b>cloth</b> for two in your parlour, Etherington--I was afraid you were going down among these confounded bores again to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucilla {{was alone}} in the sitting-room when the waiter came to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth.</b> He looked round, as if to secure secrecy, and then remarked in a low {{confidential}} voice, 'There's been a gentleman inquiring for you, ma'am.' ...|$|R
60|$|It came in {{a remarkably}} short time, and then Flippityflop {{assisted}} Dot to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth</b> on the blue and silver table, while the children proceeded to eat of the sandwiches, cake and apple-tarts that remained in the basket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, {{it is as}} well to be on {{the safe}} side. When the fire has burnt low we will <b>lay</b> a <b>cloth</b> over the top of the boat, so that the glow of the embers will not be seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If ever I {{see the end}} of this one," [...] I groaned, [...] "I'll promise {{never to}} venture on another. They are <b>laying</b> the <b>cloth,</b> so it's hardly worth while my going up. I'll stay below and unpack my things." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Tetterby, his lady-mother, who {{had been}} sitting with her bonnet and shawl thrown back, as aforesaid, thoughtfully turning her wedding-ring round and round upon her finger, now rose, and {{divesting}} herself of her out-of-door attire, began to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth</b> for supper.|$|R
60|$|After this, {{under the}} titles {{nominative}} verb, accusative, give him examples of verbs transitive; as I see you, you see me, the fire burns the wood, the boy makes the fire, the cook roasts the meat, the butler <b>lays</b> the <b>cloth,</b> we eat our dinner.|$|R
60|$|Quebec and Malta <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth</b> for dinner, while Woolwich, serving, as beseems him, {{under his}} father, keeps the fowls revolving. To these young scullions Mrs. Bagnet {{occasionally}} imparts a wink, or {{a shake of}} the head, or a crooked face, as they made mistakes.|$|R
60|$|These last sounds, so {{like those}} in which, as legends inform us, the ferocious giant Blunderbore was {{in the habit of}} expressing his opinion {{that it was time to}} <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth,</b> were too {{distinctly}} audible to be again mistaken for the workings of fancy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better to {{be without}} logic than without feeling," [...] {{retorted}} Frances, who was now passing backwards and forwards from her cupboard to the table, intent, if not on hospitable thoughts, at least on hospitable deeds, for she was <b>laying</b> the <b>cloth,</b> and putting plates, knives and forks thereon.|$|R
60|$|He {{was to come}} to {{an early}} supper, which she had {{arranged}} {{to take the place of}} a wedding-breakfast next day--the latter not being feasible in her present situation. An hour or so after dark the wife of the farmer who lived in the other part of the house entered Christine's parlour to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Having {{finished}} <b>laying</b> the <b>cloth,</b> Mrs Miff {{backed out}} of the room after the manner of attendants on royalty, overturning two chairs with her skirts as she went, and showing her full front to the enemy. But the enemy gave no sign, good or bad. All the tufts were down flat, and he stood motionless while Mrs Miff retreated.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘And so,’ said Meg, busying herself exultingly {{with the}} basket, ‘I’ll <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth</b> at once, father; for I {{have brought the}} tripe in a basin, and tied the basin up in a pocket-handkerchief; and if I like to be proud for once, and spread that for a cloth, {{and call it a}} cloth, there’s no law to prevent me; is there, father?’ ...|$|R
60|$|Before she had {{finished}} her indignant words, Hans was coming in from some unknown region to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth</b> for supper, and Peregrine, with an imprecation under his breath, {{had gone to the}} door to admit his two comrades, who came into the narrow entry on a gust of wind as it were, struggling out of their cloaks, stamping and swearing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will your ladyship {{stay the}} night?" [...] asked pretty Miss Sally, {{who was already}} busy <b>laying</b> a snow-white <b>cloth</b> on the table, preparatory to {{providing}} a simple supper for her ladyship.|$|R
40|$|Advertisement for Blanchard-Deguitard, a French {{merchant}} of balloons and other products. Includes a picture Maison Blanchard, with office, store, and a shed where women <b>lay</b> out <b>cloth</b> on long tables. Title from item.

6000|$|... "Fizz," [...] said John. [...] "Some of the poppy {{stuff from}} the end bin; a bottle of the old port that Michael liked, to follow; and see and don't shake the port. And look here, light the fire--and the gas, and draw down the blinds; it's cold and it's getting dark. And then you can <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth.</b> And, I say--here, you! bring me down some clothes." ...|$|R
60|$|The candles were brought, {{the fire}} was stirred up, and a fresh log of wood thrown on. In ten minutes' time, a waiter was <b>laying</b> the <b>cloth</b> for dinner, the {{curtains}} were drawn, {{the fire was}} blazing brightly, and everything looked (as everything always does, in all decent English inns) as if the travellers had been expected, and their comforts prepared, for days beforehand.|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} day was Sunday, and he rose at twelve with a racking headache. He {{had promised to}} take a chop with his friend at two, and at that hour he presented himself, with difficulty, at Mrs. Poppins's room. She was busy <b>laying</b> the <b>cloth</b> as he entered, but his friend was seated, half-dressed, unshorn, pale, and drooping, in an old arm-chair near the window.|$|R
60|$|As {{he entered}} the dining-hall, he saw Dates {{retiring}} from another door with his tray. Alone and meditative, by the bared half of the polished table, sat his mother at her dessert; fruit-baskets, and a decanter were before her. On the other leaf of the same table, still <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth,</b> folded back upon itself, and set out with one plate and its usual accompaniments.|$|R
6000|$|His {{head was}} heavy; his mind felt confused. He threw {{himself on the}} sofa--utterly {{exhausted}} by the ordeal through which he had passed. In grief, in fear, in pain, the time still comes when Nature claims her rights. The wretched worn-out man fell into a restless sleep. He was awakened by the waiter, <b>laying</b> the <b>cloth</b> for dinner. [...] "It's just ready, sir," [...] the servant announced; [...] "shall I knock at the lady's door?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Poor Cis, {{she knelt}} gazing perplexed into the embers, {{now and then}} {{touching}} a stick to make them glow, till Nat, the chief of [...] "the old blue bottles of serving-men," [...] came in to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth</b> for dinner, exclaiming, [...] "So, Mistress Cis! Madam doth cocker thee truly, letting thee dream over the coals, till thy face be as red as my Lady's new farthingale, while she is toiling away like a very scullion." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} to his mother with his mind tolerably at ease. His wife soon {{followed him into the}} parlor, and the meeting between her and Mrs. Scatchard passed off better than he had ventured to anticipate, though he observed with secret apprehension that his mother, resolutely as she controlled herself in other respects, could not look his wife in the face when she spoke to her. It was a relief to him, therefore, when Rebecca began to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{he spoke}} {{the old woman}} entered, and, eyeing me stealthily, began to <b>lay</b> the <b>cloth,</b> while my host, taking a chair {{the other side of}} the hearth, sat looking silently into the fire. The table set, the old woman brought in a pair of fowls ready carved in a dish, and placing three chairs, left the room. The old man hesitated a moment, and then, rising from his chair, placed a large screen in front of the fire and slowly {{extinguished}} the candles.|$|R
60|$|The {{landlord}} now busied {{himself in}} <b>laying</b> the <b>cloth,</b> in which process Mr Codlin obligingly assisted by setting forth his own {{knife and fork}} in the most convenient place and establishing himself behind them. When everything was ready, the landlord took off the cover for the last time, and then indeed there burst forth such a goodly promise of supper, {{that if he had}} offered to put it on again or had hinted at postponement, he would certainly have been sacrificed on his own hearth.|$|R
