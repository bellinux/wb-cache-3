40|$|The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) {{aboard the}} Canadian {{satellite}} SCISAT (launched in August 2003) {{was designed to}} investigate {{the composition of the}} upper troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. ACE-FTS utilizes solar occultation to measure temperature and pressure as well as vertical profiles of over thirty chemical species including O 3, H 2 O, CH 4, N 2 O, CO, NO, NO 2, N 2 O 5, HNO 3, HCl, ClONO 2, CCl 3 F, CCl 2 F 2, and HF. Global coverage for each species is obtained approximately over a three month period and measurements are made with a vertical resolution of typically 3 – 4 km. A quality-controlled climatology has been created for each of these 14 baseline species, where individual profiles are averaged over the period of February 2004 to February 2009. Measurements used are from the ACE-FTS version 2. 2 data set including updates for O 3 and N 2 O 5. The climatological fields are provided on a monthly and three-monthly basis (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) at 5 degree latitude and equivalent <b>latitude</b> <b>spacing</b> and on 28 pressure surfaces (26 of which are defined by the Stratospheric Processes And their Role in Climate (SPARC) Chemistry-Climate Model Validation Activity).

40|$|With the NASA Vision for Space Exploration {{focusing}} on the return of astronauts to the Moon and eventually to Mars, architectures for new navigation concepts must be derived and analyzed. One such concept, developed by the Space Communications Architecture Working Group (SCAWG), is to place a constellation of satellites around the Moon. Previously completed analyses examined the performance of multiple satellite constellations and recommended a constellation oriented as a Walker polar 6 / 2 / 1 with a semimajor axis (SMA) of 9250 km. One requirement of the constellations that were examined was that they have continuous access to any location on the lunar surface. In this report, the polar 6 / 2 / 1 and polar 8 / 2 / 1, with equal SMAs, are examined in greater detail. The dilution-of-precision (DoP) methodology is utilized {{to examine the effects}} of longitude surface points, latitude surface points, elevation requirements, and modified failure modes for these two constellations with regard to system availability. Longitude study results show that points along a meridian closely approximate the results of a global set of data points. Latitude study results show that previous assumptions with regard to <b>latitude</b> <b>spacing</b> are adequate to simulate global system availability.

40|$|This is {{the first}} study to compare plasma {{depletion}} drifts with the ambient plasma drifts and neutral winds in the post sunset equatorial ionosphere using global-scale satellite observations. The local time and latitude variations of the drift velocities of O+ plasma depletions at 350 – 400 ?km altitude are derived from the observations of the far ultraviolet imager operated on the IMAGE satellite during 10 March to 7 June 2002. These depletion drift velocities are compared with the simultaneously measured ion drift velocities and neutral winds by the ROCSAT- 1 and the CHAMP satellites for a similar time period. The analysis shows that the zonal drift velocity of plasma depletions is smaller than both the ambient ion zonal drift velocity and the neutral zonal wind at 18 : 00 – 20 : 00 magnetic local time, and after 21 : 00, the variations of these velocities are similar. The difference of the plasma depletion drift with the background {{is found to be}} smaller at lower latitudes. Furthermore, the zonal drift velocity of the depletion is found to have a large latitudinal gradient specifically at 12 °– 18 ° magnetic latitude, which again does not match the ambient ion drift and the neutral wind. This latitudinal difference has been reported by previous studies, but those studies use models and they only compare the depletion drifts with the modeled neutral winds. This study provides a measure of the difference that has never been studied before by any study using global observations. It has been suggested that polarization electric fields inside the plasma depletion structure drive the plasma to drift westward and thus the depletion structure moves to the east. The latitudinal gradient of the depletion drift velocity seen here in this study could also be explained by the polarization electric fields. For the C-shaped (reversed C) depletion, the polarization electric fields inside the depletion drive a westward drift of plasma and this drift velocity changes with increasing latitude. Consequently, the depletion drift has a latitudinal gradient becoming significant at higher <b>latitudes.</b> <b>Space</b> EngineeringAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

The advent of systems such as Iridium brought other methods of communications, but HF remains critical for vessels that do not carry the newer equipment and as a critical backup system for others. Space weather events can create irregularities in the ionosphere that scatter HF signals instead of reflecting them, preventing HF communications. At auroral and polar <b>latitudes,</b> small <b>space</b> weather events that occur frequently disrupt HF communications.

40|$|International audienceA {{variety of}} {{observations}} and model simulations {{indicate that the}} stratosphere has cooled in most parts since 1979. Several studies based on global-coverage satellite observations suggest a notable spatial and seasonal structure of the stratospheric temperature trend. At that, the latitude and seasonal patterns {{reported in the literature}} appear rather inconsistent with one another. Further, an accurate evaluation of lower stratospheric temperature change is hindered by the broad weighting function of space-borne microwave sounders such as MSU and SSU. Our study attempts to remedy this issue through a joint analysis of two 15 -yr satellite data sets on stratospheric temperature: Aqua AMSU and GPS Radio Occultations (RO). Evaluation of stratospheric trends using Aqua AMSU-A instrument benefits from the fixed orbit of Aqua satellite, which eliminates the tidal effect on the trends due to orbital drift. In addition, AMSU has a more vertically refined weighting functions (vertical half-width of 10 km) compared to those of SSU or MSU. We use IMICA version of AMSU-A measurements spanning September 2002 through September 2016. GPS-RO is a well established technique, providing stratospheric temperature profiles at 1 km vertical resolution with global geographical and full diurnal coverage. We combine the observations from various RO missions processed by EUMETSAT ROM SAF facility - CHAMP, GRACE, COSMIC and Metop A/B - altogether covering 2002 - 2016 period. For intercomparison of AMSU and GPS-RO temperature trends the RO profiles ranging between the tropopause and 35 km were convoluted using AMSU weighting functions (channels 9 - 13). The altitude, latitude and seasonal patterns of temperature trends from AMSU and RO appear in good agreement, providing confidence in our estimates. Analysis of both AMSU and RO datasets reveals a remarkable inter-hemispheric asymmetry with larger cooling trend throughout the Southern hemisphere's mid-stratosphere and a quasi-null change at the Northern mid-latitudes. In contrast to that, the (sub-) tropical lower stratosphere is shown to be warming in SH during all seasons and cooling in NH from April through December. The trends in the polar regions, varying strongly with altitude, are characterized by large uncertainty due to strong dynamical variability of the polar vortices. In order to isolate the trend estimates from the effect of vortex variability, the trends are computed in the equivalent <b>latitude</b> <b>space.</b> In addition, we apply both linear and multiple regression analysis for quantifying the trends and discuss the resulting differences.
