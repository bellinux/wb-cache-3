25|$|Folger Pinnacle, located atop {{a shallow}} reef, has dense mats of sponges, ascidians and encrusting algae. There are {{numerous}} types of sessile (bottom attached) organisms including sponges, anemones, bryozoans, tunicates, and barnacles. Since {{this is a}} rockfish conservation area, {{there is a wide}} variety of rockfish (yellowtail, China, quillback, Puget Sound, black, and blue) in addition to many other fish (kelp greenling, <b>lingcod,</b> flatfish, wolfeels), molluscs (giant Pacific octopus, mussles, swimming scallops, and snails), and echinoderms (seastars, sea cucumbers, and urchins). An echosounder installed at Folger Deep shows evidence of a dense zooplankton community and schools of fish in the water column, while hydrophones regularly record the songs of whales and dolphins in the area.|$|E
500|$|Fish species {{found in}} the bay are: Chinook, chum, sockeye, pink and coho salmon, halibut, trout, steelhead, Dolly Varden, <b>lingcod,</b> whitefish, blackfish, char and herring. As for shellfish, there are Dungeness crabs, scallops, shrimp and clams. [...] Salmon are very {{important}} food of bears, particularly {{in the late summer}} and fall. In {{the southern part of the}} bay, there are streams which abound in salmon. They are also seen colonizing in the northern bay, consequent to the retreat of many glaciers and the streams emerging. These salmon food sources are expected to support more bear populations in the years ahead.|$|E
500|$|The {{size and}} {{structure}} of the prickly shark's mouth and pharynx suggests that it uses suction to capture prey. This species feeds on a variety of benthic and pelagic bony fishes, including hake, flounders, rockfishes, <b>lingcod,</b> topsmelt, mackerel, and herring, and on cartilaginous fishes, including elephantfishes (Callorhinchus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), young bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus), and ghost catshark (Apristurus) egg cases. Octopuses and squid, including the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) are also consumed. Young prickly sharks may themselves fall prey to the bluntnose sixgill shark, while adults likely face few threats. Reproduction in this species is aplacental viviparous, with the unborn young sustained by yolk. There is only one known record of a pregnant female, which was gestating 114 embryos; this ranks among the largest known litters from any shark. The young are probably under [...] long at birth. The length at sexual maturity has not been precisely determined but is thought to be around [...] for males and [...] for females.|$|E
500|$|Sport {{fishing on}} the Rogue River varies greatly {{depending}} on the location. In many places, fishing is good from stream banks and gravel bars, {{and much of the}} river is also fished from boats. Upstream of Lost Creek Lake, the main stem, sometimes called the North Fork, supports varieties of trout. Between Lost Creek Lake and Grants Pass there are major fisheries for spring and fall Chinook salmon, and Coho salmon from hatcheries, summer and winter steelhead, and large resident rainbow trout. The river between Grants Pass and Grave Creek has productive runs of summer and winter steelhead and Chinook, as well as good places to fish for trout. From Grave Creek to Foster Bar, all but the lower [...] of which is closed to jetboats, anglers fish for summer and winter steelhead, spring and fall Chinook, and Coho. Near Agness, the river produces large catches of immature steelhead known as [...] "half-pounders" [...] that return from the ocean to the river in August in large schools. The lower river has spring and fall Chinook, as well as perch, <b>lingcod,</b> and crab near the ocean.|$|E
2500|$|Mail-cheeked fishes {{belong to}} a group of about 30 species in the order Scorpaeniformes. Mail-cheeked fishes are named after a plate of bone that runs across each cheek. They are {{widespread}} in all the oceans of the world. Mail-cheeked fishes are carnivorous, mostly feeding on crustaceans, such as crabs and shrimp, and on smaller fish. Most species live on the sea bottom in relatively shallow waters, although species are known from mid and deep water, from the mid-water, and even from fresh water. They typically have spiny heads, and rounded pectoral and caudal fins. Most species are less than [...] in length, but the full size range of the order varies from the velvetfishes, which can be just [...] long as adults, to the <b>Lingcod,</b> which can reach [...] in length.|$|E
2500|$|Fishing (creek and river) {{was done}} {{near the village}} sites, and the fish were stored in large {{subsurface}} caches and is domestic and most common. The main economical fish (Tanacross łuug Upper Tanana łuugn, łuuk) species are mostly whitefish (humpback whitefish, round whitefish Tanacross xełtįį' [...] ) and Pacific salmon (king (chinook) Upper Tanana gath Tanacross łuug chox, red (sockeye) Upper Tanana łuugn delt'al Tanacross łuug delt'el). Other fish species are pike (Upper Tanana ch'ulju̱u̱dn Tanacross uljaaddh), grayling (Lower Tanana srajela Upper Tanana seejiil Tanacross seejel), <b>lingcod</b> (Upper Tanana and Tanacross ts'aan) and sucker (Upper Tanana taats'adn Tanacross tats'aht'ôl). Fishing at Mansfield Lake and Fish Creek for whitefish, pike, and grayling {{began in the late}} spring and continued until mid-July and was a major harvest activity; whitifish was an especially important and perennially reliable food source. All band members except the very young children assisted in harveting and processing the catch. The spring fish harvest provided a welcome dietary change after a long winter of eating mostly dried fish and meat. Fish not eaten fresh were processed and dried on drying racks for later consumption. Both fresh and dried fish were cooked in boiling water, produced by placing heated stones into a birch bark basket.|$|E
5000|$|The larvae are pelagic {{until late}} May or early June, when they settle {{to the bottom}} as juveniles. Initially they inhabit {{eelgrass}} beds, then move to flat, sandy areas that are not the typical habitat of older <b>lingcod.</b> They eventually settle in habitats of similar relief and substrate as older <b>lingcod,</b> but remain at shallower depths for several years.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lingcod</b> are {{endemic to}} the west coast of North America, with the center of {{abundance}} off the coast of British Columbia. They are found on the bottom, with most individuals occupying rocky areas at depths of 10 to 100 m (32 to 328 ft). Tagging studies have shown <b>lingcod</b> are a largely nonmigratory species, with colonization and recruitment occurring in localized areas only.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lingcod</b> are {{voracious}} predators, {{feeding on}} nearly {{anything they can}} fit in their mouths, including invertebrates and many species of fish, such as herring (Clupea pallasii), salmon, and Pacific hake (Merluccius productus). One of their favorite foods is smaller octopuses, and they also readily devour large rockfish. <b>Lingcod</b> that survive the larval stages have few predators themselves, and are vulnerable mainly to marine mammals, such as sea lions and harbor seals.|$|E
5000|$|A. harringtoni is a forager and predator. [...] It {{has been}} known to eat the eggs of the <b>Lingcod</b> (Ophiodon elongates).|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, Dr. Dick Beamish and Doris Chilton of the Pacific Biological Station {{published}} an article showing that cross sections of the fourth to eighth fin rays from the second dorsal fin provided a method for estimating the age of <b>lingcod.</b> This method has since been validated by a mark-recapture study in which <b>lingcod</b> received an injection of oxytetracycline. Other methods of aging, such as those using scales and otoliths, were found to underestimate ages for older fish.|$|E
50|$|Halibut were eaten frequently, as were herring and <b>lingcod.</b> Halibut {{were killed}} by spear or by club {{depending}} on size and weight, or caught with specialized halibut hooks.|$|E
50|$|Sturgeon lake {{offers a}} variety of recreations opportunities. A variety of fish are {{available}} consisting of Pickerel (Walleye), Jackfish (Northern Pike), Perch, Burbot (<b>Lingcod),</b> White suckers & White-fish.|$|E
50|$|Ophiodon ozymandias is an {{extinct species}} of <b>lingcod</b> from the Late Miocene of Southern California. Fossils suggest the living animal could have {{reached up to}} 6 feet in length.|$|E
50|$|In one exhibit, fish, {{such as the}} Red Snapper, Rock Fish, Cabezon, <b>Lingcod,</b> Greenlings, Sculpins, Perch and Halibut, swam {{through the}} kelp forest, as they were {{surrounded}} by different Sea stars, Anemones and Crabs.|$|E
50|$|Though not {{commonly}} commercially fished {{like the}} related <b>lingcod,</b> {{they are a}} popular gamefish. Most live among areas impossible to fish by commercial boats. They are commonly caught by sport fishers off exposed rocky shores.|$|E

50|$|Predators {{of adult}} Pacific ocean perch are likely sablefish, Pacific halibut, and sperm whales (Major and Shippen 1970). Juveniles are {{consumed}} by seabirds (Ainley et al. 1993), other rockfish (Hobson et al. 2001), salmon, <b>lingcod,</b> {{and other large}} demersal fish.|$|E
5000|$|Sund Rock is a {{designated}} conservation {{area on the}} U.S. state of Washington's Hood Canal. The area is known for abundant and diverse life, including {{but not limited to}} <b>Lingcod,</b> Giant Pacific Octopus, Wolf Eel, as well as nudibranch, anemone, and sea cucumber.|$|E
50|$|The program {{started in}} 2002 and was {{initially}} {{limited to the}} study of the movement and ocean-survival of both hatchery-raised and wild salmon in the Pacific Northwest. After the successful pilot period, the program has now moved into the tracking of trout, sharks, rockfish, and <b>lingcod.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Underwater Dome is {{an exhibit}} viewed from a mostly {{transparent}} spherical undersea {{room in a}} 400000 gal L tank.

The tank exhibits species that would be found in Puget Sound including salmon, <b>Lingcod,</b> sharks, sturgeon, skates, and rockfish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lingcod</b> or ling cod (Ophiodon elongatus), {{also known}} as the buffalo cod or cultus cod, is a fish of the greenling family Hexagrammidae. It is the only extant member of the genus Ophiodon. A {{slightly}} larger, extinct species, Ophiodon ozymandias, is known from fossils from the Late Miocene of Southern California.|$|E
50|$|Cabezon feed on crustaceans, mollusks, {{fish and}} fish eggs. Cabezon are {{taken as a}} game fish, however their roe is toxic to humans., because of the {{occurrence}} of a toxic phospholipid (Dinogunellin). Cabezon inhabit the tops of rocky ledges as opposed to rockfish and <b>lingcod,</b> which usually inhabit the sheer faces of these features.|$|E
50|$|The kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus) is {{a popular}} sport fish, and {{although}} it is not commercially valuable, it is considered a delicious food catch. The <b>lingcod</b> is long and olive-yellow in color, and has a very large, toothy mouth. The painted greenling (Oxylebius pictus) is smaller, brighter in color, and easily recognized by its large vertical red bands.|$|E
50|$|This {{rockfish}} is {{an important}} prey item for many other animals. The larva is consumed by siphonophores and chaetognaths. The juvenile is food for other fish, such as <b>lingcod,</b> cabezon, and salmon, {{as well as many}} birds, pinnipeds, and porpoises. The adult is prey for sharks, dolphins, and seals. Additionally, this species is taken in spearfishing and angling.|$|E
5000|$|The {{family of}} marine fishes Hexagrammidae {{incorporates}} the greenlings. These fish are {{found on the}} continental shelf in the temperate or subarctic waters of the North Pacific. They are a well-known family in the littoral zone from southern California north to the Aleutian Islands. The most commercially important species is the <b>lingcod</b> (Ophiodon elongatus), a common food fish.|$|E
50|$|The {{beach is}} home to many types of birds and marine life, {{including}} mussels, ocean worms, sea stars, sea anemones, barnacles, rock crabs, harbor seals, anglers, flounder, mackerel, halibut, <b>lingcod,</b> perch, cabezon, jacksmelt, steelhead, anchovy, bocaccio (tomcod), kingfish, dark seabirds, sea lions, dolphins, harbor seals, sea otters and whales. The Palo Alto serves as a main place for marine life.|$|E
50|$|Point Arena {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{upwelling}} zones along the West coast of the U.S., which means it is a source of nutrients for fish and wildlife. Kelp forests and rocky reefs shelter red abalone at Arena Rock and underwater caves host a highly diverse fish fauna that once included abundant populations of yelloweye and vermillion rockfish, <b>lingcod</b> and giant Pacific octopus.|$|E
50|$|They {{have been}} an {{important}} commercial species {{since at least the}} early 1880s, with fisheries off San Francisco, California and Washington state. They are caught in trawling and hook and line operations, along with a variety of other fish such as yellowtail, <b>lingcod,</b> and other rockfishes. The numbers have been declining in recent years, and canaries are classified as overfished.|$|E
5000|$|Hexagrammos decagrammus, the kelp greenling, is {{a species}} of greenling that occurs in rocky nearshore areas of the {{northern}} Pacific especially around British Columbia and Alaska, and is common on kelp beds and on sand bottoms. They feed on crustaceans, polychaete worms, brittle stars, mollusks, and small fishes. The young are food for large predators such as <b>lingcod</b> and halibut.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in October, <b>lingcod</b> {{migrate to}} nearshore {{spawning}} grounds. The males migrate first, and establish nest sites in strong current areas in rock crevices or on ledges. Spawning takes place between December and March, and females leave the nest site immediately after depositing eggs. Males actively defend the nest from predators until the eggs hatch in early March through late April.|$|E
50|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} that inhabit the water {{around the island}} include: king salmon, red salmon, silver salmon, pink salmon, chum salmon, halibut, <b>lingcod,</b> Pacific cod, a variety of rock fish, greenling, rat fish, dog sharks, dungeness crab, tanner crab, king crab, shrimp, prawns, scallops, abalone, clams, and jellyfish. There have also been reported sightings and catchings of great white sharks that have traveled up on warm currents.|$|E
50|$|The burbot (Lota lota) is {{the only}} gadiform (cod-like) {{freshwater}} fish. It {{is also known as}} bubbot, mariah, freshwater ling, the lawyer, coney-fish, <b>lingcod,</b> freshwater cusk, and eelpout. The species is closely related to the marine common ling and the cusk. It {{is the only}} member of the genus Lota. For some time of the year, the burbot lives under ice, and they require frigid temperatures to breed.|$|E
50|$|Most hexagrammids {{are small}} to {{moderate}} in size, averaging around 50 cm, although the <b>lingcod</b> {{can be much}} larger. Like many other scorpaeniform species, they have broad, spiny pectoral, dorsal, and anal fins. They are scavengers but also catch and eat small fish and bottom-dwelling animals such as crabs. They can be found off rocky shorelines, in kelp beds, and, especially during spawning, in shallow inlets and tidepools.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of fishing {{opportunities}} in the region from the Peace River itself and its tributaries to the numerous lakes in the area, some of which are stocked and naturally aerated to prevent winter kill. The Peace River, especially at the confluence with the Smoky River in the Peace River Wildland Provincial Park has various fish species including Arctic Grayling, Bull Trout, <b>Lingcod,</b> Northern Pike, Rainbow Trout and Walleye.|$|E
50|$|The Bodega Head area {{contains}} one of {{the most}} persistent and important upwelling plumes along the entire California coast and provides for significant down stream larval dispersal, resulting in an area of high abundance and natural diversity. The area provides important habitat for nearshore, shelf and deeper nearshore rockfishes such as <b>lingcod,</b> kelp greenling and cabezon, as well as a diversity of benthic invertebrates. Murres, auklets, guillemots and marine mammals also depend on the habitat and forage fishes found here.|$|E
