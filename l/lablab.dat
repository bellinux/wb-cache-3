50|$|Special {{concern for}} flatulence-producing {{substances}} is important when a pulse is promoted {{for human consumption}} (Smil, 1997). Revilleza et al. (1990) tested the content of known flatulence-producing oligosaccharides in common legumes from the Philippines and ranked them on their flatulence-producing potential: Sam-samping (Clitoria ternatea) > hyacinth bean (<b>Lablab</b> purpureus, syn. Dolichos <b>lablab</b> L) > Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) > swordbean (Canavalia gladiata) > ricebean > jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis). Two different varieties of ricebean contained 2.25 and 2.55% oligosaccharides. Kaur & Kawatra (2000) measured the effect of soaking, open pan cooking, pressure cooking, sprouting and combinations of these. All led to a significant reduction {{of the content of}} flatus-producing sugars, although the most effective was a combination of sprouting and pressure cooking.|$|E

50|$|Around the 5th-8th century, {{the coffee}} plant was {{introduced}} into the Arab world from Ethiopia. Coffea arabica, the most highly regarded species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia. Long before the cultivation of coffee, however, other food crops like finger millet, teff, sorghum, <b>lablab</b> bean and castor bean were domesticated and cultivated in Ethiopia.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the fruit}} {{of a wide range}} of plants such as: Combretum species (including C. zeyheri), Burkea species (including B. africana), Syzygium species (including S. cordatum), Gardenia species (including G. volkensii and G. neuberia), Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia, Acacia species (including A. stenocarpa), Dolichos, <b>Lablab,</b> Schotea, Macadamia, Coffea, Quisqualis, Schotia, Tamarindus, Vigna, Psidium, Prunus and Ximenia species.|$|E
5000|$|Green {{beans are}} the unripe, young fruit and {{protective}} pods of various cultivars {{of the common}} bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Immature or young pods of the runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus), yardlong bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis), and hyacinth bean (<b>Lablab</b> purpureus) are used in a similar way. Green beans are known by many common names, including French beans, string beans, snap beans, and snaps.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Canavalia galeata, Dolichos <b>lablab,</b> Erythrina monosperma, garden bean, Mucuna gigantea and Strongylodon lucidum.

Then they feed on the leaf {{substance}} leaving only the outer epidermis. The larvae are about 22 mm long and dark green.|$|E
5000|$|... as indicating: (i) an {{even earlier}} {{domestication}} in Africa, and (ii) an early migration of domestic sorghum, from East Africa into the Indian subcontinent. This interpretation got further support because several other African grain crops, namely: pearl millet Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br., cow pea Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp., and hyacinth bean <b>Lablab</b> purpureus (L.) Sweet show similar patterns. Their wild progenitors {{are restricted to}} Africa.|$|E
50|$|Megacopta cribraria, {{also called}} the bean plataspid, kudzu bug, kudzu beetle, {{globular}} stink bug and <b>lablab</b> bug, is a shield bug native to India and China, where it is an agricultural pest of <b>lablab</b> beans and other legumes. The bug, while harmless to houseplants and people, often enters houses. It is attracted to white surfaces such as the walls of houses or white vehicles, {{because of the high}} reflectance of the white surfaces {{as it relates to the}} bugs' simple eyes. As a defense mechanism, they emit a foul-smelling pheromone that also acts as a congregation pheromone. Aside from smelling foul, the liquid also creates a burning sensation and sometimes leaves a red welt on bare skin. It is similar to other Plataspididae in having a somewhat unusual symbiotic relationship with its gut bacteria. Before laying eggs, females deposit particles containing the symbiont, which are then eaten by newly hatched nymphs under natural conditions. Nymphs experimentally deprived of access to the symbiont exhibited slower growth, smaller body sizes and higher mortality.|$|E
