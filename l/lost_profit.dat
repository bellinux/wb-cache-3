If he had given notice, {{he would have been}} informed that we had changed our residence and that that gruff old bass-voiced sailorman, Dr. G., our family physician, was living in the house which we had formerly occupied and that Orion's former room in that house was now occupied by Dr. G.'s two middle-aged maiden sisters. Orion arrived at Hannibal per steamboat {{in the middle of the}} night, and started with his customary eagerness on his excursion, his mind all on fire with his romantic project and building and enjoying his surprise in advance. He was always enjoying things in advance; it was the make of him. He never could wait for the event, but must build it out of dream-stuff and enjoy it beforehand--consequently sometimes when the event happened he saw that it was not as good as the one he had invented in his imagination, and so he had <b>lost</b> <b>profit</b> by not keeping the imaginary one and letting the reality go.|$|E

The company reached its peak that year, but the late 1970s would {{mark the beginning of}} the end for the Howard Johnson's company.

50|$|The {{objective}} {{of the law of}} contracts with respect to damages is to put the aggrieved party in as good a position as the aggrieved party would have been in if the breaching party had fully performed. The ordinary measure of damages fails to put the lost volume seller in as good a position as the lost volume seller would have been had the breaching buyer fully performed. The lost volume seller would have had the profit from two sales if the first buyer had performed instead of the profit from only one sale {{as a result of the}} first buyer’s breach. In such a case, certain law (including Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States) permits the aggrieved seller to recover the <b>lost</b> <b>profit</b> that the seller would have made had the buyer not breached (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).|$|E

50|$|Contracts {{for the new}} U.S. Grant Bridge {{were given}} {{in the spring of}} 2001. Construction was {{expected}} to be complete in June 2004, but work fell behind schedule due to inclement weather, unusual flooding of the Ohio River, and the partial sinking of a floating construction barge which carried one of the cranes used to work on the center span of the bridge. The date of completion was moved to October 16, 2006.In addition, many downtown business owners were upset over the delays and often criticized the construction company, C.J. Mahan Construction Company, for delays on days when it was sunny and the river levels were average. It {{should be noted that the}} bridge was critically underdesigned and not constructible until C.J. Mahan stopped construction and awaited a near complete redesign by the design consultant. Another complaint was that this is the first major bridge project the construction company that was awarded the construction contract has worked on. However, C.J.

50|$|The range has {{its origins}} in 1936 when Geoffrey Malins started to make engines for Hobbies of Dereham. His engines were loosely based on the Bowman engines that Geoffrey Bowman Jenkins had made for Hobbies until 1935. The main {{difference}} between the Bowman and the Malins was that the latter were smaller, only came on metal bases and all except the SE1 had the chimney attached {{to the top of}} the boiler, known as a locomotive style chimney. From 1937 Malins decided to make his own range of engines as well as those he was producing for Hobbies. With the exception of a few small detail changes - such as lighter shade of paints and a Mamod badge - they were almost identical to the Hobbies range. The difference between Mamod and Hobbies became somewhat blurred; a Mamod badged SE4 could be found in the 'Hobbies colours'. This was the very beginnings of a philosophy which meant that the engines had to be sold and out the door. Unsold engines meant <b>lost</b> <b>profit</b> and nothing was wasted. Any differences between the two ranges had all but disappeared by 1940.|$|E
50|$|The 3DO console {{launched}} in October 1993 {{at the price}} of $699. Poor console and game sales trumped the enticingly low royalty rate and proved a fatal flaw. While 3DO's business model attracted game publishers with its low royalty rates, it resulted in the console selling for a price higher than the SNES and Sega Genesis combined, hampering sales. While companies that manufactured and sold their own consoles could sell them, at a loss, for a competitive price, making up for <b>lost</b> <b>profit</b> through royalties collected from game publishers, the 3DO's manufacturers, not collecting any money from game publishers, and owing royalties to the 3DO Company, had to sell the console for a profit, resulting in high prices. As the console failed to compete with its cheaper competitors, game developers and publishers, while initially attracted by low royalties, dropped support for the console as its games failed to sell. Stock in the 3DO Company dropped from over $37 per share in November 1993 to $23 per share in late December. Though the company's financial figures dramatically improved in the fiscal year ending March 1995, with revenues nearly triple that of the previous fiscal year, they were still operating at a loss. The console's prospects continued to improve through the first half of 1995 with a number of critical success, including winning the 1995 European Computer Trade Show award for best hardware. In January 1996, The 3DO Company sold exclusive rights to its next generation console, M2, to Matsushita for $100 million. Thanks in part to revenues from the sale of M2 technology to Matsushita and other licensees, {{in the first quarter of}} 1996 the 3DO Company turned a profit for the first time since it was founded, with a net income of $1.2 million. In early 1996, the company changed its business to develop and publish games for other game consoles and PC.|$|E

However, I point out that the concept of "reasonable" royalty rates lacks logical consistency when intellectual property rights are probabilistic.

40|$|At a {{cross docking}} terminal, inbound {{shipments}} are directly transshipped across the terminal to designated outbound trucks, so that delays and inventories are kept {{as low as}} possible. We consider an operational truck scheduling problem, where a dock door and a start time has to be assigned to each inbound truck. A set of outbound trucks is scheduled beforehand and, therefore, departure times are fixed. If a shipment is not unloaded, transshipped to the outbound gate and loaded onto the designated outbound truck before its departure we consider the shipments's value as <b>lost</b> <b>profit.</b> The objective is to minimize total <b>lost</b> <b>profit.</b> The paper at hand formalizes the resulting truck scheduling problem.
