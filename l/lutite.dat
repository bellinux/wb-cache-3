The center is raised approximately 5mm above the low points. Each horizontal section consists of 3 equidistant rows of tiny holes (approximately 1mm in diameter) that connect at 120° angles. Each of these horizontal sections are connected by vertical shafts (approximately 2-3mm in diameter).When actively being inhabited, the surface of the burrow is made of red metalliferous sediment. When it becomes inactive, this becomes covered with a light gray <b>Lutite</b> and the top flattens out. The red sediment is only found under the surface sediment in this environment, so its presence at the surface hints at a biotic factor which brings up the sediment.The number of rows and the spacing of these rows increases in correlation with the size of the overall form. This indicates that these burrows are a result of organic growth.The raised parts of the burrow force water to flow through the burrow. As a result of this, scientists found large numbers of foraminifera tests within the burrows. These were trapped in certain areas suggesting that the burrows were engineered to catch food as prey.

MSc thesis (unpublished), University of Johannesburg, Aucklandpark, pp. 133. The Early Paleoproterozoic Koegas Subgroup comprises {{a succession}} of siltstone, mudstone, iron-­‐formation, chert and carbonate rocks that overlies the iron-­‐formations of the Asbestos Hills Subgroup with sharp contact. It is overlain with erosional unconformable contact by glaciogenic diamictites of the Makaganyene Formation. This study focused on the lithostratigraphy, mineralogy and geochemistry of the iron-­‐ formations of the Koegas Subgroup based on fresh diamond drill core samples obtained during the Agouron scientific drilling project in South Africa in 2004. The iron formations the Koegas Subgroup are represented by a few important lithotypes, occurring in distinct sedimentary facies, which formed in unique depositional and diagenetic environments. The iron formations consist essentially of four facies, namely silicate <b>lutite,</b> mixed silicate-­‐siderite <b>lutite,</b> siderite <b>lutite</b> and siderite peloidstone A repetitive sedimentary cycle consisting of fine-­‐grained chemical lithotypes grading upward into reworked chemical lithotypes is evident throughout the Koegas Subgroup iron formations. Silicate <b>lutite</b> formed in deep water settings well below the wave base along a chemocline. Siderite <b>lutite</b> formed in shallower parts of the basin through transformation of primary ferric iron precipitate by iron respiration in presence of organic carbon. Peloidstone formed above normal wave base in shallow water by reworking of earlier siderite <b>lutite</b> deposits. The REE geochemistry provides important clues as to the depositional environment of the iron formation as follows. Depletion in LREE and enrichment in HREE combined with positive Y are typical of ocean water indicate that the iron formations were deposited in a marine environment. Positive Eu anomaly suggest {{the presence of a}} hydrothermal component in the ocean water from which the iron formations were deposited. Negative Ce anomalies indicate that somewhere in the marine system Ce 3 + was oxidized to Ce 4 + oxide, probably in the presence of free oxygen in the ocean water column (Bau and Dulski, 1996).

Additionally, a continuous coring drill was performed in order to support the study. Electrical imaging has been successfully applied to identify the gypsum deposits interlayered in <b>lutite</b> units. Nevertheless, the gypsum-lutite boundaries are diffuse and uncertain in the tomographic lines. Comparison of the cores of the borehole and the electrical response shows a meaningful correlation between electrical resistivity and purity of gypsum. The electrical resistivity tomography profiles display a rather wide range of electrical resistivity value (from 20 - 1000 Ωm) for the investigated gypsum facies. The highest values are attributed to sulphate layers with > 90 % of gypsum mineral. <b>Lutite</b> units display higher values than expected due to the presence of evaporite minerals within them (> 10 Ωm). Additionally, induced polarization measures have been performed in order to study the chargeability of gypsum deposits.

40|$|Badlands are {{pervasive}} {{in a wide}} range of environmental conditions across the Mediterranean region, including arid, semiarid, and humid environments. On montane (cold subhumid and humid) Mediterranean landscapes, harsh thermal conditions on north-facing hillslopes favour intense bedrock weathering by freezing and impose serious constraints on plant colonization. The above are the customary arguments to explain the high abundance of montane badlands on north-exposed shady aspects. We studied the distribution and morphological diversity of badlands in the upper Llobregat basin (Catalan Pyrenees, NE Spain), using remote sensing information (high-resolution orthophotos and complementary Landsat 8 imagery), digital elevation data, and regional information on lithology. Badlands extend over about 200 ha in the upper Llobregat basin and occur on two different parent materials, swelling (smectite-rich) continental Garumnian <b>lutites</b> of late Cretaceous age, and nonswelling (illitic) marine Eocene marls. Vegetation, assessed by remote-sensed vegetation greenness, is less developed on north-facing badland slopes. However, badland slope-aspect distribution varies considerably with lithology. While badlands on Eocene marls show preferential distribution on north-facing shady slopes, badland occurrence on Garumnian <b>lutites</b> does not reveal clear slope-aspect anisotropy patterns. Lithology also affects slope gradient, with badlands on Eocene marls showing rougher topography (30 – 40 ° average slope angle) than on Garumnian <b>lutites</b> (20 – 30 °). Badland morphological differences induced by lithology are discussed in terms of the greater weathering susceptibility and slope instability of the swelling, smectite-rich Garumnian <b>lutites</b> than of the nonswelling Eocene marls. Elevation, which broadly controls annual precipitation and winter air temperature within the region, shows no clear influence on badland distribution. Overall, our results reveal lithology as the main factor controlling badland distribution and morphological diversity under the montane Mediterranean conditions of the upper Llobregat basin. © 2016 Elsevier B.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{continental}} margin off southern Oregon, {{which includes the}} shelf and slope from Cape Blanco to the Oregon-California border, exhibits a distinctive marginal-plateau structural pattern which divides the margin into the continental shelf, the upper continental slope and its associated benches, and the lower continental slope. Lutum transport and deposition have dominated the sedimentary processes on the margin {{since the start of}} Holocene time. The structure of the southern Oregon margin is characterized by north-south trending compressional folds, and near-vertical faults which have been down-dropped to the west. Large-scale folds on the upper slope have ponded sediments behind them resulting {{in the formation of the}} Klamath Plateau, Cape Blanco Bench, and other bench-like features. Development of the structural pattern is most likely a result of the compressive underthrusting of the oceanic lithospheric plate beneath the southernmost Oregon-northern California margin and the crustal extension which exists throughout the nearby continent and ocean basin. Useful stratigraphic horizons within the late Pleistocene and Holocene margin deposits include Mazama Ash (6600 years B. P.) and several recognizable shifts in the abundance of Radiolaria and planktonic Foraminifera, particularly one dating from 5000 - 4000 years B. P. Holocene sedimentation rates vary from an average of 10 cm/ 1000 years on the upper slope to an average of 50 cm/ 1000 years on the lower slope, indicating that the lower slope is out-building and up-building more rapidly than the upper slope. The paleo-depth range of Pliocene fauna in sedimentary rocks from the margin suggests that subsequent to their deposition both uplift and subsidence occurred on the southern Oregon margin. Sediments from the southern Oregon margin consist primarily of olive gray <b>lutite,</b> gray <b>lutite,</b> and sand-silt layers. Olive gray <b>lutite</b> is Holocene in age and is ubiquitous on the margin, with the thickest accumulation (10 m average) found on the lower slope, while the distribution of Holocene <b>lutite</b> on the upper slope is thin and patchy (3 - 4 m or less). The gray <b>lutite</b> appears to be a late Pleistocene deposit, and the sand-silt layers reflect both ages. The surface sediment distribution pattern on the shelf consists of modern inner shelf sand, modern central shelf mud, and mixed deposits of both types. Relict deposits are present at the shelf edge. The lower slope consists entirely of modern mud, but the surface sediment on the upper slope and benches consists of both modern and relict deposits, and mixtures of the two. The mineralogy of the unconsolidated and consolidated sediments from the margin indicates that the Klamath Mountains have been the dominant source for these deposits since early Tertiary time. This is reflected in the abundance of blue-green hornblende and other heavy minerals indicative of the Mesozoic rocks of the Klamath Mountains; the same source is suggested for the abundant chlorite found in the clay fraction of margin sediments and rocks. There are indications in the mineralogy of lower slope sediments which suggest that the Tertiary strata of the southern Oregon Coast Ranges may be a secondary source for the deposits in this environment. When compared to the upper slope sediments, those from the lower slope have a higher feldspar content, a higher pyroxene-to-amphibole ratio, and an apparently higher illite content. As a result of the Holocene rise in sea level, the deposition of coarse clastics on the southern Oregon margin has been restricted to the inner shelf. Consequently, only the fine-grained lutum discharged from rivers is deposited on the outer margin environments. Submarine topography, oceanographic conditions, and gravity are important factors which effect transport and deposition of lutum on the margin. A model of modern lutum transport by bottom turbid layers and fine-particle suspensate is proposed for the southern Oregon margin. Long-period swell is believed to be responsible for much of the formation of bottom turbid layers on the shelf. Once formed, these turbid layers move north and west over the shelf under the influence of shelf currents, alternating tidal action, and gravity; upon reaching the slope they are funneled into submarine valleys and deposited on the lower slope and adjacent deep sea. Lutum deposited on the upper slope is eventually re-suspended and transported by southerly bottom currents into down-slope valleys; very little lutum remains behind on the upper slope. Deposition of the fine-particle suspensate as well as slumping and other gravitational processes contribute to the lower slope sediments. The end result of modern lutum transport is the continual up-building and out-building of the lower slope...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. It is {{the focus}} of the study to qualitatively {{describe}} and then quantify the mineralogical and geochemical changes associated with the supergene alteration of carbonate-rich braunite <b>lutite</b> (Mamatwan-type ore) immediately below the Kalahari unconformity along the southeastern suboutcrop perimeter of the Hotazel Formation in the Kalahari deposit. It was also the objective of this study to determine the timing and duration of supergene alteration. Samples for polished thin sections were carefully selected from eight representative boreholes to be representative of all the lithostratigraphic zones and ore types. The thin sections were used to study mineralogy by means of reflected light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. X-ray powder diffractometry on representative powder samples were used to study the mineralogy and geochemistry of the samples. Microprobe analyses were also performed on the representative samples. Finally the samples were submitted for 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology. In this supergene enrichment zone carbonates are leached (associated with an increase in porosity) and Mn 2 +/Mn 3 + -bearing minerals (kutnahorite, Mn-calcite an braunite) are altered to supergene Mn 4 +-bearing mineral phases (todorokite and manganomelane) and minor quartz. This process upgrades ore from 38 wt% Mn to ore with more than 40 wt% Mn. Element fluxes, enrichment and depletion of major and trace elements were quantified by mass balance calculations. Na 2 O, K 2 O, Sr, Ba, Zn and H 2 O were enriched, while Mn 3 O 4, Fe 2 O 3, CaO, MgO, P, B and CO 2 were leached from the ore during supergene alteration. Results {{of this study suggest that}} the development of Post African I erosional surface may have taken place 45 Ma ago. The bottom of the weathering profile gives a well-defined peak at ca. 5 Ma that may possible coincide with the development of Post African II erosional surface. The major characteristics of the alteration process of the unaltered Mamatwan-type ore to supergene altered braunite <b>lutite</b> can be summarized as follow: • Leaching of Mn carbonates and Mn 2 +/Mn 3 +-oxides. • Formation of Mn 4 +-oxyhydroxides and quartz. • Decrease in relative density of the ore. • Increase in porosity of the ore. • Leaching of Mn 3 O 4, Fe 2 O 3, CaO, MgO, P, B, CO 2. • Enrichment of Na 2 O, K 2 O, Sr, Ba, Zn, H 2 O. Chemical weathering processes along the Cenozoic Kalahari unconformity appear to have affected the manganiferous lithologies of the Hotazel Formation from 45 Ma onwards to 5 Ma.

It have been differentiated five continental formations of the Quaternary and twelve neogenes formations dated from the upper Burdigalian to the Pliocene. They were originated in marine environments with entrance of continental contributions except for the upper Messinian-PUocene which have a fluvial-lacustrine origin. The most abundant material are marls, sandstones, <b>lutites,</b> gypsiferous levels, conglomerates, sands and limestone...|$|R
40|$|Samples {{of three}} piston cores and one gravity core from the Nova Scotia {{continental}} rise (depths 4210 - 4925 m) {{have been examined}} to differentiate parallel-to-slope and downslope depositional processes in Quaternary deposits from a region presently influenced by a strong contour current. Measurement of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility of samples of a red-brown, silt-laminated <b>lutite</b> 'contourite' facies shows grain alignments which are consistent with both parallel-to-slope (contour current) flow and downslope (turbidity current) flow. We believe that these results provide support for the hypothesis that 'geologically significant' contour currents have influenced continental rise deposition during the Pleistocene. However, our observation that both alongslope and downslope alignments are present in lithologically similar units clearly demonstrates the need for studies {{on the relationship between}} lithofacies and process in this geological setting...|$|E
40|$|A new amber outcrop {{has been}} found {{recently}} in a bed of <b>lutite</b> within the Escucha Formation {{near the village of}} Utrillas (Teruel Province), Spain. This new fossil site, which has been named San Just, contains an exceptional quantity of amber remains associated with fossilized wood and leaves of probable araucarian origin, and is dated as EarlyeMiddle Albian (Early Cretaceous). The amber is physically and chemically similar to other Spanish Early Cretaceous ambers. Values of IRTF are also similar to other Early Cretaceous ambers, except for curve values of 800 e 400 cm 1 (in which bands are not visible) and the absence of exocyclic methylenic bands at 880 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1. The latter is also a feature of Alava amber (Pe~nacerrada I and II exposures), and suggests a high degree of maturation. The San Just outcrop is the second in Teruel Province in which biological inclusions (mainly insects and chelicerates) have been found in amber. Insects are represented by hyme...|$|E
40|$|The Cerro de los Batallones (Los Batallones Butte) {{is located}} in the central-northern area of the Madrid Basin, central Spain. Six {{vertebrate}} localities containing a large variety of mammals together with amphibians, fishes and plant remains of Upper Vallesian Age (Late Miocene) have been found associated with the sediments forming the butte. From bottom to top, these sediments consist of magnesian <b>lutite</b> beds (Unit I), palaeosols formed of sepiolite and opal (Unit II), and siliclclastic, marlstone and carbonate beds (Unit III). Both the patch-like geometry and the composition of the deposits bearing the Upper Vallesian fauna indicate that their accumulation took place in cavities which acted as traps for both carnivores and herbivores. Although there is not conclusive evidence for the precise mechanism of formation of the holes, a combined effect of vertisol development followed by subsurface erosion processes ("pseudokarst") can be suggested as most reliable. Moreover, formation of the vertebrate localities of Cerro de los Batallones could provide some clues on the geological evolution of the Madrid Basin during the Upper Miocen...|$|E
40|$|The Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Cameros Basin {{comprises}} {{an expanded}} Tithonian to Early Albian stratigraphic record, mainly {{made up of}} fluvial and lacustrine systems, but also containing minor marine incursions. This basin is renowned because of preserving numerous ichnites sites, being the Berriasian Oncala Group one of the units that includes more of them. A sedimentological study of the deposits at the Serrantes site demonstrates that the ichnites are clearly associated with tidally-influenced fluvial-deltaic meandering channel and overbank deposits. The facies appearing in this outcrop are: 1) channelized beds, 2) <b>lutites,</b> 3) tabular sandstone beds, 4) black limestones, 5) laminated limestones with gypsum pseudomorphs. The ichnites are clearly associated to the siliciclastic deposits, especially to the lutitic facies, and are absent in the carbonate-evaporitic deposit...|$|R
40|$|Facies and {{thickness}} {{distribution in}} the Cortes de Tajuña Fm. was controlled by extensional fault activity around the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in the Iberian basin. The analysis of the outcrops located South of Oliete (Teruel) allows the mapping of a East-West trending normal fault (inverted as a thrust during Alpine compression), which involved {{the presence of a}} thick carbonatic aand evaporitic succession (up to 300 m) in the hanging wall. Thickness in the foot wall is reduced to a third. Two facies associations are found in {{the lower part of the}} unit. Relatively deep facies (intertidal to shallow subtidal) laterally grade into evaporites and <b>lutites</b> (supratidal sabkhas) in the areas were subsidence was lower. In the upper part are found massive dolomites and well-bedded limestones all across the study are...|$|R
40|$|In the Vic area, the non-marine Palaeogene clastic {{materials}} {{are arranged in}} two successive lithostratigraphic formations: the lower, Vilanova de Sau (VS) mainly composed of <b>lutites</b> and some channels of sandstones, and the upper, Romagats (RO) mainly consisting of conglomeratic sandstones with few lutitic intercalations. The VS is interpreted as distal and lateral alluvial fan facies, whereas the RO is regarded as alluvial fan proximal facies. The clay mineral analysis, {{the study of the}} main palaeocurrents and the different clast lithologies distribution along the studied stratigraphic logs suggest that the source area was located to the east of the present outcrops. In addition, the geochemical analysis of the fine-grained materials provide more evidence that the main source area was placed eastwards, at the area at present occupied by the Mediterranean sea and relatively near the coas...|$|R
