5|$|By 1816, the Shelleys {{were living}} in Italy and in 1818 and 1819, two of their young {{children}} died, Clara and William. Mary entered into a deep depression and became alienated from Percy, who was not as deeply affected by the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children. Mary Shelley revived a bit {{with the birth of}} Percy Florence later in 1819.|$|E

5000|$|Gene {{knockout}} {{experiments were}} conducted to identify the neuronal populations in both the PNS and CNS that were affected by the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> different neurotrophins during development {{and the extent to}} which these populations were affected. [...] These knockout experiments resulted in the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> several neuron populations including the retina, cholinergic brainstem and the spinal cord. It was found that NGF-knockout mice had <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> a majority <b>of</b> <b>their</b> dorsal root ganglia (DRG), trigeminal ganglia and superior cervical ganglia. The [...] of these mice was poor. The BDNF-knockout mice had <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> a majority <b>of</b> <b>their</b> vestibular ganglia and moderate <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> DRG, trigeminal ganglia, nodose petrosal ganglia and cochlear ganglia. In addition they also had minor <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> facial motoneurons located in the CNS. The viability of these mice was moderate. The NT-4-knockout mice had moderate <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nodose petrosal ganglia and minor <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> DRG, trigeminal ganglia and vestibular ganglia. The NT-4-knockout mice also had minor <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> facial motoneurons. These mice were very viable. The NT-3 knockout mice had <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> a majority <b>of</b> <b>their</b> DRG, trigeminal ganglia, cochlear ganglia and superior cervival ganglia and moderate <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> nodose petrosal ganglia and vestibular ganglia. In addition the NT-3-knockout mice had moderate <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> spinal moroneurons. These mice had very poor viability. These results show that the absence of different neurotrophins result in <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> different neuron populations (mainly in the PNS). Furthermore, the absence of the neurotrophin survival signal leads to apoptosis.|$|R

5|$|Original Base Realignment and Closure {{commission}} plans only {{hinted at}} a Distributed Common Ground System being created at Otis. These plans {{did not include}} the air guardsmen affected by the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> jobs. The issue was resolved when the Air Force announced its plans, right before the F-15s started to leave for Barnes.|$|E
5|$|Species {{that have}} no long-distance migratory relatives, such as the {{waxwings}} Bombycilla, are effectively moving in response to winter weather and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> usual winter food, rather than enhanced breeding opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The Polish victory infuriated the Soviets, {{leading to}} dozens of arrests and several executions among those {{connected}} to the Lit-Bel.; the former Lit-Bel leaders began accusing one another of culpability for the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> capital. Lenin considered the city vital to his plans, and ordered its immediate recapture, with the Red Army attempting several counteroffensives in April 1919.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> land, local {{residents}} {{discovered that they}} had been disenfranchised. Now a part of the ACT, they had lost their vote in the New South Wales government, and their numbers were too small to warrant a seat in the new federal parliament. As a result, they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against the provisions of the legislation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{own rules}} Sheffield {{remained}} {{the centre of}} the footballing world until the onset of professionalism. The association matches versus London were considered only equalled in importance to the England v Scotland international and FA Cup Final. Sheffield born Charles Clegg became chairman of the Football Association in 1890 leading it until his death in 1937. In the process he became the longest serving FA chairman and earned the nickname The Napoleon of Football.|$|E
50|$|The federalist troops, {{on their}} side were {{severely}} affected by the unitarian bombardment, and after the capture <b>of</b> <b>their</b> artillery and heavy <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> men, they simply ran. The unitarian cavalry slaughtered the running enemy causing miore than 100 dead in a few minutes. In {{a little more than}} a half-hour of combat, Bustos ordered a retreat of his remaining forces.|$|R
50|$|In 1633, an {{epidemic}} devastated {{all of the}} region's Native population. Historians estimate that the Pequot suffered the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 80% <b>of</b> <b>their</b> population. At {{the outbreak of the}} Pequot War, Pequot survivors may have numbered only about 3,000.|$|R
50|$|In {{the lead}} up to the match up, both the Aggies and Spiders were dealing with depth issues. Both teams {{suffered}} <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> starting quarterbacks, with A&T losing Sophomore Lamar Raynard and Richmond losing Junior Kyle Lauletta. The Aggies started 3rd string Quarterback Oluwafemi Bamiro, while the Spiders tapped sophomore Kevin Johnson to make his season debut.|$|R
5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties meant the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> outpost line in the South Eastern Area. Imperial Headquarters now ordered the {{preparation}} of a new line in Western New Guinea. The Admiralties operation also indicated the Allies were becoming more ambitious and might bypass Hansa Bay. Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|E
5|$|Historians have divided {{views on}} Stefansson's {{decision}} to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, his {{grandmother}} Louisa Drew's business began to suffer, and she {{lost control of}} her theater, causing disruption in the family. The following year, when Barrymore was 11 years old, his mother died from tuberculosis; her consistent touring and his absence at school meant that he barely knew her, and he was mostly raised by {{his grandmother}}. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mother's income prompted both Ethel and Lionel to seek work as professional actors. Barrymore's father was mostly absent from the family home while on tour, and when he returned he would spend time at The Lambs, a New York actors' club.|$|E
50|$|The waning of {{the arcade}} game industry, coupled with some poor sales and public enthusiasm from several key titles {{led to the}} {{eventual}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> licenses.

However, my results show that in the midinfrared 3 - 6 µm region, the <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> tellurite glass should be 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than what the authors claimed...|$|R
25|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, {{along with some}} Bon scholars, cooperated the Rimé {{movement}} to prevent the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> teachings and revive their traditions, {{in response to the}} dominance of the Gelugpa school.|$|R
5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had served}} almost {{three and a}} half years of McKinley's term. On the night of his own {{election}} in 1904, Roosevelt publicly declared he would not run for re-election in 1908, a pledge he quickly regretted. But he felt bound by his word. Roosevelt believed Taft was his logical successor, although the War Secretary was initially reluctant to run. Roosevelt used his control of the party machinery to aid his heir apparent. On pain of <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> jobs, political appointees were required to support Taft or remain silent.|$|E
5|$|The Menominee sued in the U.S. Court of Claims {{to recover}} {{compensation}} for the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hunting and fishing rights. The Court of Claims first clarified that the Menominee Termination Act did not abolish the tribe or its membership, but merely ended federal supervision of the tribe. Since the Menominee was still a tribe, although not one under federal trusteeship, the tribe {{had a right to}} assert a claim arising out of the Wolf River Treaty in accordance with the Indian Claims Commission Act and the Tucker Act.|$|E
50|$|At first, UN jet fighters, {{which also}} {{included}} Royal Australian Air Force Gloster Meteors, had some success, but straight winged jets were soon outclassed in daylight by the superior {{speed of the}} MiGs. At night, however, radar-equipped Marine Corps Douglas F3D Skynight night fighters claimed five MiG kills with no <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own, and no B-29s under their escort were lost to enemy fighters.|$|R
50|$|But, a {{smallpox}} {{epidemic in}} 1633 devastated {{the entirety of}} the region's Native population. Historians estimate that the Pequot suffered the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 80% <b>of</b> <b>their</b> entire population. By the outbreak of the Pequot War in 1637, their numbers may have been reduced to about 3,000 in total.|$|R
60|$|The trapper {{found him}} distributing knives to the ferocious hags, who {{received}} the presents chanting a low monotonous song, that recalled the <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> people, in various conflicts with the whites, and which extolled the pleasures and glory of revenge. The appearance of such a group was enough of itself to have deterred one, less accustomed to such sights than the old man, from trusting himself within the circle <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wild and repulsive rites.|$|R
5|$|The Raid on Genoa {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought in}} the harbour of the Italian city of Genoa {{during the first year}} of the French Revolutionary Wars. French Republican forces in the Mediterranean, under pressure from Austrian and Spanish armies, Royalist uprisings and British blockade had suffered the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> principal naval base and the fleet stationed there when British forces under Lord Hood seized Toulon at the invitation of the city's Royalist faction. The survivors of the French fleet were scattered across the Mediterranean, several sheltering in neutral Italian harbours, including the frigates Modeste at Genoa and Impérieuse at Leghorn.|$|E
5|$|The {{family lived}} in Norman until Warren was 11, when they moved to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, a {{salesman}} at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack—which led to many medical bills, {{as well as a}} pay cut because he could not do his previous work. Eventually, this led to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> car from failure to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The group {{continued}} their Casbah residency {{into the new}} year, occasionally securing other gigs. In January, Brown grew ill {{and was unable to}} play the show. Best, however, insisted that the Quarrymen still pay Brown, but Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison refused; the incident resulted in the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> residency at the Casbah and Brown's departure from the group. Shortly after, however, Lennon convinced fellow art school student Stuart Sutcliffe to purchase a bass guitar and join the group. The group had no bookings, but began rehearsing vigorously to allow the musical novice Sutcliffe practice on his new instrument.|$|E
50|$|Adelaide Olympic were relegated {{at the end}} of the 2006 season due to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> key {{experienced}} {{players and}} an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the board.
