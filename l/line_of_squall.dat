40|$|This {{study is}} an {{expansion}} of Gallus et al. (2008) (hereafter, G 08), in which all convective systems that occurred within a ten-state region that covers parts of the Midwest and great plains between 1 Apr 2002 and 31 Aug 2002 were classified according to their dominant morphology. Severe weather produced by each system was associated with each morphology. Archived radar imagery was used to classify systems, which had to meet specific criteria to be classified. This study uses data in the same region as in G 08, but the time period is 1 Apr 2007 to 19 Jul 2007. The same nine morphologies {{that were used in}} G 08 are used in this study, which includes non-linear convective events, isolated cells, clusters <b>of</b> cells, broken <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> cells, <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> with no stratiform precipitation, trailing stratiform precipitation, parallel stratiform precipitation, and leading stratiform precipitation, and bow echoes. Cellular systems that contained supercells were added as morphologies to incorporate the effects that supercells have on the type of severe weather produced. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the trends exhibited by the systems in G 08 also are exhibited by the systems in this study to an extent. It is also confirmed that supercellular systems produce severe weather more frequently, and also produce more intense severe weather. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a {{sequence}} of numerical weather prediction efforts utilizing the special observations from the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE). These observations, along with those available from the World Weather Watch, provide a unique opportunity to carry out numerical weather prediction (NWP) studies over portions of West Africa and the eastern Atlantic ocean utilizing high resolution limited area models. The present study reports on the results of 34 short-range numerical weather prediction experiments, with two simple models, designed to study the westward propagation of African waves. In the time frame of 24 to 48 hours, predictions at 700 mb (the level of maximum amplitude of these waves, and the level of non-divergence) show extremely promising results. These results are comparable to fine-mesh predictions in higher latitudes. Errors in phase speed and vector root mean square (RMS) wind errors are summarized for the third phase of GATE. A second part of this study deals with the problem of specification of the West African squall line with respect to the position of the predicted trough <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the African wave. A body of recent literature provides useful obser-vational statistics relating the position of African waves, certain geographical regions, the time of day and the formation <b>of</b> <b>line</b> <b>squall</b> systems. These studies also provide information on the relative speeds of westward motion <b>of</b> the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> and the wave trough. The decay <b>of</b> the <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> during their westward propagation away from the trough is also 8 part of these observational statistics. Based on these observations, an empirical set of selection rules may be defined to specify the squall lines with respect to the predicted motion field. Successful results were obtained in the time frame of 24 to 48 hours for these experiments, the results of which are summarized below. 1...|$|R

The very short-range forecasting (2 to 6 hr) capabilities of synthesizing GOES imagery with diagnostic frontogenesis analyses of conventional surface data to predict the precise location and time of formation of such convective activity is demonstrated.

40|$|Two surface {{pressure}} features that commonly accompany squall lines, the mesohigh and the wake low, {{may be explained}} {{at least in part}} as a linear response to the low-level cooling associated with stratiform precipitation. This response is numerically simulated for two- and three-dimensional, moving and stationary low-level coolings characteristic <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> stratiform regions. When the cooling is defined to move and to have three-dimensional structure both a mesohigh and a mesolow develop, and their structures and evolutions resemble those <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> mesohighs and wake lows. When an upper boundary is introduced directly above the cooling the response approaches a steady state in which a mesohigh–mesolow couplet is centered on the cooling. The simulations and the steady-state analysis presented here help to explain observed characteristics <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> mesohighs and wake lows, including their life cycles and positioning relative to precipitation structures. 1...|$|R

40|$|This study compares {{severe weather}} reports {{associated}} with the nine convective system morphologies used {{in a recent study}} by Gallus et al. to an additional morphology, supercell storms. As in that previous study, all convective systems occurring in a 10 -state region covering parts of the Midwestern United States and central plains were classified according to their dominant morphology, and severe weather reports associated with each morphology were then analyzed. Unlike the previous study, which examined systems from 2002, the time period over which the climatology was performed was shifted to 2007 to allow access to radar algorithm information needed to classify a storm as a supercell. Archived radar imagery was used to classify systems as nonlinear convective events, isolated cells, clusters <b>of</b> cells, broken <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> cells, <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> with no stratiform precipitation, trailing stratiform precipitation, parallel stratiform precipitation, and leading stratiform precipitation, and bow echoes. In addition, the three cellular classifications were subdivided to allow an analysis of severe weather reports for events in which supercells were present and those in which they were not. As in the earlier study, all morphologies were found to pose some risk of severe weather, and differences in the two datasets were generally small. The 2007 climatology confirmed the theory that supercellular systems produce severe weather more frequently than other morphologies, and also produce more intense severe weather. Supercell systems were especially prolific producers of tornadoes and hail relative to all other morphologies, but also produced severe wind and flooding much more often than nonsupercell cellular morphologies. These results suggest {{that it is important to}} differentiate between cellular morphologies containing rotation and those that do not when associating severe weather reports with convective morphology...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of surface {{conditions in the}} form of changing surface temperatures on fully developed mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) is investigated using a cloud system resolving setup of the ICON model (1 km grid spacing). The simulated MCSs take the form <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> with trailing stratiform precipitation. After the squall lines have reached a quasi steady-state, secondary convection is triggered ahead <b>of</b> the <b>squall</b> <b>line,</b> resulting in an increase <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> propagation speed, also known as discrete propagation. The higher propagation speed is then maintained {{for the remainder of the}} simulations because secondary convection ahead <b>of</b> the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> acts to reduce the environmental wind shear over the depth <b>of</b> the <b>squall</b> <b>line’s</b> cold pool. The surface conditions have only a marginal effect on the squall lines themselves. This is so because the surface fluxes cannot significantly affect the cold pool, which is continuously replenished by mid-tropospheric air. The mid troposphere remains similar given the use of identical initial profiles. The only effect of the surface fluxes consists in an earlier acceleration <b>of</b> the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> due to earlier initiation of secondary convection with higher surface temperature. Finally, a conceptual model to estimate the change in surface temperature needed to achieve a change in onset time of pre-frontal secondary convection and the associated discrete propagation events given environmental conditions is presented...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUsing {{the data}} from SAFIR 3000 {{lightning}} detection network and Doppler weather radar, the characteristics of lightning activity in a squall line on July 31, 2007 were analyzed. In this study, the lightning activity and inferred charge structure <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> were obtained. Our results reveal that: 1) the horizontal projection of the lightning radiation sources mainly corresponded to the high radar reflectivity area <b>of</b> the <b>squall</b> <b>line,</b> and 2) the vertical distribution of the lightning radiation sources developed from two layers into three layers. At the developing stage <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> <b>line,</b> the upper lightning radiation sources were centered at 11 km MSL, while the lower radiation sources were located at 4 km MSL. Assuming that the maximum lightning radiation sources were corresponding to the positive charge region, the squall line showed a dipole charge structure with an upper positive charge region and a lower negative charge region. At its mature stage, the entire squall line was characterized by a multi-layer charge structure with three layers of positive charge at 5 km MSL, 9. 5 km MSL, and 13 km MSL, and a two-layer negative charge region at 7 km MSL and 11 km MSL...|$|R

40|$|This study {{develops}} conceptual {{models of}} how a land–water interface affects the strength and structure <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> <b>lines.</b> Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the Advanced Regional Prediction System model are employed. Five sets of simulations are performed, each testing eight wind shear profiles of varying strength and depth. The first set of simulations contains a squall line but no surface or radiation physics. The second and third sets do not contain a squall line but include surface and radiation physics with a land surface {{on the right and}} a water surface on the left of the domain. The land is either warmer or cooler than the sea surface. These three simulations provide a control for later simulations. Finally, the remaining two simulation sets examine squall-line interaction with a relatively cool or warm land surface. The simu-lations document the thermodynamic and shear characteristics <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> interacting with the coastline. Results show that the inclusion of a land surface did not sufficiently affect the thermodynamic properties ahead <b>of</b> the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> to change its overall structure. Investigation of ambient shear ahead <b>of</b> the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> revealed that the addition of either warm or cool land reduced the strength of the net circulation in the inflow layer as measured by ambient shear.

40|$|The Congo Basin and the {{adjacent}} equatorial eastern Atlantic {{are among the}} most active regions of {{the world in terms of}} intense deep moist convection, leading to frequent lightning and severe squalls. Studying the dynamics and climatology of this convection is difficult due to a very sparse operational network of ground-based observations. Here, a detailed analysis of recently available high temporal resolution meteorological observations from three oil platforms off the coast of Angola spanning the three wet seasons from 2006 / 07 to 2008 / 09 is presented. The annual cycle <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> days as identified from wind data closely follows that of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and therefore mirrors the cycle of wet and dry seasons. The diurnal cycle <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> occurrence varies from station to station, most likely related to local features such as coastlines and orography, which control the initiation of storms. An attempt to classify squalls based on the time evolution of the station meteorology and satellite imagery suggests that microbursts account for at least one-third of the strong gusts, while mesoscale squall lines appear to be quite rare. On a daily basis the probability <b>of</b> <b>squall</b> occurrence increases with increasing values ofCAPE, downdraft CAPE, and 925 - 700 -hPa wind shear, and decreases for high convective inhibition, all calculated from vertical profiles of temperature and humidity at the nearest grid point in the NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF reanalysis datasets. Both the climatological results and the stability indices can be used for local forecasting to avoid squalls impacting on operations on the offshore platforms...|$|R

40|$|An {{anelastic}} approximation is {{used with}} a time-variable coordinate transformation to formulate a two-dimensional numerical model that describes the evolution of gravity waves. The model is solved using a semi-Lagrangian method with monotone (nonoscillatory) interpolation of all advected fields. The time-variable transformation is used to generate disturbances at the lower boundary that approximate the effect <b>of</b> a traveling <b>line</b> <b>of</b> thunderstorms (a <b>squall</b> <b>line)</b> or <b>of</b> flow over a broad topographic obstacle. The vertical propagation and breaking of the gravity wave field (under conditions typical of summer solstice) is illustrated {{for each of these}} cases. It is shown that the wave field at high altitudes is dominated by a single horizontal wavelength; which is not always related simply to the horizontal dimension of the source. The morphology of wave breaking depends on the horizontal wavelength; for sufficiently short waves, breaking involves roughly one half of the wavelength. In common with other studies, it is found that the breaking waves undergo "self-acceleration," such that the zonal-mean intrinsic frequency remains approximately constant in spite of large changes in the background wind. It is also shown that many of the features obtained in the calculations can be understood in terms of linear wave theory. In particular, linear theory provides insights into the wavelength of the waves that break at high altitudes, the onset and evolution of breaking. the horizontal extent of the breaking region and its position relative to the forcing, and the minimum and maximum altitudes where breaking occurs. Wave breaking ceases at the altitude where the background dissipation rate (which in our model is a proxy for molecular diffusion) becomes greater than the rate of dissipation due to wave breaking, This altitude, in effect, the model turbopause, is shown to depend on {{a relatively small number of}} parameters that characterize the waves and the background state...|$|R
