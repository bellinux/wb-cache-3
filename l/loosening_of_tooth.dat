Except for one case, other cases were unilateral maxillary FD. The range of the expansile lesions included the maxillary bone involving maxillary alveolar process, hard palate, zygoma, and medial wall of orbit. Since the typical buccogingival incision was limited to access to the lesions, surgery was performed using the midfacial degloving approach. The surgical procedures and methods that contour the facial bone were similar to this case. There were no recurrence of the lesion and serious complications, and the esthetic result was satisfactory for the patients.

50|$|The maxillary sinus {{is known}} for its thin floor walls and close {{proximity}} to the posterior maxillary teeth. Dental procedures such as extraction <b>of</b> these <b>teeth</b> sometimes cause OAC. The posterior maxillary molars and maxillary sinus are innervated by the same branch of nerves which is the maxillary division of trigeminal nerve. This innervation complicates the situation as the pain from maxillary sinus might be indistinguishable from a posterior maxillary toothache. Other known causes of OAC are fracture across the antral floor typically Le Fort I, displacement of posterior maxillary molar roots into antrum, and direct trauma. Extraction <b>of</b> primary <b>teeth</b> are not considered a risk of OAC due to the presence <b>of</b> developing permanent <b>teeth</b> and the small size of a developing maxillary sinus.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the therapeutic effects of potato extract (PE) on cigarette smoke (CS) –induced {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Methods: PE was first prepared by frozen centrifugation, and its amino acid composition was detected. Toxicity of PE was analyzed by changes in morphology, behavior, routine blood indexes, and biochemical criteria of mice. Then, the COPD rat model was established by CS exposure, and PE, doxofylline, and prednisolone acetate were used to treat these rats. After 45 days of treatment, the morphology and behavior of rats were recorded. In addition, the histopathology of lung tissue was evaluated by chest x-ray and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of interleukine- 10 (IL- 10), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was detected in serum and lung tissue by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: Various amino acids were identified in PE, and no toxicity was exhibited in mice. The CS-induced COPD rat model was successfully established, which exhibited significant thickened and disordered lung markings on 90 % of the rats. After administering doxofylline and prednisolone acetate, inflammation symptoms were improved. However, side effects such as emaciation, weakness, and <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> appeared. In the PE group, obviously improved histopathology was observed in lung tissues. Meanwhile, it was revealed that PE could increase the expression of IL- 10 and reduce the expression of TNF-α and G-CSF in COPD rats, and doxofylline and prednisolone acetate also elicited similar results. Conclusion: Our study suggests PE might be effective in the treatment of CS-induced COPD by inhibiting inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Osteosarcomas (OS) of {{the jaws}} are {{uncommon}} lesions representing 6 - 8 &#x 0025; of skeletal OS. We assessed the characteristics, demographics, prevalence clinical and histopathological findings {{and distribution of}} gnathic OS relative to non-gnathic OS in four major treatment centers. Materials and Methods: This study assessed 13 gnathic OS patients of 98 OS patients from four major referral centers during 1996 - 2007. The age distribution, gender, involved site, clinical findings, signs, symptoms, grade and sub-types were assessed. Hematoxylin-eosin, Picrosirius red, Ponceau trichrome, Masson trichrome and osteoid staining methods were used. Results: Of the 98 OS lesions, 85 (86. 8 &#x 0025;) involved the skeleton, the youngest patient was 6 and the oldest 60 years old; 13 lesions (13. 2 &#x 0025;) involved the jaws (seven mandibular and six maxillary) and the youngest and oldest patients were 15 and 50 years-old, respectively. Non-gnathic OS was more prevalent {{between the ages of}} 11 and 20 years (avg. 15 years) and was common in the distal femur and proximal tibia, presenting most frequently with pain and swelling. OS of the jaws, however, presented more than 10 years later than non-gnathic OS, being more prevalent between the ages of 20 and 30 years (avg. 27 years). OS of the jaws most frequently involved the mandibular body and the posterior maxillary alveolar ridge, presenting frequently with pain, swelling and <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth.</b> Two patients with gnathic OS died during the 10 -year follow-up period (15. 3 &#x 0025;).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine, if it is {{possible}} to create retentive structures on dental enamel by means of an Er,Cr:YSGG laser ((= 2790 nm). As reference procedure thereby the conventional acid etching technique served. The results were judged particularly on an orthodontical application, i. e. the temporary bracket bonding. To this end, natural tooth surfaces were irradiated with 10, 20 and 30 J/cm² and examined afterwards with the help of scanning electron microscopic evaluation, roughness measurements and tensile tests. The SEM pictures of Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiateded surfaces displayed rough surfaces, which are very similar to acid etched enamel. The prism structure of the enamel emerged clearly by a loss of inter and intraprismatic substance. However the clarity of these structures came to a loss with increasing laser energy. The roughness measurements showed with the lowest energy density of 10 J/cm² an ablation, which on the average already exceeded the maximum values of acid etching. During higher energy levels the reference values were exceeded and it came to a clear material loss. In order to judge the quality of the bonding between adhaesiv system and enamel tensile bond strength tests were performed. In clinical outcome a bond strength between 4 - 8 mPa is considered to be necessary. Only the surfaces irradiateded with 30 J/cm² achieved this clinical limit. Lower laser settings could not achieve the required adhesion. In a further scanning electron microscopic investigation the underside of the bracket base was examined after debonding. The bases were completely covered with composite. These surfaces were covered with pieces of cracked enamel, which suggests a small bond strength and a <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hard tissue structure. Due to a too high loss of hard tissue and a strong <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tooth</b> structure the application of the Er,Cr:YSGG laser for conditioning of dental enamel for bracket bonding can not be recommended. The application of this laser for enamel conditioning with fissure sealing or composite filling therapy is however conceivable...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Chondrosarcomas are {{malignant}} mesenchymal tumors with cartilaginous differentiation. Chondrosarcomas of the maxillofacial {{region are}} extremely rare lesions, accounting for approximately 1 % of chondrosarcomas {{of the entire}} body. In most cases, the tumor presents as a painless mass or swelling with <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the associated <b>teeth.</b> The final diagnosis of the lesion is based on histopathological findings. Case Report: A 30 -year-old man with a swelling over the lingual side of his mandible was admitted. The patient had no complaints of pain or tenderness in the region. The mass lesion was biopsied. Histopathological examination on the biopsied sample confirmed the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. The patient was advised to undergo surgery and the tumor was resected completely. So far {{there has been no}} evidence of recurrence in the 6 month post operation follow up. Conclusion: Chondrosarcomas vary from a well-differentiated tumor resembling a benign mass of cartilage to a high grade malignancy with aggressive behavior and the potential to form metastasis. Tumor grade and resectability are the most important prognostic factors for head and neck chondrosarcomas. The treatment of choice for such lesions is wide surgical excision.

The cavalry horses and transport animals suffered from bursati, and even a pinprick expanded into a large open sore. It is doubtful whether the brigade could have been considered fit for active service after September. All the Europeans suffered acutely from prickly heat. Malarial fever was common. There were numerous cases of abscess on the liver. Twenty-five per cent of the British officers were invalided to England or India, and only six escaped a stay in hospital. The experiences of the battalion holding Tokar Fort were even worse than those of the troops in Suakin. At length the longed-for time of departure arrived.

40|$|Introduction: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) is {{a commonly}} used surgical treatment of osteoarthritis {{of the hip}} joint. A frequent complication <b>of</b> THA is <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> one or both components <b>of</b> the prosthesis. <b>Loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis is usually caused by mechanical (aseptic) causes but can also have an infectional (septic) cause. Both types <b>of</b> <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis require a different surgical treatment. The treatment <b>of</b> aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis consists of one operation during which one or both components of the prosthesis are being changed (1 -stage revision THA). Treatment <b>of</b> septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis requires a more intensive treatment because first the infection has to be cleared. Previous studies showed that certain patient-related factors have {{an increased risk of}} aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. However, no study has been performed into the difference between patient-related factors with aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify patient-related factors that are associated with an increased risk of aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Methods: This retrospective cohort study consisted of 257 patients who underwent a revision THA between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011 admitted to the orthopedic unit of the Martini Hospital in Groningen. After in- and exclusioncriteria, 161 patients were being included. Patient-related and surgical factors were derived from EPD and patient charts. Analysed patient-related factors included the 19 specific diseases that are used to determine the Charlson Comorbidity Index as well as the 30 most common chronic diseases according to the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Uni- and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify patient-related factors related to aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Results: Of the 161 patients, 151 patients had an aseptic loosening and 15 patients had a septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Analysis showed that myocardial infarction (OR, 7. 37; BI 1. 86 - 29. 20) and cancer (OR, 5. 25; BI 1. 65 - 16. 76) had a raised chance for septic loosening in comparison with aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Overweight showed to be a raised chance OR, 0. 26; BI, 0. 07 - 0. 97) for aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Also having a high Charlson score (> 5) in comparison with a Charlson score of 0 was a risk factor for septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Conclusions: This study showed that patients with myocardial infarction or cancer in the medical history have a significant higher risk for septic loosening in comparison with aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis.

Diabetes mellitus (OR 0, 1; p = 0, 040) was the only predictor for aseptic loosening. Predictors for septic loosening were pre-operative anemia (OR 6, 2; p = 0, 025) and overweight (OR 9, 9; p = 0, 071). Conclusion: Diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> aseptic <b>loosening.</b> Pre-operative anemia and overweigh were predictive for septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> a TKP. Results of this study are in line with earlier results of {{international studies}}, new associations were not found. ...|$|R
