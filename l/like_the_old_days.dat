500|$|Lukather {{achieved}} notability in the 1970s and 1980s {{as one of}} {{the most}} sought-after session guitarists in Los Angeles, playing with a wide range of artists from Aretha Franklin to Warren Zevon. He has performed on over 1,500 records spanning 36years. Music journalist Jude Gold noted, [...] "It's hard to name a guitarist who has had a more prolific and fulfilling career than Steve Lukather." [...] Lukather credits fellow Toto members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro for getting him exposure in the industry—although he lamented in an April 2011 interview that opportunities for session musicians have curtailed in recent years: [...] "There is no 'session guy' thing any more—not like it was. It's not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> when I was doing 25 sessions a week. All the studios are gone. The budgets are gone. The record companies are all gone." [...] His own output as a session musician has slowed along with the rest of the industry—as of 2009, Lukather stated he was only doing a few sessions a year.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout, members saw manager Wayne Sharp as {{an amiable}} influence. Producer Mike Denneen said, [...] "He's not a dictator; he's a {{consensus}} builder, and he's {{very good at}} it... He cajoles and persuades and convinces and everybody is inclined to trust him, including me." [...] However, band members expressed concern that they started out too fast and that they intentionally brought on too much media attention. Members also experienced increasing dissatisfaction with their label. Zehr said, [...] "It's not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> where a label would spend years pumping money to develop an artist... Today it's up to the artists to ready themselves for the big time". He commented as well, [...] "At this point you're kind of turning the label into a bank".|$|E
2500|$|While {{promoting}} an October 28, 2010 Detroit gig by the Pointer Sisters - then comprising Anita and Ruth Pointer and Sadako Johnson - Ruth Pointer, asked [...] "Do you [...] plan on recording {{an album}} with Sadako?", replied: [...] "Hmm...not really. We {{talk about it}} from time to time, but the business has changed so much. It's not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> when you just have a record deal and go {{in the studio and}} record with a producer and then start promoting." [...] In the same interview Ruth Pointer commented on the Pointer Sister's profile having dropped in recent years: [...] "We've performed a lot in Europe and Asia and Australia, and it's just that we haven't been very visible publicly in the [...] We still do a lot of corporate parties and private parties because I mean, let's face it, those are the people that are in our own age group and know our songs." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This is, indeed, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> We {{shall have}} time for a mouthful of dinner before we need go. Well, then, about that chasm. I had no serious {{difficulty}} in getting out of it, for the very simple reason that I never was in it." ...|$|E

60|$|What! To {{be treated}} in such fashion! As the news spread among the schooners, they were emptied. Everybody came ashore. Men who had had no {{intention}} of coming ashore climbed into the boats. The unfortunate governor's ukase had precipitated a general debauch for all hands. It was hours after sunset, and the men wanted to see anybody try to put them on board. They went around inviting the authorities to try to put them on board. In front of the governor's house they were gathered thickest, bawling sea-songs, circulating square faces, and dancing uproarious Virginia reels and old-country dances. The police, including the reserves, stood in little forlorn groups, waiting for the command the governor was too wise to issue. And I thought this saturnalia was great. It was <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> of the Spanish Main come back. It was license; it was adventure. And I was part of it, a chesty sea-rover along with all these other chesty sea-rovers among the paper houses of Japan.|$|E
6000|$|... "Laddy and Jim {{are going}} to stay," [...] went on Belding. [...] "It'll be <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Panhandle <b>days</b> a little.

I think I'll make this young man Gale an offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the daytime. Nobody {{killed by}} this Citizens' Protective League, {{as they call}} themselves. They just rounded up all the {{suspicious}} men an' herded them on to thet cattle-train an' carried them off. It was at night when the vigilantes worked--masked an' secret an' sure bloody.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{but look}} here, Stacy," [...] {{continued}} Barker, [...] "comrades <b>like</b> us, in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> {{used to do}} that in times of trouble and adventures. Why shouldn't we do it in our luck?" ...|$|R

Why, I ain't bin inside a schoolhouse since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. Thar's the benches, and the desks, and the books and all them 'a b, abs,' jest <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> Dear! Dear! But the teacher in those days was ez old and grizzled ez I be--and some o' the scholars--no offense to you, Mr. Brooks--was older and bigger nor you.

Ez I was sayin' only t'other day, we can't be too grateful to our parents for givin' us an eddication in our youth;" [...] and Mr. Hoover, with the air of recalling an alma mater of sequestered gloom and cloistered erudition, gazed reverently around the new pine walls.|$|E
5000|$|Holy Ghost Tent Revival's second {{full-length}} album Sweat <b>Like</b> <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Days</b> {{was released}} on September 4, 2012. The Daily Tarheel stated the album showed growth from their first 2008 release, and that Sweat <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Days</b> [...] "melds the goodness of Bourbon Street-style jazz and Appalachian folk into a solid toe-tapping release. Timeless as the record sounds, it maintains the lush animation and instrumentation of contemporary indie rock, providing an invigorating modernity that prevents the album from sounding the least bit stale. It’s a celebration of times and relationships come and gone, delving into a musical box of memories with effortless style." [...] Around 2012 trumpeter Charlie Humphrey joined the group.|$|E

5000|$|Not {{long after}} Cal moved to Rosehill, Meg did come back, and sadly, {{she was the}} same as she was before, amoral and always lusting after {{attractive}} shady men, much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> Again, she and Van were battling each other over morals. Meg's final husband, crooked mayor Jeff Hart, had tried to eliminate Van, as well as Cal, many times, but failed.|$|E
5000|$|Shimabukuro commented afterwards: [...] "The {{best thing}} was that, {{even with all}} those people, we {{recorded}} everything live with no overdubs. It was great, tracking live with an orchestra and a rhythm section. We picked up on each other’s subtle emotional cues - you could feel everyone breathing together.

50|$|Plainfield's {{atmosphere}} {{is distinct from}} popular tourist destinations in Vermont such as Stowe, and Woodstock in that its commercial activity is generated primarily by local residents.

Following this success, the band also released a compilation featuring songs from their third and fourth album in 2004 under the title Kao nekad (<b>Like</b> in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days).</b> All of <b>the</b> songs were remastered and in some of them the authors modified the arrangements.

5000|$|Hugh Leslie Gibb {{was born}} in Chorlton District in Manchester to Hugh Gibb and Edith Yardley. He said: [...] "I was the oddball in my family 'cause I liked music and the {{attitude}} {{was that it would}} never do you any good. The main theme then was go to work, have a steady job, and bring your wages home every weekend. A-side track from that wasn't right in their eyes. To be a musician was <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> you know, when they were considered vagabonds, and that's all I ever wanted to do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bate regained {{ownership}} of the property and started an online version of the Ottawa edition of the magazine called eFrank.ca on September 27, 2005, with a print version following in late November 2005. Within a month of publication, his new venture had its first lawsuit. For a publisher who thrived on controversy, Bate was pleased, [...] "Its just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> Now its official. Were back." [...] Bate decided to cease publishing in October 2008 as subscriptions had declined once again. Frank, said Bate, {{was a victim of}} the Internet. At the time, Bate said he was contemplating a book on the publications controversial run.|$|E
5000|$|... "Still Ill" [...] is a 1984 song by The Smiths. The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Johnny Marr, and the lyrics by Morrissey. The track initially {{appeared on the}} band's self titled debut album, The Smiths, but was also included on the compilation album Hatful of Hollow. The two versions on the different albums differ from each other, the second featuring a prominent harmonica. A staple of most of their live concerts; the song, lyrically, is about general depression and dissatisfaction with lines like [...] "England is mine, and it owes me a living", referring to living on the dole, and [...] "it just wasn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> any more / am I still ill..." [...] evoking a mood of sombre disillusion and alienation.|$|E
50|$|Gi-dong {{makes his}} claim on Ju-ran, but Young-joon {{calls it a}} fair game. Young-joon planned to make his trip to Gyeongju a short visit, but he extends his stay to win Ju-ran's heart and {{to get back at}} Gi-dong for old time's sake. Gi-dong gets infuriated over Young-joon's {{decision}} since he won't listen to him <b>like</b> <b>the</b> good <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> Even though fighting over Ju-ran becomes a grueling test to their friendship, the situation gets worse when they practically get the whole city involved. It's a fight to the finish to win one girl's heart, even if it takes a few bones to break.|$|R
5000|$|Soon the {{government}} tried to ban the tianguis, {{and as a matter}} of fact, the museum had already closed its doors to the whole event, stating that it or the National University [...] "had nothing to do with the current state of affairs". They had created a monster, and it had grown so out of hand, that now it was on its own, and was being put down, <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> But now <b>the</b> participants knew each other well, and the [...] "heads" [...] of the tianguis organized themselves, and as a group presented a proposition to the local government dependency, offering reliable and uncompromising security, and most important, a permanent fee.|$|R

You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get 'cause I just start knowing stuff." [...] Interscope confirmed that a new album would be released in spring 2009. In December 2008, the rapper provided a few more details about the album, entitled Relapse: [...] "Me and Dre {{are back in the}} lab <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> man.

[...] Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five [...] "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: [...] "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: [...] "Grey's has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ruth made up {{with her}} sisters and they began touring {{together}} again as a family, just <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>days.</b> In 1964 their concert in Hot Springs, Arkansas was recorded by the prestigious RCA label, which had only recorded a few Afro-American gospel artists before, like Doris Akers and Clara Ward. The RCA album was their first recording in stereo because Savoy's studio {{did not have the}} technical capability at that time to engineer dual-channel stereo products. The album was issued as [...] "The Davis Sisters Sing Authentic Southern Style Gospel - Recorded In Live Performance", RCA Victor LSP-2851, and had a color photograph {{on the cover of the}} Famous Davis Sisters in their choir robes singing around a microphone, reminiscent of the format of Savoy MG-14000, their first album which was issued almost ten years previously with much less professional photography and graphics.|$|R
60|$|Lady Mabel {{was content}} with her afternoon's work. When {{they had been}} at Matching before the Polpenno election, there had {{apparently}} been no friendship between them,--at any rate no confidential friendship. Miss Boncassen had been there, and he had had neither ears nor eyes for any one else. But now something <b>like</b> <b>the</b> feeling of <b>old</b> <b>days</b> had been restored.
