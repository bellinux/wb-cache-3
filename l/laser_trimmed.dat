40|$|Electronic devices {{with high}} {{performance}} are becoming smaller and lighter. The passive components required to enable high performance consume premium {{space on the}} surface of the printed circuit board. Integrating the resistor function into the laminate substrate frees up the PCB surface area consumed by the discrete component, enabling increased device functionality by the placement of more active components. When the typical 5 to 20 % tolerance of embedded resistors can be allowed, the resistors satisfy the device requirements. The resistive materials and the PCB fabrication processes used to fabricate the resistors are currently not able to achieve precision of 1 % or less. Laser trim technology achieves < 1 % tolerance on thin film embedded resistor panels. The resistive material has an effect on the efficacy the laser trim. Thin resistive films are <b>laser</b> <b>trimmed</b> to a high degree of precision. Thin film alloys of nickel and chromium, due to the good thermal stability of the alloy, are trimmed to high accuracy at high speed.

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{studies the}} effects of varying <b>laser</b> <b>trim</b> {{patterns}} on several performance parameters of thin film resistors such as the {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) and target resistance value. Design/methodology/approach - The benefits and limitations of basic trim patterns are taken into consideration and the plunge cut, double plunge cut and the curved L-cut were selected to be modelled and tested experimentally. A computer simulation of the <b>laser</b> <b>trim</b> patterns has been developed for the modelling process of the resistors. The influence of the trim length and resistor dimensions on the TCR performance and resistance value of the resistors is investigated. Findings - It is found that variation in trim length, within the range of 5 to 15 mm, can give significant increases in the TCR of the thin films. Thus, for the plunge TCR cut can reach up to 11. 51 ppm/oC, for the double plunge cut up to 14. 34 ppm/oC and for the curved L-cut up to 5. 11 ppm/oC.

40|$|Abstract: The {{resistance}} {{increase by}} transverse cutting is {{more quickly than}} by ordinate cutting when using <b>laser</b> <b>trimming.</b> Therefore, the precision and efficiency of <b>laser</b> <b>trimming</b> can be improved at low cost through reasonable design of the L-cut. In this paper, the finite element method is used to study the influence of L-cut on the resistance of chip resistor.

Both increases or decreases in resonator frequency are possible via the <b>laser</b> <b>trimming</b> due a geometrically-derived location-dependence, where {{the direction of the}} frequency change depends strongly on the location at which the laser removes material.

40|$|Existing {{thick film}} hybrid {{microcircuit}} (HMC) production utilizing integral thick film resistors requires that thick film resistors be deposited via screen printing {{directly on the}} base alumina substrate material. This requirement, when coupled with circuits of moderate to high density and associated layer buildup prior to resistor application, results in printing on surfaces with significant topography surrounding the resistor, compared to required as-printed resistor thicknesses. Due to the technological requirement to print resistors after most other thick film processing has been completed, resistor printing is seldom performed on a flat surface. The surface topography of the substrate surrounding the resistor area prohibits the printing process from maintaining a relatively uniform printed resistor thickness across the substrate. Although resistors are, in most cases, adjusted to final electrical values by physically modifying the length-to-width ratio through laser trimming, the resistors must be within certain resistance ranges. This variation in thickness translates into potential scrap product through extreme variation in as-fired resistor electrical values and/or product incapable of being <b>laser</b> <b>trimmed</b> due to excessive resistor thickness. The development of a thick film resistor application process compatible with existing conductor and dielectric materials and enabling more planarization of the print surface was needed to enhance production yields on products of moderate complexity...|$|E
40|$|Homoepitaxial {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) of diamond requires {{high quality}} substrate crystals. This paper describes the process of diamond substrate crystal recovery so that the original substrate can be reused for multiple synthesis processes. A three-stage treatment is applied after homoepitaxial CVD growth. First the original substrate is separated by laser cutting, then the cut surface is mechanically polished, and finally polycrystalline material {{at the edges of}} the recovered seed plate is <b>laser</b> <b>trimmed.</b> This recovery process yields reusable diamond substrates that do not differ appreciably from their original state in terms of stresses and impurity concentrations. While the recovery process was demonstrated using HPHT seed substrates the process can also be applied to the as-grown CVD diamond plates. Infrared absorption spectral analysis, surface profilometry, birefringence imaging and Raman spectroscopy are performed after each processing step to monitor crystal quality. The nitrogen concentration in the substrate crystal remains constant throughout CVD and recovery processes. When using HPHT type Ib substrates the detected nitrogen concentration is 110 - 180 ppm. The nitrogen is mainly incorporated in form of C center defects and no transformation to other forms of defect centers occurs during the CVD process. Birefringence imaging showed a low level of internal stress within the HPHT crystals. No change is observed during CVD growth and recovery processes. It is shown that the polycrystalline rim removal is essential for repeatable CVD deposition on the same seed substrate. Substrate crystal recovery allows growth of up to 20 crystals from one original seed...|$|E
40|$|The AD 667 is a {{complete}} voltage output 12 -bit digital-to-analog converter including a high stability buried Zener voltage reference and double-buffered input latch on a single chip. The converter uses 12 precision high speed bipolar current steering switches and a <b>laser</b> <b>trimmed</b> thin-film resistor network to provide fast settling time and high accuracy. Microprocessor compatibility is achieved by the on-chip doublebuffered latch. The design of the input latch allows direct interface to 4 -, 8 -, 12 -, or 16 -bit buses. The 12 bits of data from the first rank of latches can then {{be transferred to the}} second rank, avoiding generation of spurious analog output values. The latch responds to strobe pulses as short as 100 ns, allowing use with the fastest available microprocessors. The functional completeness and high performance in the AD 667 results from a combination of advanced switch design, high speed bipolar manufacturing process, and the proven laser wafer-trimming (LWT) technology. The AD 667 is trimmed at the wafer level and is specified to ± 1 / 4 LSB maximum linearity error (K, B grades) at + 25 °C and ± 1 / 2 LSB over the full operating temperature range. The subsurface (buried) Zener diode on the chip provides a low noise voltage reference which has long-term stability and temperature drift characteristics comparable to the best discrete reference diodes. The laser trimming process which provides the excellent linearity, is also used to trim the absolute value of the reference as well as its temperature coefficient. The AD 667 is thus well suited for wide temperature range performance with ± 1 / 2 LSB maximum linearity error and guaranteed monotonicity over the full temperature range. Typical full-scale gain TC is 5 ppm/°C. Microprocessor-Compatibl...|$|E
