5|$|The {{development}} of autonomous robots capable of constructing intricate structures without human assistance has {{been inspired by}} the complex mounds that termites build. These robots work independently and can move by themselves on a tracked grid, capable of climbing and <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> bricks. Such robots may be useful for future projects on Mars, or for building levees to prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect it}} from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
5|$|Knowles rehearsed {{the pole}} dancing using two ballet bars, which {{was when it}} was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. Though she is from Texas, she had never {{previously}} been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it wasn't until 4:00am that they completed work.|$|E

5|$|The keel of Yamato, {{the lead}} ship of the class, was laid {{down at the}} Kure Naval Arsenal, Hiroshima, on 4 November 1937, in a {{dockyard}} {{that had to be}} adapted to accommodate her enormous hull. The dock was deepened by one meter, and gantry cranes capable of <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> to 350 tonnes were installed. Extreme secrecy was maintained throughout construction, a canopy even being erected over part of the drydock to screen the ship from view. Yamato was launched on 8 August 1940, with Captain (later Vice-Admiral) Miyazato Shutoku in command. A great effort was made in Japan to ensure that the ships were built in extreme secrecy to prevent American intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} contest pitted Chris Sabin against Petey Williams, lasting 12 {{minutes and}} 34 seconds. The bout was originally scheduled as Sabin facing his tag team {{partner in the}} Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament, Shocker. However, Shocker was unable to attend the show {{and was replaced by}} Williams. Williams held Sabin by Sabin's legs in a Sharpshooter submission hold twice during the match, with Sabin forcing Williams to release the hold both times. Near the end, Williams went to perform his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver on Sabin, before Sabin countered the move into his signature Cradle Shock maneuver. After <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> and slamming Williams back and neck-first into the mat, Sabin followed with the pinfall to win the encounter. Matt Bentleyformally known as Michael Shanereturned to TNA by attacking Sabin and Williams after the bout. Bentley then announced an Ultimate X open challenge to take place at Bound for Glory.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which {{defending}} champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a cello. Jarrett went to hit Nash with the cello, however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken cello {{and placed it on}} the canvass. He then followed by <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the cello to perform what he dubbed the Jackknife Powerbomb. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. Monty Sopp then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, which led to a fight between the two. After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. Sean Waltman then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them. A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him to fall and force his face into the canvass, which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the Stroke. Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

60|$|From {{these words}} may be {{observed}} these things, First. That {{there is a}} hell for souls to be tormented in, when this life is ended. Mark, after he was dead and buried, 'In hell he <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.' Second. That all that are ungodly, and do live and die in their sins, so soon as ever they die, they go into hell: he died and was buried; 'And in hell he <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.' Third. That some are so fast asleep, and secure in their sins, that they scarce know well where they are till they come into hell; and that I gather from these words, 'In hell he <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.' He was asleep before, but hell makes him <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.|$|R
25|$|The STS-135 payload canister's move to Launch Pad 39A {{began in}} the night of 16 June. The canister's <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> of the pad {{structure}} to place it into the cleanroom happened on the next day. Technicians at the launch pad closed the Rotating Service Structure (RSS) back around Atlantis {{to gain access to}} the orbiter's payload bay. The payload bay doors were opened on the night of 18 June and the cargo was installed into the shuttle's payload bay on 20 June.|$|E
25|$|On {{the very}} day of the wedding, Henry {{returned}} to Hessilhead castle and discovered the treacherous act, but he fell from his horse {{on his way to}} claim his bride and died. At midnight the wedding feast was halted abruptly by the figure of the fully armour clad Neil Montgomerie striding into Aiket Castle hall, <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> the Lady Anna and then vanishing into the night. Neither soldier nor bride were ever found. The Lockhart, Loccard or Lockhard family are believed to have been the first owners of the Barony of Kilmarnock. Symington is named after a Flemish knight, Simon Loccard.|$|E
25|$|The Gazelle {{is capable}} of {{transporting}} up to five passengers and up to 1,320 pounds of cargo on the underside cargo hook, or alternatively up to 1,100 pounds of freight in 80 cubic feet of internal space {{in the rear of}} the cabin. Armed variants would carry up to four HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d'un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin. Various optional equipment can be installed upon the Gazelle, such as fittings for engine noise suppression, 53 gallon ferry tanks, a rescue winch capable of <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> to 390 pounds, emergency flotation gear, particle filter, high landing skids, cabin heater, adjustable landing lights, and engine anti-icing systems. While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type's entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well. The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator Vought Helicopters at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles. Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external baggage access door mounted beneath the main cabin.|$|E

500|$|Many {{have given}} {{suggestions}} as Jason's motivation for killing. Ken Kirzinger refers to Jason as a [...] "psychotic mama's boy gone horribly awry...very resilient. You can't kill him, but he feels pain, just not like everyone else." [...] Kirzinger {{goes on to}} say that Jason is a [...] "psycho-savant", and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and not anything personal. Andrew O'Hehir has stated, [...] "Coursing hormones act, of course, as smelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of William Bennett-style values." [...] Todd Farmer, writer for Jason X, wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life. Whatever his motivations, Kane Hodder believes there is a limit to what he will do. According to Hodder, Jason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when Jason Takes Manhattan called for Hodder to kick the lead character's dog, Hodder refused, stating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he is not bad enough to hurt animals. Another example from Jason Takes Manhattan, involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife, however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in Jason Lives, stating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child.|$|E
