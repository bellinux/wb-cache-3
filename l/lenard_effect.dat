25|$|The {{researches}} of Langevin {{and those}} of Eugene Bloch {{have shown that the}} greater part of the <b>Lenard</b> <b>effect</b> is certainly due to this 'Hertz effect'. The <b>Lenard</b> <b>effect</b> upon the gas itself nevertheless does exist. Refound by J. J. Thomson and then more decisively by Frederic Palmer, Jr., it was studied and showed very different characteristics than those at first attributed to it by Lenard.|$|E

This study presented an effective approach in integrating air ion monitoring, variograms, Kriging and sprinkler experiment, based on a case study in central Taiwan. Twelve months monitoring of the air ion at thirty sample sites is an effective method for generating spatial and temporal NAI concentrations in the study areas. The measurement results showed that the lowest mean and standard deviation of NAI occurred in January. The highest mean and standard deviation value of NAI occurred in July and June. Factors that impact NAI concentration include types of NAI source, landscape layout, distances to NAI source. The ability of waterfall to generate NAI is larger than sprinkler. The area close to waterfall and far to sprinkler is high NAI concentration. Kriging estimation is useful in evaluating and mapping of spatial negative air ions patterns in a house garden. The maps showed the highest NAI next to the waterfall and lower NAI are the areas next to the entrance of the garden and residence. An experiment found that sprinkler has high ability to generate NAI through the <b>Lenard</b> <b>effect.</b> According to the map which sums up the twelve months NAI concentration, the study garden should set up three sprinklers to increase 5. 28 times more NAI concentration, increases 7. 56 times of mean NAI when there was any sprinkler. This study provides a hybrid approach to assess and mapping the patterns of negative air ions for future garden design with health concept...|$|E
40|$|The {{waterfall}} effect {{describes the}} separation of charge by splashing {{at the base of}} a waterfall. Smaller drops that have a net negative charge are created, while larger drops and/or the bulk maintain overall charge neutrality with a net positive charge. Since it was first described by <b>Lenard</b> (1892) the <b>effect</b> has been confirmed many times, but a molecular explanation has not been available. Application of our fluctuation-correlation model of hydrophobic hydration accounts for the negative charge observed at aqueous interfaces with low permittivity materials. The negative surface charge observed in the waterfall effect is created by the preferential adsorption of hydroxide ions generated from the autolysis of water. On splashing, shear forces generate small negative drops from the surface, leaving a positive charge on the remaining large fragment. The waterfall effect is a manifestation of the general phenomenon of the negative charge at the interface between water and hydrophobic surfaces that is created by the preferential adsorption of hydroxide ions...|$|R
