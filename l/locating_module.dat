The agent has to obtain user’s location dynamically, and respond him the information or service depending upon his geographical position. We propose a novel framework for location-aware information agent that operates on the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) environment. There is a <b>locating</b> <b>module</b> that can obtain user’s location by GSM cellular network. A topology-based data model is devised to represent geographical information. Search algorithm can find location-dependent results from the topology graph. Search results are organized as dynamic documents, which are Wireless Markup Language (WML) cards and decks.

40|$|The area of {{automatic}} license plate recognition (ALPR) offers a big scope in numerous applications {{and a lot}} of techniques have been proposed. Most of the techniques work under restricted and supervised conditions. The proposed ALPR technique consists of two main modules: plate <b>locating</b> <b>module</b> and plate segmentation module. In the initial stage, search is being made for a prospective license plate on the basis of some of the local features contained in its fuzzy geometry. The second module utilizes a fuzzy C means based clustering over the finalized plate-patch to cluster the eight-connected components in it into desired and undesired regions. Segmentation proceeds only over the cluster containing the desired plate regions. In the experiment on locating license plates, 852 images were taken at various backgrounds and conditions. Of these, 10 images failed to locate the license plates; the rate of success was 98. 82 %. Experiments for character segmentation were carried out on the remaining 842 plates. Of which, 39 plates were not properly segmented; the success rate was 95. 36 %. The combined rate for the two phases of our license plate identification algorithm is 94. 24 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Automatic {{license plate}} {{recognition}} (LPR) {{plays an important}} role in numerous applications and a number of techniques have been proposed. However, most of them worked under restricted conditions, such as fixed illumination, limited vehicle speed, designated routes, and stationary backgrounds. In this study, as few constraints as possible on the working environ-ment are considered. The proposed LPR technique consists of two main modules: a license plate <b>locating</b> <b>module</b> and a license number identification module. The former characterized by fuzzy disciplines attempts to extract license plates from an input image, while the latter conceptualized in terms of neural subjects aims to identify the number present in a license plate. Experiments have been conducted for the respective modules. In the experiment on locating license plates, 1088 images taken from various scenes and under different conditions were employed. Of which, 23 images have been failed to locate the license plates present in the images; the license plate location rate of success is 97. 9 %. In the experiment on identifying license number, 1065 images, from which license plates have been successfully located, were used. Of which, 47 images have been failed to identify the numbers of the license plates located in the images; the identification rate of success is 95. 6 %. Combining the above two rates, the overall rate of success for our LPR algorithm is 93. 7 %.

Several of them were directly related to the neurodegenerative disease and its development, e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease enriched in GS 05 and Parkinson’s Disease enriched in GS 01. Another major part of them were also related to the neurodegenerative diseases and their development. For instance, caffeine as the most widely used psychoactive substance, its metabolism (from GS 09 <b>located</b> in <b>Module</b> 25) can affect brain metabolism and has potential benefits on Parkinson’s Disease treatment [16]. There are also several enriched pathways related to oxidative stress, which is a critical factor for a range of neurodegenerative disorders. For example, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (from GS 02 <b>located</b> in <b>Modules</b> 02 - 07) are associated with hypoxia, ischemia, and AD [2]. Gap junctions (from GS 03 <b>located</b> in <b>Modules</b> 08 - 13) can couple various kinds of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) which {{play an important role in}} maintaining normal function.

50|$|The CPAN's {{main purpose}} is to help programmers <b>locate</b> <b>modules</b> and {{programs}} {{not included in the}} Perl standard distribution. Its structure is decentralized. Authors maintain and improve their own modules. Forking, and creating competing modules for the same task or purpose is common. There is no formal bug tracking system, but there is a third-party bug tracking system that CPAN designated as the suggested official method of reporting issues with modules. Continuous development on modules is rare; many are abandoned by their authors, or go years between new versions being released. Sometimes a maintainer will be appointed to an abandoned module. They can release new versions of the module, and accept patches from the community to the module as their time permits. CPAN has no revision control system, although the source for the modules is often stored on GitHub. Also, the complete history of the CPAN and all its modules is available as the GitPAN project, allowing to easily see the complete history for all the modules and for easy maintenance of forks. CPAN is also used to distribute new versions of Perl, as well as related projects, such as Parrot.|$|R

40|$|Our {{long-term}} {{objective is}} to develop robots that engage in natural language-mediated cooperative tasks with humans. To support this goal, we are developing an amodal representation and associated processes which is called a grounded situation model (GSM). We are also developing a modular architecture in which the GSM resides in a centrally <b>located</b> <b>module,</b> around which there are language, perception, and actionrelated modules. The GSM acts as a sensor-updated "structured blackboard", {{that serves as a}} workspace with contents similar to a "theatrical stage" in the robot's "mind", which might be filled in with present, past or imagined situations. Two main desiderata drive the design of the GSM: first, "parsing" situations into ontological types and relations that reflect human language semantics, and second, allowing bidirectional translation between sensory-derived data/expectations and linguistic descriptions. We present an implemented system that allows of a range of conversational and assistive behavior by a manipulator robot. The robot updates beliefs (held in the GSM) about its physical environment, the human user, and itself, based on a mixture of linguistic, visual and proprioceptive evidence. It can answer basic questions about the present or past and also perform actions through verbal interaction. Most importantly, a novel contribution of our approach is the robot's ability for seamless integration of both language- and sensor-derived information about the situation: For example, the system can acquire parts of situations either by seeing them or by "imagining" them through descriptions given by the user: "There is a red ball at the left".

40|$|Abstract. Procedures invoked across program modules {{to notify}} about event occurences {{rather than to}} request {{concrete}} services are termed callbacks. They are frequently used to decouple program modules. However, their use complicates exception handling, turning default exception propagation with the established termination model unsatisfactory. Existing advice on handling exceptions in callbacks either requires implementors to provide a no-throw guarantee or to propagate a generic exception from a callback to its invoker. We demonstrate that neither approach supports adequate exception handling in practice. To aid programmers, we propose a tactic which mimics default propagation in the callback-less context: If possible, handle an exception locally; otherwise, propagate it to the invoked callback’s clients, that is, modules affected by the callback’s failure. We suggest early explicit specification {{as a means to}} <b>locate</b> such <b>modules.</b> ...|$|R
