40|$|A {{range of}} green {{practices}} is {{emerging in the}} streets, homes and gardens of suburban neighbourhoods around the world. From community gardens and permablitzing {{to the rise of}} &# 039;sustainability streets&# 039; and &# 039;voluntary simplicity&# 039; networks, individuals and community groups in advanced consumer societies are looking for innovative approaches to living more ethically and sustainably. In this article I examine the way that such trends are starting to make their way onto our TV screens, and in particular into the <b>life-changing</b> <b>narratives</b> of lifestyle programming. While traditionally seen as vehicles for the promotion of the latest consumer products and services, lifestyle shows are also increasingly concerned with teaching audiences how to adopt &# 039;ethical&# 039; ways of living. This article examines a range of &# 039;eco-lifestyle&# 039; formats as sites of creative experimentation around green living, citizenship and {{the question of how to}} live &# 039;the good life&# 039; today...|$|E
