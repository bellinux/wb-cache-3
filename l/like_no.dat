5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} {{was built on}} a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two Mountains and {{the mouth of the}} Des Prairies River. This windmill was <b>like</b> <b>no</b> other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), with thick walls, square loopholes for muskets, with machicolation at the top for pouring lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the heart}} of this epic, Lee relays another {{personal}} story that impacts intensely, especially as the song breaks during the bridge and her voice takes flight like never before.

5|$|In {{the early}} to mid 2000's the Crusaders and Brumbies had a rivalry <b>like</b> <b>no</b> other. In the space of five years, the Crusaders and the Brumbies contested three finals. In 2000 the Crusaders {{defeated}} the Brumbies 20-19, in 2002 the Crusaders also claimed the second meeting 31-12. However, in 2004, the Brumbies would defeat the Crusaders in the final meeting 47-38 in a high scoring match. Likewise with the Blues, the rivalry has dwindled in recent times, with the Brumbies only sporadically title threats.|$|E
5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked <b>like</b> <b>no</b> other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{broken and}} {{incoherent}} radio messages between Lieber {{and the search}} party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare up over his impending trial, {{where it will be}} held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak... his tongue is <b>like</b> <b>no</b> other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.|$|E

25|$|The year after, the Order {{started work}} on a new city with fortifications <b>like</b> <b>no</b> other, on the Sciberras Peninsula which the Ottomans had used as a base during the siege. It was named Valletta after Jean Parisot de Valette, the Grand Master who had seen the Order through its victory. Since the Ottoman Empire never {{attacked}} again, the fortifications were never put to the test, and today remain one of the best-preserved fortifications of this period.|$|E
25|$|Yeah sure, we see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds <b>like</b> <b>no</b> other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} in October 1993 already {{received}} widespread attention with over 130 reports in newspapers, magazines, and radio broadcasts discussing its work in every German-speaking country. Many commentators noted its conceptual clarity {{as well as}} its international and intergenerational approach. This editorial method has made the magazine an “integrative” medium for contemporary poetry in the German language. <b>Like</b> <b>no</b> other publication, DAS GEDICHT was able to initiate a widespread debate on poetry with a broad scope of readers. The Stuttgarter Zeitung wrote that the genre poetry is setting out on a “search for the traces of a new identity” with DAS GEDICHT.|$|E

25|$|The other {{dominant}} {{center of}} the early 1990s was David Robinson. Playing college ball at the United States Naval Academy, his entry into the NBA was delayed by his military service, but he unanimously won the Rookie of the Year Award in 1990 and, in 1995, was voted the MVP. Offensively, Robinson excelled in fast-breaks, running the floor <b>like</b> <b>no</b> 7-footer (2.13 m and above) before or since, while also possessing an effective left-hand jumper. Defensively, his speed and agility helped him hold {{the distinction of being}} the only player in NBA history to rank among the top five in rebounds, blocks and steals in a single season.|$|E
25|$|The Paris Gun was {{a weapon}} <b>like</b> <b>no</b> other, but its {{capabilities}} {{are not known}} with full certainty. This {{is due to the}} weapon's apparent total destruction by the Germans {{in the face of the}} final Allied offensives. Figures stated for the weapon's size, range, and performance varied widely depending on the source—not even the number of shells fired is certain. With the discovery (in the 1980s) and publication (in the Bull and Murphy book) of a long note on the gun written shortly before his death in 1926 by Dr. Fritz Rausenberger, who was in charge of its development at Krupp, the details of its design and capabilities were considerably clarified.|$|E
25|$|Any {{suggestion}} of further reading on Kant {{has to take}} cognizance {{of the fact that}} his work has dominated philosophy <b>like</b> <b>no</b> other figure after him. Nevertheless, several guideposts can be made out. In Germany, one important contemporary interpreter of Kant and the movement of German Idealism he began is Dieter Henrich, who has some work available in English. P. F. Strawson's The Bounds of Sense (1966) {{played a significant role in}} determining the contemporary reception of Kant in England and America. More recent interpreters of note in the English-speaking world include Lewis White Beck, Jonathan Bennett, Henry Allison, Paul Guyer, Christine Korsgaard, Stephen Palmquist, Robert B. Pippin, Roger Scruton, Rudolf Makkreel, and Béatrice Longuenesse.|$|E
