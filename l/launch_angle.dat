2500|$|Golf {{clubs have}} {{traditionally}} been arranged into three basic types. Woods are large-headed, long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively [...] "open" [...] lies, such as the tee box and fairway. Of particular importance is the driver or [...] "1-wood", which is the lowest lofted wood club, and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots, up to , or more, in a professional golfer's hands. Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood, hence the name, but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium, or of composite materials. Irons are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat, angled striking face. Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron; modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy. Irons of varying loft are used {{for a variety of}} shots from virtually anywhere on the course, but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green, or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps. The third class is the putter, which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted, balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole. Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe. A fourth class, called hybrids, evolved as a cross between woods and irons, and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance, but a higher <b>launch</b> <b>angle</b> and a more forgiving nature.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that chondrules and calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) were formed at the inner edge of the protoplanetary disk and then entrained in magnetocentrifugal X-winds. We study trajectories of such solid bodies with the consideration of the central star gravity, the protoplanetary disk gravity, and the gas drag of the wind. The efficiency of the gas drag depends on a parameter η, which is the product of the solid body size and density. We find that the gravity of the protoplanetary disk has a non-negligible effect on the trajectories. If a solid body re-enters the flared disk, the re-entering radius depends on the stellar magnetic dipole moment, the disk's gravity, the parameter η, and the initial <b>launching</b> <b>angle.</b> The disk's gravity can make the re-entering radius lower by up to 30 %. We find a threshold η, denoted as η t, for any particular configuration of the X-wind, below which the solid bodies will be expelled from the planetary system. η t sensitively depends on the initial <b>launching</b> <b>angle,</b> and also depends on the mass of the disk. Only the solid bodies with an η larger than but very close to η t can be launched to a re-entering radius larger than 1 AU. This size-sorting effect may explain why chondrules come with a narrow range of sizes within each chondritic class. In general, the size distributions of CAIs and chondrules in chondrites can be determined from the initial size distribution as well as the distribution over the initial <b>launching</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R
