50|$|Before the Fender Squier line of guitars was {{introduced}} in 1982, Fender was making <b>lower</b> <b>priced</b> guitars such as the Fender Lead series at its Fullerton, California plant. Until {{the introduction of the}} Fender Squier series, Fender had never produced <b>lower</b> <b>priced</b> guitars based on its main Stratocaster and Telecaster models and had always used different model designs for its <b>lower</b> <b>priced</b> guitars.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s Fender was facing {{competition}} from <b>lower</b> <b>priced</b> Japanese made guitars. The higher priced Fender guitars {{were made in}} the United States and could not compete with the <b>lower</b> <b>prices</b> of Japanese made Fender copies. In the early 1980s, Japanese labour and production costs were much lower than in America and to compete with the Japanese made guitars, Fender moved the <b>lower</b> <b>priced</b> Fender guitar production from America to Japan.|$|R

5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. While the 5C shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5C used a lower-cost poly-carbonate plastic case {{in place of the}} original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5C deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at a <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> point below the new model.|$|E
50|$|The {{competitor}} {{will not}} <b>lower</b> <b>prices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about it, a simpler way, is to imagine if both firms set equal prices above marginal cost, firms would get half the market at a higher than MC <b>price.</b> However, by <b>lowering</b> <b>prices</b> just slightly, a firm could gain the whole market, so both firms are tempted to <b>lower</b> <b>prices</b> as much as they can. It would be irrational to price below marginal cost, because the firm would make a loss. Therefore, both firms will <b>lower</b> <b>prices</b> until they reach the MC limit.|$|R
5000|$|Price war is [...] "commercial {{competition}} {{characterized by}} the repeated cutting of prices below those of competitors". [...] One competitor will <b>lower</b> its <b>price,</b> then others will <b>lower</b> their <b>prices</b> to match. If one of them reduces their price again, {{a new round of}} reductions starts. In the short term, price wars are good for buyers, who can take advantage of <b>lower</b> <b>prices.</b> Often they are not good for the companies involved because the <b>lower</b> <b>prices</b> reduce profit margins and can threaten their survival.|$|R
5|$|Three {{years after}} its 2000 release, Vagrant Story was {{selected}} as one of Sony's Greatest Hits. Games released as Greatest Hits were sold at a <b>lower</b> <b>price,</b> often increasing units sold. Vagrant Story {{is also part of}} Ultimate Hits, Square Enix's main budget range. The game was later made playable on Sony's PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 consoles when Square Enix announced the title's release on the PlayStation Stores in Japan, Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|A MaK-built DB Class 240 {{locomotive}} was test-run in Norway during 1990. On 23 November 1992, NSB's board {{decided to}} order ten similar units. The order was later expanded with another two units because NSB {{was offered a}} <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than originally stipulated. The Di6 would have motors from Siemens, who had bought MaK, and would be optimized for Norwegian conditions and standards. The contract was worth NOK380 million, or NOK32 million per unit. At the same time, NSB also made an order for 20 smaller diesel-electric locomotives from MaK, the Di8. Between the two new classes, they were to replace all the Di3s.|$|E
5|$|After Biman {{became a}} public limited company, renewed {{attempts}} were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as million. Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at a much <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Fender was facing {{competition}} from <b>lower</b> <b>priced</b> Japanese-made guitars. The higher priced Fender guitars {{were made in}} the United States and could not compete with the <b>lower</b> <b>prices</b> of Japanese-made Fender copies. In Japan, Fender was also losing sales to Japanese guitar brands such as T≈çkai, Greco and Fernandes. Since Japanese labor and production costs were much lower than in America and to compete with the Japanese made guitars, Fender moved the <b>lower</b> <b>priced</b> Fender guitar production from America to Japan. Fender began negotiations with several Japanese musical instrument distributors.|$|R

5|$|Like the Berlina, the Calais {{retains the}} {{features}} of the outgoing model but at a <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the High Output Alloytec V6 engine of the SV6 with the five-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as FE1.5, the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension. Like the SS, an upscale V-Series edition is available. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice range based on the VE. The Calais (as well as Berlina) are the only models in the range to feature larger tail-lights.|$|E
5|$|Liquor {{was another}} {{profitable}} private industry nationalized {{by the central}} government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately. By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain at a <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than demanded by merchants. Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{when the}} Wii U console was first {{shown at the}} E3 2011 in Los Angeles, Namco {{announced}} that they would develop a Tekken game for the Wii U, which was untitled at the time. However, at E3 2012, {{it was announced that}} Tekken Tag Tournament 2 would come to the Wii U, which was already going to come to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Tekken Tag Tournament 2: Wii U Edition is amongst the first third-party Wii U games that is available in both retail and as a downloadable format for the Nintendo eShop. In Japan, the downloadable version is available for a slightly <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than the retail format.|$|E

5|$|Sega {{was able}} to outsell Nintendo four Christmas seasons in a row due to the Genesis' head start, a <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> point, and a larger library of games when {{compared}} to the Super Nintendo at its release. Sega had ten games for every game on SNES, and while the SNES had an exclusive version of Final Fight, one of Sega's internal development teams created Streets of Rage, which had bigger levels, tougher enemies, and a well-regarded soundtrack. ASCII Entertainment reported in the spring of 1993 that Genesis had 250 titles versus 75 for Super Nintendo, but limited shelf space meant that stores typically offered 100 Genesis and 50 Super Nintendo titles. The NES was still the leader, with 300 titles and 100 on shelves.|$|E
5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a <b>lower</b> <b>price.</b> The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E

5|$|The mix of {{engraving}} styles was criticised; {{line engraving}} {{was considered the}} superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. Moreover, Boydell's engravers fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, at a <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred {{that the quality of}} the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of so many different artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.|$|E
5|$|Though {{metallic}} sodium has some important uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds; millions {{of tons of}} sodium chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually. Sodium chloride is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing and as a preservative; sodium bicarbonate is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> and atomic weight. Sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|DOS (Disk Operating System) was the {{operating}} system that brought the company its real success. IBM first approached Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M operating system, which was set {{to be used in the}} IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an operating system when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done their homework. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its <b>lower</b> <b>price.</b> 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.|$|E
