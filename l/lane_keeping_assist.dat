40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{combining}} automatic <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> and driver’s steering for either obstacle avoidance or lane change maneuvers for passing purpose or any other desired maneuvers, through a closed loop control strategy. The automatic <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> control loop is never opened, and no on/off switching strategy is used. During the driver’s maneuver, the vehicle lateral dynamics is controlled by the driver himself through the vehicle steering system. When there is no driver’s steering action, the vehicle center of gravity tracks the center of the travelling lane thanks to the automatic <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> system. At the beginning (end) of the maneuver, the <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> task is released (resumed) safely and smoothly. The performance of the proposed closed loop structure is shown by means of simulations and through experimental results obtained along italian highways. Copyright c© 2007 IFA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{overcome}} {{traffic congestion}} problem and driving safety issues on highway, automatic <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> control of vehicles {{has become an}} attractive area of research. In this paper, an adaptive <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> control scheme for vehicles is proposed. An estimator for unknown curvatures of target lanes is developed and a method to design ideal transient responses is proposed. Finally, an adaptive steering controller to achieve ideal responses is developed. <b>Lane</b> <b>keeping</b> performance can be easily improved by setting only one design parameter and unnecessary high frequency vibration is hard {{to occur in the}} steering control input...|$|R

40|$|Experimental data {{revealed}} that drivers performing a visual secondary task exhibited deteriorated <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> performance, {{but that the}} same drivers performing a cognitive secondary exhibited an improvement in <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> compared to baseline driving. In this paper we present a computational cybernetic driver model that characterizes the effect of difference in eye fixation durations between on and off road glances across the three task conditions on straight <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> performance. The model uses perceptual cues as control input, maintains internal representations of these cues across fixations through Bayesian updating, and each time a change in cue magnitude is perceived based on mechanisms akin to signal detection theory a change in control is applied. The model is shown {{to be able to}} capture the experimental results encouragingly well. The model also sheds light on the relative magnitude of <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> performance degradation caused by glancing away from the road and the fact that internal representations are degraded each time a saccade takes place. The adopted approach to modeling driver perception during and across fixations is expected to lead to new insights into the effects that various in-vehicle activities have on driving performance and risk...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new cost-effective control method for automatic <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> task of autonomous vehicles. To that end, the road-vehicle system {{is transformed into}} a polytopic LPV form which allows to deal with a large variation range of vehicle speed. Based on a robust static output feedback scheme, this method relies exclusively on commonly available vehicle sensors for control design and real-time implementation. Moreover, the information on the road geometry is incorporated in the control law to improve the <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> performance of the vehicle during curve taking. In particular, aiming to reduce the design conservatism, the limitation bounds on the vehicle acceleration are judiciously exploited in the design procedure {{through the use of a}} parameter-dependent Lyapunov function. The control design is recast as an LMI-based optimization with a line search over a scalar variable which can be effectively solved with numerical solvers.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} evaluation of unmanned ground vehicles is difficult. For this problem, we propose a {{quantitative evaluation}} method based on chaos theory. First, the ideal trajectory of an unmanned ground vehicle was designed applying the quintic polynomial method, and the deviation time series {{were obtained by}} calculating the deviation of the actual trajectory from the ideal trajectory. Then, the phase space of the deviation time series was reconstructed based on the improved algorithm using correlation integral method. Finally, the Lyapunov exponent of the deviation time series was calculated, which was the quantitative presentation of the unmanned ground vehicle’s trajectory. The quantitative presentation of the unmanned ground vehicle’s trajectory for <b>lane</b> <b>keeping,</b> obstacle avoidance, and overtaking lane changing was achieved. The Lyapunov exponent of <b>lane</b> <b>keeping</b> was the least, so the maximum predicted time was the longest. <b>Lane</b> <b>keeping</b> was done the best of all.
