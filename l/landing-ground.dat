25|$|Flights {{were made}} down the Hedjaz railway on 1 July to El Kutrani where {{the camp and}} aerodrome were strafed with machine gun fire by Australians and on 6 July at Jauf ed Derwish they found the {{garrison}} working to repair their defences and railway culverts, after {{the destruction of the}} bridges over the Wady es Sultane to the south by the Hedjaz Arabs, which cut their railway communications. When Jauf ed Derwish station north of Maan was reconnoitred, the old German aerodrome at Beersheba was used as an advance <b>landing-ground.</b> Also on 6 July aerial photographs were taken of the Et Tire area near the sea for the map makers. Two days later Jauf ed Derwish was bombed by a British formation which flew over Maan and found it strongly garrisoned. No. 1 Squadron's patrols watched the whole length of the railway during the first fortnight of July; on 13 July a convoy of 2,000 camels south of Amman escorted by 500 cavalry, moving south towards Kissir was machine gunned scattering the horses and camels, while three more Bristol Fighters attacked a caravan near Kissir on the same day; Amman was attacked several days later.|$|E
2500|$|Air {{observation}} for {{the infantry}} attack which began on 13 November was not possible, because of dense white fog during the day. On {{the morning of}} 14 November the mist cleared and 4 and 15 Squadrons flew contact patrols, which revealed the capture of Beaucourt and ground to the north-west. Artillery observation flights gave the positions of [...] batteries, {{many of which were}} silenced by counter-battery fire. German infantry were harassed from the air; [...] troops spotted in a ravine north of Beaucourt were heavily bombarded by British heavy artillery after a [...] "zone call". Another observer directing fire from a siege battery saw approximately [...] infantry sheltering in trenches, brought immediate artillery fire on them and then the crew strafed them. Two battalions of infantry were caught on the road near Achiet le Petit and heavily bombarded. During the night ten aircraft from 18 Squadron made low attacks on railway stations, trains and road transport with bombs and machine-guns. A German aircraft followed two of the British aircraft to their base and bombed the aerodrome, leaving craters in the <b>landing-ground.</b> A dummy <b>landing-ground</b> was illuminated as a ruse and was machine-gunned by a German aircraft later that night.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} 50's, when Flying Training took over, Thorney Island was the parent unit {{for a small}} {{detachment}} in Weymouth (RAF Chesil Bank), where there was an emergency <b>landing-ground</b> (some involvement when the submarine [...] "Affray" [...] sank in the English Channel in 1951). The detachment's primary role was {{the operation of the}} bombing range off Chesil Beach. The floating targets in Lyme Bay were serviced by a launch from Lyme Regis.|$|E
50|$|For {{the rest}} of 1943, the {{squadron}} was fragmented: the Flight in Italy operated from a succession of <b>landing-grounds</b> near the Adriatic coast, while {{the main part of}} the squadron remained in North Africa. Only in mid-January 1944 were the two reunited: but not for long.|$|R
5000|$|Kössen's {{topography}} {{lends itself}} to air sports in the summer months. The surrounding mountain massifs create great thermals, which are near-perfect for hang gliding and paragliding flights, whilst the valley-floor makes safe <b>landing-grounds,</b> as it is broad, flat and mostly meadow-land; furthermore, the winter ski-lifts allow equal access to the summits in their off-season, for the new market of air-sports adventurers.|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the problem of}} determining lease rates for land plots granted for aerodromes, heliports and <b>landing-grounds,</b> airports, objects, EU EO VD, analyzes the situation with the lease of lands for road and rail transport and a comparison with air travel is given. In addition, the problem of transfer of land from the categories of settlements {{into the category of}} transport is examined, it is concluded that rents for civil aviation are discriminatory and do not comply with the recommendations of the International organization of civil aviation (ICAO) according to their size. Appropriate recommendations are given...|$|R
50|$|In October the {{regiment}} left US Fifth Army and crossed Italy again to join 12 AA Bde in British Eighth Army at Rimini. The journey on muddy mountain roads was particularly difficult. On arrival it took over established gun positions, including its first GL Mk. III radar sets and twin 0.5-inch Browning machine guns {{to replace the}} twin Brens. In November some of the guns were pushed forward to defend a <b>landing-ground</b> at Bellaria and Lt-Col Dickinson became AADC Bellaria and Rimini Landing Grounds and Rimini Railhead.|$|E
5000|$|Air {{observation}} for {{the infantry}} attack which began on 13 November was not possible, because of dense white fog during the day. On {{the morning of}} 14 November the mist cleared and 4 and 15 Squadrons flew contact patrols, which revealed the capture of Beaucourt and ground to the north-west. Artillery observation flights gave the positions of 157 German batteries, {{many of which were}} silenced by counter-battery fire. German infantry were harassed from the air; 300 German troops spotted in a ravine north of Beaucourt were heavily bombarded by British heavy artillery after a [...] "zone call". Another observer directing fire from a siege battery saw approximately 250 German infantry sheltering in trenches, brought immediate artillery fire on them and then the crew strafed them. Two battalions of infantry were caught on the road near Achiet le Petit and heavily bombarded. During the night ten aircraft from 18 Squadron made low attacks on railway stations, trains and road transport with bombs and machine-guns.

50|$|At {{the end of}} June 1943 two Flights {{deployed}} to Inqa airfield on Malta, {{as part of the}} operations preparing for the invasion of Sicily, Operation Husky. Oblique photographs were taken of the invasion area and intensive Tac.R operations started on the day prior to the invasion. A few days after the beachhead had been established, the squadron moved to a Sicilian <b>landing-ground</b> and continued with its usual workload in support of XIII Corps. It also added Naval Arty.R shoots to its repertoire, assisting HMS Roberts in bombarding roads inland.|$|E
2500|$|... 84th HAA Regiment later {{served with}} Eighth Army in the Italian Campaign. When the Eighth Army closed {{up to the}} German Winter Line in December 1943, 84th HAA {{reinforced}} [...] 2nd AA Brigade, which was stretched from the River Sangro back to the Foggia Airfield Complex, protecting field gun positions, <b>landing-grounds,</b> railheads and airfields. By early 1944, raids by the German Luftwaffe were becoming less frequent, but the brigade commander, Brig H.M.J. McIntyre, was an enthusiast for employing the versatile 3.7-inch HAA gun against ground targets. For 'Operation Kishan', carried out by 10th Infantry Brigade in May 1944, 84th and 88th HAA Rgts deployed 44 guns and fired 9881 rounds in bombardment and harassing fire in one week. On one occasion, three Troops of 84th HAA broke up a concentration of 300 German troops forming up for an attack. Forward deployment could be dangerous: on 29 August a Troop of 84th HAA south of the River Arno was heavily shelled {{for an hour and}} suffered casualties and loss of equipment, but no guns were put out of action.|$|R
25|$|German air {{operations}} {{over the winter}} concentrated on reconnaissance to look for signs of Anglo-French offensive preparations, which were found at Messines, Arras, Roye, the Aisne and the Champagne region. By March {{the outline of the}} Anglo-French spring offensive had been observed from the air. German air units were concentrated around Arras and the Aisne, which left few to operate over the Noyon Salient during the retirement. When the retirement began British squadrons in the area were instructed to keep German rearguards under constant observation, harass German troops by ground attacks and to make long-range reconnaissance to search the area east of the Hindenburg Line, for signs of more defensive positions and indications that a further retreat was contemplated. A policy on rapid movement had been devised in September 1916, in which the Army Wing and Corps Wings not attached to the corps moving forward, would move with army headquarters and the Corps Wings attached to the corps that were advancing, would keep as close to their associated corps headquarters as possible. Squadrons would not need to move every day and could arrange temporary <b>landing-grounds.</b> On 21 March 1917 the use of temporary facilities was ordered with portable hangars to be built near corps headquarters and aircraft flown back to their normal aerodromes at night. IV and V Brigades were involved in the advance, with their squadrons attached to divisions for contact-patrols. Two cavalry divisions were attached to the Fourth and Fifth armies for the advance, with aircraft for reconnaissance of the ground that the cavalry was to traverse and to help the cavalry maintain touch with the rear.|$|R
50|$|As {{the threat}} of a German {{invasion}} from Bulgaria increased, the need to transfer Greek divisions to the Bulgarian frontier forced Papagos to launch a final effort to capture Valona as quickly as possible. The RAF agreed to challenge the air superiority of the Regia Aeronautica, which had recovered with the loss of much of the RHAF in ground-attack operations, rather than continue ineffective attempts at interdiction. With reinforcements from Egypt and the drying of a <b>landing-ground</b> at Paramythia, the RAF managed 200 close support sorties by the end of February. Launched in mid-February, the attack saw I Corps gain ground towards Tepelenë; Italian resistance and a deterioration in the weather forced a suspension of operations before Tepelenë, let alone Valona or Berat, were reached. The Italian defensive success was costly, and signs of an imminent Italian offensive in the central sector of the front forced a return to the defensive.|$|E
