40|$|We {{study the}} problem of a {{leveraged}} investor that is forced to unwind a significant fraction of its portfolio {{in a collection of}} illiquid markets. It is shown that markets may become disrupted in response to a relatively small liquidity shock. As a consequence, the probability of default can be much higher than suggested by standard risk measures. We also study the impact of successful liquidation on relative asset prices. Our analysis suggests that effective risk management of leveraged financial entities should focus on the entity's potential to generate emergency cash-flows net of third-party claims for <b>liquidity.</b> <b>Portfolio</b> liquidation; Market disruption; Leverage; Determinants of asset liquidity; Hedge funds; Structured credit. ...|$|E
40|$|Credit {{risks are}} unanticipated {{variations}} in costs {{and availability of}} credit that arise from forces in financial markets or from lenders ' responses to risks in agricultural markets and farmers ' creditworthiness. An extension of mean-variance portfolio theory shows how credit risks combine with other financial and business risks to determine total risk. Empirical evidence from lender surveys about risks shows that farmers ' credit is positively correlated with changes in farm income, although the correlation is stronger for capital credit than for operating credit, and that variability in fund availability from rural banks has contributed to high credit risks. Key words: agricultural finance, credit, <b>liquidity,</b> <b>portfolio</b> theory, risk management. Liquidity management is a principal means by which farmers cope with variations in cash flows that arise from uncertain commodity prices, yields, and production costs. The farmer's objective is to assure that cash can be generated quickly and efficiently in order-to meet cash demands. Previous studies by Baker (1966, 1968), Baker and Bhargava, Barry and Baker, and Barry and Willmann, have provided much insight {{on the role of}} credit in farmers ' liquidity management, how credit appraisals differ among lenders, and how farmers ' perceptions of these appraisals interact with their managerial decisions. How-ever, these credit concepts and measurement procedures are developed in deterministic terms so that once the composition of credit is known, it is modeled as though it can be relied upon with complete certainty. Farmers ' reliance on credit as a source of liquidity introduces risks in terms of lenders' responses to changing conditions in agricul-ture and in financial markets that influence their lending decisions and resulting credit availability. These uncertain responses give credit the characteristics of a random variable whose properties can be expressed through the farmers ' cost of borrowing. Thus, farmers' credit risk is an added element of their port-folio risk that has not been accounted for in Peter J. Barry and C. B.

40|$|The market {{consensus}} {{during the}} financial crisis was that financial sector CEOs were engaged in excessive risk taking induced by compensation practices. Thus, {{the primary focus of}} this paper is to determine whether empirical evidence supports this assertion. As such, I examine bank CEO compensation, bank risks, and the relation between bank CEO risk taking incentives and bank risks and the effect of the 2007 / 9 financial crisis on this relation. I find that banks on average reduced their exposure to credit, capital, total, and unsystematic risks, and increased their exposure to <b>liquidity,</b> <b>portfolio,</b> off-balance sheet and (accounting) foreign exchange risks, from 2003 to 2006. These trends largely reversed during 2007 to 2009. During the 2007 / 9 financial crisis, banks experienced significant structural shifts in all risk indicators (except for capital and foreign exchange risks) which increased significantly consequent on the economic downturn. I also find that banks remained highly sensitive to changes in short- and long-term interest rates and foreign exchanges rates throughout the period. My findings also support a bank size effect. I observe consistent real growth in CEO base salary annually, from 2003 to 2009, which suggests that there is resilience in this form of compensation to {{the financial crisis}}. However, only small banks paid significantly higher base salary during the financial crisis to offset the similar decline in annual bonus payments caused by deteriorating financial and market performances during that time. I find that CEO portfolio option values were more responsive to changes in total risk during the pre-financial crisis period (2003 to 2006) than during the financial crisis (2007 to 2009). Also, I find evidence of banks size effects in compensation components, compensation structure and compensation sensitivity. My results are robust to other sample formations and statistical indicators. After adjusting for the simultaneity bias between bank CEOs 2 ̆ 7 risk taking incentives (measured by the sensitivity of CEO option portfolio and pay for performance sensitivity) and bank risks (using accounting and market based measures), my findings reveal significant shifts in the relation between compensation and bank risks during the financial crisis. Specifically, during the financial crisis, CEOs with more sensitive pay for performance were related to banks with greater capital risk, and banks with higher portfolio risk had CEOs with more sensitive pay for performance. Also, banks with greater total and unsystematic risks during the financial crisis had CEOs with less risk taking incentives. Other indicators during the financial crisis show that less stable banks had CEOs with less risk taking incentives, while banks with greater asset return risk had CEOs with less sensitive option portfolios. Overall, these results do not support the risk inducing incentives of bank CEO compensation especially during the financial crisis...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{quantify}} the potential cost of liquidity constraints {{on a long}} equity <b>portfolio</b> using the <b>liquidity</b> risk framework of Acerbi and Scandolo (2008). The model modifies the classical mark-to-market valuation model, and incorporates the impact of <b>liquidity</b> policies of <b>portfolios</b> on the <b>liquidity</b> adjustment valuation (LVA). Also, we suggest a quantitative indicator that scores market liquidity ranging from 0 to 1 (perfect <b>liquidity)</b> for a <b>portfolio</b> with possible <b>liquidity</b> constraints. The thesis consists of three major studies. In the first one, we compute LVA given the cash, minimum weight and portfolio expected shortfall (ES) liquidity policies on a long equity portfolio. Several numerical examples in the results demonstrate the importance associated the incorporation of the liquidity policy in the liquidity risk valuation. In the second study, we quantify the execution costs and the revenue risk when implementing trading strategies over multiple periods by employing the transaction costs measure of Garleanu and Pedersen (2013). The <b>portfolio</b> <b>liquidity</b> costs estimated from the model of Garleanu and Pedersen (2013) are compared with the costs estimated from the liquidity risk measure of Finger (2011). In the third study, we estimate the liquidity-adjusted portfolio ES for a long equity <b>portfolio</b> with the <b>liquidity</b> constraints. <b>Portfolio</b> pure market P&L scenarios are based on initial positions, and the liquidity adjustments are based on positions sold, which depend on the specified <b>liquidity</b> constraints. <b>Portfolio</b> pure market P&L scenarios and state-dependent liquidity adjustments are integrated to obtain liquidity-adjusted P&L scenarios. Then, we apply the liquidity score method (Meucci, 2012) on the liquidity-plus-market P&L distribution to quantify the market <b>liquidity</b> for the <b>portfolio.</b> The results show the importance of pricing liquidity risk with liquidity constraints.

40|$|In {{the light}} of the recent {{financial}} crisis, the discussion on the nature of runs and on the stabilizing role of liquidity holdings has intensified. This paper explores the cash management conducted by German open-end equity funds for the period between 2005 and 2010. Since ownership structures may have important consequences according to recent work, we distinguish funds whose shares are predominantly held by retail investors from funds with a stronger institutional orientation. Conditional on poor <b>portfolio</b> <b>liquidity,</b> we find that managers of permanently retail-oriented funds tend to move towards higher cash-to-asset positions. Cashbuilding intensities are found to be lower when illiquid funds are institutional-oriented or when the <b>portfolio</b> <b>liquidity</b> of retail-based funds is higher. The striking effort undertaken by poorly liquid funds with a lasting retail-orientation is likely to be linked to their exposure to the risk of strategic investor behavior at times of distress. We conclude that conditional on their liquidity status, these funds use cash as a device to provide for the ownership-related fragility of their funding base, thereby contributing to the self-stabilization of the financial system...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{systematic}} {{liquidity risk}} and short-term stock price reaction to large one-day price changes. We study 642 constituents of the FTSALL share index {{over the period}} from 1 st July 1992 to 29 th June 2007. We show that the US evidence of a priced systematic liquidity risk of Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) and Liu (2006) is not country-specific. Particularly, systematic liquidity risk is priced in the London Stock Exchange when Amihud's (2002) illiquidity ratio {{is used as a}} liquidity proxy. Given the importance of systematic liquidity risk in the asset pricing literature, we are interested in testing whether the different levels of systematic liquidity risk across stocks can explain the anomaly following large one-day price changes. Specifically, we expect that the stocks with high sensitivity to the fluctuations in aggregate market liquidity to be more affected by price shocks. We find that most liquid stocks react efficiently to price shocks, while the reactions of the least liquid stocks support the uncertain information hypothesis. However, we show that time-varying risk is more important than systematic liquidity risk in explaining the price reaction of stocks in different <b>liquidity</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Indeed, the time varying risk explains nearly all of the documented overreaction and underreaction following large one-day price changes. Our evidence suggests that the observed anomalies following large one-day price shocks are caused by the pricing errors arising from the use of static asset pricing models. In particular, the conditional asset pricing model of Harris et al. (2007), which allow both risk and return to vary systematically over time, explain most of the observed anomalies. This evidence supports the Brown et al. (1988) findings that both risk and return increase in a systematic fashion following price shocks.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} research within empirical {{financial economics}} with focus on <b>liquidity</b> and <b>portfolio</b> optimisation {{in the stock}} market. The discussion on liquidity is focused on measurement issues, including TAQ data processing and measurement of systematic liquidity factors (FSO). Furthermore, a framework for treatment of the two topics in combination is provided. The liquidity part of the thesis gives a conceptual background to liquidity and discusses several different approaches to liquidity measurement. It contributes to liquidity measurement by providing detailed guidelines on the data processing needed for applying TAQ data to liquidity research. The main focus, however, is the derivation of systematic liquidity factors. The principal component approach to systematic liquidity measurement is refined {{by the introduction of}} moving and expanding estimation windows, allowing for time-varying liquidity co-variances between stocks. Under several liability specifications, this improves the ability to explain stock liquidity and returns, as compared to static window PCA and market average approximations of systematic liquidity. The highest ability to explain stock returns is obtained when using inventory cost as a liquidity measure and a moving window PCA as the systematic liquidity derivation technique. Systematic factors of this setting also have a strong ability in explaining a cross-sectional <b>liquidity</b> variation. <b>Portfolio</b> optimisation in the FSO framework is tested in two empirical studies. These contribute to the assessment of FSO by expanding the applicability to stock indexes and individual stocks, by considering a wide selection of utility function specifications, and by showing explicitly how the full-scale optimum can be identified using either grid search or the heuristic search algorithm of differential evolution. The studies show that relative to mean-variance portfolios, FSO performs well in these settings and that the computational expense can be mitigated dramatically by application of differential evolution.
