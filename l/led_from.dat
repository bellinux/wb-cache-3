5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage and install a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that <b>led</b> <b>from</b> her dressing room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

5|$|Having {{arrived in}} Melbourne, O'Halloran was rested, along with Rose and Henricks, in the heats of the relay.

Australia <b>led</b> <b>from</b> the start and reached {{the midpoint of the}} race with a lead of 4.5s. Hamilton swam a very slow third leg of 2min 15.4s and conceded 8.8s to the British.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, {{a letter}} {{published}} in the Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch by William F.

The evaluation program included <b>LED</b> phototransistor opto-couplers <b>from</b> three sources, <b>LED</b> photoamplifier opto-couplers <b>from</b> a single source, and discrete infrared emitting <b>LEDs</b> <b>from</b> two sources. Environmental tests to evaluate device mechanical integrity included power cycling (10, 000 cycles), temperature cycling (500 cycles) and a sequence of monitored shock, monitored vibration and constant acceleration. Multiple temperature operating life tests were conducted at ambient temperatures between 25 C and 200 C. Opto-couplers were operated in both the 'on' and 'off' states during life testing...|$|R
5|$|In Roman Britain, {{what is now}} Ashford was {{the meeting}} point of two main roads. One <b>led</b> <b>from</b> London to Lympne (Lemanis), the other from the Weald, through Canterbury (Durovernum) and ending {{at the port of}} Richborough (Rutupiae). Ashford was one of the towns in Kent to become a hub when the roads were turnpiked {{in the second half of}} the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which <b>led</b> <b>from</b> the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{mouthparts}} show {{many examples}} of convergent evolution. The mouthparts of different insect groups consist {{of a set of}} homologous organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that insect group. Convergent evolution of many groups of insects <b>led</b> <b>from</b> original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the proboscis of flower-visiting insects such as bees and flower beetles, or the biting-sucking mouthparts of blood-sucking insects such as fleas and mosquitos.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Hamilton <b>led</b> <b>from</b> the start, {{preventing}} Fernando Alonso from overtaking at turn one. Alonso ran wide allowing Nick Heidfeld {{to overtake}} him {{and move into}} second place. Alonso damaged his car {{in the process and}} subsequently ran off the track at turn one a further three times during the race. Jenson Button had a gearbox problem {{at the start of the}} race and was unable to select first gear causing him stall on the grid. Christijan Albers started from pit lane. The first accident of the race involved Scott Speed who clipped the rear wing of Wurz' Williams and went into the hairpin with a broken suspension.|$|E
5|$|Methods to {{diagnose}} {{the likelihood of}} a patient with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 getting cancer were covered by patents owned or controlled by Myriad Genetics. Myriad's business model of exclusively offering the diagnostic test <b>led</b> <b>from</b> Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit.|$|E

5|$|The fort {{was linked}} to a jetty, Coalhouse Wharf, on the {{riverside}} a short distance to the south. A standard gauge railway track <b>led</b> <b>from</b> the fort's interior to the jetty and was used to bring guns and supplies from the wharf. The heaviest guns were transported to and from Coalhouse Fort (and other Thames forts) aboard two specialised gun barges called Gog and Magog, built in 1886 and 1900 respectively and used until the 1960s. The remains of the jetty are still visible, as are sections of the track within the fort's entrance.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{intended}} to be rigged as a three-masted schooner, like her half-sisters, but her first captain suggested that her fore- and mainmasts be square rigged to take advantage of her more seaworthy hull form. Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the depth of water under the keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that <b>led</b> <b>from</b> the gun deck through the bottom of the hull.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{enclosure}} ran the processional path, which <b>led</b> <b>from</b> the temple entrance {{through the main}} gate in {{the enclosure}} wall. The path was frequently decorated with sphinx statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could set it down to rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the exit point for the festival procession when it travelled by water. In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which {{was linked to the}} pyramid temple by the processional causeway.|$|E

5|$|A {{battle for}} the lead {{developed}} between Hamilton and Ricciardo, until the Australian moved around Hamilton on lap 15. With {{the grip of the}} intermediate tyres deteriorating, there were many overtaking manoeuvres on track. Rosberg unsuccessfully tried to overtake teammate Hamilton for second on lap 16, while Verstappen took sixth place from Vettel one lap later, only to run wide and lose the position again. On lap 18, Rosberg moved ahead of Hamilton, who {{was the first of the}} front runners to change tyres at the end of the lap, going for a dry compound. The other frontrunners followed suit over the next couple of laps. Following the pit stops, Ricciardo <b>led</b> <b>from</b> Rosberg, Kvyat and Hamilton. The two Mercedes drivers moved ahead of their respective Red Bull rivals on laps 22 and 23, while Vettel, now in fifth, closed on the leading quartet. On lap 24, he reached Kvyat and overtook him for fourth, while Nico Rosberg extended his lead to Ricciardo to nine seconds by lap 25. Hamilton took second place from Ricciardo one lap later. At the same time, Kimi Räikkönen was forced to retire. So had Massa on lap 24, suffering the same problem that had forced his teammate to stop.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} League Cup {{in the third}} round and were drawn at home to Rotherham United. Wenger handed midfielder Cesc Fàbregas his debut at 16 years and 177 days; as of 2016 is still the {{youngest}} player to turn out for the club. Arsenal <b>led</b> <b>from</b> the 11th minute through an Aliadière goal, but conceded an equaliser late on which forced extra time. Rotherham goalkeeper Mike Pollitt was sent off for handling the ball outside his penalty area; his substitute Gary Montgomery denied Wiltord from scoring the winner. As there were no further goals, the match was decided on penalties which Arsenal won 9–8 in the shootout. Fellow divisional opponents Wolverhampton Wanderers were defeated 5–1 by Arsenal in the fourth round; Vieira, absent through injury in September and October, made his first team return and played the full match.|$|E
5|$|Australia played its inaugural Test against New Zealand in Wellington, a {{match that}} was {{retrospectively}} given Test status. The uncertain {{status of the}} tour saw the players wearing blazers that were labelled ABC (Australian Board of Control), rather than the Australian coat of arms. Brown <b>led</b> <b>from</b> the front, topping the tour aggregates and averages, with 443 runs at 73.83 in five matches. In the opening tour match against Auckland, Brown elected to bat and opened with 68 as Australia amassed 579 and took victory by an innings and 180 runs. This {{was followed by a}} match against Canterbury in Christchurch, in which Brown top-scored with 137. This laid the foundation for a total of 8/415 and another innings victory. Brown made his second consecutive century in the third match against Otago at Carisbrook in Dunedin, again top-scoring with 106 in an eight-wicket victory. Brown made 34 in the final tour match as Australia defeated Wellington in another innings victory.|$|E
