This behavior was attributed to a preferential segregation of silica onto the outer surface, as evidenced by XPS analysis...|$|E
40|$|Organic-inorganic hybrid {{materials}} (also {{known as}} ceramers or phase-interconnected nanocomposites) were prepared starting with tetraethoxysilane and α,ω-triethoxysilane-terminated poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL-Si) using the sol-gel process. In all cases {{the formation of}} nanocomposites with a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpenetration</b> between PCL and SiO 2 phases was noted. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) slabs were dip-coated with PCL-Si/silica hybrids and a preferential segregation of silica on to the outer surface was found, together with a PCL-rich coating PMMA interface. In all cases, a marked reduction in both the average roughness and the apparent friction coefficient was noted {{with respect to the}} uncoated PMMA. All the PCL-Si/SiO 2 -coated samples showed a significant increase in flame resistance before and after UV irradiation, while improvements in the anti-scratch properties were noted only {{in the case of the}} PMMA coated with silica-rich ceramers...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{transparent}} and tough graft-interpenetrating polymer networks (graft-IPNs) were synthesized using an elastomeric polyurethane phase (PU) {{and a highly}} stiff acrylate-base copolymer phase. The grafting points between the two networks were generated {{with the purpose of}} minimizing the phase separation process of the polymeric systems. In order to generate the grafting between the networks, an acrylic resin capable of undergoing both free radical and poly-addition polymerization was employed. The thermo-mechanical properties, fracture toughness properties as well as network and surface phase morphology of the graft-IPNs synthesized were evaluated in this work. Data obtained suggested that the minimization of the phase separation was achieved by the generation of crosslinking points between both networks. High transparency was obtained in all samples as an indication of the high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpenetration</b> achieved. The relative high values obtained for the fracture toughness tests suggest that generating chemical crosslinks between networks is a good approach for increasing the fracture toughness of polymeric materials...|$|E
40|$|Written {{from the}} {{culmination}} point of exile in the universities of Denver and Yale, the two fictional autobiographies of Es’kia Mphahlele and Noel Chabani Manganyi mobilize reverie {{to hold in}} counterpoise the harsh reality of hostile home and exile. The article argues, through a reading of these texts via ideas of double consciousness and temporality, {{that we need to}} interpret reverie at the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interpenetration</b> <b>of</b> the subject and object as both counterpoint to and counterpart of the ‘I’ and ‘me’ of fictional autobiography. These fictional autobiographies are framed in the double temporality of the ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ of exile, the most powerful trope of which is the near-escapism of reverie itself in the course of fantasies of violence. The fictional autobiography of exile – what is here called the wilderness text – becomes a line of flight imbued with a worldliness (a being-in-the world) that puts the body at stake as it contemplates and solidifies existing reality by doubling its representational time by means of reverie...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{performance}} of an interactive virtual crowd system for entertainment purposes can be greatly improved by setting a level-of-details (LOD) strategy: in distant areas, collision avoidance {{can even be}} stealthy disabled to drastically speed-up simulation and to handle huge crowds. The greatest difficulty is then to select LODs to progressively simplify simulation in an imperceptible but efficient manner. The main objective of this work is to experimentally evaluate spectators' ability to detect the presence of collisions in simulations. Factors related to the conditions of observation and simulation are studied, such as the camera angles, distance to camera, <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpenetration</b> or crowd density. Our main contribution {{is to provide a}} LOD selection function resulting from two perceptual studies allowing crowd system designers to scale a simulation by relaxing the collision avoidance constraint in a least perceptible manner. The relaxation of this constraint is an important source for computational resources savings. Our results reveal several misconceptions in previously used LOD selection functions and suggest yet unexplored variables to be considered. We demonstrate our function efficiency over several evaluation scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Organic–inorganic hybrid {{materials}} were prepared through the sol–gel approach starting from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), as silica precursor, and triethoxysilane terminated polymers; before gelling the solutions {{were applied to}} polyethylene (PE) films and slabs by spin-coating, without any previous surface pre-treatment of the substrate, and finally the coatings were thermally cured at 60 °C for 24 h. Among the various polymers used to prepare the coatings, only polyethylene-b-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers gave good results in terms of adhesion to the PE substrates, and hybrid coatings with different organic–inorganic ratios were prepared. As suggested by visual inspection and SEM investigation, and confirmed by the critical loads derived from scratch tests, a good adhesion of the coating to the PE substrates was obtained, {{probably due to the}} presence of PE segments in the organic phase of the coating. Transparency as well as SEM and DSC data were in agreement with the formation of a nanostructured hybrid coating, with a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpenetration</b> between organic and inorganic domains. It was also observed that these hybrid coatings are able to improve significantly the scratch resistance and slightly increase the wettability with respect to uncoated PE. This approach to the surface-properties modification of PE appears as a simple and convenient method for the functionalization of PE substrates...|$|E
40|$|The olive fly, Bactrocera oleae, is {{the most}} {{important}} pest affecting the olive industry, to which it is estimated to cause average annual losses in excess of one billion dollars. As with other insects with a wide distribution, it is generally accepted that the understanding of B. oleae population structure and dynamics is fundamental for the design and implementation of effective monitoring and control strategies. However, and despite important advances in the past decade, a clear picture of B. oleae's population structure is still lacking. In the Medi-terranean basin, where more than 95 % of olive production is concentrated, evidence from several studies suggests the existence of three distinct sub-populations, but the geographi-cal limits of their distributions, and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpenetration</b> and gene flow among them remain ill-characterized. Here we use mitochondrial haplotype analysis to show that one of the Mediterranean mitochondrial lineages displays geographically correlated substructure and demonstrate that Italic populations, though markedly distinct from their Iberian and Le-vantine counterparts are more diverse than previously described. Finally, we show that this distinction does not result from extant hypothetical geographic limits imposed by the Alps or the Pyrenees nor, more generally, does it result from any sharp boundary, as intermixing is observed in a broad area, albeit at variable levels. Instead, Bayesian phylogeographic anal-ysis suggests the interplay between isolation-mediated differentiation during glacial periods and bi-directional dispersal and population intermixing in the interglacials has {{played a major role in}} shaping current olive fly population structure...|$|E
40|$|Trade {{policy is}} {{commonly}} {{understood as the}} product of competition between export-oriented and import-competing interests. The politics that has emerged early in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations, however, reflects a very different cleavage. Transatlantic alliances of transnational firms have emerged as the champions of a far-reaching agreement, while a variety of civic interest groups have formed the principal opposition. This paper contends this distinctive pattern of trade politics is primarily the product of the distinctive degree <b>of</b> <b>interpenetration</b> between the American and European economies. The high-level <b>of</b> <b>interpenetration</b> means that much of transatlantic economic exchange occurs through trade within firms or global value chains or through foreign affiliate sales, which dramatically reducing firm opposition to trade liberalization. The high degree <b>of</b> <b>interpenetration,</b> reflected in generally low tariffs, means that the principle obstacles to trade lie in regulatory differences. Concern about the deregulatory potential of the talks has spurred civic interest engagement. It speculates that misunderstanding the implications of the character of transatlantic economic exchange contributed to the gap between the early expectations of a swift, ambitious deal and more recent assessments of a protracted and limited agreement...|$|R

Extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations {{have been carried out}} on (i) an isolated PG 4 chain and (ii) ten dimers formed by two PG 4 chains associated with different degrees <b>of</b> <b>interpenetration.</b> Results indicate that the amount of nitrogen atoms involved in hydrogen bonding is [similar] 11 % while [similar] 15 % of aromatic groups participate in π,π-interactions. Furthermore, in both cases intramolecular interactions clearly dominate over intermolecular ones, while exhibiting markedly different behaviors. Specifically, the amount of intramolecular hydrogen bonds increases when the <b>interpenetration</b> <b>of</b> the two chains decreases, whereas intramolecular π,π-interactions remain practically insensitive to the amount <b>of</b> <b>interpenetration.</b> In contrast, the strength of the corresponding two types of intermolecular interactions decreases with interpenetration.

This would only be the case when the distance between activities is smaller than the distance that a neutrally evolving population can cover.
