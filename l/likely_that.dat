5|$|It is {{not known}} whether Eorpwald was baptised in East Anglia, Northumbria or Kent, {{but it is very}} <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Edwin, now the senior ruler, was present as his sponsor. Higham {{suggests}} that {{because of the lack of}} proper facilities in East Anglia, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> he was baptised by Paulinus at Edwin's centre of authority in Northumbria. The manner of Eorpwald's conversion indicated that he was a subordinate king and that Edwin was his overlord.|$|E

5|$|Such long-distance {{high-speed}} railways are {{not included}} in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010–2040, and it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> railways Hamar–Trondheim and Drammen–Kristansand will be built first since they are easier to build. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> a high-speed railway to Bergen will be built sometime in the period 2030–2060.|$|E
5|$|A {{commercial}} document from 30 January 1359, which testifies to John's continuing {{trade relations with}} Venice, is chronologically the last reference to his activity in contemporary sources. While the date of his death was not recorded, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> John perished during the plague epidemic which hit Valona and Durazzo (today Durrës) in 1363.|$|E
40|$|Institutions affect key {{dimensions}} {{of the political process}} –policy, stability, and conflict. The choice of institutions is thus consequential. I argue that transition modes affect the choice of institutions in predictable and systematic ways. The more balanced power is between the two main bargaining forces –regime elite and opposition– the <b>likelier</b> <b>that</b> the resulting institutions will be pluralistic. Contrarily, the more unbalanced power is in favour of regime elites vis a vis the opposition, the <b>likelier</b> <b>that</b> institutions will be majoritarian. The argument is tested for El Salvador and Guatemala...|$|R

50|$|Königstein had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention in 1215, making it <b>likelier</b> <b>that</b> the castle was {{built around the}} 12th century for the town's - and the Frankfurt-Cologne commercial road's - security.|$|R
5|$|According to Dio Cassius, he inflicted genocidal depredations on {{the natives}} and {{incurred}} {{the loss of}} 50,000 of his own men to the attrition of guerrilla tactics, although it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> these figures are a significant exaggeration.|$|E
5|$|Almost any {{substance}} containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> many cultures, on {{observing that}} a sweet liquid {{could be obtained}} from a source of starch, independently invented beer. Bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies {{and contributed to the}} building of civilisations.|$|E
5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it did, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with supersonic speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it was probably a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E

5|$|Asser recounts meeting Alfred {{first at}} the royal estate at Dean, Sussex (now East and West Dean, West Sussex). Asser {{provides}} only one datable event in his history: on St Martin's Day, 11 November 887, Alfred decided {{to learn to read}} Latin. Working backwards from this, it appears most <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Asser was recruited by Alfred in early 885.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of darts in many superfamilies of the Stylommatophora, it seems <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> love darts appeared during the early evolution of the Pulmonata, and that the ancestors of the Stylommatophora possessed darts already.|$|E

50|$|Gordia, wife of Philippicus. She {{reportedly}} {{constructed a}} monastery dedicated to Mammes of Caesarea.

5|$|Ecgberht {{was buried}} in Winchester, as were his son, Æthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder. During the ninth century, Winchester began {{to show signs of}} urbanisation, and it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the {{sequence}} of burials indicates that Winchester was held in high regard by the West Saxon royal line.|$|E
5|$|Excavation has {{revealed}} remnants of oak, {{some of it}} from trees hundreds of years old. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> this came from various sources; some from nearby, and some donated from the forests at Delamere and Macclesfield. The church and monastic buildings were constructed in Romanesque style.|$|E
5|$|In his Autobiography, the Romanian philosopher Mircea Eliade {{indicated}} that it was <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> his ancestors, whose original surname was Ieremia, had adopted the new name {{as a tribute to}} Heliade Rădulescu, whom they probably admired.|$|E
50|$|Israelization {{has been}} noted amongst the Druze {{community}} in Israel. One study noted a trend whereas the post-1950 Druze generation the younger the generation is, the <b>likelier</b> <b>that</b> there is a preference for Hebrew instead of Arabic with many younger druze using social media having a near absence of arabic usage amongst other druze peers.|$|R

5|$|It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Hoffmann did as most chemists {{have always}} done, {{starting}} {{by studying the}} literature and recreating the published methods. On 10 August 1897 (according to his laboratory notebooks), Hoffmann found a better method for making ASA, from salicylic acid refluxed with acetic anhydride.|$|E
