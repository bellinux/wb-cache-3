5|$|Artificial trees made of goose {{feathers}} were {{in use in}} American homes {{since the}} 1880s. In the 1930s, however, The Addis Brush Company, an American toilet bowl brush manufacturer, began making artificial trees of green-dyed bristles and then supplied the British (who suffered a dearth of wild trees) with thousands of artificial trees in the post-War years. Americans took <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Addis artificial trees and remained loyal to real trees.|$|E

He had an unsuccessful American football try-out with the San Francisco 49ers, hoping to emulate Renaldo Nehemiah. He drifted {{on to the}} celebrity circuit, appearing on British reality television series Hell's Kitchen in May 2004. However, Chambers had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> show and soon chose to leave. He appeared in neither sporting events nor television programs for 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{paid for}} his middle nephew's {{business}} classes at the Academy of Commerce until his 1912 graduation, and arranged his hiring by the stock exchange soon after. Unlike his older brother Imre, {{who worked at the}} exchange in Budapest for all his life, Kertész had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. He was drawn to illustrated magazines and to activities like fishing and swimming in the Danube River near his uncle's property.|$|E

5|$|Broder Lysholm Knudtzon (5 October 178820 March 1864) was a Norwegian merchant, {{politician}} and benefactor. Born {{into one of}} Trondheim's wealthiest mercantile families, he travelled to England where he developed a great admiration of English language and literature. Despite his commercial background he was more drawn towards the fields of politics, culture and art. He nevertheless administrated his father's family firm, acting as foreign correspondent with <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> everyday business. In England he befriended Lord Byron and came {{under the influence of}} the English national liberal movement. Prior to his death, he bequeathed his entire library and several artworks to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.|$|E
5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subject. However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E
5|$|That's why I say {{the players}} didn't stab the ACB in the back. The administrators had {{numerous}} opportunities {{to reach a}} compromise but displayed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> welfare of the players. It wasn't really surprising then that more than 50 players {{from around the world}} signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born. About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman's tight-fisted approach to the ACB's money.|$|E

5000|$|His {{prints are}} mainly {{concerned}} with the figures, which often occupy most of the picture space. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who adopted the extensive landscape backgrounds pioneered by Albrecht Dürer, he is, like Mantegna, relatively <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> backgrounds, which are often blank or very simple. According to Sheehan [...] "he never achieves a true unity between figures and setting, as do the more advanced masters of the 16th century".|$|R

5|$|With {{the area}} around Woking by this time heavily populated, the LNC's land {{holdings}} had become an extremely valuable asset, and from 1955 onwards the LNC became a target for repeated hostile takeover bids from property speculators. In January 1959 the Alliance Property Company announced the successful takeover of the London Necropolis Company, bringing over a century of independence to an end. Alliance Property was a property company with <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> funeral business, and the income from burials was insufficient to maintain the cemetery grounds. Brookwood Cemetery went into decline and the cemetery began to revert to wilderness. This trend continued under a succession of further owners.|$|E
5|$|A speaker for the Anti-Saloon League, Barkley co-{{sponsored}} the 1916 Sheppard–Barkley Act which banned alcohol {{sales in}} Washington, D.C. It {{was passed in}} 1917. He sponsored {{an amendment to the}} Lever Food and Fuel Act forbidding the use of grain – rendered scarce by World War I and a poor harvest in 1916 – to make alcoholic beverages. The amendment passed the House, but a conference committee amended it to allow production of beer and wine. Both measures increased Barkley's national visibility and set the stage for future prohibition legislation, including the Eighteenth Amendment. By 1917, the state Democratic Party was divided over prohibition, and the prohibitionist faction tried to enlist Barkley for the 1919 gubernatorial race. The Memphis Commercial Appeal noted in late 1917 that Barkley had not declined the invitations, but his continued silence reduced the prohibitionists' enthusiasm. He also showed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> faction's attempts to recruit him to challenge incumbent anti-prohibition Senator Ollie James in the 1917 Democratic primary.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen {{was born}} in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990, to Sigrun Øen, a {{chemical}} engineer and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant. The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14. His father taught him to play chess {{at the age of}} 5, although he initially showed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. He has three sisters, and in 2010 he stated {{that one of the things}} that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, {{he made no}} lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably well in his classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, he seldom visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E
5|$|He {{also played}} in the Taranaki side that was only {{narrowly}} beaten by the touring Australians in 1913. His form in these games earned him a place with the All Blacks. On 6September 1913, he {{played in the}} 30–5 first test win over Australia at Athletic Park: Albert Downing and George Sellars played alongside him and were also later killed in action in the First World War. Dewar was then selected, along with four other Taranaki players, for the tour of North America, playing in 14 of the 16 games, including the 51–3 victory over the All America team for his second test cap. He received particular mention in the test match for a cunning dummy pass to Downing on his right, drawing the defence and passing to five-eighths McKenzie on his left to run in for a try. He scored just one try. There was <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American press about the tour. A single short paragraph in the New-York Tribune reports on the 51–3 defeat of the USA team on 15November.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{there was}} <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{cultivation}} of Australian plants until the mid-20th century, despite a long-standing appreciation of their beauty as wildflowers. For example, in 1933 and 1934 The Western Mail published {{a series of}} Edgar Dell paintings of Western Australian wildflowers, including a painting of B.sessilis. These were subsequently republished in Charles Gardner's 1935 West Australian Wild Flowers. One of the first published colour photographs of the species appeared in William Blackall's 1954 How to know Western Australian wildflowers, but this publication was restricted to plant identification. The species was discussed and illustrated in the 1959 Wildflowers of Western Australia, and in the 1973 Flowers and plants of Western Australia, but these books did not provide cultivation advice either.|$|E
60|$|Now, for his {{own sake}} and for Rome's sake, Pilate {{did not want to}} execute him. Pilate was <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{fisherman}} and greatly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> peace and order. What cared Pilate for a man's life?--for many men's lives? The school of Rome was iron, and the governors sent out by Rome to rule conquered peoples were likewise iron. Pilate thought and acted in governmental abstractions. Yet, look: when Pilate went out scowling to meet the mob that had fetched the fisherman, he fell immediately under the charm of the man.|$|R
60|$|During {{the whole}} time we had been speaking, Mrs. Sherwin had looked at us with far more earnestness and {{attention}} than I had ever seen her display before. Even her languid faculties seemed susceptible of active curiosity {{on the subject of}} Mr. Mannion--the more so, perhaps, from her very dislike of him. Margaret had moved her chair into the background, while her father was talking; and was apparently <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> topic under discussion. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first interval of silence, she complained of headache, and asked leave to retire to her room.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, Sony Music {{has shown}} <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{releasing}} <b>the</b> title on DVD <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US, possibly {{due to the}} age of the concert as well as Gilmour's own dislike of About Face as an album.|$|R
5|$|In the {{meantime}} the Knights were buying lands in Prussia. In May 1392, von Wallenrode began negotiations with Sigismund of Hungary to buy Neumark for 500,000 guldens. Negotiations fell apart {{as the title}} to the land was contested by several dukes. The Neumark purchase was closed with Jobst of Moravia only in 1402. During July 1392, the Knights agreed to pay Władysław Opolczyk 50,000 guldens for the Dobrzyń Land, which had been contested among Piast dukes since 1377. Opolczyk, the ruler of Opole in Silesia, had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> volatile regions to his north. In 1392, he circulated a proposal to partition Poland among the Teutonic Knights, the Holy Roman Empire, Silesia, and Hungary, but it was rejected. These purchases by the Knights threatened Poland's northern borders.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E
5|$|A major {{influence}} on Ueshiba's early education was his elementary schoolteacher Tasaburo Nasu, {{who was a}} Shinto priest and who introduced Ueshiba to the religion. At {{the age of six}} Ueshiba was sent to study at the Jizōderu Temple, but had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rote learning of Confucian education. However, his schoolmaster Mitsujo Fujimoto was also a priest of Shingon Buddhism, and taught the young Ueshiba some of the esoteric chants and ritual observances of the sect, which Ueshiba found intriguing. His interest in Buddhism was sufficiently great that his mother considered enrolling him in the priesthood, but his father Yoroku vetoed the idea. Ueshiba went to Tanage Higher Elementary School and then to Tanabe Prefectural Middle School, but left formal education in his early teens, enrolling instead at a private abacus academy, the Yoshida Institute, to study accountancy. On graduating from the academy, he worked at a local tax office for a few months, but the job did not suit him and in 1901 he left for Tokyo, funded by his father. Ueshiba Trading, the stationery business which he opened there, was short-lived; unhappy with life in the capital, he returned to Tanabe {{less than a year later}} after suffering a bout of beri-beri. Shortly thereafter he married his childhood acquaintance Hatsu Itokawa.|$|E
25|$|The Elements {{is mainly}} a systematization of earlier {{knowledge}} of geometry.
