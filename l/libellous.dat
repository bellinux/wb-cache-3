He ensured that <b>libellous</b> writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death. Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for satire {{at the expense of the}} government. Consequently, he forbade mimes from appearing on stage in public.|$|E

5|$|The {{ban on the}} NSDAP {{was lifted}} in early 1928, {{in time for the}} Reichstag elections, held on 20 May. Results were poor, with the NSDAP losing nearly 100,000 voters and earning only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they {{attained}} only 1.4 per cent of the vote. Goebbels was one of twelve NSDAP members to gain election to the Reichstag. This gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Weiß. The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for <b>libellous</b> material he had placed in Der Angriff {{over the course of the}} previous year.|$|E
5|$|Throughout this period, but {{particularly}} {{in the middle of}} the 18th century, the Bastille was used by the police to suppress the trade in illegal and seditious books in France. In the 1750s, 40% of those sent to the Bastille were arrested for their role in manufacturing or dealing in banned material; in the 1760s, the equivalent figure was 35%. Seditious writers were also often held in the Bastille, although many of the more famous writers held in the Bastille during the period were formally imprisoned for more anti-social, rather than strictly political, offences. In particular, many of those writers detained under Louis XVI were imprisoned for their role in producing illegal pornography, rather than political critiques of the regime. The writer Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle, the philosopher André Morellet and the historian Jean-François Marmontel, for example, were formally detained not for their more obviously political writings, but for <b>libellous</b> remarks or for personal insults against leading members of Parisian society.|$|E

When it finally did, the justices suggested they would clarify once and for all the extent to which opinions could be expressed without fear of being held <b>libellous.</b> The actual decision, however, was regarded as having confused the issue somewhat instead. Several state courts have responded by recognizing an opinion privilege in some way in their own jurisprudence.|$|E
25|$|November 2008, BSkyB paid {{substantial}} undisclosed libel {{damages to}} Robert Murat {{in relation to}} their reporting of the abduction of Madeleine McCann.

Sky News also falsely accused Murat of misleading journalists into thinking he was working for the police. An apology was also placed on the Sky News website, the <b>libellous</b> material removed and Murat's costs were paid.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July 2008 the Malaysian {{police have}} {{obtained}} a warrant of arrest against Raja Petra for criminal defamation. This {{is due to}} his statutory declaration connecting Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s wife, Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, saying she was present when Mongolian national Altantunya Shaariibuu’s body was blown up. On 17 July, Raja Petra was charged with three counts of criminal intimidation over his statutory declaration on the murder of Mongolian translator Altantuya Shaariibuu. He {{is alleged to have}} defamed Deputy Prime Minister's wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor by making a <b>libellous</b> statement in the declaration which he affirmed on 18 June when he knew that it would tarnish her good name. He also faced similar charges against Kolonel Norhayati Hassan and her husband Acting Kolonel Abdul Aziz Buyong.|$|E
25|$|On 29 September, after a Qassam rocket hit the Israeli town of Sderot {{and killed}} two Israeli children, the IDF {{launched}} Operation Days of Penitence {{in the north}} of the Gaza Strip. The operation's stated aim was to remove the threat of Qassam rockets from Sderot and kill the Hamas militants launching them. The operation ended on 16 October, leaving widespread destruction and more than 100 Palestinians dead, at least 20 of whom were under the age of 16. Thirteen-year-old Iman Darweesh Al Hams was killed by the IDF when she strayed into a closed military area: the commander was accused of allegedly firing his automatic weapon at her dead body deliberately to verify the death. The act was investigated by the IDF, but the commander was cleared of all wrongdoing, and more recently, was fully vindicated when a Jerusalem district court found the claim to be <b>libellous,</b> ruled that NIS 300,000 be paid by the journalist and TV company responsible for the report, an additional NIS 80,000 to be paid in legal fees and required the journalist and television company to air a correction. According to Palestinian medics, Israeli forces killed at least 62 militants and 42 other Palestinians believed to be civilians. According to a count performed by Haaretz, 87 militants and 42 civilians were killed. Palestinian refugee camps were heavily damaged by the Israeli assault. The IDF announced that at least 12 Qassam launchings had been thwarted and many terrorists hit during the operation.|$|E

500|$|The law {{dealing with}} seditious libel was {{particularly}} strict. Acting as [...] "the government's chief weapon against criticism", it followed principles {{laid down in}} De Libellis Famosis and R v Carr: that seditious libel was a criminal offence, that {{the intention of the}} publisher or the truth of the allegations was irrelevant, that mere publication was sufficient for a conviction, and that juries were only allowed to deliver a verdict on whether the material had been published by the defendant, not whether it was <b>libellous.</b> Traditionally, matters of fact were left to the jury and matters of law to the judge, but with seditious libel [...] "matters of law" [...] was construed very widely; it was the judge's job to decide if the material was <b>libellous,</b> what constituted [...] "seditious libel", and the nature of [...] "publication", which was understood to include almost anything. Even a private letter, if intercepted, could lead to a prosecution.|$|E
500|$|Shipley {{was tried}} in 1784 by Mr Justice Buller and a {{specially}} convened jury at Shrewsbury. Edward Bearcroft, {{counsel for the}} prosecution, argued that {{on the basis of}} the existing system the jury could not decide on the nature of the pamphlet, while Erskine argued not only that they could, but that the material did not constitute seditious libel, containing as it did [...] "a solemn protest against all sedition". Persuaded by Erskine's arguments, the jury ruled that Shipley was neither [...] "guilty" [...] or [...] "not guilty", but instead [...] "guilty of publication only", a confusing and non-standard ruling which, after a long dialogue, Mr Justice Buller declared to mean [...] "guilty on all charges". Erskine appealed the decision to the Court of King's Bench on 8 November, where the judges again ruled that juries could not decide whether material was <b>libellous,</b> but nevertheless released Shipley on a technicality; his freedom was greeted with fireworks and bonfires, and Erskine was rewarded with the Freedom of the City of Gloucester. Still seeking to reform the law, Erskine sent the court records to Charles James Fox and Lord Camden, who, after much effort, passed the Libel Act 1792, which secured the right of juries to decide whether material was <b>libellous.</b>|$|E
500|$|Edward Bearcroft, lead {{counsel for}} the prosecution, {{described}} the Dialogue as libel and argued that {{the truth of this}} was not a question for the jury to decide on; they were bound to convict the defendant as long as they decided that he had published the Dialogue, regardless of the contents. Those contents, Bearcroft went on, sought to persuade the public that [...] "every man of age had a right to choose his own representative in Parliament". Erskine, in his reply, argued that the Dialogue was not <b>libellous</b> (it opened with a preface containing [...] "a solemn protest against all sedition"), and insisted that the jury had the right to decide what constituted libel: ...|$|E

John Wilkes fought Samuel Martin in 1772, as did Richard Brinsley Sheridan with Captain Thomas Mathews over the latter's <b>libellous</b> {{comments}} about Sheridan's fiancee Elizabeth Ann Linley. Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow fought Andrew Stuart in a Hyde Park duel in 1770.

500|$|Erskine {{immediately}} {{appealed the}} decision to the Court of King's Bench, where he argued on 8 November that Buller's statement had misdirected the jury, and that as the jury was traditionally not given the right to investigate Shipley's actual guilt, the previous trial was invalid; a jury {{should be permitted to}} determine not only whether a statement was published, but whether it was <b>libellous.</b> With the exception of Mr Justice Wiles, the court unanimously declared that Erskine's arguments were incorrect, and that the jury had no such role; accordingly, his appeal was denied. Shipley was, however, later freed when the King's Bench held that the initial indictment had been invalid because [...] "there were no averments to point the application of the paper as a libel on the king and government".|$|E

The pseudonymous [...] "Martin Marprelate" [...] tracts, which attacked conformist clergy with a <b>libellous</b> humorous tone, outraged senior Puritan clergy and set the government on an unsuccessful attempt to run the writer to earth.

500|$|Due to his immense {{popularity}} {{during his}} lifetime, Holmes was {{often called upon}} to produce commemorative poetry for specific occasions, including memorials, anniversaries and birthdays. Referring to this demand for his attention, he once wrote that he was [...] "a florist in verse, and what would people say / If I came to a banquet without my bouquet?" [...] As critic Hyatt Waggoner noted, however, [...] "very little... survives the occasions that produced it". Holmes became known as a poet who expressed the benefits of loyalty and trust at serious gatherings, as well as one who showed wit at festivities and celebrations. Edwin Percy Whipple for one considered Holmes to be [...] "a poet of sentiment and passion. Those who know him only as a comic lyricist, as the <b>libellous</b> laureate of chirping follow and presumptuous egotism, would be surprised at the clear sweetness and skylark thrill of his serious and sentimental compositions".|$|E
500|$|Because {{of public}} disquiet with these principles, Shipley's trial {{acted as a}} [...] "test case" [...] for the law of seditious libel; a Society for Constitutional Information was formed by {{concerned}} citizens and began raising {{money to pay for}} his defence. Able to afford the best representation, the society gave the brief to Thomas Erskine KC, a noted defence barrister. The trial was to be heard by Lord Kenyon, then Chief Justice of Chester, at Wrexam; after travelling 200 miles to the court Erskine discovered that a paper had been circulated in the area arguing that in libel cases juries were allowed to decide whether a publication was <b>libellous,</b> as well as whether it had been published. Citing the paper's circulation, the prosecution asked for a postponement; ignoring claims that a delay would cause Shipley hardship, Kenyon agree to postpone the trial. The case was eventually heard on 6 August 1784 by Mr Justice Buller, at Shrewsbury.|$|E
500|$|On 19 December 1769, Junius wrote {{a letter}} attacking the King, and incensed at this, the {{government}} ordered several people to be arrested and tried for seditious libel, including Woodfall for publishing the letters, John Almon for selling them, and John Miller for republishing them. Almon's case was heard at Westminster Hall by Mansfield and a jury on 2 June 1770. He was found guilty, although it is unclear in what fashion he was punished, if at all. [...] Woodfall was tried on 13 June 1770, by Mansfield and a jury. While Mansfield believed that the language used was <b>libellous,</b> the jury disagreed, and held that he was [...] "guilty of printing and publishing only", and innocent of seditious libel. Miller was tried on 13 July 1770, and after six hours of discussion, the jury found him innocent. As {{a result of these}} two trials, it became clear that no jury would convict a printer for printing these letters, leaving Junius free to continue publishing them.|$|E
500|$|The Case of the Dean of St Asaph, {{formally}} R v Shipley, was the 1784 {{trial of}} William Davies Shipley, the Dean of St Asaph, for seditious libel. In {{the aftermath of}} the American War of Independence, electoral reform had become a substantial issue, and William Pitt the Younger attempted to bring a Bill before Parliament to reform the electoral system. In its support Shipley republished a pamphlet written by his brother-in-law, Sir William Jones, which noted the defects of the existing system and argued in support of Pitt's reforms. Thomas FitzMaurice, the brother [...] of British Prime Minister [...] Earl of Shelburne, reacted by indicting Shipley for seditious libel, a criminal offence which acted as [...] "the government's chief weapon against criticism", since merely publishing something that an individual judge interpreted as libel was enough for a conviction; a jury was prohibited from deciding whether the material was actually <b>libellous.</b> The law was widely seen as unfair, and a Society for Constitutional Information was formed to pay Shipley's legal fees. With financial backing from the society Shipley was able to secure the services of Thomas Erskine KC as his barrister.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of 11 April, Lennon, Harrison and Mardas sat up late {{discussing}} their views of the Maharishi and {{decided to leave the}} next morning. They packed hurriedly, while Mardas went to Dehradun to find taxis. Lennon was chosen to speak to the Maharishi. When asked why they were leaving, Lennon replied [...] "If you're so cosmic, you'll know why". Paul Mason, a biographer of the Maharishi, later interpreted Lennon's statement as a challenge to the Maharishi's claim of cosmic consciousness. Lennon said that his mind was made up when the Maharishi gave him a murderous look in response. According to Mardas: [...] "John Lennon and I went to the Maharishi about what had happened... he asked the Maharishi to explain himself"; and the Maharishi answered Lennon's accusation by saying, [...] "I am only human".

[...] While waiting for Mardas to return, Lennon wrote the song [...] "Maharishi", which was later renamed [...] "Sexy Sadie" [...] because Harrison advised Lennon that was potentially <b>libellous.</b> According to Harrison, Lennon [...] "had wanted to leave anyway" [...] and this gave him a [...] "good reason to get out." ...|$|E
