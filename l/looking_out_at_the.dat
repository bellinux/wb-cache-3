Frost thanks Nixon for the interviews and Nixon, graciously admitting defeat, thanks Frost in return and wishes him well, privately {{adding that he}} has no recollection of calling Frost while drunk. He also for the first time addresses Frost by his first name. Nixon watches Frost and Caroline Cushing leave and then leans over a railing of his villa, <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sunset.|$|E
25|$|At Taormina {{they check}} into the San Domenico Palace Hotel where Sandro's {{employer}} Ettore {{and his wife}} Patrizia are preparing for a party. Claudia decides not to attend because she's tired. At the party Sandro checks out the womenâ€”recognizing the beautiful aspiring actress Gloria Perkins. Back in the room Claudia is unable to sleep. Noticing that Sandro has not yet returned, she goes downstairs to Patrizia's room to inquire about Sandro. Claudia confesses that she's afraid Anna has returned and that Sandro will return to her. After searching the hotel, Claudia finally discovers Sandro having sex with Gloria Perkins on a couch. Claudia runs off, and Sandro follows her onto the hotel terrace where he finds her quietly weeping. Sandro sits down on a bench and says nothing; he too begins to cry. Claudia approaches him, and after hesitating, she places {{her hand on his}} head in a gesture of compassion and comfort while <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> snow-covered image of Mount Etna on the horizon.|$|E
500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled {{at the top of}} my voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred on the side of caution by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a symbol}} of the tension between the writing {{imagination}} and the constraint of one's environment, the tower has appeared in the writings of many other writers than Montaigne. For instance, [...] "Montaigne's Tower" [...] is the title of a poem by Geoffrey Grigson, published in the 1984 collection Montaigne's Tower and Other Poems. It probes the relation between the writer, his immediate environment, and the compass of his imagination by imaging Montaigne at work in his library and <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> countryside surrounding the castle after asking its initial question: ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing for The London Review of Books in February 2017, Michael Wood {{characterized}} {{the film as}} a study of an inherited intergenerational tragedy. He wrote: [...] " [...] there are still ten minutes of late Ingmar Bergman to go. The film keeps showing us Chiron's handsome, inscrutable face. The silence doesn't tell us anything, it just asks us {{to feel sorry for}} him... All is not lost, though, because as we gaze at Chiron, we can think of something else: his resemblance to Juan (his father figure). Does it mean that Juan was once a Chiron... Not quite that perhaps, but the last shot of the film is of the young Chiron sitting on the beach... <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ocean... His wide eyes suggest all the desolation and promise that Juan saw in him at the beginning. If we started again, would things be different?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Late Antique evangelist portraits often show {{standing}} figures, as in {{the ivory}} panels of the Throne of Maximianus in Milan, but from the Insular art of the 7th to 10th centuries, evangelist portraits in manuscripts nearly always closely followed the seated classical models, showing the Evangelists at full-length, either <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer or writing at a table or desk and seen at an oblique angle. [...] These were derived from unknown classical prototypes, {{similar to those in}} the Codex Amiatinus and Saint Augustine Gospels, though both of these types are rather different from the general types. [...] Usually a setting is provided for the figure. [...] Details of the classical models, such as anachronistic scrolls and scroll-boxes, and a small writing-stand with a single dolphin-shaped support (see gallery below), survive well into the Middle Ages, sometimes clearly misunderstood by the artists concerned. Perhaps because of the secular origins of the typology, haloes {{are less likely to be}} worn than in other types of image. [...] The level of detail shown in the furniture and fittings is unusual for Early Medieval art. [...] An arch behind the author, often with curtains hanging across it, in some examples close to the classical models, gradually is turned into a decorative framing device for the whole scene.|$|E

2500|$|The 6th-century mosaic {{panels in}} the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna of the Emperor Justinian I and Empress Theodora with courtiers {{are not of}} the type showing the ruler {{receiving}} divine approval, but each show one of the imperial couple standing confidently {{with a group of}} attendants, <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer. [...] Their scale and composition are alone among large-scale survivals. [...] Also in Ravenna, there is a small mosaic of Justinian, possibly originally of Theoderic the Great in the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo. [...] In the Early Middle Ages, a group of mosaic portraits in Rome of Popes who had commissioned the building or rebuilding of the churches containing them show standing figures holding models of the building, usually among a group of saints. [...] Gradually these traditions worked their way down the social scale, especially in illuminated manuscripts, [...] where they are often owner portraits, as the manuscripts were retained for use by the person commissioning them. [...] For example, a chapel at Mals in [...] South Tyrol has two fresco donor figures from before 881, one lay and the other of a tonsured cleric holding a model building. [...] In subsequent centuries bishops, abbots and other clergy were the donors most commonly shown, other than royalty, and they remained prominently represented in later periods.|$|E
