The post-1937 body has been criticised on a number of grounds, including claims that it is weak and dominated by the Government of the day.

Shortly afterwards the project was given the cover name The Environment Roadshow. A production office was opened for the project {{in the first week of}} September 1992 with shooting planned for January–February 1993. The script was sent to Peter Cregeen on 22 March 1993, indicating at the same time that Graeme Harper was being looked at as a potential director for the special.

By the end of May 1993, the project was now being referred to as The Dark Dimension before a new working title of Lost in the Dark Dimension was settled on.
