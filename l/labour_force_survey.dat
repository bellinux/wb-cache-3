Mitton and Aspinall also argue that logistic regression analysis of LFS data from 2003, 2006 and 2009 indicates that an ethnic penalty existed for Somalis even after other factors impacting employment, like English language proficiency, work experience, health, age, religion and marital status, had been taken into consideration.|$|E

25|$|The Somali-born {{population}} of the UK includes {{a disproportionate number of}} females in comparison with the general population. Analysis of data from the <b>Labour</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Survey</b> by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggests that 61 per cent of the Somali-born population in 2006/07 was female. Of the 101,370 Somali-born residents of England and Wales recorded by the 2011 Census, 57,042 (56.3 per cent) were female. The equivalent figure for the UK as a whole from the previous census, held in 2001, was 54 per cent. Expressed as a sex ratio, the 2011 figure suggests that there were 78 Somali-born men per 100 Somali-born women, compared to the overall sex ratio for England and Wales of 97 men per 100 women.|$|E
2500|$|Levels of {{education}} amongst Somali-born {{adults in the}} UK are low relative to many other foreign-born groups and to the British-born population. Analysis of <b>Labour</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Survey</b> data by the Institute for Public Policy Research, published in 2008, shows that in 2006/07, 48 per cent of the working-age Somali-born population of the UK had no qualifications. 6 per cent had GCSEs at grades A*-C or equivalent foreign qualifications, and 19 per cent had A-levels or their equivalent. The remaining 27 per cent were classified as having [...] "other qualifications". The IPPR note that {{it is often difficult}} to classify foreign qualifications, and hence a higher proportion of foreign-born populations are classified in this category than the UK-born population. When immigrants' qualifications are classified as [...] "other", they note, they are often of a high level.|$|E

2500|$|Although women play {{an active}} role in Pakistan's economy, their {{contribution}} has been grossly underreported in some censuses and surveys. [...] Part of the understimation of women's economic role is that Pakistan, like many other countries, has a very large informal sector. The 1991–92 <b>Labour</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Survey</b> revealed that only about 16% of women aged 10 years and over were in the labour force. According to World Bank, in 2014, women made up 22.3% of the labor force in Pakistan. According to the 1999 report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, only two percent of Pakistani women participate in the formal sector of employment. However, the 1980 agricultural census stated that the women's participation rate in agriculture was 73%. The 1990–1991 Pakistan Integrated Household Survey indicated that the female labour force participation rate was 45% in rural areas and 17% the urban areas. Pakistani women {{play a major role in}} agricultural production, livestock raising and cottage industries.|$|E

30|$|For the analyses, I use a long {{series of}} German <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>surveys,</b> the Microcensus, {{covering}} one per {{cent of the}} German households. The time series comprises the Microcensus Scientific-Use-Files (70  per cent random subsamples) 1980, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 2000 and 2004 – 2008 and concentrates on the West German population. The sample is restricted to tertiary graduates differentiating between first-tier university and second-tier polytechnics (Fachhochschule) graduates.|$|R
50|$|However, in {{countries}} such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan and the European Union, unemployment is measured using a sample survey (akin to a Gallup poll). According to the BLS, a number of Eastern European nations have instituted <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>surveys</b> as well. The sample survey has its own problems because the total number of workers in the economy is calculated based on a sample rather than a census.|$|R
30|$|As another alternative, {{measurements}} of hours worked and volume of {{work can be}} derived directly from survey interviews. For most of the establishment surveys, however, the findings are limited to particular groups of persons or companies, questions relate to paid hours rather than actual hours worked, or interviews take place only infrequently. Also in household interviews, e.[*]g., <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>surveys,</b> the questions to record hours actually worked and not worked, respectively, are not sufficient to yield a solid overall figure. Besides typical problems with household surveys such as proxy interviewing or memory errors, questions on “hours actually worked last week” or similar questioning may induce a systematic bias due to underreported occurrence of components such as holidays or sick leave which cause interviews not to take place. Likewise, multiple jobholding is underreported by survey participants as was found by Steward (2014) for U.S. data. Fleck (2009), who also discusses several other shortcomings of surveys when measuring hours worked, shows that, all in all, the hours worked series estimated directly from <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>surveys</b> provide higher measures as compared to other concepts.|$|R

50|$|Migration {{refers to}} the {{movement}} of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some pre-defined, political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements 'migrations' unless they are somewhat permanent. Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data including tax forms and <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>surveys</b> are also important.|$|R
30|$|Typically, {{time use}} surveys {{are based on}} daily diaries of individuals. Time use diaries refer to a  24 -hour period of a specific day in the week. Respondents are asked to record all their {{activities}} (usually in 10  minutes time intervals), possibly distinguishing between primary and secondary activities when they are carried out contemporaneously. If an activity is not reported because the respondent did not carry it out, that activity is assigned a  0  minute time interval. Some activities are imputed by national statistical offices {{but there is no}} harmonised imputation procedure. As in <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>surveys,</b> people are required to report their activities independently of whether they are carried out in the regular or hidden economy. The under-reporting of irregular activities is common to all surveys which ask people to report what they do. However, in time use surveys the under-reporting might be possibly lower than in <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>surveys,</b> because of the detailed recording of the time spent in various activities (Hirway and Jose 2011) or because respondents may be less afraid that their answers could be used for administrative controls by tax or social security authorities.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Temporary {{workers have}} many human {{resource}} and labour market implications.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to present research on the impacts of the legislation – Fixed Term Employees Regulations and Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations – on temporary workers in the <b>labour</b> <b>force.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Information from 24 <b>Labour</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Surveys,</b> conducted between December 1997 and November 2003, were analysed with two longitudinal <b>Labour</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Surveys.</b> Qualitative data was also gathered from six temporary worker employers and 17 agency workers. Findings – Analysis of data demonstrated that the utilisation of temporary workers had declined in the labour force: Temporary workers had decreased in real terms by 24 per cent and agency workers who were less regulated by only 11 per cent. Also, an increased take‐up of permanent work by temporary workers was found post‐legislation (27 per cent) compared with pre‐legislation (22 per cent). Research limitations/implications – Some limitations exist in the study using National Statistics and qualitative data to analyse <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> dynamics. Further research is warranted in this area investigating how strategic decisions in utilising temporary workers are formed and how recent legislation has influenced these policies. Practical implications – Changes in temporary worker legislation have direct consequences to the <b>labour</b> <b>force.</b> Originality/value – The paper reveals the decline of temporary workers in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> between 1997 and 2003 and examines specific legislation, which may have influenced this phenomenon...|$|R
