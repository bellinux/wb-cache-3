30|$|Later, {{adventitious}} postembryonic crown roots, {{also called}} nodal roots, {{emerge from the}} nodes on the stem and tillers arranged {{in one or two}} rows (Fig.  1 b). For example, more than 100 crown roots are present 40  days after germination in cv Nipponbare plants grown under hydroponic conditions, forming a fibrous root system (Fig.  1 b). Root ramification is also partially responsible for this fibrous architecture. Indeed, <b>lateral</b> rice <b>roots</b> can appear on any primary root, including embryonic and crown roots, and can be classified into two main anatomical types [77] (Fig.  1 a, c). Thin small <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> exhibiting determinate growth are by far the most numerous (Fig.  1 a). A few large <b>lateral</b> <b>roots,</b> which are thinner in diameter than primary roots, can also be observed. They display indeterminate growth and can also bear small <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> (Fig.  1 c). Moreover, the small <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> elongate laterally, whereas the large <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> elongate downward, suggesting that the small <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> do not respond to gravity. Higher orders of branching can also be observed in the large <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> of the crown roots that emerge at later growth stages [55]. Small <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> exhibit determinate growth and never bear <b>lateral</b> <b>roots,</b> whereas all other root types have indeterminate growth and bear numerous <b>lateral</b> <b>roots,</b> suggesting a different function for these two types of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} {{of understanding of}} root gravity responses comes {{from the study of}} primary <b>roots,</b> even though <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> make a far greater contribution to root system architecture. The focus of this report is the analysis of gravitropic responses in <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> of wild-type background and pgm- 1 mutants. Despite the significant reduction in gravitropic response of primary roots of pgm- 1 mutants, the <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> of this mutant demonstrate wild-type rates of gravitropism, suggesting a significant difference in gravity signal transduction between primary and <b>lateral</b> <b>roots...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lactuca sativa cv. Baijianye {{seedlings}} do {{not normally}} produce <b>lateral</b> <b>roots,</b> but {{removal of the}} root tip or application of auxin, especially indole-butyric acid, triggered the formation of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots.</b> Primordia initiated within 9 h and were fully developed after 24 h by activating the pericycle cells opposite the xylem pole. The pericycle cells divided asymmetrically into short and long cells. The short cells divided further to form primordia. The effect of root tip removal and auxin application was reversed by 6 -benzylaminopurine at concentrations > 10 (- 8) M. The cytokinin oxidase inhibitor N 1 -(2 chloro 4 pyridyl) -N 2 -phenylurea also suppressed auxin-induced <b>lateral</b> <b>rooting.</b> The elongation of primary roots was promoted by L-alpha-(2 -aminoethoxyvinyl) glycine and silver ions, but only the latter enhanced elongation of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots.</b> The data indicate that the induction of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> is controlled by basipetally moving cytokinin and acropetally moving auxin. <b>Lateral</b> <b>roots</b> appear to not produce ethylene...|$|R
25|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that AM fungi release an unidentified diffusional factor, known as the myc factor, which activates the nodulation factor's inducible gene MtEnod11. This is the same gene involved in establishing symbiosis with the nitrogen fixing, rhizobial bacteria (Kosuta et al. 2003). When rhizobium bacteria are present in the soil, mycorrhizal colonization is increased due to an increase in the concentration of chemical signals involved in the establishment of symbiosis (Xie et al. 2003). Molecules similar to Nod factors were isolated from AM fungi and were shown to induce MtEnod11, <b>lateral</b> <b>root</b> formation and enhance mycorrhization. Effective mycorrhizal colonization can also increase the nodulations and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in mycorrhizal legumes.|$|E
2500|$|A {{tuberous}} root or storage root, is a modified <b>lateral</b> <b>root,</b> enlarged {{to function as}} a storage organ. The [...] enlarged area of the root-tuber, or storage root, can be produced at the end or middle of a root or involve the entire root. It is thus different in origin but similar in function and appearance to a stem tuber. Examples of plants with notable {{tuberous root}}s include the sweet potato, cassava, and dahlia.|$|E
2500|$|As in legumes, {{nodulation}} {{is favored}} by nitrogen deprivation and is inhibited by high nitrogen concentrations. Depending {{on the plant}} species, two mechanisms of infection have been described: The first is observed in [...] casuarinas or alders and is called root hair infection. In this case the infection begins with an intracellular infection of a root hair and {{is followed by the}} formation of a primitive symbiotic organ lacking any particular organization, a prenodule. The second mechanism of infection is called intercellular entry and is well described in Discaria species. In this case bacteria penetrate the root extracellularly, growing between epidermal cells then between cortical cells. Later on Frankia becomes intracellular but no prenodule is formed. In both cases the infection leads to cell divisions in the pericycle and the formation of a new organ consisting of several lobes anatomically similar to a <b>lateral</b> <b>root.</b> This organ is the actinorhizal nodule also called actinorhizae. Cortical cells of the nodule are invaded by Frankia filaments coming from the site of infection or the prenodule. Actinorhizal nodules have generally an indeterminate growth, new cells are therefore continually produced at the apex and successively become infected. Mature cells of the nodule are filled with bacterial filaments that actively fix nitrogen.|$|E
40|$|Gravitropism and, to {{a lesser}} extent, {{phototropism}} have been characterized in primary roots, but {{little is known about}} structural/functional aspects of these tropisms in <b>lateral</b> <b>roots.</b> Therefore, in this study, we report on tropistic responses in <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> of Arabidopsis thaliana. <b>Lateral</b> <b>roots</b> initially are plagiogravitropic, but when they reach a length of approximately 10 mm, these roots grow downward and exhibit positive orthogravitropism. Light and electron microscopic studies demonstrate a correlation between positive gravitropism and development of columella cells with large, sedimented amyloplasts in wild-type plants. <b>Lateral</b> <b>roots</b> display negative phototropism in response to white and blue light and positive phototropism in response to red light. As is the case with primary roots, the photoresponse is weak relative to the graviresponse, but phototropism is readily apparent in starchless mutant plants, which are impaired in gravitropism. To our knowledge, this is the first report of phototropism of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> in any plant species...|$|R
50|$|These drought induced short roots can {{be found}} on either both the tap <b>root</b> and <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> or on <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> only.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if patterns of cell differentiation are similar in primary and <b>lateral</b> <b>roots,</b> I performed a morphometric analysis of the ultrastructure of calyptrogen, columella, and peripheral cells in primary and <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> of Helianthus annuus. Each cell type {{is characterized by a}} unique ultrastructure, and the ultrastructural changes characteristic of cellular differentiation in root caps are organelle specific. No major structural differences exist in the structures of the composite cell types, or in patterns of cell differentiation in caps of primary vs. <b>lateral</b> <b>roots...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although an apoplastic pathway (the {{so-called}} bypass flow) is {{implicated in}} the uptake of Na+ by rice growing in saline conditions, the point of entry of this flow into roots remains to be elucidated. We investigated the role of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> in bypass flow using the tracer trisodium- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS) and the rice cv. IR 36. PTS was identified in the vascular tissue of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> using both epifluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy of sections stained with berberine-aniline blue revealed that the exodermis is absent in the <b>lateral</b> <b>roots.</b> We conclude that PTS can move freely through the cortical layers of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots,</b> enter the stele and be transported to the shoot via the transpiration stream...|$|R
40|$|Half-tipped {{primary and}} <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> of Ricinus communis cv Hale bend toward {{the side of}} the root on which the intact half-tip remains. Therefore, the minimal graviresponsiveness of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> is not due to the {{inability}} of their caps to produce growth effectors (presumably inhibitors). The columella tissues of primary (i. e. graviresponsive) roots are (a) 4. 30 times longer, (b) 2. 95 times wider, (c) 37. 4 times more voluminous, and (d) composed of 17. 2 times more cells than those of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots.</b> The onset of positive gravitropism by <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> is positively correlated with a (a) 2. 99 -fold increase in length, (b) 2. 63 -fold increase in width, and (c) 20. 7 -fold increase in volume of their columella tissues. We propose that the minimal graviresponsiveness of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> is due to the small size of their columella tissues, which results in their caps being unable to (a) establish a concentration gradient of the effector sufficient to induce gravicurvature and (b) produce as much of the effector as caps of graviresponsive roots...|$|R

50|$|Water {{droplet size}} {{is crucial for}} {{sustaining}} aeroponic growth. Too large a water droplet means less oxygen is available to the root system.

40|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>roots</b> are {{initiated}} {{from the}} pericycle cells of {{other types of}} roots and remain in contact with these roots throughout their life span. Although this physical contact has the potential to permit the exchange of signals, {{little is known about the}} flow of information from the <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> to the primary root. To begin to study these interactions the proteome of the primary root system of the maize (Zea mays L.) lrt 1 mutant, which does not initiate <b>lateral</b> <b>roots,</b> was compared with the corresponding proteome of wild-type seedlings 9 days after germination. Approximately 150 soluble root proteins were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and analyzed by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry and database searching. The 96 most abundant proteins from a pH 4 – 7 gradient were analyzed; 67 proteins representing 47 different Genbank accessions were identified. Interestingly, 10 % (15 / 150) of the detected proteins were preferentially expressed in lrt 1 <b>roots</b> that lack <b>lateral</b> <b>roots.</b> Eight of these lrt 1 -specific proteins were identified and four are involved in lignin metabolism. This study demonstrates for the first time the influence of <b>lateral</b> <b>roots</b> on the proteome of the primary root system.
