5|$|Derby della Campania {{generally}} {{refers to}} a rivalry with regional clubs, mainly Avellino and Salernitana. However, both teams have <b>largely</b> played in the lower divisions and meetings are <b>largely</b> limited to the Coppa Italia.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} obvious {{deficiency}} of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from <b>largely</b> infantry-based to <b>largely</b> cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, the only road in Davidson Township, Sullivan County besides the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike passed near Muncy Creek and the {{settlements}} along it. The valley of Muncy Creek is <b>largely</b> undeveloped, <b>largely</b> lacking even summer camps.|$|E
5|$|Albury Street (previously Union Street) {{contains}} a fine row of early urban houses <b>largely</b> dating from 1705 to 1717 which were once popular with naval captains and shipwrights.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{everything}} {{known about}} Domery {{comes from a}} 1799 account by Dr. J. Johnston in the Medical and Physical Journal, based <b>largely</b> upon information provided by Dr. Thomas Cochrane.|$|E
5|$|Although Sondheim was {{cautious}} of a cinematic {{adaptation of}} his musical, he was <b>largely</b> {{impressed by the}} results. The film received <b>largely</b> positive reviews, with Depp's performance receiving critical praise — the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 221 reviews, and Metacritic gave the film an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 39 reviews. Sweeney Todd appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained <b>largely</b> rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained <b>largely</b> agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|Although press freedoms have {{improved}} {{since the first}} decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are <b>largely</b> under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since {{the first decade of}} the 21st century and are <b>largely</b> unregulated.|$|E
5|$|An earth {{structure}} is a building or other structure made <b>largely</b> from soil. Since soil {{is a widely}} available material, {{it has been used}} in construction since prehistoric times.|$|E
5|$|Anarky has {{undergone}} several shifts in his characterization {{over the course}} of the character's existence. These were <b>largely</b> decided upon by Alan Grant, who between the creation of Anarky to the end of the 1999 Anarky series, was <b>largely</b> the sole author of the character. After the departure of Grant and Breyfogle from DC Comics, Anarky's characterization fell to various authors who utilized him thereafter.|$|E
5|$|As {{many stars}} either {{declined}} or retired following this win, it is <b>largely</b> {{recognized as the}} last NBA Finals conducted by the Celtics dynasty.|$|E
5|$|As {{the head}} has <b>largely</b> {{disappeared}} in bivalves, the mouth has been equipped with labial palps (two {{on each side}} of the mouth) to collect the detritus from its mucus.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{important}} economically, providing {{substantial amounts of}} food, especially protein, <b>largely</b> but not exclusively from the domestic chicken; feathers and down are used for bedding, insulation, and other purposes.|$|E
5|$|Britain was <b>largely</b> forested in this period; {{widespread}} {{forest clearance}} {{did not occur}} in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from {{the vicinity of the}} White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the river, supports the idea that the area was still <b>largely</b> forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was <b>largely</b> pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.|$|E
5|$|Buford {{appears in}} {{historical}} records {{beginning in the}} early 19th century. The area that is now Buford was originally part of Cherokee territory. Despite the treaty in 1817 that ceded the territory to the United States and Gwinnett County's legislative establishment in 1818, the area was still <b>largely</b> inhabited by the Cherokee until the 1830s. The first non-Native Americans moved to the Buford area in the late 1820s or early 1830s, although the Buford area was not <b>largely</b> settled by them until the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Calabria, alone, has 30 {{traditional}} musical instruments, some {{of which}} have strongly archaic characteristics and are <b>largely</b> extinct elsewhere in Italy. It is home to the four- or five-stringed guitar called the chitarra battente, and a three-stringed, bowed fiddle called the lira, which is also found in similar forms in the music of Crete and Southeastern Europe. A one-stringed, bowed fiddle called the torototela, is common in the northeast of the country. The <b>largely</b> German-speaking area of South Tyrol is known for the zither, and the ghironda (hurdy-gurdy) is found in Emilia, Piedmont and Lombardy.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{opinions}} of the album have been mixed, but <b>largely</b> positive. Metacritic gave the album a rating of 68 out of 100, based on 12 reviews.|$|E
5|$|Critical reviews were <b>largely</b> positive. The film {{currently}} has a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The Canadian network Space awarded it the 2005 Spacey Award for Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Film.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of acid mine drainage in Catawissa Creek, its waters are <b>largely</b> clear.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{problems}} England were <b>largely</b> the better team, with Cowdrey’s leadership, Geoffrey Boycott’s batting and a weakened West Indian attack being {{the difference between}} the sides.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury was <b>largely</b> rural {{until the}} mid-19th century, when it {{underwent}} development and urbanisation during the Industrial Revolution. It {{became part of}} Manchester in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Dika oil, from Irvingia gabonensis seeds, {{native to}} West Africa. Used to make margarine, soap and pharmaceuticals, {{where is it}} being {{examined}} as a tablet lubricant. <b>Largely</b> underdeveloped.|$|E
5|$|ECB lending has <b>largely</b> {{replaced}} inter-bank lending. Spain has €365 {{billion and}} Italy has €281 billion of borrowings from the ECB (June 2012 data). Germany has €275 billion on deposit.|$|E
5|$|East Kolkata is <b>largely</b> {{composed}} of newly developed areas and neighbourhoods of Saltlake, Rajarhat, Tangra, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Phoolbagan etc.|$|E

5|$|From age 14 to 21, Little held {{a variety}} of jobs while living with his {{half-sister}} Ella Little-Collins in Roxbury, a <b>largely</b> African-American neighborhood of Boston.|$|E
5|$|Greek {{historian}} Herodotus {{claimed that}} ancient Egyptians {{looked like the}} people in Colchis (modern-day Georgia). This claim has been <b>largely</b> discredited as fictional by modern-day scholars.|$|E
5|$|Greek {{organizations}} at Dartmouth College that dissolved {{over the}} years have <b>largely</b> done so as a result of financial difficulties or critically low membership and interest.|$|E
5|$|He {{was fond}} {{of the works of}} Akira Kurosawa, and worked in a {{reference}} to him in Paprika. However he claimed to be <b>largely</b> unfamiliar with Japanese film in general.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{seems to}} have been known in {{northern}} Germany, but he was <b>largely</b> ignored elsewhere in the Roman Catholic world.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Solomon Creek had {{at least}} seven tributaries, {{including}} one named Buttonwood Creek. However, several tributaries <b>largely</b> disappeared by the late 1890s due to mining in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist <b>largely</b> on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, fallow deer and musk deer. The prey animals of North American wolves have <b>largely</b> continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting <b>largely</b> on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.|$|E
5|$|In Nigeria, {{at least}} half a million suffer from vaginal fistula, <b>largely</b> as a result of lack of medical care. Early marriages can result in fistula.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, {{most of the}} town's {{inhabitants}} and {{the local}} elite were Saxons, <b>largely</b> descended from settlers brought in by the Kings of Hungary in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to develop and defend the southern borders of the province. By {{the middle of the}} next century roughly half the population had Hungarian names. In Transylvania as a whole, the Reformation sharpened ethnic divisions: Saxons became Lutheran while Hungarians either remained Catholic or became Calvinist or Unitarian. In Kolozsvár, however, the religious lines were blurred. Isolated both geographically from the main areas of German settlement in southern Transylvania and institutionally because of their distinctive religious trajectory, many Saxons eventually assimilated to the Hungarian majority over several generations. New settlers to the town <b>largely</b> spoke Hungarian, a language that many Saxons gradually adopted. (In the seventeenth century, out of more than thirty royal free towns, only seven had a Hungarian majority, with Kolozsvár/Klausenburg being one of them; the rest were <b>largely</b> German-dominated.) In this manner Kolozsvár became <b>largely</b> Hungarian speaking and would remain so through the mid-20th century, though 4.8% of its residents identified as German as late as 1880.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{there is}} {{increasing}} global awareness of {{the threat posed by}} the human greenhouse effect, produced <b>largely</b> by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E
