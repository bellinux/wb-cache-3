40|$|The <b>luminance</b> <b>non-linearity</b> {{introduced}} by many imaging devices {{can often be}} described by a simple point-wise operation (gamma correction). This paper presents a technique for blindly estimating the amount of gamma correction {{in the absence of}} any calibration information or knowledge of the imaging device. The basic approach exploits the fact that gamma correction introduces specific higher-order correlations in the frequency domain. These correlations can be detected using tools from polyspectral analysis. The amount of gamma correction is then estimated by minimizing these correlations...|$|E

Subjects {{were required to}} identify the orientation and direction of a drifting sinusoidal contrast modulation. When the carrier consisted of static two-dimensional noise, performance often reflected the use of first-order artifacts that arise from stochastic local biases in the noise, rather than the detection of the contrast modulation per se. This stimulus, which has been used widely for studying second-order motion, therefore appears to be inappropriate for that purpose. In contrast, global distortion products arising from <b>luminance</b> <b>non-linearities</b> {{do not appear to}} provide usable artifacts. Two manipulations were employed to eliminate local first-order artifacts: the use of dynamic noise and the use of high-pass filtered static noise. These two manipulations gave similar results, which were quite different from those obtained with broadband static noise. We argue that performance with both of these image types reflects the activity of a true second-order motion mechanism. A characteristic property of this mechanism is that it cannot specify direction at the threshold for detecting orientation. Direction thresholds are around 50 % higher than orientation thresholds when first-order artifacts are eliminated. Copyright Â© 1996 Elsevier Science Lt...|$|R
