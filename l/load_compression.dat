5000|$|Cranial sutures are {{indicators}} of skull function and morphologies {{can be linked}} to specific feeding modes. Transitional feeding changes can be observed by examining cross sectional morphology of a suture in taxa of the fish-tetrapod transition. [...] Comparing positionally comparable sutures in extant fish allows {{for the creation of a}} sutural morphospace. The main cause of sutural deformation is caused by strain during feeding activity, most prominent with feeding mechanisms involving sucking a prey into the mouth. There is a tension anteriorly, and compression posteriorly strain patterns are observed in Polypterus, a prey-sucking predator. In terrestrial tetrapod Phonerpeton, there is compression between the frontals and parietals and a complex loading between the post parietals. There is no evidence of tensile strain in any sutures. Acanthostega fossil records demonstrate that no strain pattern was exhibited that relate to prey capture by means of suction. The <b>load</b> <b>compression</b> is similar to extant tetrapods. It is most likely that the organism captured prey by biting in the water or near the edge of the water. This finding indicates that the terrestrial mode of feeding first emerged in an aquatic environment.|$|E

In this study, the makeup, sealability and joint strength was analyzed from conditions of make-up <b>loading,</b> tension <b>loading,</b> <b>compression</b> <b>loading</b> and internal pressure loading by finite element method. The makeup torque, the contact pressure distributions of metal seal along the axis and the stress distributions of threaded connection are given. The results show that under tension <b>loading,</b> <b>compression</b> <b>loading</b> and internal pressure, the overall stress level of threaded connection is lower than of pipe. The anti-compression performance and joint strength of threaded connection is greater than of pipe. The contact pressures of metal seal maintain relatively high level of contact pressures under tension <b>loading,</b> <b>compression</b> <b>loading</b> and internal pressure.

40|$|Abstract: A {{small-scale}} biomechanical disc culture {{system was}} designed to stimulate intervertebral disc (IVD) ‘motion segment ’ in culture environment with load-controlled compression and combined <b>load</b> (<b>compression</b> + shear). After 7 days of diurnal mechanical loading, cell viability of discs stimulated with static compression load (0. 25 MPa) and static combined <b>load</b> (<b>compression</b> (0. 25 MPa) + shear (1. 5 N)) were similar (. 90 per cent) to unloaded controls. Mechanically stimulated discs showed decrease in static/dynamic moduli, early stress relaxation, and loss of disc height after 7 days of diurnal loading. Histological data of discs indicated load-induced transformations that were not apparent in controls. The feasibility of studying the mechanobiology of intact IVD as a motion segment was demonstrated. Media conditioning (improve tissue stability in long-term culture) and application of biochemical gene expression assays (differential tissue response to types of mechanical stimulation) are proposed as future improvements. The study suggests that the limitations in studying mechanobiology of IVD pathology in vitro can be overcome {{and it is possible}} to understand the physiologically relevant mechanism of IVD pathology. ...|$|E
40|$|Competitive surfing {{includes}} high -risk manoeuvres, such as aerials, {{that require}} landing from height onto the water surface, absorbing high loads through the lower limbs. The injuries reported during aerial manoeuvres have been mainly {{located in the}} knee and ankle joints; however, {{there is a lack}} of information about the types and mechanisms of these injuries. This case report describes two cases of Anterior Inferior Tibio - Fibular Ligament (AITFL), or syndesmosis, injuries that occurred during one professional surfing competition. Video recordings and clinical examination information were used to analyse the two cases. Both injuries were due to unsuccessful landings of aerial manoeuvres, and the video recordings showed similar movement patterns with the landing occurring in an already compressed position. The result suggests that the performance of aerial manoeuvres in competition can lead to high <b>load</b> <b>compression</b> injuries, and that syndesmosis injury may be a typical surfing injury due to the modern type of manoeuvres. This information can be used to direct training interventions and landing strategies for surfing athletes, to make them more effective in coping with the dynamic high <b>load</b> <b>compression</b> forces that occur during aerial manoeuvres...|$|E

Rheological properties from ESR were further used in designing the cure cycles to study the evolution of mechanical properties. Five panels were cured at different cure stages using the designed cure cycles and coupons were tested for short beam shear and combined <b>loading</b> <b>compression</b> properties at different cure stages. To correlate the mechanical properties with its respective glass transition temperature, Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA) was used to obtain the glass transition temperature for the coupons obtained from the respective panels. Statistical results showed significant difference in short beam shear and combined <b>loading</b> <b>compression</b> properties up to vitrification, however, no significant difference was observed on these mechanical properties after vitrification. The observed linear trend between degree of cure (DOC) and glass transition temperature (Tg) was validated using Dibenedetto relation. Linearly increasing trend between degree of cure (DOC) and glass transition temperature (Tg) for different cure states suggests that both DOC and Tg can be used interchangeably to define the state of material.

To check the possibility of apatite accumulation in anammox granules, and study its contribution to the mechanical strength of granules, anammox granular sludge was collected from Dokhaven municipal wastewater treatment plant, the Netherlands. Mineral precipitation inside the granules was visualized by micro-computed tomography, and apatite was identified by electron probe microanalysis and X-ray powder diffraction. The mechanical strength of anammox granules was measured by a low <b>load</b> <b>compression</b> tester. The contribution of apatite to the mechanical strength was evaluated by the generalized Maxwell model. Ca-PO 4 minerals are reported to accumulate in anammox granules. A transformation of Ca-PO 4 happens, and apatite is the final stable form. The accumulation of apatite increases the mechanical strength of anammox granules.

OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to investigate the hemostatic mechanism of action and viscoelastic properties of polyurethane foam (PU) {{in comparison to the}} widely used collagen and gelatin. METHODS: The hemostatic mechanism of action of the materials was tested using human whole blood and platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The ability of the hemostatic agent to exert pressure on the wound was quantified in terms of its viscoelastic properties both under dry and wet conditions using a low <b>load</b> <b>compression</b> tester (LLCT). RESULTS: It has been shown that collagen and PU initiate hemostasis through both thrombocyte aggregation and contact activation of the coagulation cascade. Gelatin did not show improved thrombocyte aggregation or initiation of the coagulation cascade compared to the negative control group. PU is more firm under wet conditions and shows more springback than collagen and gelatin. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PU is promising as a topical hemostatic agent because it initiates both the coagulation cascade and thrombocyte aggregation. Furthermore, it has favorable viscoelastic properties compared to collagen and gelatin which leads to increased pressure on a wound...|$|E

The contribution of bracing to stabilization of the ankle was smaller in the axial loading condition than in the no axial loading condition. The semirigid braces had greater stabilizing effects in response to the inversion moment than the lace up brace. Stabilizing effects of bracing were significantly greater in 20 ° of plantar flexion than in 0 ° of plantar flexion.
