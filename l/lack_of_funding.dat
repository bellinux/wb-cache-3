5|$|The GB {{baseball}} team finished 2nd in the 2007 European Baseball Championship behind the Netherlands, guaranteeing them {{a place at}} the Olympic qualifying tournament in Taiwan.

5|$|Much of {{the area}} around the lake remains undeveloped and empty. Original plans {{included}} large recreation areas on both the eastern and western end of the lake complete with golf courses, campgrounds, swimming lakes, water parks and other amenities. The MWD still plans on building the additional recreation facilities, but <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> and lack of support from developers has prevented them from doing so.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} halted in March 1989, for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding,</b> after costs had quickly {{escalated}} that January, from £35million to £230million. By this point huge {{sections of the}} building's roof had been removed, so that machinery could be taken out. Without a roof, the building's steel framework has been left exposed and its foundations have been prone to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The table {{does not}} include the {{numerous}} whaling voyages that took place during this period, or sub-Antarctic expeditions such as that of Carl Chun in 1898–99, which did not penetrate the Antarctic circle. The abortive Cope Expedition of 1920–22, which collapsed through <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding,</b> is likewise excluded, though two men were landed from a Norwegian whaler and spent a year on the Antarctic peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Although disbanded in 1919 {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, it was re-raised in 1921 in the Citizens Force (later known as the Militia) as a part-time infantry battalion based in Victoria. However, due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> {{following the}} Great Depression and a shortage of manpower following the suspension of the compulsory training scheme in 1929, the battalion was amalgamated with the 38th Battalion as the 7th/38th Battalion, although it was delinked again in 1936 when the Army was expanded due to rising tensions in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Canada had {{originally}} planned to send two ski jumpers, Nels Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie. Nelsen held world {{record for the}} longest ski jump. However, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> meant that they planned for work for their fare on a freighter. These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation, who organized the Canadian team and who felt working for their fare was inappropriate and not fitting for the team, and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Efforts made {{by local}} {{authorities}} in the Cluj-Napoca district {{at the end of}} the 1990s to reform the protection of children's rights and assistance for street children proved insufficient due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding,</b> incoherent policies and the absence of any real collaboration between the actors involved (Child Rights Protection Directorate, Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social Protection, Minors Receiving Centre, Guardian Authority within the City Hall, Police). There are numerous street children, whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with local law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|Following {{decommissioning}} in 1997, {{the ship}} was earmarked for preservation as a museum ship in Mumbai. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> prevented progress on the ship's conversion to a museum and it was speculated that the ship would {{be made into a}} training ship. In 2001, {{the ship was}} opened to the public by the Indian Navy, but the Government of Maharashtra was unable to find a partner to operate the museum on a permanent, long-term basis and the museum was closed after it was deemed unsafe for the public in 2012.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, Caltrans {{said that}} SR54 {{had not been}} {{included}} in plans {{for the next six}} years, due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> and a shift in priorities from new roads to maintenance. The water subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives later recommended that the wildlife refuge be put on hold, since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had not finished their proposal. Over the next few years, support for the project was expressed by a local citizens' group, the Chula Vista city council, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.|$|E
5|$|Lakefront Station's lack of {{modernization}} since its opening {{has become more}} noticeable, especially its appearance and lack of adequate signage. In August 2012, when the Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland was under construction, a Cuyahoga County official {{expressed a desire to}} keep Lakefront Station out of view. One proposed solution was to build a new station underground, but due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding,</b> the county settled on hiding the station behind trees and shrubs as a short-term solution.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January 2007, the ACO {{announced}} that 24 of the 28 teams had accepted their automatic entries before the deadline.

5|$|On January 14, 1964, {{players in}} the newer league formed the AFL Players Association, and elected linebacker Tom Addison of the Boston Patriots as president. Rather than working with the AFLPA, the NFLPA chose to remain apart and tried to block the merger between the two leagues in 1966, though <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> {{prevented}} it from mounting a formal challenge. With the merger complete, the players could no longer use the leverage {{of being able to}} sign with an AFL team to attain more money.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Literary Theatre project {{lasted until}} 1901, when it {{collapsed}} owing to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding.</b> In 1904, Lady Gregory, Martyn, Yeats, John Millington Synge, Æ, Annie Horniman and William and Frank Fay {{came together to}} form the Irish National Theatre Society. The first performances staged by the society {{took place in a}} building called the Molesworth Hall. When the Hibernian Theatre of Varieties in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in Marlborough Street became available, Horniman and William Fay agreed to their purchase and refitting {{to meet the needs of}} the society.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in that society that occasionally allows for female-specific human rights abuses. At the same time, if talented women footballers do emerge, many choose to go abroad to maximize playing opportunities. A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> impedes regional {{development of}} women's football {{as most of the}} funding for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association.|$|E

5|$|The {{extension}} {{opened to}} Jay Street on February 1, 1933, but the High Street station remained closed {{for an additional}} five months. The trains ran through the station without stopping, because the escalators to the street had not been completed due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding.</b> That month, the contract for four escalators in the station was awarded to Otis Elevator Company. The station opened on June 24, 1933.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E

This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating, T-Force, which at first could not be pursued owing to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding.</b> Development resumed in 1993, when {{it was decided to}} produce the series, now titled GFI, using cel animation.
