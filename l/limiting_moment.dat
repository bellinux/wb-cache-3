30|$|The current {{analysis}} for scenario (b) {{is regarded as}} a static problem because a fire load is not short-lived (the unit of time is h). The experimental results have shown that the fire resistance of an isolated steel beam with simple supports at its ends differs from that of a beam restrained by surrounding structures. One of the main causes of this difference is the effects of catenary action. Current studies on beams under the effects of fire have also shifted toward this direction (Bradford et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2002; Xi and Luan 2012; Yin and Wang 2005). The fire resistance of restrained steel beams can be analyzed by using various methods; the limiting temperature of the structures can then be determined. However, the traditional concept of limiting temperature, which is defined by the rule that the section bending moment is equal to the plastic <b>limiting</b> <b>moment</b> at a corresponding temperature, is only applied to pure bending beams under the assumption of infinitesimal deflection. Apparently, this definition may be inappropriate for large deflection beams, wherein bending moments and axial forces contribute to yield condition. Catenary action has been demonstrated to improve the fire resistance of restrained beams (Liu et al. 2002). However, the definition of limiting temperature (or failure temperature) remains unclear. Although both limiting temperature criteria were proposed by Xi and Luan (2012), additional examples are needed to check their validity.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation of end plate connections of various thicknesses welded to 10 WF 21 and 12 WF 27 beams and connected to various stiffened and unstiffened 8 WF columns are reported. Moment-rotation curves have been obtained for all connections tested and these have been compared {{to determine the effects}} on connection performance of the parameters of end plate thickness, column section, and column stiffener plates. Yield beam lines, representing first yield in a uniformly loaded beam, were drawn to obtain the connection moment at the yield beam line. The value of this moment indicated that the connections behaved semi-rigidly and was used in the comparison of various connections. It was observed that the thicker the end plate, the more rigid the connection and the greater the effect of column stiffeners on the rigidity of the connection. For an end plate connection of a particular width and depth connected to a particular column, there is a <b>limiting</b> <b>moment</b> which such a connection can sustain at the yield beam line, regardless of the thickness of end plate used. This limiting effect is due to deformation of the column section, specifically, of the column flange. Column stiffener plates increased the rigidity of all connections primarily by restraining the deformation of the column flanges adjacent to the tension flanges beams. Column stiffeners prevented column web bucking, however the column web buckles which developed in these tests were initiated at rotations greatly exceeding those expected in structural forms...|$|E

These previous factors were not considered in design. Corners may be subjected to closing moments, which subject to tensile stresses in {{the outside of the}} corner, or to opening moments, which cause tensile stresses in the inside of the corner.

Opening joints may be found in retaining walls water tanks, open channels, bridge abutments, high rises due to wind effect, frame structures, etc. in the other hand the closing joint may be found in two hinged and fixed frames and underground water tanks. Hence two types of joints should be compared.

40|$|AbstractRelatively {{thin-walled}} tubes bent {{into the}} plastic range buckle by axial wrinkling. The wrinkles initially grow stably but eventually localize and cause catastrophic {{failure in the}} form of sharp local kinking. The onset of axial wrinkling was previously established by bifurcation analyses that use instantaneous deformation theory moduli. The curvatures at bifurcation were predicted accurately, but the wrinkle wavelengths were consistently longer than measured values. The subject is revisited with the aim of resolving this discrepancy. A set of new bending experiments is conducted on aluminum alloy tubes. The results are shown to be in line with previous ones. However, the tubes used were found to exhibit plastic anisotropy, which was measured and characterized through Hill’s quadratic anisotropic yield function. The anisotropy was incorporated in the flow theory used for prebuckling and postbuckling calculations {{as well as in the}} deformation theory used for bifurcation checks. With the anisotropy accounted for, calculated tube responses are found to be in excellent agreement with the measured ones while the predicted bifurcation curvatures and wrinkle wavelengths fall in line with the measurements also. The postbuckling response is established using a finite element model of a tube assigned an initial axisymmetric imperfection with the calculated wavelength. The response develops a <b>limit</b> <b>moment</b> that is followed by a sharp kink that grows while the overall moment drops. The curvature at the <b>limit</b> <b>moment</b> agrees well with the experimental onset of failure. From parametric studies of the various instabilities it is concluded that, for optimum predictions, anisotropy must be incorporated in both bifurcation buckling as well as in postbuckling calculations...|$|R

40|$|Conference paper,When an {{external}} load {{is applied to}} one of its ends, a pipeâ€™s bends cross section tends to deform significantly {{both in and out}} of its end plane. This shell type behaviour characteristic of pipe bends and mainly due to their curves geometry accounts for their greater flexibility. This added flexibility is also accompanied by stresses and strains that are much higher than those present in a straight pipe. The primary goal of this research is to study the elastic-plastic behaviour of pipe bends under out of plane moment loading. It is also required to study the effects of changing the value of the pipe bend factor and the value of the internal pressure on that behaviour and to determine the value of the <b>limit</b> <b>moments</b> in each case. The results of these analyses are presented in the form of load deflection plots for each load case belonging to each model. From the load deflection curves, the <b>limit</b> <b>moments</b> of each case are obtained. The limit loads are then compared to those computed using some of the analytical and empirical equation available in the literature. The effects of modelling parameters are also studied. The results obtained from small displacement and large displacement analyses are compared and the effects of using a strain hardened material model are also investigated. To better understand the behaviour of pipe elbows under out of plane bending and internal pressure, it was deemed important to know how the cross section deforms and to study the distribution of stresses that cause it to deform in a particular manner.
