40|$|Coordinate {{measuring}} machine (CMM) technology {{is widely used}} in inspection, but sometimes it is not suitable for measuring complex parts in dimensional metrology or reverse engineering owing its inherent slow speed.

The decision is often {{based on the principle}} that tight tolerance elements should be measured by contact methods, while other more <b>loose</b> <b>tolerance</b> elements can be scanned by optical sensors.

50|$|Another {{key feature}} {{cited in the}} {{reliability}} of the Saiga is that the rifle is designed to have <b>loose</b> <b>tolerances</b> between moving parts. These <b>loose</b> <b>tolerances</b> allow more space between the moving parts of the rifle, and they allow the rifle to push any dirt and debris out of the way when the action cycles. All Saiga rifles have a hammer-forged chrome-lined barrel, which influences the Saiga's reliability by making the inside of the barrel more resilient to corrosion and enabling the rifle to withstand more rounds to be fired out of the barrel without an adverse effect on accuracy. This allows the firearms barrel to be cleaned easier than that of a non-chrome lined bore.|$|R

There are a lot of benefits to use the membrane-based diffractive optical element in ultra-large aperture optical imaging system, including <b>loose</b> <b>tolerance,</b> light weight, easy folding and unfolding, which make it easy to realize high resolution earth observation on geostationary orbit. The implementation of this technology also faces some challenges, including the configuration of the diffractive primary lens, the development of high diffraction efficiency membrane-based diffractive optical elements, and the correction of the chromatic aberration of the diffractive optical elements. Aiming at the configuration of the diffractive primary lens, the “ 6 + 1 ” petal-type unfold scheme is proposed, which consider the compression ratio, the blocking rate and the development complexity. For high diffraction efficiency membrane-based diffractive optical element, a self-collimating method is proposed. The diffraction efficiency is more than 90  % of the theoretical value. For the chromatic aberration correction problem, an optimization method based on schupmann is proposed to make the imaging spectral bandwidth in visible light band reach 100  nm. The above conclusions have reference significance for the development of ultra-large aperture diffractive optical imaging system...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} use of the {{tolerance}} limits on the treatment couch position to detect mistakes in patient positioning and warn users of possible treatment errors. Computer controlled radiotherapy systems use the position of the treatment couch as a surrogate for patient position, and a tolerance limit is applied against a planned position. When the couch is out of tolerance, a warning is sent to a user to indicate a possible mistake in setup. A tight tolerance may catch all positioning mistakes {{while at the same time}} sending too many warnings; a <b>loose</b> <b>tolerance</b> will not catch all mistakes. We developed a statistical model of the absolute position for the three translational axes of the couch. The couch position for any fraction is considered a random variable xi. The ideal planned couch position xp is unknown before a patient starts treatment and must be estimated from the daily positions of xi. As such, xp is also a random variable. The tolerance, tol, is applied to the difference between the daily and planned position, di = xi- xp. The di is a linear combination of random variables and therefore the density of di is the convolution of distributions of xi and xp. Tolerance limits are based on the standard deviation o...|$|E
40|$|To achieve azimuth {{and height}} {{measurement}} of a slowly moving {{point in a}} certain distance and wide field of view, a combined long-focal-length cylindrical lens measurement system was built. A point shape reticle, a long-focal-length optical system formed by a Galileo telescope combined with cylindrical lens and two orthogonal linear array CCD were utilized. There isn&# 39;t a real middle image plane in the combined long-focal-length optical system with a relatively short optical length. The front {{part of the system}} is a Galileo telescope, and its focal power is approximate to 0. Within a measurement range, some parameters, such as the value of the angular magnification and diameter of the front part, should be properly selected, making the linear image from different field orthogonal to the two linear CCD. Through targeted lens system design optimization, proper selection of merit function, and tolerance analysis of the alignment and measurement principle, the acurracy of azimuth measurement of this system is less than ± 2. 5 ″, within field of view of 1. 5 °× 1. 5 °, at the measurement distance of 10 m, additionally with relatiely small system length, and relatively <b>loose</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The proposed system can solve the problem of the limited size of light source cooperation target, making a low cost and large size photo-electronic detector. © 2016, Science Press.

40|$|In many applications, {{an optical}} {{detector}} {{has to be}} located relative to mechanical reference points. One solution is to specify stringent requirements on (1) mounting the optical detector relative to the chip carrier, (2) soldering the chip carrier onto the printed circuit board (PCB), and (3) installing the PCB to the mechanical structure of the subsystem. Figure 1 shows a sketch of an optical detector mounted relative to mechanical reference with high positional accuracy. The optical detector is typically a fragile wafer that cannot be physically touched by any measurement tool. An optical coordinate measuring machine (CMM) {{can be used to}} position optical detectors relative to mechanical reference points. This approach will eliminate all requirements on positional tolerances. The only requirement is that the PCB is manufactured with oversized holes. An exaggerated sketch of this situation is shown in Figure 2. The sketch shows very loose tolerances on mounting the optical detector in the chip carrier, <b>loose</b> <b>tolerance</b> on soldering the chip carrier to the PCB, and finally large tolerance on where the mounting screws are located. The PCB is held with large screws and oversized holes. The PCB is mounted loosely so it can move freely around. The optical CMM measures the mechanical reference points. Based on these measurements, the required positions of the optical detector corners can be calculated. The optical CMM is commanded to go to the position where one detector corner is supposed to be. This is indicated with the cross-hairs in Figure 2 (a). This figure is representative of the image of the optical CMM monitor. Using a suitable tapping tool, the PCB is manually tapped around until the corner of the optical detector is at the crosshairs of the optical CMM. The CMM is commanded to another corner, and the process is repeated a number of times until all corners of the optical detector are within a distance of 10 to 30 microns of the required position. The situation is sketched in Figure 2 (b) (the figure also shows the tapping tool and where to tap). At this point the fasteners for the PCB are torqued slightly so the PCB can still move. The PCB location is adjusted again with the tapping tool. This process is repeated 3 to 4 times until the final torque is achieved. The oversized mounting holes are then filled with a liquid bonding agent to secure the board in position (not shown in the sketch). A 10 - to 30 -micron mounting accuracy has been achieved utilizing this method. ...|$|E

50|$|Such {{mechanisms}} are not often found since the {{rack and pinion}} is generally more robust for the same job.

Another feature of the capstan and bowstring is that it can be designed to slip at the ends of its travel if desired by the simple expedient of having the cable slip around the capstan, forming a simple torque-limiting clutch.

50|$|Archery may {{be easier}} to learn and have a faster rate of fire, yet perhaps this system's {{greatest}} advantage over the atlatl is that ammunition is easier to make and transport. Since the dart must store {{almost all of the}} system's elastic energy, more care, planning, and weight of elastic material must be invested in its construction. In archery, the bulk of elastic energy is stored in the throwing device, rather than the projectile; arrow shafts can therefore be much smaller, and have <b>looser</b> <b>tolerances</b> for spring constant and weight distribution than atlatl darts. For example, stone dart points from the same set tend to vary in mass by {{no more than a few}} percent, and computer simulations show that this is necessary for efficient operation. Similar constraints exist for the length, diameter, and materials quality of the shaft. If the same amount of attention and material are instead invested into a bow, projectiles can be made lighter (by a factor of five or more) and to less exacting tolerances. This allowed for more forgiving flint knapping.|$|R
