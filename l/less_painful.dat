5|$|By mid-2012 Iceland was {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It has had two years of economic growth. Unemployment was down to 6.3% and Iceland was attracting immigrants to fill jobs. Currency devaluation effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Ten-year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the PIIGS nations in the EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, a member of parliament, noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> than government labor policies and negotiations. Nevertheless, while EU fervor has cooled the government continued to pursue membership.|$|E
25|$|Bowling is done underarm (as in softball), {{rather than}} overarm as in {{international}} cricket. This change {{came about because}} underhanded-bowled balls are <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> if they contact with a player.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} can {{be added}} to local anaesthetics, to speed up the onset of their effects and make their injection <b>less</b> <b>painful.</b> It is also a component of Moffett's solution, used in nasal surgery.|$|E

50|$|In BDSM {{play the}} wooden horse {{is used as}} a sexual torture device {{primarily}} or exclusively on women. Another version often dubbed the wooden pony is made of a single wooden plank supported horizontally from the floor on its side with the thin edge up. This version may have been invented because it is easier to make and more readily available than a triangular shape. The edges may be filed to a blunt point or rounded off to create a <b>less</b> immediately <b>painful</b> variation, or a thinner plank used to provide extra pressure and pain.|$|R
25|$|There is a {{substantial}} market for products which promise to make weight loss easier, quicker, cheaper, more reliable, or <b>less</b> <b>painful.</b> These include books, DVDs, CDs, cremes, lotions, pills, rings and earrings, body wraps, body belts and other materials, fitness centers, clinics, personal coaches, weight loss groups, and food products and supplements.|$|E
25|$|Recovery time {{following}} {{laparoscopic surgery}} is shorter and <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> than following traditional abdominal surgery. Instead {{of opening the}} pelvic cavity with a wide incision (laparotomy), a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) and surgical instruments are inserted into the pelvic cavity via small incisions. Rectopexy and anterior resection have been performed laparoscopically with good results.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} procedure utilizing the DIEAP free flap is <b>less</b> <b>painful,</b> {{and allows the}} woman a shorter post-operative recovery period, because the harvesting procedure preserved all of the abdominal muscles and relevant innervation. Likewise, the long-term preservation of abdominal strength {{reduces the risk of}} abdominal complications, such as hernia, intestinal bulging, and pain. The DIEAP free flap breast reconstruction can tolerate oncologic radiotherapy.|$|E
50|$|In frozen shoulder, {{there is}} a lack of {{synovial}} fluid, which normally helps the shoulder joint, a ball and socket joint, move by lubricating the gap between the humerus (upper arm bone) and the socket in the shoulder blade. The shoulder capsule thickens, swells, and tightens due to bands of scar tissue (adhesions) that have formed inside the capsule. As a result, there is less room in the joint for the humerus, making movement of the shoulder stiff and painful. This restricted space between the capsule and ball of the humerus distinguishes adhesive capsulitis from a <b>less</b> complicated, <b>painful,</b> stiff shoulder.|$|R
60|$|I {{climbed down}} again to Charles. The evening came on slowly. Cries of sea-birds rang weird upon the water. Puffins and {{cormorants}} circled round our {{heads in the}} gray of twilight. Charles suggested that they might even swoop down upon us and bite us. They did not, however, but their flapping wings added none the <b>less</b> a <b>painful</b> touch of eeriness to our hunger and solitude. Charles was horribly depressed. For myself, I will confess I felt so much relieved {{at the fact that}} Colonel Clay had not openly betrayed me in the matter of the commission, as to be comparatively comfortable.|$|R
50|$|Harvey and Samyn left net.art for {{videogames}} in {{the early}} 2000s, when they felt that the web was becoming too much like a shopping mall. In 2002, they founded Tale of Tales, an independent game development studio in Ghent, Belgium, {{with the goal of}} creating games of greater emotional engagement and imaginative richness than {{the kinds of things that}} were being made for the then-major demographic of teenage boys. For a while Auriea was living in New York and MichaÃ«l in Belgium, and during this period they created Wirefire, a multimedia software interface that allowed them to communicate in a way that they considered less predictable and more creative than either chat or video (and <b>less</b> damned <b>painful!).</b>|$|R
25|$|Although {{they have}} {{effective}} stingers, these wasps {{and other members}} of Stenogastrinae are typically passive aggressive. Their stings are <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> for humans than those of many other social wasps, and often when faced with a large threat, these wasps will simply fall passively out of their nests. This behavior actually makes it harder for the potential predator to determine the location of the nest.|$|E
25|$|Liostenogaster vechti {{is a type}} of eusocial hover wasp {{within the}} family Vespidae. They are {{typically}} brown and yellow in color and are considered a passive aggressive species. Their stings are <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> to humans than other social wasps, and they engage in associative nest foundation. They are mostly found on the Malaysian peninsula and are known for living in large clusters of small ring-shaped nests.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that a cuff with a wider bladder occludes blood flow at a lower {{pressure}} level than a cuff with a narrower bladder. This may be related to more efficient pressure transmission to the deeper tissues with a wider cuff. Lower pressures, and associated lower pressure gradients, may reduce the risk of pressure-related injuries to the patient. Furthermore, Estebe et. al demonstrated that a wide tourniquet cuff is <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> than a narrow cuff if inflated at lower pressures and at these lower pressures it is still effective at occluding blood flow.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 while hitchhiking {{across the}} United States, Smith {{picked up a}} {{newspaper}} one morning at a truck stop outside Scottsbluff, Nebraska and was inspired by an article he read promising cheaper international airfares under the new Airline Deregulation Act. That development, when blended with an inexplicable wanderlust, compelled him to become an experimental fine art global street photographer instead of the other <b>less</b> exciting (more <b>painful</b> and <b>less</b> pain distracting) things left available to him.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{movement}} of the shoulder is severely restricted in people with a [...] "frozen shoulder". This condition, which doctors call adhesive capsulitis, is frequently caused by injury that leads to lack of use due to pain. Rheumatic disease progression and recent shoulder surgery can also cause frozen shoulder. Intermittent periods of use may cause inflammation. Adhesions (abnormal bands of tissue) grow between the joint surfaces, restricting motion. There is also a lack of synovial fluid, which normally lubricates {{the gap between the}} arm bone and socket to help the shoulder joint move. It is this restricted space between the capsule and ball of the humerus that distinguishes adhesive capsulitis from a <b>less</b> complicated <b>painful,</b> stiff shoulder. People with diabetes, stroke, lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and heart disease, or who have been in an accident, are at a higher risk for frozen shoulder. The condition rarely appears in people under the age of 40.|$|R
60|$|It may be {{conceived}} how pleasant {{it was to}} the clever woman of the family to hear her mother declaiming on the arts by which she had been duped by this adventurer, appealing continually to Grace and Fanny, and sometimes to herself, and all before Mr. Grey, on whose old-world prejudices she had bestowed much more antagonism than he had thought it worth while to bestow on her new lights. Yet, at the moment, this operation of being written down an ass, was <b>less</b> acutely <b>painful</b> to her than the perception that was simultaneously growing on her of the miserable condition of poor little Lovedy, whose burning hand she held, and whose gasping breath she heard, as the child rested feebly in the chair in which she had been placed. Rachel had nothing vindictive or selfish in her mood, and her longing was, above all, to get away, and minister to the poor child's present sufferings; but she found herself hemmed in, and pinned down by the investigation pushed on by her mother, involving answers and explanations that she alone could make.|$|R
25|$|Progesterone {{can also}} be {{administered}} alternatively via subcutaneous injection, with the aqueous formulation Prolutex in Europe being intended specifically for once-daily administration by this route. This formulation is rapidly absorbed and {{has been found to}} result in higher serum peak progesterone levels relative to intramuscular oil formulations. In addition, subcutaneous injection of progesterone is considered to be easier, safer (less risk of injection site reactions), and <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> relative to intramuscular injection. The terminal half-life of this formulation is 13 to 18hours, which is similar to the terminal half-lives of OMP and intramuscular progesterone.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficacy}} {{profile of}} lidocaine {{as a local}} anaesthetic {{is characterized by a}} rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes local numbing <b>less</b> <b>painful.</b> Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} mini-mover procedure (3MP) is {{a technique}} used to correct pectus excavatum by using two magnets to realign the sternum {{with the rest of}} the chest and ribcage. One magnet is inserted 1cm into the patient's body on the lower end of the sternum, the other is placed externally onto a custom fitted brace. These two magnets generate around 0.04tesla (T) in order to slowly move the sternum outwards over a number of years. The maximum magnetic field that can be applied to the body safely is around 4T, making this technique safe from a magnetic viewpoint. The 3MP technique's main advantages are that it is more cost-effective than major surgical approaches such as the Nuss procedure and it is considerably <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> postoperatively.|$|E
60|$|Not <b>less</b> {{than four}} <b>painful</b> hours now passed, ere {{the gang of}} hands from the vessels reached {{the base of the}} mountain. It came prepared, however, to {{transport}} the sufferer on a hand-barrow that had been used in conveying the skins of seal across the rocks. On this barrow Daggett was now carefully placed, when four men lifted him up, and walked away with him for a few hundred yards. These were then relieved by four more; and, in this manner, was the whole distance to the house passed over. The patient was put in his bunk, and some attention was bestowed on his bruises and other injuries.|$|R
60|$|Not quickly, in Somo, had Jerry's {{memory of}} Skipper and Mister Haggin faded. Life in the cannibal village {{had been too}} unsatisfying. There had been too little love.

But at the moments he remembered them the yearning that accompanied the memory grew <b>less</b> pronounced and <b>painful.</b> The intervals between the moments widened, nor did Skipper and Mister Haggin take form and reality so frequently in his dreams; for, after the manner of dogs, he dreamed much and vividly.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: {{to assess}} the {{effectiveness}} of the muzzle twitch in donkeys Animals: five donkeys serving as their own controls Procedures: painful stimuli were applied to a donkey with and without use of a muzzle twitch. Effectiveness was measured by use of behavioural, cardiovasculair (HR, HRV) and hormonal (ACTH, cortisol and Ã-endorphins) parameters. Results: donkeys responded <b>less</b> to <b>painful</b> stimuli under influence of the twitch compared to the control group. Mean HR was significantly increased during the twitch procedure after applying the twitch. Administration of painful stimuli in the twitch procedure did not further increase mean HR. Mean HR during the procedure without the twitch significantly increased after applying painful stimuli. The use of the twitch resulted in a significant increase in mean plasma ACTH concentration. The use of the twitch did not result in significant differences in mean plasma Ã-endorphin concentrations. Conclusions and clinical relevance: although twitching of donkeys led mainly to a hormonal stress response without concurrent increases in Ã-endorphin concentration, the response to painful stimuli was clearly less. Therefore, it is advisable to use a twitch for restraining donkeys when to perform mildly painful and/or brief procedures...|$|R
25|$|Kocher first {{attained}} {{international recognition}} with his method to reset a dislocated shoulder published in 1870. The new procedure was much <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> and safer than the traditionally used procedure {{and could be}} performed by a single physician. Kocher developed the procedure through his knowledge of anatomy. In the same period, Kocher also studied the phenomena of bullet wounds {{and how they can}} cause bone fractures. From these studies resulted one public lecture in 1874 Die Verbesserung der Geschosse vom Standpunkt der Humanitaet (English: The improvement of the bullets from the standpoint of humanity.) and an 1875 manuscript Ueber die Sprengwirkung der modernen Kriegsgewehrgeschosse (English: Over the explosive effect of modern war rifle bullets.) He showed that small caliber bullets were less harmful and recommended to use bullets with slower speed.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} approach uses {{an interval}} between the sartorius muscle and tensor fasciae latae. Dr. Joel Matta and Dr. Bert Thomas have adapted this approach, which was commonly used for pelvic fracture repair surgery, for use when performing hip replacement. When used with older hip implant systems {{that had a}} small diameter head, dislocation rates were reduced compared to surgery performed through a posterior approach. With modern implant designs, dislocation rates are lower because supporting muscle tissue, including the iliotibial tract, receives very little damage during the surgery. There is a 10% rate of numbness in the thigh following this approach, due to injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The anterior approach results in a quicker and <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> recovery. Immediately following surgery patients are instructed to go about their normal hip function, including weight bearing activity and bending their hip freely.|$|E
25|$|Tendonectomy {{involves}} {{cutting the}} deep digital flexor tendon of each claw, {{resulting in the}} cat being unable to move its distal phalanges. Without the ability to expose its claws, the cat is unable to wear down or groom its claws. For this reason, the cat subsequently requires regular nail clippings to prevent its claws from growing into its paw pads. A 1998 {{study published in the}} Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association comparing cats undergoing onychectomy to cats undergoing tendonectomy found that, although the cats undergoing tendonectomy appeared to suffer less pain immediately post-operatively, {{there was no significant difference}} in postoperative lameness, bleeding, or infection between the two groups. A 2005 study found no evidence that tendonectomy is <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> than onychectomy. The American Veterinary Medical Association and the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association explicitly do not recommend this surgery as an alternative to declawing.|$|E
60|$|So soon as {{the doors}} of Coldingham Priory were opened, {{he was on his}} way northward. It was a sore and trying journey, in the bitter March weather, for one so little used to hardship. He did not fail in obtaining shelter or food; his garb was {{everywhere}} a passport; but he grew weary and footsore, and his anxiety greatly increased when he found that fatigue was bringing back the lameness, which greatly enhanced the likelihood of his being recognized. Kind monks, and friendly gude-wives, hospitably persuaded the worn student to remain and rest, till his blistered feet were whole; but he pressed on whenever he found it possible to travel, and after the first week found his progress <b>less</b> tardy and <b>painful.</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{syphilis}} {{first appeared}} in Europe in 1495, it was an acute and extremely unpleasant disease. After {{only a few years}} it was less severe than it once was, and it changed over the next 50 years into a milder, chronic disease. The severe early symptoms may have been the result of the disease being introduced into a new host population without any resistance mechanisms, but the change in virulence is most likely to have happened because of selection favouring milder strains of the pathogen. The symptoms of the virulent early disease were both debilitating and obvious to potential sexual partners of the infected, and strains that caused <b>less</b> obvious or <b>painful</b> symptoms would have enjoyed a higher transmission rate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Ideal models should {{reproduce}} just sensory deficits, such as alodynia, hyperalgesia {{and spontaneous}} pain for short periods. There are {{different types of}} animal models to evaluate different neuropathic pain etiologies and manifestations. Some models study neuropathic pain peripheral mechanisms and other study its central mechanisms. This review focuses on animal models most commonly used for neuropathic pain research. CONTENTS: Animal models based on peripheral nerves ligation which are more commonly used are described. From all models described in this review, spared nerve injury is that producing more reproducible behavioral abnormalities for a longer period, while chronic sciatic nerve compression produces behavioral signs of <b>less</b> predictable <b>painful</b> neuropathies. Spinal hemisection and cytokines-induced spinal injury are the models of choice {{for the study of}} central pain mechanisms. Other specific models are used {{for the study of the}} specific etiology of pain. CONCLUSION: Since neuropathic pain is multifactorial, different neuropathic pain animal models were developed throughout the years, which have been critical for the study of neuropathic pain, since much of current knowledge comes from studies with rats and mice. Current animal models need to be further refined and more efforts should be made to determine which animal models may be more predictive, with less biases and more complex and objective analysis parameters...|$|R
25|$|Other {{advantages}} of the NPT approach are that it is fast and convenient, usually <b>less</b> <b>painful,</b> and offers, in home use, the ability for patients to measure their own INRs when required. Among its problems are that quite a steady hand is needed to deliver the blood to the exact spot, that some patients find the finger-pricking difficult, and {{that the cost of}} the test strips must also be taken into account. In the UK these are available on prescription so that elderly and unwaged people will not pay for them and others will pay only a standard prescription charge, which at the moment represents only about 20% of the retail price of the strips. In the USA, NPT in the home is currently reimbursed by Medicare for patients with mechanical heart valves, while private insurers may cover for other indications. Medicare is now covering home testing for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Home testing requires a doctor's prescription and that the meter and supplies are obtained from a Medicare approved Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF).|$|E

[...] Prodromal symptoms include tingling (paresthesia), itching, and pain where lumbosacral nerves innervate the skin. Prodrome may occur as long as several days or as short as a few hours before lesions develop. [...] Beginning antiviral treatment when prodrome is experienced can reduce the appearance and duration of lesions in some individuals. During recurrence, fewer lesions are likely to develop and [...] are <b>less</b> <b>painful</b> and heal faster (within 5â10 days without antiviral treatment) than those occurring during the primary infection. [...] Subsequent outbreaks tend to be periodic or episodic, occurring on average four or five times a year when not using antiviral therapy.|$|E
50|$|Gold {{fillings}} {{have excellent}} durability, wear well, {{and do not}} cause excessive wear to the opposing teeth, but they do conduct heat and cold, which can be irritating. There are two categories of gold fillings, cast gold fillings (gold inlays and onlays) made with 14 or 18 kt gold, and gold foil made with pure 24 kt gold that is burnished layer by layer. For years, they have been considered the benchmark of restorative dental materials. Recent advances in dental porcelains and consumer focus on aesthetic results have caused demand for gold fillings to drop in favor of advanced composites and porcelain veneers and crowns. Gold fillings are sometimes quite expensive; yet, they do last {{a very long time}} - which can mean gold restorations are <b>less</b> costly and <b>painful</b> in the long run. It is not uncommon for a gold crown to last 30 years.|$|R
40|$|Toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) {{are rare}} but severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions {{that are to}} be considered medical emergencies. The average reported mortality rate for SJS is 1 - 5 %, and up to 25 - 35 % for TEN. TEN and SJS are characterized by more or <b>less</b> extensive <b>painful</b> erythematous and erosive lesions of the skin, conjunctiva and mucous membranes resulting from massive apoptosis of epithelial cells, and are considered to be two ends of a spectrum of severe epidermolytic adverse cutaneous drug reactions, differing only by their extent of skin detachment. Drugs including allopurinol, antibiotics, anticonvulsants and NSAIDs of the oxicam type are the main cause of SJS/TEN in most cases. Recent evidence supports a genetic susceptibility to SJS and TEN as exemplified by the strong association observed in Han Chinese between the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B* 1502, and SJS induced by carbamazepine. Diagnosis relies mainly on clinical signs together with the histological analysis of a skin biopsy showing typical full-thickness epidermal necrolysis due to extensive keratinocyte apoptosis. Differential diagnoses include autoimmune bullous dermatoses, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, disseminated fixed bullous drug eruption and staphyloccocal scalded skin syndrome. Due to the high risk of mortality, management of patients with SJS/TEN requires rapid diagnosis, evaluation of the prognosis using SCORTEN, rapid identification and interruption of the culprit drug, specialized supportive care ideally in an intensive care unit, and the consideration of immunomodulatory agents such as high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin...|$|R
40|$|The {{red cell}} {{distribution}} width (RDW) {{has been studied}} during the clinical steady state in 1121 patients with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease, 344 with sickle cell-haemoglobin C (SC) disease, 68 with sickle cell-beta+ thalassaemia, 49 with sickle cell beta 0 thalassaemia and in 130 control subjects with a normal (AA) genotype. The mean RDW was moderately increased in S beta + thalassaemia and SC disease and markedly increased in S beta 0 thalassaemia and SS disease. In SS, SC and S beta 0 thalassaemia genotypes, lower RDW values occurred in females and with alpha thalassaemia. The RDW correlated negatively with total haemoglobin, mean cell haemoglobin concentration, mean cell volume, and fetal haemoglobin (HbF) and positively with reticulocyte count in SS disease. A low RDW was associated with higher weight and <b>less</b> frequent dactylitis, <b>painful</b> crisis, acute chest syndrome, acute splenic sequestration, and hospital admissions.
