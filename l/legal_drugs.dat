25|$|In 2013 the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction {{reported}} that there are 280 new <b>legal</b> <b>drugs,</b> known as legal highs, available in Europe. One of the best known, mephedrone, was banned in the United Kingdom in 2010. On November 24, 2010, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration announced it would use emergency powers to ban many synthetic cannabinoids within a month. An estimated 73 new psychoactive synthetic drugs appeared on the UK market in 2012. The response of the Home Office has been to create a temporary class drug order which bans the manufacture, import and supply but not the possession of named substances.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{dependency}} {{is addressed}} in many drug rehabilitation programs {{by attempting to}} teach the patient new methods of interacting in a drug-free environment. In particular, patients are generally encouraged, or possibly even required, to not associate with friends who still use the addictive substance. Twelve-step programs encourage addicts not only to stop using alcohol or other drugs, but to examine and change habits related to their addictions. Many programs emphasize that recovery is a permanent process without culmination. For <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> such as alcohol, complete abstention—rather than attempts at moderation, which may lead to relapse—is also emphasized ("One is too many, and a thousand is never enough.") Whether moderation is achievable by those {{with a history of}} abuse remains a controversial point, but is generally considered unsustainable.|$|E
25|$|Drug use {{discrimination}} is the unequal treatment people experience {{because of the}} drugs they use. People who use or have used illicit drugs may face discrimination in employment, welfare, housing, child custody, and travel, in addition to imprisonment, asset forfeiture, {{and in some cases}} forced labor, torture, and execution. Though often prejudicially stereotyped as deviants and misfits, most drug users are well-adjusted and productive members of society. Drug prohibitions may have been partly motivated by racism and other prejudice against minorities, and racial disparities have been found to exist in the enforcement and prosecution of drug laws. Discrimination due to illicit drug use was the most commonly reported type of discrimination among Blacks and Latinos in a 2003 study of minority drug users in New York City, double to triple that due to race. People who use <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> such as tobacco and prescription medications may also face discrimination.|$|E

500|$|While {{there were}} rumours that the Marquess {{had died from}} AIDS, having {{apparently}} contracted HIV in 1986, the coroner recorded that he died of [...] "multiple organ failure due to chronic drug abuse".

500|$|Professor Shiela Bird, a {{statistician}} at the Medical Research Council, {{suggested the}} ban of mephedrone {{may lead to}} more cocaine-related deaths. In {{the first six months}} of 2009, the number of cocaine-related deaths fell for the first time in four years, and fewer soldiers tested positive for cocaine in 2009 than in 2008. She suggested this may have been due to users switching to mephedrone from cocaine, but cautioned that before full figures are available for 2009 and 2010, it will be difficult to determine whether mephedrone saved lives, rather than cost them. Other supposedly <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> have filled the gap in the market since mephedrone was made illegal, including naphyrone (NRG-1) (since made illegal) and Ivory Wave, which has been found to contain MDPV, a compound made illegal at the same time as mephedrone. However, some products branded as Ivory Wave possibly do not contain MDPV. When tested, some products sold six weeks after mephedrone was banned, advertised as NRG-1, NRG-2 and MDAI, were found to be mephedrone. A Drugscope survey of drugs workers at the end of 2012 reported that mephedrone use was still widespread in the UK and that there increasing reports of problematic users. It was being taken as not only a [...] "poor man's cocaine" [...] but also amongst users of heroin and crack cocaine. Cases of intravenous use were also reported to be on the increase.|$|E
