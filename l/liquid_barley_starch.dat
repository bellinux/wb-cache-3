Apparent and absolute amylose contents, molecular size distributions of amylose and amylopectin, amylopectin branch-chian-length distributions, and Naegeli dextrin structures of the starches were analyzed. Results showed that amylose contents (9. 1 % to 44. 7 %) and total phosphorus contents (0. 022 % to 0. 068 %) varied among normal, waxy, and high amylose <b>barley</b> <b>starches.</b> 31 P-NMR analysis showed that phosphorus in <b>barley</b> <b>starches</b> was mainly from phospholipids. All the <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> varieties had short branch chain lengths and displayed a substantially reduced proportion of chains at DP 18 [...] 21. Waxy barley (W. B.

The viscosity profiles varied among different starches and different soy protein concentrations. Potato starch and the interaction between potato starch and soy proteins were significantly affected by salt in the mixture of starch and protein. Soy protein could form helical complex with amylose through hydrophobic interactions, which retarded the swelling of starch granules. Protein could interact with phospholipids in starch and facilitated granule swelling. Decreased pasting temperature was observed in the mixture of normal maize starch and soy proteins.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of acetylation and oxidation on the structural, morphological, physical–chemical, thermal and pasting properties of <b>barley</b> <b>starch.</b> <b>Barley</b> <b>starches</b> were acetylated at different catalyst levels (11 %, 17 %, and 23 % of NaOH solution) and oxidized at different sodium hypochlorite concentrations (1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, and 2. 0 % of active chlorine). Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractograms, thermal, morphological, and pasting properties, swelling power and solubility of starches were evaluated. The degree of substitution (DS) of the acetylated starches increased with the rise in catalyst concentration. The percentage of carbonyl (CO) and carboxyl (COOH) groups in oxidized starches also increased with the rise of active chlorine level. The presence of hydrophobic acetyl groups, carbonyl and carboxyl groups caused a partial disorganization and depolymerization of starch granules. The structural, morphological and functional changes in acetylated and oxidized starches varied according to reaction conditions. Acetylation makes <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> more hydrophobic by the insertion of acetyl groups. Also the oxidation promotes low retrogradation and viscosity.

The effects of acid hydrolysis on the molecular weight of amylopectin and amylose were studied by high -performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with post-column iodine staining. Microstructural studies of 8 % hydrolyzed <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> dispersions heated to 90 0 C showed {{that even a}} short acid treatment induced considerable changes in the granule structure. The molecular weight of amylopectin decreased substantially. As the hydrolysis progressed, the gel network composed of both amylose and amylopectin and separation into amylopectin-rich and amyloserich domains took place.

In this work, {{the roles of}} two universal features of starch biosynthesis were investigated to better understand their impact on starch molecular structure. To investigate the impact of diurnal photosynthetic activity on starch fine structure, normal and waxy barley were cultivated in a greenhouse under normal diurnal, or constant light photosynthetic conditions. The impact of starch branching enzymes on starch structure was investigated by studying the lintners of <b>barley</b> <b>starch,</b> which had all known genes coding for starch branching enzymes (SBE I, SBE IIa, SBE IIb) suppressed in the grain resulting in a novel amylose-only starch (AOS). The structure of AOS lintners was compared to lintners from normal <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> (NBS) and waxy <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> (WBS). Unexpectedly, NBS and WBS displayed growth rings regardless of lighting regimes. It was observed that the molecular structure and composition of (NBS) {{was influenced by the}} diurnal lighting regime, as NBS contained lower quantities of amylose, and a lower ratio of long chain amylose:short chain amylose (determined by gel permeation chromatography) when cultivated under the diurnal lighting regime compared to the constant light regime. While the composition of WBS remained constant, higher relative crystallinity values (determined by X-ray diffraction), and greater crystalline quality (determined by differential scanning calorimetry) were observed when cultivated under the diurnal lighting regime. When considering the fine structure of amylopectin from NBS and WBS, differences in structure were observed when cultivated under the different lighting regimes. The structure of clusters and building blocks of amylopectin were investigated following their isolation by partial and complete hydrolysis with α-amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Clusters of amylopectin from NBS and WBS cultivated under diurnal photosynthetic conditions were larger, and contained a greater number of building blocks compared to their counterparts cultivated in constant light conditions. AOS exhibited irregular morphological features and contained multi-lobed granules with a rough surface texture. When viewed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), acid hydrolyzed components of AOS displayed strong textured aggregates with an organization not previous seen in other specimens, whereas NBS and WBS displayed expected stacks of elongated elements with a width of 5 - 7 nm, believed to represent crystalline amylopectin side chains viewed longitudinally. High performance anion-exchange chromatography of lintners at equivalent levels of acid hydrolysis (45 wt%) revealed that the average degree of polymerization of the AOS lintner was 21, substantially smaller than that of NBS and WBS (42). While NBS and WBS lintners displayed size distribution and chain length profiles expected of those from <b>barley</b> <b>starch,</b> the AOS lintner displayed a unique size distribution profile wherein a repeat-size of the molecules corresponding to 5 - 6 glucose residue was observed, which corresponds to the approximate number of residues required per turn of the helical structure of amylose.

For the untreated sample, the macromolecules are elongated objects with low apparent density. As a result of homogenization, molar mass, and r rms decrease, while r h remains unaffected. The process also induces an increase, and scaling with size, of apparent density as well as changes in conformation, represented qualitatively by r rms/ r h. Finally, results from AsFlFFF are compared with viscosimetry and {{discussed in terms of}} concentration and close-packing in relation to macromolecular shape and conformation.

In {{this thesis}} {{the effect of}} different ways of thermal processing (pelleting, expanding, toasting) of barley and maize on the degradative behaviour of their starch and protein in the rumen of lactating dairy cows are described. In situ studies showed that all thermal processing methods increased the ruminal starch and protein availability of maize, while all thermal processing methods decreased ruminal starch availability but only pelleting increased ruminal protein availability of barley. Based on in vivo experiments compared to untreated grains, expander treatment increased the apparent rumen and total tract digestibility of maize starch but {{did not affect the}} digestibility of <b>barley</b> <b>starch.</b> Supplementing grazing dairy cows with pelleted and pressure toasted maize and barley slightly (not significantly) decreased the dry matter intake of grass in the first grazing event in the morning after milking, and it decreased ruminal clearence of nitrogen. Supplementing pasture grass with pelleted and pressure toasted cereal grains decreased the pH, the NH 3 -N level in the rumen, the ammonia to total VFA (TVFA) ratio, the isobutyrate proportion, the acetate to propionate ratio and the non-glucogenic to glucogenic ratio in the rumen. Simultaneously it increased TVFA concentrations, propionate, butyrate and valerate proportions {{as a percentage of the}} TVFA. All processed grains did affect production responses in dairy cows, by elevating milk protein and decreasing milk fat production, and milk urea nitrogen but no significant differences between these two heat treatments were found. It is concluded that the need of synchrony is specially important with diets based on fresh grass, in which markedly asynchronous rates of release of energy and nitrogen occur in the rumen. It appears that to generate a better ruminal N and organic matter synchrony to improve microbial N yield and N utilization feeding different types of cereal grain that differ by nature in rate and extent of ruminal degradation has more effect than using one of this processing methods on the same type of grain. Responses obtained from cereal grain supplementation are very dependent on the quality and degradation characteristics of the pasture consumed, which changes through the grazing season. </TR...|$|R

The feeding experiment comprised 20 Finnish Ayrshire bulls and 12 Holstein-Friesian bulls, and four treatments (8 bulls per treatment). There were four diets with two offered at stage 1 (from the initiation of the study to 450 kg live weight) and four at stage 2 (from 450 kg live weight to slaughter). The control diet (BF 0) included grass silage (460 g kg 1 dry matter) and barley grain (540), BF 25 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (405) and BF (135), BF 50 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (270) and BF (270), and BF 75 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (135) and BF (405). At stage 1 there were only two treatments (BF 0 and BF 50) and at stage 2, all four treatments were included. All bulls were fed total mixed ration ad libitum. The mean initial live weight of the bulls was 261 kg and the mean final live weight 650 kg. At stage 1 there were no significant treatment differences in dry matter, energy or protein intakes or in live weight gain. At stage 2, replacing barley grain with BF led to a linear decrease of daily live weight gain (P < 0. 05) and a linearly reduced feed conversion (kg dry matter kg 1 live weight gain) (P < 0. 05). The apparent digestibility of the organic matter and neutral detergent fibre decreased linearly with increasing BF supplementation (P < 0. 001). The dressing proportion and the carcass fat score decreased linearly (P < 0. 05) with partial replacement of barley grain with BF. On carcass conformation, treatment had a significant (P < 0. 05) quadratic effect: the BF 25 and BF 50 diets were classified highest. The results indicate that 50 % of <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> can be replaced with BF without affecting growth, but feed efficiency factors may decrease when <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> is replaced with BF.

The polysaccharide components of the insoluble residue were characterised by HPLC, GPC, and lambda(max) of the polyiodide complex. It was concluded that short chain-length (CL 16) material was from external chains of AP, intermediate material (modal CL 46) was from retrograded F. AM, and longer chain residues (CL 77, 120 - 130) were from lipid-complexed segments of L - AM. The starch lysophospholipids were completely hydrolysed to free fatty acids which remained complexed with L. AM residues. This was shown by the C- 13 Cp/MAS-NMR spectrum which had a clear resonance at 31 ppm from mid-chain methylene carbons of fatty acids in complexes. The C- 1 signal of the L. AM residues also included a feature at 104 ppm indicative of single V 6 AM helices. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of the residues of non-waxy starches were Cc-type (= mixed A + B types), whereas the spectra of the original starches were A-type. It is suggested that, during the early stages of lintnerisation, amorphous F-AM was partially hydrolysed into material (CL < 120) that retrograded into double helices (with B-type crystallinity) that were resistant to hydrolysis. Evidence for some B-crystalline polymorph was also obtained from the C- 13 Cp/MAS-NMR spectra, which were consistent with a mixture of double helices and V-type glycosidic conformations, with only a small proportion of non-ordered regions.

The [13]C-cross polarization/magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS-NMR) spectra of the nonwaxy starches had a broad resonance with a chemical shift of 31. 2 +/- 0. 4 ppm, which is characteristic of midchain methylene carbons of fatty acids in the solid state or in V-amylose (V-AM) complexes. The extracted lipid was a viscous liquid that, when mixed with seven parts AM, did not give a discernible peak under the conditions used to acquire the solid- state spectra. However, when the lipid was complexed with AM, it gave a typical V-AM spectrum and a broad resonance at 31. 8 ppm. This proves lipid complexed with L.

AM content and, hence, no exothermic formation of L. AM during starch gelatinization. Twelve waxy <b>barley</b> <b>starches</b> used in this study contained 0. 8 - 4. 0 % L. AM and 0. 9 - 6. 4 % F. AM; six nonwaxy starches contained 6. 1 - 7. 2 % L. AM and 23. 1 - 25. 0 % F. AM. All starches had essentially identical AP structures, as show by the chain lengths of debranched starches fractionated by gel-permeation chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. L. AM and F. AM appeared to have quite different effects on starch gelatinization behavior. Peak gelatinization temperature (Tp) of the waxy starches was p ositively correlated with L. AM content; because the Tp of the nonwaxy starches was much lower than predicted from the regression equation for the waxy starches, we concluded that F. AM lowered Tp. Swelling of starches at 80 C is essentially a property of AP content that is inhibited by LPL, but the relationship is not strictly linear. An improved equation to describe swelling properties assumed that 80 % of the F. AM swelled with the AP fraction, although swelling was inhibited by L. AM 0. 485...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects on}} <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> and grain {{properties}} of four starch synthesis mutations were studied during the introgression of the mutations from diverse backgrounds into an elite variety. The lys 5 f (ADPglucose transporter), wax (granule-bound starch synthase), isa 1 (debranching enzyme isoamylase 1) and sex 6 (starch synthase IIa) mutations were introgressed into NFC Tipple to give mutant and wild-type BC 2 F 4 families with different genomic {{contributions of the}} donor parent. Comparison of starch and grain properties between the donor parents, the BC 2 F 4 families and NFC Tipple allowed {{the effects of the}} mutations to be distinguished from genetic background effects. The wax and sex 6 mutations had marked effects on starch properties regardless of genetic background. The sex 6 mutation conditioned low grain weight and starch content, but the wax mutation did not. The lys 5 mutation conditioned low grain weight and starch content, but exceptionally high β-glucan contents. The isa 1 mutation promotes synthesis of soluble α-glucan (phytoglycogen). Its introgression into NFC Tipple increased grain weight and total α-glucan content relative to the donor parent, but reduced the ratio of phytoglycogen to starch. This study shows that introgression of mutations into a common, commercial background provides new insights that could not be gained from the donor parent...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the efficiency of rye and <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> hydrolysis in mashing processes using cereal malts as a source of amylolytic enzymes and starch, and to establish the volatile profile of the obtained agricultural distillates. In addition, the effects of the pretreatment method of unmalted cereal grains on the physicochemical composition of the prepared mashes, fermentation results, and the composition of the obtained distillates were investigated. The raw materials used were unmalted rye and barley grains, as well as the corresponding malts. All experiments were first performed on a semi-technical scale, and then verified under industrial conditions in a Polish distillery. The fermentable sugars present in sweet mashes mostly consisted of maltose, followed by glucose and maltotriose. Pressure-thermal treatment of unmalted cereals, and especially rye grains, resulted in higher ethanol content in mashes in comparison with samples subjected to pressureless liberation of starch. All agricultural distillates originating from mashes containing rye and barley grains and the corresponding malts were characterized by low concentrations of undesirable compounds, such as acetaldehyde and methanol. The distillates obtained under industrial conditions contained lower concentrations of higher alcohols (apart from 1 -propanol) than those obtained on a semi-technical scale...|$|R
40|$|Starch is {{a staple}} food in {{human and animal}} diets, but also a raw {{material}} widely used for industrial purposes. By genetical modification of starch-synthesising enzymes in crop plants, starch yields could be increased and novel starches with particular qualities could be produced for industrial use. However, the process of starch biosynthesis and its regulation is still not completely understood. One of the major groups of enzymes in starch biosynthesis is the starch branching enzymes (SBEs), which introduce the branch points into amylopectin. This thesis describes some properties of two different families of SBEs from potato and <b>barley.</b> In addition, <b>starch</b> structure from both developing and mature barley has been characterised. Initially, a linear substrate for in vitro studies of SBEI and SBEII from potato was prepared. The linear dextrins were produced by enzymatic hyrdolysis of retrograded starch and then further fractionated through ethanol precipitation. The in vitro branching properties of SBEI and SBEII from potato were examined using iodine-staining, NMR spectroscopy, chromatographic and enzymatic methods. The two enzyme isoforms showed different substrate specificities and the branched products exhibited different chain length distribution profiles, but a similar degree of branching. In develping <b>barley,</b> <b>starch</b> structure and {{the expression of the}} gene encoding for barley SBEI were examined. The amylose content increased during development and followed a time course {{similar to that of the}} expression of the SBEI gene. The amylopectin chain length distribution was examined in the later stages of development, but no changes in the amylopectin structure were observed. In mature waxy barley, the amylose content and amylopectin structure in different parts of the grain were analysed. It was shown that the amylose content was signigicantly higher in the peripheral parts of the endosperm than in the centre, whereas the amylopectin chain length distribution was similar in all parts of the endosperm...|$|R
2500|$|Malt extract is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} brewing of beer. Its production begins by germinating barley grain in {{a process known as}} malting, [...] immersing barley in water to encourage the grain to sprout, then drying the barley to halt the progress when the sprouting begins. The drying step stops the sprouting, but the enzymes remain active due to the low temperatures used in base malt production. In one before-and-after comparison, malting decreased <b>barley's</b> extractable <b>starch</b> content by about 7% on a dry matter basis, and turned that portion into various other carbohydrates.|$|R
5000|$|The {{oldest and}} most {{predominant}} ingredient in brewing is barley, which {{has been used in}} beer-making for thousands of years. Modern brewing predominantly uses malted barley for its enzymatic power, but ancient Babylonian recipes indicate that, without the ability to malt grain in a controlled fashion, baked bread was simply soaked in water [...]Malted barley dried at a sufficiently low temperature contains enzymes such as amylase, which convert starch into sugar. Therefore, sugars can be extracted from the <b>barley's</b> own <b>starches</b> simply by soaking the grain in water at a controlled temperature; this is mashing.|$|R
40|$|A thermoseparating aqueous {{two-phase}} {{system for}} extraction of a recombinant cutinase fusion protein from Escherichia coli homogenate has been scaled up to pilot scale. The target protein ZZ-cutinase-(WP) 4 {{was produced in}} a fed batch process at 500 l to a concentration of 12 % of the total protein and at a cell concentration of 19. 7 g l- 1. After harvest and high-pressure homogenisation a first extraction step was performed in an EO 50 PO 50 (50 % (w/w) ethylene oxide and 50 % (w/w) propylene oxide) thermopolymer/amylopectin rich Waxy <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> system. The (WP) 4 tag was used for enhanced target protein partitioning to the EO 50 PO 50 phase while the cell debris was collected in the starch phase. A second extraction step followed where the recovered EO 50 PO 50 phase from {{the first step was}} supplemented with a non-ionic detergent (C 12 - 18 EO 5) and heated to the cloud point (CP) temperature (45 oC). One polymer-rich liquid phase and one almost pure aqueous phase were formed. The target protein could be obtained in a water phase after the thermal phase separation at a total recovery over the extraction steps of 71 % and a purification factor of 2. 5. We were able to demonstrate that a disk-stack centrifugal separator could be adapted for rapid separation of both primary and thermoseparated phase systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of starch chain-length distributions (CLDs) {{is important for}} understanding starch biosythesis-structure-property relations. It is obtained by analyzing the number distribution of the linear glucan chains released by enzymatic debranching of starch α-(1 → 6) glycosidic bonds for subsequent characterization by techniques such as fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) or size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Current literature pretreatments for debranching prior to CLD determination involve varying protocols, which might yield artifactual results. This paper examines the two widely used starch dissolution treatments with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) containing 0. 5 % (w/w) lithium bromide (DMSO-LiBr) at 80 °C and with aqueous alkaline (i. e. NaOH) solvents at 100 °C. Analyses by FACE with a very high range of degree of polymerization, and by SEC, of the CLD of <b>barley</b> <b>starches</b> with different structures show the following. (1) The NaOH treatment, even at a dilute concentration, causes significant degradation at higher degrees of polymerization, leading to quantitatively incorrect CLD results in longer amylopectin and in amylose chains. (2) Certain features in both amylopectin and amylose fractions of the CLD reduced to bumps or are missing with NaOH treatment. (3) Overestimation of amylose chains in starch CLD due to incomplete amylopectin dissolution with dilute NaOH concentration. These results indicate starch dissolution with DMSO-LiBr is the method of choice for minimizing artifacts. An improved pretreatment protocol is presented for starch CLD analysis by FACE and SEC...|$|R
40|$|Adhesion of 19 Bifidobacterium strains {{to native}} maize, potato, oat, and <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> {{granules}} was examined to investigate links between adhesion and substrate utilization {{and to determine}} if adhesion to starch could be exploited in probiotic food technologies. Starch adhesion was not characteristic of all the bifidobacteria tested. Adherent bacteria bound similarly to {{the different types of}} starch, and the binding capacity of the starch (number of bacteria per gram) correlated to the surface area of the granules. Highly adherent strains were able to hydrolyze the granular starches, but not all amylolytic strains were adherent, indicating that starch adhesion is not a prerequisite for efficient substrate utilization for all bifidobacteria. Adhesion was mediated by a cell surface protein(s). For the model organisms tested (Bifidobacterium adolescentis VTT E- 001561 and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum ATCC 25526), adhesion appeared to be specific for α- 1, 4 -linked glucose sugars, since adhesion was inhibited by maltose, maltodextrin, amylose, and soluble starch but not by trehalose, cellobiose, or lactose. In an in vitro gastric model, adhesion was inhibited both by the action of protease and at pH values of ≤ 3. Adhesion was not affected by bile, but the binding capacity of the starch was reduced by exposure to pancreatin. It may be possible to exploit adhesion of probiotic bifidobacteria to starch granules in microencapsulation technology and for synbiotic food applications...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen hull-less barley cultivars, {{collected}} from four major cultivated areas in China, {{were employed to}} investigate the structural and physicochemical properties of their starches in this study. Relatively wide variations in physicochemical properties of the starches were observed. Amylose content ranged from 23. 1 % to 30. 0 %, swelling power and water solubility index ranged from 12. 8 to 19. 9 g g - 1 and 12. 7 % to 23. 7 % respectively. Peak viscosity was from 170 to 346 Rapid Visco Unit (RVU), peak temperature (Tp) of starch gelatinisation was from 55. 6 to 61. 8 °C and enthalpy of starch retrogradation ranged from 0. 3 to 3. 1 J g - 1. Weight-based chain-length proportions of fa, fb 1, fb 2 and fb 3 in amylopectins ranged from 21. 65 % to 24. 95 %, 44. 48 % to 49. 44 %, 15. 56 % to 17. 19 % and 9. 83 % to 16. 66 % respectively. Correlation analyses showed that amylose content was inversely related to pasting parameters and enthalpy of gelatinisation.

Starch pasting properties are very important factors in malting, food processing and feed quality of barley cultivars. Therefore, it is important to control of the amylose/amylopectin ratio in the <b>barley</b> <b>starch.</b> The Wax locus of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is responsible for the amylose endosperm biosynthesis. The Wax gene may be found among the barley cultivars in several allelic variants: 2 functional active alleles encoding GBSS I protein and one null-allele with the inactivated enzyme. The most reliable way to assess the allelic state of Wax gene is to use molecular marker based on polymerase chain reaction. Among the 126 barley samples studied (cultivars and breeding lines) by a codominant molecular marker system all of the three allelic variants of Wax gene were identified. Two samples representing with the cultivars Candle and Alamo carried the null-allele of the Wax gene. The results of the present study can be efficiently used to identify genotypes with the null-allele of the Wax gene for developing and characterization of the new barley varieties. ???????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ????

40|$|The {{decomposition}} of <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> plays a fundamental {{role in the}} final quality of fermented beverages in the brewing industry. The process of mashing involves steeping milled barley in water to stimulate the enzymatic {{decomposition of}} starch into simple carbohydrates. The temperature of the water significantly impacts the activity of the enzymes and in turn the resulting concentrations of sugar products. A kinetic model accurately predicting the types and quantities of sugars formed as a function of mash temperature would serve as a tool to tailor sugar profiles and optimize mashing procedures for a desired product. Sixty minutes mashes were conducted over a series of temperatures ranging from 61 to 73 °C and samples analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. The concentration profiles of fructose, dextrose, sucrose, maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose as a function of time were determined for each mash temperature. A reaction kinetics model was proposed and rate constants and reaction orders were extracted from the experimental data and used to simulate mashes at each temperature. The model was validated for the isothermal experiments and the model’s predictions were then compared to mash samples taken from a local microbrewery. The model was found to accurately capture the behavior of each sugar and the resulting sugar concentrations in the brewery. The model was then adjusted to gain insight into the profiles of several different mashing procedures...|$|R
