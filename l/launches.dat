50|$|A {{reusable}} <b>launch</b> system (RLS, or reusable <b>launch</b> vehicle, RLV) is a <b>launch</b> {{system which}} {{is capable of}} <b>launching</b> a payload into space more than once.

40|$|Research on the <b>launch</b> of new {{products}} in the international realm is scarce. The present paper {{is the first to}} document how <b>launch</b> window (difference in months between the first worldwide <b>launch</b> and the subsequent <b>launch</b> in a specific country) and <b>launch</b> price are interrelated and how regulation influences both <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price. The research context is the global - 50 countries worldwide - <b>launch</b> of 58 new ethical drugs across 29 therapeutic areas. We show that the fastest <b>launch</b> occurs when the <b>launch</b> price is moderately high and the highest <b>launch</b> price occurs at a <b>launch</b> window of 85 months. We find that the health regulator acts strategically in that {{the extent to which it}} delays the <b>launch</b> of a new drug increases with the price of the new drug. We also find that regulation overall increases the <b>launch</b> window, except for patent protection. Surprisingly, regulation does not directly impact <b>launch</b> price. The descriptive information on average <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price and the interconnection between <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price allows managers in ethical drug companies to build more informed decisions for international market entry. This study also provides public policy analysts with more quantitative evidence regarding <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price on a broad sample of countries and categories. regulation;pharmaceutical;entry timing;launch price;launch window;international new product <b>launch...</b>|$|R

Borden courts and {{eventually}} marries Sarah, who {{gives birth to}} their daughter, Jess; but their relationship is shadowed by Sarah's intuition that Borden is keeping secrets and that sometimes he is lying {{when he says he}} loves her. At his first show, Borden's bullet catch trick is sabotaged by Angier, and Borden loses two fingers. Angier <b>launches</b> his own magic career, hiring Olivia Wenscombe as his assistant and Cutter as his ingénieur. During the finale of Angier's show, a disguised Borden sabotages Angier's bird cage act, which maims an audience member and ruins Angier's reputation.|$|E

5|$|The {{culmination}} of Thor missile training was {{to participate in}} a missile launch. Originally it was intended that all Thor missile crews would carry out at least one launch, but it soon became apparent that the cost would be prohibitive. Nonetheless, 21 RAF crews visited the United States for training, culminating in operational training <b>launches</b> from Vandenberg. This was known as Integrated Weapons System Training (IWST). The first of these <b>launches</b> was a launch codenamed Lions Roar. Despite the fact that a Thor missile had exploded on the launch pad just a few days before, the launch was viewed by dignitaries including Brigadier Godfrey Hobbs, the Director of Public Relations at the Ministry of Defence; Air Vice-Marshal Walter Sheen, the RAF commander at the British Joint Staff Mission; and Air Vice-Marshal Augustus Walker, the commander of No. 1 Group. After delays due to weather and technical problems, the missile was successfully launched on 16 April 1959. In all, there were nine IWST <b>launches,</b> the last of which, codenamed Red Caboose, was on 21 January 1960.|$|E
5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground <b>launches,</b> also known as winch <b>launches</b> or wire <b>launches.</b> If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
50|$|Potential <b>launch</b> {{options are}} in the mid-heavy lift <b>launch</b> system class of <b>launch</b> vehicles, where Bigelow has now {{negotiated}} arrangements with two commercial <b>launch</b> providers., both SpaceX—using the Dragon— and United <b>Launch</b> Alliance/Boeing—using the Atlas V/CST-100—have signed to deliver <b>launch</b> services to Bigelow Space Station Alpha.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Launch</b> Complex {{receives}} the Cyclone-4 <b>launch</b> vehicle horizontally by a railway {{that connects the}} <b>launch</b> complex to the technical complex. The <b>launch</b> vehicle is tilted to the vertical position, and the final tests are performed automatically. The <b>launch</b> complex is designed so that the <b>launch</b> vehicle fuelling and <b>launching</b> are performed automatically, thus allowing a safe and reliable operation.|$|R
5|$|After 1964 the Kwajalein {{site was}} no longer {{required}} to be on alert, and returned primarily to Zeus testing. The system was kept active in a non-alert role between 1964 and 1967, known as Program 505. In 1967 it {{was replaced by a}} Thor based system, Program 437. A total of 12 <b>launches,</b> including those at White Sands, were carried out as part of the 505 program between 1962 and 1966.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it meets}} the {{definition}} of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites. This region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned <b>launches</b> that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|An {{operation}} is {{launched by the}} task force {{to take back the}} site from Zakhaev’s forces via halo jump.

The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and remotely destroy the missiles over the Atlantic Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Sea <b>Launch</b> created Land <b>Launch</b> {{with its}} Russian and Ukrainian {{partners}}.

5|$|Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket, fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene) {{and high}} test peroxide, a concentrated form of hydrogen peroxide.
