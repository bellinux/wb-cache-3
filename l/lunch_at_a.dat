5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Girl" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and released in mid-February along with the video for [...] "Cater 2 U". It was inspired by Sex and the City, containing elements and influences of the sitcom in many scenes. The clip is split into two different sets: Destiny's Child in Beyoncé's apartment and the same trio on a fictional television show. It begins with Michelle and Kelly entering Beyoncé's apartment as she writes on her laptop. They settle down with snacks and wine as they watch a fictional show styled after Sex and the City. After the opening credits, Beyoncé and Michelle meet Kelly on the TV for <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> restaurant. Throughout the video, the women at home respond {{to the events of}} the program through gestures and actions, while, on the television, the dialogue of the song matches their conversations in the restaurant. Beyoncé confronts Kelly about her sad demeanor and suspected boyfriend problems, but she feigns shock and insists that nothing is wrong; however, neither Michelle nor Beyoncé are convinced. Viewers can see that, on one occasion, her boyfriend took very long to come home without explanation and, when he finally arrived, a hurt Kelly threw his food away before running upstairs avoiding him.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on February 7, 2009 on CMT. The video commences with a close-ups of Swift's and Colletti's mouths as {{they speak}} via telephone. He begins, [...] "All I want is you.

She performs as she flashbacks to memories with Colletti. The two frolic on a brown couch and play with a deck of cards. The video then transitions to Swift and her friend having <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> restaurant, where Swift's friend informs her of Colletti's betrayal. The two converse and, then, Swift is seen walking on the streets during nighttime. She sees Colletti arriving at a house with groceries and, after staring at each other, a redheaded woman walks out of the house. In a panic, Swift runs away and the video transcends to the phone call, which commenced {{in the beginning of the}} video, with Colletti repeating, [...] "Will you give me another chance?" [...] A rapid flashback of cut-scenes is played and, after its conclusion, Swift denies his request, hangs up, and cries. Cut-scenes feature Swift and Colletti frolicking, Swift walking in the streets, and her sitting beside the fireplace. To date, the video has over 124 million views on YouTube.|$|E

2500|$|Among the [...] "firsts" [...] by Marshall Field's was {{the concept}} of the {{department}} store tea room. In the 19th century, ladies shopping downtown returned home for lunch; having <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> downtown restaurant unescorted by a gentleman was not considered ladylike. But after a Marshall Field's clerk shared her lunch (a chicken pot pie) with a tired shopper, Field's hit on the idea of opening a department store tea room, so that women shoppers would not feel the need to make two trips to complete their shopping. To this day, the Walnut Room serves the traditional Mrs. Herring's chicken pot pie.|$|E

60|$|I saw {{no reason}} to object. I was, in fact, {{exceedingly}} hungry.
