In this study, susceptibility of wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV M 552 I, M 552 V, and L 528 M/M 552 V mutants to other reverse transcriptase inhibitors was investigated by transient transfection of full-length HBV DNA into human hepatoma cells. HBV DNA replication was monitored by Southern blot hybridization, which showed {{the presence of a}} single-stranded band (representative of the HBV replicative intermediates) in the drug-free, wild-type HBV-transfected cells. This band was diminished in the samples of wild-type HBV DNA treated with either lamivudine, adefovir, or <b>lobucavir.</b> The band intensities from the lamivudine-resistant mutants were not decreased by treatment with lamivudine, but were decreased by the treatments with adefovir or <b>lobucavir.</b> In contrast, penciclovir and nevirapine did not diminish the intensity of the single-stranded band of wild-type HBV or the lamivudine-resistant mutants. These results demonstrate that lamivudine-resistant HBV is susceptible to adefovir and <b>lobucavir.</b> Lamivudine-resistant HBV should be treated with adefovir or <b>lobucavir,</b> and combination therapy with lamivudine and adefovir/lobucavir may prevent the {{emergence of}} lamivudine-resistant HBV...|$|E

This repression was presumed to occur via inhibition of the viral polymerase (Pol) by the triphosphate (TP) forms of BMS- 200475 and <b>lobucavir</b> which are both produced in mammalian cells. To determine the exact mode of action, BMS- 200475 –TP and lobucavir-TP, along with several other guanosine analog-TPs and lamivudine-TP were tested against the HBV, WHV, and duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) polymerases in vitro. Estimates of the 50 % inhibitory concentrations revealed that BMS- 200475 –TP and lobucavir-TP inhibited HBV, WHV, and DHBV Pol comparably and were superior to the other nucleoside-TPs tested. More importantly, both analogs blocked the three distinct phases of hepadnaviral replication: priming, reverse transcription, and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis. These {{data suggest that the}} modest potency of <b>lobucavir</b> in 2. 2. 15 cells {{may be the result of}} poor phosphorylation in vivo. Kinetic studies revealed that BMS- 200475 –TP and lobucavir-TP competitively inhibit HBV Pol and WHV Pol with respect to the natural dGTP substrate and that both drugs appear to bind to Pol with very high affinities.

As expected, lamivudine was much less (approximately 200 -fold) effective at inhibiting replication of the M 550 V mutant virus than the wild-type virus.

40|$|<b>Lobucavir</b> (LBV) is a deoxyguanine {{nucleoside}} analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. LBV was previously shown to inhibit {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) DNA polymerase after phosphorylation by the HSV thymidine kinase. Here we determined the mechanism of action of LBV against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). LBV inhibited HCMV DNA synthesis to a degree {{comparable to that of}} ganciclovir (GCV), a drug known to target the viral DNA polymerase. The expression of late proteins and RNA, dependent on viral DNA synthesis, was also inhibited by LBV. Immediate-early and early HCMV gene expression was unaffected, suggesting that LBV acts temporally coincident with HCMV DNA synthesis and not through cytotoxicity. In vitro, the triphosphate of LBV was a potent inhibitor of HCMV DNA polymerase with a Ki of 5 nM. LBV was phosphorylated to its triphosphate form intracellularly in both infected and uninfected cells, with phosphor-ylated metabolite levels two- to threefold higher in infected cells. GCV-resistant HCMV isolates, with deficient GCV phosphorylation due to mutations in the UL 97 protein kinase, remained sensitive to LBV. Overall, these results suggest that LBV-triphosphate halts HCMV DNA replication by inhibiting the viral DNA polymerase and that LBV phosphorylation can occur in the absence of viral factors including the UL 97 protein kinase.

In general, PS, DS, PVAS, PAVAS, ATA, PFA, PMEA, S 2242, <b>lobucavir</b> and HPMPC had comparable anti-HHV- 7 activity in the two cell lines, irrespective of the parameters followed to monitor antiviral activity.

40|$|Success in {{treating}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with nucleoside analog drugs like lamivudine {{is limited by}} the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains upon prolonged therapy. The predominant lamivudine resistance mutations in HBV-infected patients are Met 552 IIe and Met 552 Val (Met 552 Ile/Val), frequently in association with a second mutation, Leu 528 Met. The effects of Leu 528 Met, Met 552 Ile, and Met 552 Val mutations on the binding of HBV polymerase inhibitors and the natural substrate dCTP were evaluated using an in vitro HBV polymerase assay. Susceptibility to lamivudine triphosphate (3 TCTP), emtricitabine triphosphate (FTCTP), adefovir diphosphate, penciclovir triphosphate, and <b>lobucavir</b> triphosphate was assessed by determination of inhibition constants (K(i)). Recognition of the natural substrate, dCTP, was assessed by determination of Km values. The results from the in vitro studies were as follows: (i) dCTP substrate binding was largely unaffected by the mutations, with Km changing moderately, only in a range of 0. 6 to 2. 6 -fold; (ii) K(i) s for 3 TCTP and FTCTP against Met 552 Ile/Val mutant HBV polymerases were increased 8 - to 30 -fold; and (iii) the Leu 528 Met mutation had a modest effect on direct binding of these beta-L-oxathiolane ring-containing nucleotide analogs. A three-dimensional homology model of the catalytic core of HBV polymerase was constructed via extrapolation from retroviral reverse transcriptase structures. Molecular modeling studies using the HBV polymerase homology model suggested that steric hindrance between the mutant amino acid side chain and lamivudine or emtricitabine could account for the resistance phenotype. Specifically, steric conflict between the Cgamma 2 -methyl group of Ile or Val at position 552 in HBV polymerase and the sulfur atom in the oxathiolane ring (common to both beta-L-nucleoside analogs lamivudine and emtricitabine) is proposed to account for the resistance observed upon Met 552 Ile/Val mutation. The effects of the Leu 528 Met mutation, which also occurs near the HBV polymerase active site, appeared to be less direct, potentially involving rearrangement of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate-binding pocket residues. These modeling results suggest that nucleotide analogs that are beta-D-enantiomers, that have the sulfur replaced by a smaller atom, or that have modified or acyclic ring systems may retain activity against lamivudine-resistant mutants, consistent with the observed susceptibility of these mutants to adefovir, <b>lobucavir,</b> and penciclovir in vitro and adefovir in vivo. status: publishe...|$|E

Hydroxyurea also caused marked increases in the activities of ACV, GCV, PCV, LBV, and H 2 G (compounds that depend for their activation on a virus-encoded thymidine kinase [TK]) against TK-deficient (TK(-)) HSV- 1.

Although 3 TC {{is one of the more}} effective antivirals, viral resistance may occur with monotherapy. To retain therapeutic benefit and avoid viral resistance, combination therapy is utilized. Therefore, 3 TC is necessarily coadministered with other therapeutic agents for primary infection and opportunistic sequelae. ^ The aims of this research were three-fold: (1) to determine the dose dependency of 3 TC renal clearance; (2) to identify involvement of nucleoside transporters in the renal disposition of 3 TC; and (3) to investigate the effects of nine clinically relevant compounds on 3 TC renal disposition. All experiments were conducted using the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPK) as a model of human renal disposition. ^ The clearance of 3 TC demonstrated dose dependence and exhibited evidence of active secretion and reabsorption. Observations were consistent with high-capacity, low-affinity secretion and low-capacity, high-affinity reabsorption. A model with two hyperbolic terms described the observed excretion ratio data as a function of perfusate 3 TC concentration, and predicted the observed urinary excretion rate data. ^ The involvement of a nucleoside transporter in the renal disposition of 3 TC was not supported. Following inhibition of the classical organic anion and cation transporters, thymidine was unable to effect a change in the observed reabsorption of 3 TC. The inability of thymidine to inhibit 3 TC reabsorption indicated that nucleoside transporters of the proximal tubule brush border did not influence the renal disposition of 3 TC. ^ Four of nine therapeutic compounds at clinically relevant concentrations caused statistically significant changes in the disposition of 3 TC. Investigational drug 1 and <b>lobucavir</b> decreased the net secretion of 3 TC, while investigational drug 2 and ribavirin increased the net secretion of 3 TC. Although statistically significant in IPK, in humans these drug interactions may not be clinically significant. Therefore, clinical investigations of these four compounds in combination with 3 TC are warranted. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) {{has been}} {{approved}} as an immunosuppressive agent in kidney transplant recipients and may thus be used concomitantly with antiherpetic agents, the latter {{for the treatment of}} intercurrent herpesvirus infections. The parent compound of MMF, mycophenolic acid (MPA), is a potent inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and causes depletion of the intracellular (deoxy) guanosine triphosphate [(d) GTP] pools. <b>Lobucavir</b> [1 R(1 alpha, 2 beta, 3 alpha) ]- 9 -[2, 3 -bis(hydroxymethyl) cyc lobutyl]guanine (LBV) is a novel antiviral agent with activity against ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) strains, that is in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of CMV infections. LBV triphosphate inhibits the viral DNA polymerase competitively with dGTP. We present the results of our studies on the antiviral effects of the combinations LBV + MMF and LBV + MPA. METHODS: The antiviral effects of LBV either alone or in combination with MMF or MPA on the replication of CMV, herpes simplex virus type- (HSV) 1 (HSV- 1), HSV- 2, and thymidine kinase-deficient HSV- 1 were studied by means of plaque or CPE reduction assays. RESULTS: When combined with LBV, MPA (at concentrations ranging from 0. 25 to 10 microg/ml, which are readily attainable in human plasma) markedly potentiated the antiviral efficacy of LBV against HSV- 1 and HSV- 2, that is a 10 - to 100 -fold decrease in EC 50. Moreover, the EC 50 of LBV against TK- HSV- 1 decreased up to 1400 -fold upon combination with MPA. MPA by itself had little or no effect on the replication of these viruses. Moreover, MPA and MMF resulted in a marked increase in the anti-CMV activity of LBV minimal FIC (FICmin: 0. 24 and 0. 26, respectively). Exogenously added guanosine reversed the potentiating effect of MPA on the antiviral activity of LBV, which indicates that this potentiating effect results from a depletion of the endogenous dGTP pools, thus favoring the inhibitory action of the LBV-triphosphate on the viral DNA polymerase. Ribavirin, another inhibitor of inosine monophosphate-dehydrogenase, also caused a marked enhancement of the antiviral activity of LBV against HSV- 1 (12 -fold), HSV- 2 (20 -fold), and TK- HSV- 1 (25 -fold). CONCLUSION: MMF markedly potentiates the activity of LBV against HSV- 1, HSV- 2, TK- HSV- 1, and CMV. This drug interaction may have important implications when using LBV in the treatment of intercurrent herpesvirus infections in transplant recipients under MMF therapy. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Drugs {{commonly}} {{administered to}} patients {{infected with the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been studied for their propensity to alter the intracellular phosphorylation of the anti-HIV nucleoside analog stavudine (2 ', 3 '-dideoxy- 2 ', 3 '-didehydrothymidine; d 4 T) in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) and U 937 cells in vitro. PBMCs isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers were stimulated by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (10 microg/ml) for 72 h. Stimulated PBMCs (3 x 10 (6) cells/plate) were then incubated with [3 H]d 4 T (0. 65 microCi; 3 microM) and either acyclovir, dapsone, ddC, ddI, fluconazole, foscarnet, ganciclovir, itraconazole, <b>lobucavir,</b> ranitidine, ribavirin, rifampin, sorivudine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, lamivudine (3 TC), zidovudine, or thymidine (30 and 300 microM) for 24 h. Doxorubicin and drugs showing some evidence of inhibition were also studied at 0. 3 and 3 microM. Cells were extracted overnight with 60 % methanol prior to analysis by radiometric high-performance liquid chromatography. Additional data for nine of the drugs were obtained by incubation with [3 H]d 4 T in U 937 cells for 24 h. The effect of d 4 T (0. 2 to 20 microM) on zidovudine (0. 65 microCi; 0. 018 microCi) phosphorylation was also studied. Zidovudine significantly reduced d 4 T total phosphates in PBMCs and U 937 cells (in PBMCs to 33 % [P < 0. 001] and 17 % [P < 0. 001] of that in control cells at 3 and 30 microM, respectively). A small reduction in zidovudine phosphorylation was seen with d 4 T but only at d 4 T:zidovudine ratios of 100 and 1, 000. Of the other compounds screened, only thymidine, ribavirin, and doxorubicin produced inhibition of d 4 T phosphorylation in both PBMCs and U 937 cells. However, doxorubicin was cytotoxic at 3 microM. The decrease in d 4 T phosphorylation in the presence of ribavirin is consistent with previous findings with zidovudine. Although ddC significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of d 4 T in PBMCs, this was not seen in U 937 cells, and it is probable that the findings in PBMCs are related to mitochondrial toxicity [based on 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay]. The only drugs screened which may interfere with d 4 T phosphorylation at clinically relevant concentrations were zidovudine, ribavirin, and doxorubicin...|$|E
40|$|Varicella zoster virus (VZV), {{a member}} of the {{herpesvirus}} family, is responsible for both primary (varicella, chickenpox) as well as reactivation (zoster, shingles) infections. In immunocompetent patients, the course of varicella is generally benign. For varicella zoster, post-herpetic neuralgia is the most common complication. In immunocompromised patients (particularly those with AIDS), transplant recipients and cancer patients, VZV infections can be life-threatening. For these patients and also for immunocompetent patients at risk such as pregnant women or premature infants, the current treatment of choice is based on either intravenous or oral aciclovir (acyclovir). The low oral bioavailability of aciclovir, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains, have stimulated efforts towards the development of new compounds for the treatment of individuals with VZV infections. Among these new compounds, penciclovir, its oral prodrug form famciclovir and the oral pro-drug form of aciclovir (valaciclovir), rank among the most promising. As with aciclovir itself, all of these drugs are dependent on the virus-encoded thymidine kinase (TK) for their intracellular activation (phosphorylation), and, upon conversion to their triphosphate form, they act as inhibitors/alternative substrate of the viral DNA polymerase. Therefore, cross-resistance to these drugs may be expected for those virus mutants that are TK-deficient and thus resistant to aciclovir. Other classes of nucleoside analogues dependent for their phosphorylation on the viral TK that have been pursued for the treatment of VZV infections include sorivudine, brivudine, fialuridine, fiacitabine and netivudine. Among oxetanocins, which are partially dependent on viral TK, <b>lobucavir</b> is now under clinical evaluation. Foscarnet, which does not require any previous metabolism to interact with the viral DNA polymerase, is used in the clinic when TK-deficient VZV mutants emerge during aciclovir treatment. TK-deficient mutants are also sensitive to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (i. e. [s]- 1 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl]cytosine; HPMPC); these agents do not depend on the virus-encoded TK for their phosphorylation but depend on cellular enzymes for conversion to their diphosphoryl derivatives which then inhibit viral DNA synthesis. Vaccination for VZV has now come of age. It is recommended for healthy children, patients with leukaemia, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or those with chronic diseases. The protection induced by the vaccine seems, to some extent, to include zoster and associated neuralgia. Passive immuniatin based on specific immunoglobulins does not effectively prevent VZV infection and is therefore restricted to high risk individuals (i. e. immunocompromised children and pregnant women). status: publishe...|$|E
