25|$|The song {{structure}} {{consists of}} four pushups, singing the chorus and verse through four times. In each chorus the melody is introduced or led off by the lead singer whose is then seconded by another singer who begins to vary the melody {{before the end of}} the leader's first line. They are then joined by the entire chorus for the rest of the pushup. Three down strokes or hard beats mark the end of the chorus and beginning of the verse, and during these drummers will alter their dancing such as by hopping low <b>like</b> <b>fancy</b> dancers. An increase in tempo and volume on the last five beats marks the end of the final verse. The dancing stops on the final beat and then a tail, or coda, finishes the song with a shortened chorus. Sometimes a drum group will sing the song more than four times, particularly when the song feels good and the singers seize the moment for an extra pushup or two (or more), or when a dancer blows a whistle or passes his staff or fan over the drum to signal that the song is to be continued four extra pushups while he prays.|$|E

A {{permanent}} work society numbering {{a few women}} otherwise unemployed may find a sufficient sale in the neighbourhood under the patronage of charitable ladies; but when you throw in ninety-five or one hundred pair of hands depending on their work for their livelihood, the supply must necessarily soon go beyond any demand, even fictitious. It will not do to think of these women <b>like</b> <b>fancy</b> knitters or embroiderers whose work is skilled.

5000|$|Fashion is {{a popular}} style or practice, {{especially}} in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style {{in which a person}} dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked to the term [...] "fashion", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses <b>like</b> <b>fancy</b> dress or masquerade wear, while [...] "fashion" [...] generally means clothing, including the study of it.

I'd like to get, like, a 100-piece orchestra and choirs and all that stuff. I think since Standing on the Shoulder of Giants we've been trying to prove a point of just bass, drums, guitar and vocals and nothing fancy. But I kind of <b>like</b> <b>fancy!</b> I'd like to make an absolutely fucking colossal album. You know? Like literally two orchestras, stuff like that." ...|$|E

It is lovely for luncheon sets, table covers or scarfs, and for finishing guest towels, and is especially effective on colored linens. In making towels one end might be finished with Italian hemstitching, {{and the other with}} plain hemstitching. One variation of the Italian work is to pull out two threads of material, leave four, pull eight, leave four, and pull two [...] Save the drawn threads and use them in making the hemstitching. In the rows where two threads were pulled. make plain hemstitching, in the other, catch each four threads together, then go over and fasten two of these groups together to form crosses...|$|R

5000|$|... 1). Plot good in {{structure}} and logicAll are adaptations of existing Chinese opera stories from authors before Tang {{instead of his}} own creation.2). Polished and well crafted lines/lyricsLesson learnt from Sun Yim Yeung Troupe.3). Melodies and scores well-receivedWong Yue Sang (see #1 above) and Chu Ngai Kong (see #4 above) came up {{with most of the}} well-known pieces.Mr. Wong Sum Fan (王心帆 1896 to August, 1992） refused to write lyrics, disliking those easy to sing modern melodies not written by the two above. (traditional versus easy for beginners, not veterans like Yam who can sing in a different way each and every time, to sing = 梆黃/小曲"易上口")4). Glamorous setting and costumes to matchEnticing to first time theatre-goers who are not knowledgeable. Especially when compared to rags to riches of The Story of the Lute which is known as the favorite of many performers. Glamor is opposite to tradition. Chinese opera (Xìqǔ) has been relying on no more than a table and two chairs as support for travelling performers with storylines, voices and skills to hold the audience's attention. Yam, for example, has been called the prevailing performer as (落拓窮酸書生) a scholar in rags. It was believed glamorous/fancy costume, just <b>like</b> <b>fancy</b> vocal style, would have made Yam less manly.5). Big castsFor example, Lam Kar Sing, the successor of Sit, along Leung Sing Bor and Lang Chi Bak. Most important was Yam Kim Fai as male lead exclusively on stage while Yam still worked with other co-stars in films. Why Not Return? in 1958 was also a breakthrough for Lam Kar Sing starring his first film, a Sit classic legacy title, opposite Fong (instead of a classmate). These four performers were also what some called [...] "film distributors could take to the bank".6). RehearsalsFollow the Sit tradition to rehearse till confident about hitting the ground running at debut.7). Sing and dance but duet instead of soloSee musical theatre - Tang's solution when the female lead could neither measure up to Fong/Hung nor hold her own court with vocal performances. (For example, from the January The Story of the Lute all the way up against September The Summer Snow in 1956.) While some, LGBT or not, in the audience enjoyed the arousing singing of the female lead, some (conservatives 良家婦女) opined that noises she made were obscene.8). Hanky-pankyWithout being pornographic or scandalous, hanky-panky of some sort, of two actresses. Shippers like Natalia Chan had expressed their 360 degree fantasy such as [...] "too bad they don't...." [...] while two sisters had a plan for their own boy toy. Ban on actors/actresses sharing the stage was lifted about 20 years before this. The interaction on stage between actors (or actress like Yam) in male lead roles and actresses in female lead roles were very modest.9). Happy ending (meet-date-marry-reunion in heaven if not on earth) ...|$|E
