According to the later folk image, Boone the trailblazer was too unsophisticated for the civilization which followed him and which eventually defrauded him of his land. Boone was not the simple frontiersman of legend, however: he engaged in land speculation on a large scale, buying and selling claims {{to tens of thousands}} of acres. The <b>land</b> <b>market</b> in frontier Kentucky was chaotic, and Boone's ventures ultimately failed because his investment strategy was faulty and because his sense of honor made him reluctant to profit at someone else's expense.

While {{the evolution of}} <b>land</b> <b>markets</b> is expected to promote deforestation activities by rural households, we find no sizeable impact, due to two major reasons. First, land transactions occur in cultural and spatial isolation from forest encroachment. Second, the emergence of speculative <b>land</b> <b>markets,</b> which could accelerate deforestation, is evaded through institutional constraints, primarily weak property rights on land. However, while <b>land</b> <b>markets</b> do not promote deforestation, they also do not deter forestland appropriation, because of ambiguous legal frameworks...|$|R
40|$|Based on a 2001 survey, {{this study}} finds {{increased}} disparities in land distribution in rural Zhejiang. Regression analyses yield three main findings.

Widening disparities in land rights and farm income, however, did not constitute a further retreat from equality, but instead had compensatory effects on overall inequality, as <b>land</b> <b>markets</b> brought up families who would have fallen {{at the lower end of}} income distribution in the absence of such <b>markets.</b> Third, <b>land</b> <b>markets</b> increased efficiency in farming, as households who acquired land were using it more productively.

2500|$|A common {{argument}} is that Europe had more free and efficient markets than other civilizations, which has been cited {{as a reason for}} the Great Divergence. In Europe, market efficiency was disrupted by the prevalence of feudalism and mercantilism. Practices such as entail, which restricted land ownership, hampered the free flow of labor and buying and selling of land. These feudal restrictions on land ownership were especially strong in continental Europe. China had a relatively more liberal <b>land</b> <b>market,</b> hampered only by weak customary traditions. Bound labor, such as serfdom and slavery were more prevalent in Europe than in China, even during the Manchu conquest. Urban industry in the West was more restrained by guilds and state-enforced monopolies than in China, where in the 18th century the principal monopolies governed salt and foreign trade through Guangzhou. [...] Pomeranz rejects the view that market institutions were the cause of the Great Divergence, and concludes that China was closer to the ideal of a market economy than Europe.|$|E
2500|$|After the Aztec {{capital was}} destroyed, Cortés {{remained}} in Coyoacan {{and made it}} the first capital of New Spain from 1521 to 1523. During the colonial period, the village remained independent of Mexico City, separated by farmland and lakes, filled with haciendas and monasteries. This allowed the area to maintain many of its plazas and narrow cobblestone streets to this day. During the sixteenth century and into the seventeenth, there was an active Spanish <b>land</b> <b>market</b> in Coyoacan, with many bills of sale in Nahuatl found in the archives. Rebecca Horn found over 100 such bills of sale naming Nahua men and women selling to Spaniards. [...] Natives also dictated last wills and testaments in Nahuatl the colonial era, which further contribute {{to our understanding of}} continuities and changes in Nahuas' situation in the colonial era. The altepetl (town) of Coyoacan continued to assess tribute {{on the basis of the}} size of a person's land holdings long after Spaniards had switched to a head tax. The earliest extant native pictorial of Coyoacan, the so-called Códice de Coyoacan, dating from a 1553 visita (inspection) gives a baseline for tribute and labor.|$|E
2500|$|There is, however, {{very clear}} {{evidence}} that Eleanor's property dealings made her widely unpopular. John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury warned Eleanor that her activities in the <b>land</b> <b>market</b> and her association with the highly unpopular moneylenders caused outcry, gossip, rumour and scandal across the realm. [...] Given the chroniclers' passages quoted above, the accusation is indeed borne out by contemporary writers. Peckham also warned her of complaints against her officials' demands upon her tenants. Eleanor must {{have been aware of}} the truth of such reports since, on her deathbed, she asked Edward to name justices to examine her officials' actions and make reparations. The surviving proceedings from this inquest reveal a pattern of ruthless exactions, often (but not always) without Eleanor's knowledge. Her executors' financial accounts record the payments of reparations to many of those who brought actions before the judicial proceedings in 1291. [...] In her lifetime, Eleanor had righted such wrongs when she heard of them, and her deathbed request of Edward indicates that she knew, suspected, or feared, that her officials had perpetrated many more transgressions than were ever reported to her.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Using a 2001 provincial survey, we {{find that}} disparities in land-rights {{distribution}} have greatly increased in rural China, {{and the growth of}} <b>land</b> <b>markets</b> is directly responsible for that. The <b>land</b> <b>markets</b> tend to concentrate land in those who can more efficiently use it. This translates disparities in land-rights distribution to magnified inequality in farm income. However, such widening disparities caused by <b>land</b> <b>markets</b> have compensatory effects on overall rural inequality, as <b>land</b> <b>markets</b> tend to bring up families who would fall at the bottom of income distribution in the absence of such markets.

2500|$|In 1392 Cokayne was {{party to}} an {{important}} donation intended to fund a chantry at St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne. On 18 March he, together with John Kniveton, Roger Bradbourne and Richard Cokayne, granted rents worth 100 shillings {{a year from the}} manor of Mercaston to William Hyde, the church's chaplain. In this, they were acting as feoffees for Nicholas Kniveton and the purpose of the chantry was to pray for the souls of the Kniveton family, who were probably relatives of the Cokaynes. Cokayne was involved in the process over some time, as he had witnessed the transfer by feoffees of the Mercaston estate to Johanna, the widow of Nicholas Kniveton, in June 1391. As was customary, the souls of others concerned in the grant were included, and in this case John, Duke of Aquitaine and Lancaster was named, as the manor was held of him, together with John Sheppey, the Dean of Lincoln, who confirmed the grant. Hyde paid £20 for the licence to accept the alienation in mortmain of the rents, a costly privilege because the property passed thereby outside the <b>land</b> <b>market</b> and beyond most royal taxation. With reference to a later donation to set up a chantry at Ashbourne for the Bradbourne family, the local historian Susan Wright comments on the peculiar [...] "intensity of relations, including much intermarriage, among those families with manors between the Dove valley and Derby in the Peak foothills" [...] which was both celebrated and created through such rituals.|$|E
60|$|But {{this money}} that flowed in upon him was {{immediately}} poured {{back into his}} other investments. The need for electric cars {{was so great that}} he installed his own shops for building them. And even on the rising <b>land</b> <b>market,</b> he continued to buy choice factory sites and building properties. On the advice of Wilkinson, practically every electric road already in operation was rebuilt. The light, old fashioned rails were torn out and replaced by the heaviest that were manufactured. Corner lots, on the sharp turns of narrow streets, were bought and ruthlessly presented to the city in order to make wide curves for his tracks and high speed for his cars. Then, too, there were the main-line feeders for his ferry system, tapping every portion of Oakland, Alameda, and Berkeley, and running fast expresses to the pier end. The same large-scale methods were employed in the water system. Service of the best was needed, if his huge land investment was to succeed. Oakland had to be made into a worth-while city, and that was what he intended to do. In addition to his big hotels, he built amusement parks for the common people, and art galleries and club-house country inns for the more finicky classes. Even before there was any increase in population, a marked increase in street-railway traffic took place. There was nothing fanciful about his schemes. They were sound investments.|$|E
