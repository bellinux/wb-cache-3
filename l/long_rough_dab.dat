5000|$|Like the European plaice, the American plaice {{is a right}} eyed {{flatfish}} {{belonging to}} the Pleuronectidae family. American plaice are an Atlantic species, which range from southern Labrador to Rhode Island. They are also found in Europe, where they are called rough dab or <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab.</b> They spawn in the Gulf of Maine, with peak activity in April and May. They are brown or reddish, and are generally smaller than European plaice, with a rougher skin and larger scales. Their maximum recorded length is 82.6 cm (32.5 inches), and maximum reported age 30 years. They are usually found between depths of 90 metres and 250 metres, on sandy bottoms with temperatures between -0.5 and 2.5°C. They feed on small fishes and invertebrates.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the diet of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> in three different fjords with and without red king crab. The hypothesis is that red king crab are influencing the diet and possible also growth of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab.</b> By the applying objectives it is assumed to give an answer to if red king crab is influencing different aspects of the diet and growth in <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab.</b> By the applied frequency of occurrence and weight % analyses there were found small differences in the <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> diet. There was a dominance of different Crustacea and some Polychaeta prey groups. The main differences between the fjords was high dominance by fish, Bivalvia and Pandalidae in Porsanger, and little dominance of fish and Bivalvia prey groups in Balsfjord. A diet shift with increased predator length were recognized in both Balsfjord, Kvænangen and Porsanger <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> diet. The shift in Balsfjord were from a Crustacea dominance to Polychaeta and Crustacea dominance. Kvænangen with the opposite result. Porsanger having the most diverse diet in regard to prey groups contributing to the energy budget. The diet shift is towards a more fish and Pandalidae dominated diet. There were found small differences in growth in the three populations of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab,</b> with Porsanger material being in slightly better condition. There is by this study not found indication of an impact of red king crab on diet and growth in <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab.</b> Though there is assumed that the low size of the cod stock in Porsanger, might let the <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> to include more fish and Pandalidae into their diet. This is relative high energetic prey which might held the growth rate up in a situation where the ecosystem are in change. In a situation with a large cod stock in a fjord area, there might possible be a larger influence of red king crab on the diet and growth in a population of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab.</b> Keywords: <b>Long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab,</b> Hippoglossoides platessoides, diet, growth, red king crab influence...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown {{differences}} in life history features of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> Hippoglossoides platessoides among populations of the North Atlantic. Here, length frequency distributions from commercial catches and age information from otolith readings are used to compare <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> from the North Sea and the West of Scotland. Catch data from the Scottish demersal fisheries show differences in the length distribution of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> between the 2 areas, with large fish (> 20 cm) more prevalent in the North Sea. The maximum length of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> observed in commercial catches is 8 cm greater in the North Sea, where otolith readings indicate that the species has a greater longevity. Growth models suggest that <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> of age 3 + are significantly smaller in the West of Scotland. Potential explanations for the observed contrasts in hie history features include spatial differences in temperature-related metabolic costs, food availability, sex ratios (males tend to be smaller), or age-specific loss rates (emigration or mortality). Of these, we conclude that the hypothesis involving temperature-dependent metabolic costs is the least likely explanation...|$|E
40|$|A {{baseline}} study of contaminants in fish and sediments from the Barents Sea {{was carried out}} by Institute of Marine Research (IMR) {{as a part of the}} Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme, AMAP. Sediment samples from 140 stations covering the whole Barents Sea were analysed for selected diaromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (P AH). The concentrations found were lower than typical levels found at more southern latitudes such as in deposition areas of the North Sea, but higher than expected background levels. Concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), one of the PAHs of most concern due to its toxicity, ranged from < 1 to 40 ng/g dry weight. Alkylated C 2 - napthalenes were found in highest concentrations in sediments around Svalbard (range < 1 - 2330 ng/g dw). Perylene concentrations ranged from < 1 to 300 ng/g dw. Same of the highest levels of BaP were found in the ice melting zone. This may indicate that ice plays an important role in the transport and distribution of same aromatic hydrocarbons in the Arctic. Long range transport of air pollutants originating from fossil fuel burning is most likely the dominating source of unsubstituted PAH found in Barents Sea sediments. Fish species given priority in the AMAP monitoring plan for the marine environment include cod (Gadus morhua), polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and lang <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> (Hippoglossoides platessoides). A total of 400 fish representing these three species were analysed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (DDTs, HCHs, HCB and chlordanes). Contaminant concentrations found in the fish livers were significantly higher in cod than in polar cod and lang <b>rough</b> <b>dab.</b> PCB concentrations, expressed as the sum of 13 congeners on a ng/g wet weight basis, were in the ranges 94 - 685, 36 - 114 and 8 - 60 for cod, polar cod and lang <b>rough</b> <b>dab,</b> respectively. DDT (sum of p'p-DDD, p'p-DDE and p'p-DDT) ranges were 67 - 344, for cod, 8 - 50 for polar cod and 5 - 33 for lang <b>rough</b> <b>dab.</b> Chlordane concentration (sum of four compounds) ranged from 39 to 207 for cod, from 21 to 54 for polar cod, and from 6 to 35 for lang <b>rough</b> <b>dab.</b> HCH (sum of three compounds) concentrations found were 3 - 17, 7 - 15, and 2 - 8 ng/ g wet weight respectively, for the three species. Feeding habits and migration patterns are likely explanations for this observed interspecies variation. There are few local sources of PCBs and pesticides within the Arctic region. Most of these compounds find their way into the Barents Sea ecosystem through lang range transport from industrial and agricultural areas further south...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{data from}} Norwegian and Russian bottom trawl surveys in the years 1988 - 1993, the paper {{considers}} distribution, population structure, growth and reproduction of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> (Hippoglossoides platessoides) of the Barents Sea. Based on effort statistics from the commercial fleet and data from commercial trawlers hired or inspected by Norwegian authorities, the paper also gives a preliminary evaluation of the resource potential. <b>Long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> was the most abundant flatfish at moderate depth in the Barents Sea and the abundance increased during the period 1988 - 1993, particularly in the outer part of the distribution area. This increase in abundance and distribution area was probably largely caused by the very strong 1986 year class. Eastern, northern and shallow areas were dominated by relatively small fish. Spawning occurred over wide areas, but the fishes {{in the northern part}} may to some extent have migrated to spawning grounds further south. Males reached 50 % maturation at age 5 and females at age 10. The growth rates of males and females were almost linear and not very different for age groups less than 10. Mortality was higher for males and nearly all fish older than 10 years were female. The results indicated that growth rate for the very strong 1986 year class was density dependent. The estimated total biomass of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> in the Barents Sea increased from 70 000 metric tons in 1988 to more than 200 000 tons in 1993. The bycatch of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> in the Norwegian fisheries was estimated to less than 1000 tons. The total catch of <b>long</b> <b>rough</b> <b>dab</b> in the Barents Sea was probably less than 0. 2 % of the standing biomass.
