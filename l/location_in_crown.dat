50|$|Being {{a bedroom}} community, Lake Station welcomed Abraham Lincoln to its Audubon Hotel, perhaps {{on more than}} one occasion, {{according}} to oral history. But George Pullman, who tried to negotiate for land in Lake Station for his proposed railcar company, never struck a deal and set up shop {{on the south side of}} Chicago instead. Prior to its current <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>Crown</b> Point, Indiana, the county seat was located on what is now the west end of Lake Station in a section called Liverpool, although it was a separate settlement at the time.|$|E
50|$|The {{department}} store's <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>Crown</b> Center {{was conceived}} in 1973. It {{was part of}} the continued revitalization of downtown envisioned by J. C. Hall, associated with development surrounding Hallmark's corporate headquarters that had begun in earnest in 1967. Halls Crown Center replaced the original downtown Halls with a three-level, 100000 sq ft store designed by Paul László. In 2011, both the first and second floor of Halls Crown Center were converted to an aquarium from Sea Life Centres and a Legoland Discovery Centre in a combined $30 million project. The displaced men's department and Hallmark Cards location were relocated to the Crown Center Shops while the women's department stayed in its original third floor location.|$|E
40|$|Urban forest {{health was}} {{surveyed}} on Roznik in Ljubljana (46. 05141 N, 14. 47797 E) in 2013 by two methods: ICP Forests and UFMO. ICP Forests is {{most commonly used}} monitoring programme in Europe - the International Co-operative Programme on the Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests, {{which is based on}} systematic grid. UFMO method - Urban Forests Management Oriented method was developed in the frame of EMoNFUr Project - Establishing a monitoring network to assess lowland forest and urban plantations in Lombardy and urban forest in Slovenia (LIFE 10 ENV/IT/ 000399). UFMO is based on non-linear transects (GPS tracks). ICP forests monitoring plots were established in July 2013 in the urban forest Roznik in Ljubljana. The 32 plots are located on sampling grid 500 × 500 m. The grid was down-scaled from the National Forest Monitoring survey, which bases on national sample grid 4 × 4 km. With the ICP forests method the following parameters for each tree within the 15 plots were gathered according to the ICP forests manual for Visual assessment of crown condition and damaging agents: tree species, percentage of defoliation, affected part of the tree, specification of affected part, <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>crown,</b> symptom, symptom specification, causal agents / factors, age of damage, damage extent, and damage extent on the trunk. With the UFMO method, the following parameters for each tree that needed sylviculture measure (felling, pruning, sanitary felling, thinning, etc.) were recorded: tree species, breast diameter, causal agent / damaging factor, GPS waypoint and GPS track. For overall picture in the urban forest health problems, also other biotic and abiotic damaging factors that did not require management action were recorded...|$|E

40|$|Variation in needle {{nutrient}} concentrations {{with age}} and vertical <b>location</b> <b>in</b> the <b>crown</b> was studied <b>in</b> three Scots pine stands growing on peat soils in eastern Finland. The concentrations of N, P, Fe and Zn decreased down the crown and those of Ca and Mn increased. Potassium and magnesium concentration patterns differed between sites. Potassium and Mg concentrations were highest in the current needles at all heights <b>in</b> the <b>crown,</b> which was presumably due to retranslocation from the older needles. Calcium, iron and manganese concentrations were highest in the oldest needles. The concentrations of N, P and Zn did not vary with needle age. The results {{emphasized the importance of}} careful selection of sampling point for needle nutrient analysis <b>in</b> the <b>crown</b> of Scots pine...|$|R
50|$|The 1940s and 1950s brought {{considerable}} {{change to}} the law school. After World War II caused the law school's enrollment to drop to fewer than 30 students, the school quickly expanded once the war ended in 1945. A {{move to a new}} <b>location</b> <b>in</b> the Outer Quadrangle, as well as the 1948 opening of the law school dormitory Crothers Hall (the result of a donation by Stanford Law graduate George E. Crothers), allowed the school to grow, while the 1948 inaugural publication of the Stanford Law Review (helmed by future U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher '49) helped to augment the law school's national reputation. The decision that Stanford should remain a small law school with a very limited enrollment emerged during this period. For the third time in its history, the law school relocated in the 1970s, this time to its current <b>location</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Crown</b> Quadrangle.|$|R
30|$|Variation in seed {{germination}} reflects adaptations to site conditions (Grime et al. 1981; Nishitani and Masuzawa 1996), which strongly influence seedling growth and survival. Variability in the germination response of seeds from different provenances, populations, individuals {{of the same}} population, or from different <b>locations</b> <b>in</b> the <b>crown</b> of the same individual tree is well known (Silvertown 1984; Martin et al. 1995; Schütz and Milberg 1997; Mamo et al. 2006). Provenances, particularly in deciduous species, from warmer climates are adapted to the longer growing season that occurs at lower elevations but suffer from early or late frosts when moved into higher elevations (Broadhurst and Boshier 2014). As {{a result of this}} polymorphic germination response, not all seeds may respond equally to a given stimulus. Indeed, population polymorphic germination responses {{have been found to be}} greater in unpredictable environments than in less variable ones (Meyer and Allen 1999).|$|R

40|$|Foliar {{analysis}} {{is a valuable}} tool for evaluating the pollution status of forests. However, the use of foliar diagnosis in large-scale surveys is a complicated process owing to the high variability within the crown. The method used to express foliar concentrations has often been found to diminish the variability. The effect of the method used to express element concentrations on the spatial variability of cadmium (Cd) in the leaves of crack willow (Salix fragilis L.) was investigated by sampling the leaves of one willow at 292 <b>locations</b> <b>in</b> the <b>crown,</b> each sampling location having a volume of 0. 027 m 3 (0. 3 m × 0. 3 m × 0. 3 m). Cadmium showed a distinct spatial trend <b>in</b> the <b>crown</b> of the tree. Concentrations as low as 2. 4 mg kg- 1 dry weight (DW) or 23. 1 mg kg- 1 dry ash weight (DAW) were obtained {{in the top of}} the crown, and 10. 6 mg kg- 1 DW or 73. 0 mg kg- 1 DAW in the bottom of the crown. The lower relative standard deviation and weaker correlation with the sampling height support the use of DAW in large-scale surveys especially. The lower variability of the DAW Cd concentration makes this variable less sensitive to fluctuations caused by differences in growing conditions and sampling methodology. However, the majority of publications in this field report metal concentrations on a DW basis. Therefore, the restrictions set on the use of results expressed on a DAW basis in large-scale surveys of foliar metal concentrations have to be offset against the advantages offered by a reduction of the variability in metal concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Siberian fir seeds often {{lose their}} germinating {{capacity}} during storage. This results from, among other factors, changing contents of nitrogen compounds in the seeds, {{especially those of}} protein fractions. This paper focuses on analyzing changes of these compounds in nonviable seeds of the species depending on ecological and conditions and stand location, {{as well as on}} tree growth class (Kraft growth classes I and IV). The contents of the total and protein nitrogen in the nonviable seeds of the trees of growth classes I and IV appeared to vary widely and to depend on stand location and seed <b>location</b> <b>in</b> the tree <b>crown.</b> The maximum contents were in the seeds located in {{the upper part of the}} crown. The seeds from the middle and lower crown parts contained much less total and protein nitrogen. The hard-to-solve protein fraction dominated over other protein fraction in the seeds from the upper part of the crowns of the trees of growth classes I and IV. However, this fraction, like prolamines, changed uniformly throughout the crowns, whereas seed glutelin content varied insignificantly among the crown parts. Albumins and globulins showed a uniform crown top-to-bottom decrease. A comparison of viable seed with unviable seeds for contents of the nitrogen forms revealed a marked decrease in the total and protein nitrogen in the latter, especially for the trees of growth class IV. The seeds that lost their germinating capacity exhibited increasingly hard-to-solve protein fraction and drastically decreasing albumins and globulins wherever the seeds were <b>in</b> the <b>crown.</b> Their glutelin and prolamine contents changed inconsiderably. The changes of the quantitative ratio between the protein fractions found by the study cause, along with other physiological and biochemical factors, the loss of viability of Siberian fir seeds during storage...|$|R
