5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, {{on the grounds that}} the game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E

5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
