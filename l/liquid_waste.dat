40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>wastes</b> is still current {{not only in}} Poland, {{but also in the}} world. The primary source of <b>liquid</b> <b>wastes</b> are single-family and multi-family houses. To a lesser extent, public service or {{production}} facilities, mainly in urban areas, are equipped with no-outlet reservoirs. Low concentrations in <b>liquid</b> <b>wastes</b> and their high density are often some difficulty to work with not only by sewage treatment plants, but also collection points. Therefore, the knowledge of the composition of <b>liquid</b> <b>wastes</b> supplied to the collection points is important. The paper presents the results of research as well as variability of concentrations of selected parameters of <b>liquid</b> <b>wastes</b> supplied to the collection point in Bialystok, that accepts both municipal and industrial sewage. Statistical processing of the obtained results and those derived from The Waterworks Bialystok showed the presence of high variability of total suspended matter and electrolytic conductivity as well as organic impurities expressed as BOD 5 and COD...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to study {{the impact of the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>wastes</b> from food {{processing}} industries on the quality of receiving streams. <b>Liquid</b> <b>wastes</b> from two food processing industries were analyzed into their organic components to determine their conformity with national and international standards. The results of the <b>liquid</b> <b>wastes</b> analysis showed that the organic parameters: biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and dissolved oxygen (DO) all violate the Nigerian Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) standard. It was concluded that industrial activities if not properly monitored and controlled normally lead to environmental pollution and degradation.

In 1852 Paris had 142 kilometers of sewers, which could carry only <b>liquid</b> <b>waste.</b> Containers of solid waste were picked up each night by people called vidangeurs, who carried it to waste dumps {{on the outskirts of}} the city. The tunnels he designed were intended to be clean, easily accessible, and substantially larger than the previous Parisian underground.

Mission Control noticed a {{reduction}} in the flow from the nozzle that vents the waste water into space. The tank can hold 165 pounds of <b>liquid</b> <b>waste</b> and the crew only managed to get it down to about 80 pounds. Later in the day, astronauts used the camera on Orbital Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to survey the condition of the nozzle. Since no ice was found, Flight Controllers told the crew that it is likely that there is a blockage in the line.|$|E
25|$|By the 16th century, cesspits and cesspools were {{increasingly}} {{dug into the}} ground near houses in Europe {{as a means of}} collecting waste, as urban populations grew and street gutters became blocked with the larger volume of human waste. Rain was no longer sufficient to wash away waste from the gutters. A pipe connected the latrine to the cesspool, and sometimes a small amount of water washed waste through. Cesspools were cleaned out by tradesmen, who pumped out <b>liquid</b> <b>waste,</b> then shovelled out the solid waste and collected it during the night. This solid waste, euphemistically known as Nightsoil, was sold as fertilizer for agricultural production (similarly to the closing-the-loop approach of ecological sanitation).|$|E

The process analysis, conducted by performing mass balances on the proposed scheme, has shown that in the case study examined, the treatments carried out (with the removal efficiencies assumed from the literature) are able to produce an effluent, whose concentra-tions are within the limits of the law dictated by the Italian Legislative Decree n. 152 / 06 for discharge in surface water...|$|R

Through lax environmental laws {{set up in}} developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing {{is still one of}} the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 20000 cubics of <b>liquid</b> <b>waste</b> daily. (Stanko, 2013) The daily life of local people is significantly affected as Buriganga River is their source of bathing, irrigation and transportation. Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.|$|E
