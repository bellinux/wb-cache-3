40|$|ABSTRACT:- This paper mainly {{focuses on}} <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> counting. In this paper a novel <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> counter is proposed. New Boolean {{expressions}} are derived {{for the new}} <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> counter. We can explore various designs of <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> counting unit by using the proposed approach. When compared with the known architectures the new circuits can be implemented effectively in both static and dynamic logic and also requires less energy per operation. The proposed <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> counter can also be integrated with a <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> anticipation logic for better and fast results. Finally, a simple and effective Leading Zero Counter was proposed and the occupancy rate and the delay characteristics are investigated...|$|R
5000|$|One or more <b>leading</b> <b>zeroes</b> {{from any}} groups of {{hexadecimal}} digits are removed; {{this is usually}} done to either all or none of the <b>leading</b> <b>zeroes.</b> For example, the group 0042 is converted to 42.|$|R
50|$|For example, using Σ = { 0,1 }, {{the regular}} {{expression}} (0+1+ε)⋅(0+1) denotes {{the set of}} all binary numbers {{with one or two}} digits (<b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> allowed), while 1⋅(0+1)*⋅0 denotes the (infinite) set of all even binary numbers (no <b>leading</b> <b>zeroes).</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{format of}} trade plate numbers {{comprises}} three digits (with <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> if necessary) followed by one, {{two or three}} letters denoting the location of issue, using pre-2001 format codes.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} table {{shows the}} HP RPL character set. Each character is shown {{with a potential}} Unicode equivalent and its decimal code. Where special HP TIO codes are defined to enter the character, they are given as well. The other characters can be entered using the \nnn TIO code syntax with nnn being a three-digit decimal number (with <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> if necessary) of the corresponding code point.|$|E
500|$|The {{definition}} can {{be extended}} by defining [...] Extended in this way, this function {{is related to the}} number of <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> of the 32-bit unsigned binary representation of , [...]|$|E
50|$|The <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> must be dialled from abroad.|$|R
2500|$|The {{reason this}} method is used is because an unmodified CRC does not {{distinguish}} between two messages which differ only {{in the number of}} <b>leading</b> <b>zeroes,</b> because <b>leading</b> <b>zeroes</b> do not affect the value of [...] [...] When this inversion is done, the CRC does distinguish between such messages.|$|R

500|$|The integer binary {{logarithm}} can {{be interpreted}} as the zero-based index of the most significant [...] bit in the input. In this sense it is the complement of the find first set operation, which finds the index of the least significant [...] bit. Many hardware platforms include support for finding the number of <b>leading</b> <b>zeros,</b> or equivalent operations, which can be used to quickly find the binary logarithm. The fls and flsl functions in the Linux kernel and in some versions of the libc software library also compute the binary logarithm (rounded up to an integer, plus one).|$|E

2500|$|Hexadecimal 20AC is binary [...] The two <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> {{are added}} because, as the scheme table shows, a three-byte {{encoding}} needs exactly sixteen bits from the code point.|$|E
2500|$|In {{certain areas}} of {{computer}} science, a modified base k positional system is used, called bijective numeration, with digits 1, 2,..., k (...) , and zero being represented by an empty string. This establishes a bijection between the set of all such digit-strings and the set of non-negative integers, avoiding the non-uniqueness caused by <b>leading</b> <b>zeros.</b> Bijective base-k numeration is also called k-adic notation, {{not to be confused}} with p-adic numbers. Bijective base1 is the same as unary.|$|E

50|$|Some {{highways}} {{are numbered}} with a <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> (e.g. G030).|$|R
2500|$|Scientific {{notation}} also enables simpler order-of-magnitude comparisons. A proton's mass is [...] If {{written as}} , {{it is easier}} to compare this mass with that of an electron, given below. [...] The order of magnitude of the ratio of the masses can be obtained by comparing the exponents instead of the more error-prone task of counting the <b>leading</b> <b>zeros.</b> [...] In this case, −27 is larger than −31 and therefore the proton is roughly four orders of magnitude ( [...] times) more massive than the electron.|$|E
2500|$|Durations {{define the}} amount of {{intervening}} time in a time interval and are represented by the format PYMDTHMS or PW as shown to the right. [...] In these representations, the [...] is replaced by the value {{for each of the}} date and time elements that follow the [...] [...] <b>Leading</b> <b>zeros</b> are not required, but the maximum number of digits for each element should be agreed to by the communicating parties. [...] The capital letters P, Y, M, W, D, T, H, M, and S are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced.|$|E
2500|$|This {{code was}} invented in 1880 by Sir William Watson Rutherford (1853–1927). [...] At the time, the British Post Office did not allow digits or ciphers in telegrams, but they did allow Latin words. [...] This method also allowed moves for two games to be {{transmitted}} at the same time. [...] In this method, the legal moves in the position were counted using a system until the move being made was reached. This was done for both games. [...] The move number of the first game was multiplied by 60 and added to the move number of the second game. [...] <b>Leading</b> <b>zeros</b> were added as necessary to give a four-digit number. [...] The first two digits would be 00 through 39, which corresponded to a table of 40 Latin roots. [...] The third digit corresponded {{to a list of}} 10 Latin prefixes and the last digit corresponded to a list of 10 Latin suffixes. [...] The resulting word was transmitted.|$|E

50|$|The <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> {{is always}} omitted when {{dialling}} {{from outside the}} country.|$|R
50|$|The count {{trailing}} zeros operation {{would return}} 3, while the count <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> operation returns 16. The count <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> operation {{depends on the}} word size: if this 32-bit word were truncated to a 16-bit word, count <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> would return zero. The find first set operation would return 4, indicating the 4th position from the right. The log base 2 is 15.|$|E
50|$|Below is a flowchart. <b>Leading</b> <b>zeros</b> are retained, {{however the}} only {{difference}} when <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> are discarded is that instead of 099 connecting to 891, we get 99 connecting to 0.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{table is}} applicable when <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> are retained.http://kaprekar.sourceforge.net/output/sample.php If <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> are discarded, {{the only difference}} is that the 09→81→63→27→45 cycle for digit length 2 does not occur, because then 54 − 45 = 9 (instead of 09), and 9 − 9 = 0, so all 2-digit sequences will instead end in 0. When <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> are retained, only repdigits will result in 0.|$|E
5000|$|If one <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> {{is added}} to 1510, it becomes a {{palindromic}} number.|$|R
