5000|$|Nominal design {{engine running}} time was 20 seconds at full thrust of [...] {{generating}} {{the equivalent of}} [...] [...] Keller stated that the Goodyear Tire Company restricted their top speed to 700 mi/h km/h. Reaction Dynamics subsequently modified the <b>LNG</b> <b>flow</b> in the two-stage LNG injector system to almost halve the maximum thrust. [...] The actual thrust during the record runs was between 13,000 lbs kg of [...] and 15,000 lbs kg. According to Keller the kilometer timing traps were inside the mile. The Blue Flame's record runs involved accelerating continuously to the mile midpoint, then coasting through the mile. The peak speed, of approximately 650 mi/h km/h was reached at that point and then the vehicle decelerated {{the rest of the}} way. The kilometer speed trap was biased towards one end of the mile, resulting in the 8 mi/h km/h higher speed.|$|E
40|$|The {{new system}} {{proposed}} here, compresses BOG to about 0. 9 MPa by a low-pressure compressor, and liquefies BOG by mixing with LNG. Since {{the pressure of}} the liquefied BOG is raised to the send-out pressure with LNG pumps, this system can save the electric power of BOG compression by 30 - 60 % compared with a conventional high-pressure system. Furthermore this system also adopts cold energy storage (CES) technology to liquefy a constant volume of BOG under fluctuations of <b>LNG</b> <b>flow</b> rate caused by daily demand fluctuations. ...|$|E
40|$|When {{using the}} cooling {{capacity}} of LNG several thermodynamic schemes are proposable employing conventional and non conventional conversion cycles. All conventional systems {{make use of}} organic working fluids such as methane or propane in series of Rankine cycles used in a cascading mode. A simpler system is available, using a single cycle and a single fluid in a Brayton cycle. However ordinary Brayton cycles exhibit a modest efficiency. Resorting to Brayton cycles with strong real gas effects (which is possible selecting the base parameters of pressure and temperature {{in the vicinity of}} the critical point) improves considerable cycle performance. Since the level of cold in a <b>LNG</b> <b>flow</b> is thermodynamically predetermined, working fluids must be selected with a critical point which fit the LNG thermal capacity, i. e. some 5 – 15 C higher than the usual LNG temperature which is around − 160 °C.

40|$|Supply shocks in {{the global}} gas market might affect {{countries}} differently since the market is regionally interlinked but not perfectly integrated. Additionally, high supply side concentration might expose countries to market power in different ways. To evaluate the strategic position of importing countries concerning gas supplies we disentangle import prices to price increasing and decreasing factors. Since the interrelations on the global gas market are complex we use an equilibrium model programmed as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP) and simulate the blockage of <b>LNG</b> <b>flows</b> through the Strait of Hormuz. This enables us account for the oligopolistic nature and the asymmetry of the gas supply side. We fi nd that Japan faces the most severe price increases as it completely relies on LNG supply. In contrast, European countries like the UK bene fit from a good interconnection to the continental pipeline system and significant domestic price-taking production, both of which help to mitigate an increase in physical costs of supply {{as well as the}} exercise of market power...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The leakage of {{cryogenic}} LNG through {{cracks in}} the insulation membrane of an LNG carrier causes the hull structure to experience a cold spot {{as a result of}} the heat transfer from the LNG. The hull structure will become brittle at this cold spot and the evaporated natural gas may potentially lead to a hazard because of its flammability. This paper presents a computational model for the <b>LNG</b> <b>flow</b> and heat diffusion in an LNG insulation panel subject to leakage. The temperature distribution in the insulation panel and the speed of gas diffusion through it are simulated to assess the safety level of an LNG carrier subject that experiences a leak. The behavior of the leaked LNG is modeled using a multiphase flow that considers the mixture of liquid and gas. The simulation model considers the phase change of the LNG, gas-liquid multiphase interactions in the porous media, and accompanying rates of heat transfer. It is assumed that the NO 96 -GW membrane storage is composed of glass wool and plywood for the numerical simulation. In the numerical simulation, the seepage, heat diffusion, and evaporation of the LNG are investigated. It is found that the diffusion speed of the leakage is very high to accelerate the evaporation of the LNG...|$|E
40|$|LNG {{utilization}} in ship propulsion {{seems to}} offer significative reduction in operational costs and environmental impact even in ships other than LNG carriers. However, still different technological aspects {{have to be}} in deep investigated in order to define a general LNG system design approach. In this study the installation of a B-type tank for gas propulsion in ships other than LNG carriers has been considered. LNG composition, Boil Off Gas (BOG) production and pressure variation during ship sailing have been analyzed. In particular, an analysis on a specific vessel during its trip has been carried out in order to obtain BOG production, gas composition and then its characteristics such as heating value and Methane Number. Three different gas composition and three different tank insulations have been considered. Results show high changes of gas propriety during the vessel trip, in particular significantly differences of the BOG and LNG proprieties have been highlighted. This study shows that an accurate managing of BOG and <b>LNG</b> <b>flows</b> has to be done in order to obtain a mixture more homogeneous as possible during the entire ship trip. The proposed methodology is indeed necessary to allow plant designer and ship owner to chose the right plant components and lay-out together with ship operational profile that allow to achieve the lowest cost and reduce the environmental impact...|$|R
50|$|In 2005-8 Grain LNG Ltd {{constructed}} {{new facilities}} for the storage and gasification of LNG. The facilities included three LNG storage tanks {{each with a}} capacity of 190,000 m3 (48.7 m high, 87.4 m diameter), each holding {{as much as the}} four original tanks. These are full containment vessels with an inner nickel-steel alloy and an outer pre-stressed concrete wall with a reinforced concrete roof. The tanks were constructed in the north-west part of the site {{to the north of the}} existing tanks. Each tank has a concrete mass of 72,000 tonnes and is supported on 1,560 piles, 600 mm in diameter and a depth of 24 metres. The new facilities included eight submerged combustion water bath vapourisers. These heat and vapourise <b>LNG</b> <b>flowing</b> in stainless steel coils from minus 162°C to 6°C. Two Combined Heat and Power (CHP) gas turbines provide power to the site, and the waste heat is piped to the adjacent vapourisers, to reduce the gas required for firing. The cost of the Phase 2 facilities was £350m. The capacity was sold to three customers: Sonatrach (Algeria), Centrica and Gaz de France. Under phase 2, a further 6.5 million tonnes per year of capacity was contracted on a long term basis from December 2008. The new plant brought the capability of the site to a throughput of 10.5 million tonnes of LNG (about 12% of UK gas demand).|$|R
40|$|South America {{has long}} been {{isolated}} from other natural gas markets, focusing instead on achieving self sufficiency and regional integration. As a consequence, {{it has never been}} at the centre of discussions in the natural gas industry until the region decided to turn to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in 2008 following shortages of natural gas production, tensions over price renegotiations and shortfalls of contracted deliveries. LNG imports only started in the late 2000 s but reached 17. 2 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2015. Despite relatively small volumes at the global scale, representing less than 5 % of the world LNG trades, if the pace continues, the region could become an important player reducing the scale of flows to Europe, the swing market for LNG. This was the starting point of this research, which was carried out with the objective to propose an overview of the gas demand fundamentals to 2030 horizons in a comprehensive way with some highlights of individual market trends (the paper focuses on Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela). The scenarios will need to be updated as policies/prices/generation mix evolve in the future, but the main conclusion of this research is that, as of mid 2016, South America is not expected to be a major future LNG market unless there are extreme climatic conditions, which will not happen every year and will not last many years. LNG will remain necessary to supply much needed flexibility, additional volumes, security of supply and to reach new markets far from infrastructure, but there are also major uncertainties on volumes, prices, timeframe, location and even direction of the <b>LNG</b> <b>flows</b> as some importers could turn exporters at times of low demand {{toward the end of the}} timeframe. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) as an option for international trade has created a market for natural gas where global prices may eventually be differentiated by the transportation costs between world regions. LNG’s trade share in 2013 was only about 30 {{percent of the total}} global trade in natural gas, but use of LNG is on the rise with numerous projects in planning or construction stages. Considering LNG projects that are under construction, planned, or proposed, we provide an analysis of LNG prospects for the next decade. LNG has substantial unexploited potential in terms of reducing capital requirements (especially for liquefaction projects), expanding new technology frontiers (e. g. floating LNG), serving new markets, and establishing new pricing schemes that better reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand. Trade volumes are projected to increase from about 240 Mt LNG in 2013 to about 340 – 360 Mt LNG in 2021. Despite potential challenges from weaker demand in Asia, longer-term projections show that LNG trade is bound to show substantial growth, partially due to geopolitical tensions that might increase <b>LNG</b> <b>flows</b> to Europe. However, these perspectives largely depend on demand choices, the availability and evolution of alternative fuels (e. g. renewable energies), and—most importantly—political decisions framing economic behavior.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{consequences}} of an LNG Import Terminal Ban for the US Pacific Coast along with potential developments of the world natural gas market until 2030. We use the World Gas Model (WGM), a dynamic, strategic representation of world natural gas production, trade, and consumption between 2005 and 2030. In particular, we present a Base Case for a business-as-usual scenario based on forecasts of the world natural gas markets. We then analyze the impact of an LNG terminal ban for the US Pacific Coast, focussing on the North American gas market, but addressing global consequences as well. Our results show modest changes in world-wide production, consumption, and average prices, and investments in pipelines and LNG terminals are somewhat affected. A result of interest is a significant geographical redistribution of <b>LNG</b> trade <b>flows</b> taking place, smoothing out the overall impact of the local ban on LNG import terminals. Infrastructural implications are mainly limited to the Pacific Coast of North America and environmental consequences of gas trade flow redirections are relatively modest. although still significant when measures in absolute terms...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the liquefied-natural-gas (LNG) in global gas trade has grown steadily over the past decades; the article focuses on this significant form of energy and provides an exhaustive portrait of its trade. <b>LNG</b> trade <b>flows</b> both regionally and by country are described {{and the future of}} trade is forecast. Next, the business structure is discussed. The traditional LNG trade on long-term contracts (LTCs) is considered and it is explained how vital these contracts are in distributing the volume and price risks in the industry, furthermore, in securing finance for the LNG projects. The essence of gas market liberalization and its effect on LTCs is considered and it is shown that in liberalized gas markets, risk has migrated to upstream. In the light of this risk redistribution, the suppliers’ intent in moving toward vertical integration of the industry is discussed. Later, various types of LNG spot sale in arbitrage, and for uncommitted product to LTCs, are considered and the biggest spot sale markets are identified. Finally, pricing of LNG for different markets in both LTCs and spot sales is discussed and it is forecast that due to the surge of supply, rather than any change in oil prices, LNG prices are anticipated to decrease globally at least for the next 5 years...|$|R
40|$|For LNG {{transfer}} in ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore configurations emergency release couplings (F.

Due to fast closing of the ERC pressure surges will occur both in the upstream hose and downstream piping KLAW has developed a new model, whereby {{there is also a}} controlled closure valve (CCV) system incorporated in the emergency release coupling to reduce pressure surge amplitude by reducing the flow rate before Instantaneous' flip-flap valve closure. The test results show the impact of variation of flow rates and valve closure times on the amplitude of pressure surges, the spill rate and the mechanical integrity. The hose flexibility contributes to the damping of pressure surge amplitude, resulting shock load and high acceleration levels on the upstream piping The results of the test described contribute to the qualification of the ERC by Bureau Veritas and may contribute to further modelling and prediction of the impact of ERC release in actual applications...|$|R

40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} (LNG) is {{commonly}} converted from liquid to vapor for gas distribution. One {{of the methods}} for vaporizing LNG {{is to use a}} shell and tube heat exchanger. Water is used on the shell side to provide the heat source and LNG is then vaporized through the tube side passages of the exchanger. In many of these applications, the LNG is at a high pressure on the tube side while the water is at a lower pressure than the <b>LNG</b> as it <b>flows</b> through the shell side. The industry consensus document API 521 [1] “Guide to Pressure Relieving and Depressuring Systems, ” Fourth Edition, paragraph 3. 18 “Heat Transfer Equipment Failure ” states that a complete tube rupture is to be considered for the possible overpressure of the equipment. The typical shell and tube exchanger application described above has rupture discs on the shell body to protect the shell from being over-pressured due to a tube rupture scenario. The possible freezing of the water in the shell due to mixing with cryogenic LNG is a concern. The issue to consider is whether freezing will occur before the rupture discs can safely relieve a possible over- pressure condition of the shell. A numerical analysis of the condition was performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. The exchanger service, the analysis procedure and the conclusions found are detailed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} {{contributes to}} the LNG supply chain {{by the development of}} a validated calculation model for corrugated flexible hoses or pipes developed for LNG Transfer. The model builds upon experience gained by TNO Technical Sciences (Fluid Dynamics) in a large number of flow tests carried out on hoses in a large range of diameters from 4 to 18 -inch. LNG transfer rates are in general relatively high as the time involved should be limited from economical point of view. In large scale offshore <b>LNG</b> transfer, <b>flow</b> rates up to 5000 m 3 /h are applied and in future flow rates up to 10. 000 m 3 /h are foreseen. Typical values mentioned for offshore operations in tandem transfer range from 50 to 150 meters hose length and hose diameter up to 20 -inch. The pressure losses in LNG offshore transfer, but also in smaller scale applications, can be considerable. The pressure loss depends on flow rate, length of the hose, internal diameter and internal hose corrugation geometry. High pressure losses will impose additional requirements on LNG pumps and might result in cavitation at the downstream end of the hose as the average pressure drops below vapor pressure. Furthermore the impact of local boiling phenomena due to heat-ingress and cavitation, possibly effected by vortex shedding along the internal corrugations, is not known. Once the gaps in the data base are filled a validated prediction model is available, which can be used in guidelines and standards. So far the EN 1474 (part 2 : Design and testing of transfer hoses) does not specify a maximum allowable pressure loss and the prescription of the requirement for the test is limited: "Flow rate testing (ambient or cryogenic) : demonstrate that the hose is capable of operating at its maximum flow rate and confirm the predicted head loss " The final goal of the project is to obtain a validated prediction model for the calculation of pressure losses in LNG transfer with flexible multi-composite and metal hoses based on input of parameters as operating conditions and hose geometry. Also input for guidelines and standards in LNG transfer with flexibles such as EN 1474 will be generated, which can be used in for qualification of LNG equipment...|$|R
