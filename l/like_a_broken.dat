The track was {{serviced}} to American mainstream stations on February 4, 2014, serving as Paramores fourth single.

60|$|But he flinched, as, {{in a black}} flash Gerald's fist {{came upon}} him, banged into {{the other side of}} his head, and sent him aside <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> straw.|$|E
60|$|Up sprang Harold <b>like</b> <b>a</b> kitten. The <b>broken</b> {{stone was}} {{standing}} edgeways in the kist. There was something soft beneath it.|$|R
5000|$|Dessa said, [...] "To me, many of {{the songs}} on Castor are the more organic 'twins' to the {{versions}} that were recorded for previous, highly produced projects <b>like</b> <b>A</b> Badly <b>Broken</b> Code or Paper Tiger's Made <b>Like</b> Us. There's <b>a</b> human quality to these recordings that I hoped to convey in the title." ...|$|R
60|$|The Carrier {{stood looking}} after {{him until he}} was smaller in the {{distance}} than his horse's flowers and favours near at hand; and then, with a deep sigh, went strolling <b>like</b> <b>a</b> restless, <b>broken</b> man, among some neighbouring elms; unwilling to return until the clock was {{on the eve of}} striking.|$|R
6000|$|Who {{bring my}} English heart to me, [...] Who mend me <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> toy; [...] Till I {{can see you}} fight and flee, [...] And laugh as if I were a boy.|$|E
6000|$|When some dear scheme [...] Of {{our life}} doth seem [...] Shivered at once <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> dream [...] And our hearts to reel [...] Like ships that feel [...] A sharp rock grating against their keel.--C. F. A.|$|E
6000|$|Theodosia packed her {{trunk and}} worked all night, dry-eyed, with agony and fear tearing at her heart. The iron will had snapped at last, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> reed, and fierce self-condemnation seized on her. [...] "I've been a wicked woman," [...] she moaned.|$|E
5000|$|... "Both {{his arms}} were fractured," [...] Langley said. [...] "They just hung there, there <b>like</b> arms on <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> doll. He had been bayoneted repeatedly. The {{back of his head}} had been smashed in." ...|$|R
60|$|Elsie shrank {{back against}} the wall of rock. I {{advanced}} {{on my hands and knees}} to the edge of the precipice. It was not quite sheer, but it dropped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sea-cliff, with <b>broken</b> ledges.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Sir Gervaise, she's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{piece of}} <b>broken</b> crockery, just now, and one can't tell all her merits. She's {{not a bad}} goer, and weatherly, I think, all will call her. But she's thundering French, inside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right, lad, yer right!" [...] said Slugs, who {{had taken}} another long look at the object in question; [...] "I see somethin' <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> tree near the top o' the precipice. I hope Wapaw hain't gone an' tumbled over that cliff." ...|$|E
6000|$|For a great {{speculation}} had fail'd; [...] And ever he mutter'd and madden'd, {{and ever}} wann'd with despair; [...] And out he walk'd, {{when the wind}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> worldling wail'd, [...] And the flying gold of the ruin'd woodlands drove thro' the air.|$|E

6000|$|He {{spoke in}} words that seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bent and <b>broken</b> stick thrust {{suddenly}} into water, destroying {{the mirror of}} the shapes they sought. [...] "Jim's not coming back again ever," [...] he said. [...] "He got drowned five years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will {{do nothing}} of the sort," [...] said the princess. [...] "If the men folk think no more {{of a piece of}} good luck than to hand it round <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bit of <b>broken</b> glass, it is better for the women folk to keep it for them." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{darkness}} {{over his}} mind. The terrible knot of consciousness that had persisted there <b>like</b> <b>an</b> obsession was <b>broken,</b> gone, {{his life was}} dissolved in darkness over his limbs and his body. But {{there was a point}} of anxiety in his heart now. He wanted her to come back. He breathed lightly and regularly <b>like</b> <b>an</b> infant, that breathes innocently, beyond the touch of responsibility.|$|R
6000|$|... "Granville," [...] he said slowly, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> man, [...] "I don't ask you {{to forgive}} me; you can never forgive me; I don't {{ask you to}} sympathise with me; a father knows better than to accept sympathy from a son; but I do ask you to bear with me while I try to explain myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus many a {{time have}} {{we come to}} the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, with a full purpose of amendment, and with as full a persuasion of putting that same purpose into practice; and yet have we not all as often broke that good purpose, and falsified that same persuasion, by {{starting}} aside, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> bow, into those very sins, which we then so solemnly and so confidently declared against? ...|$|E
6000|$|... [5] No {{one could}} speak more feelingly upon this subject than our author. He {{had been in}} deep waters--in soul-harrowing fear, while his heart--hard by nature--was under the hammer of the Word.--'My soul was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> vessel. O, the unthought of imaginations, frights, fears, and terrors, that are {{affected}} by a thorough application of guilt, yielded to desperation!' Like the man that had his dwelling among the tombs.--Grace Abounding, No. 186.|$|E
40|$|The Todoroki Mine is {{situated}} about 25 kilometers to the south-east of Ginzan railway station in Siribesi Province, Hokkaido. The author analysed an interesting specimen of black manganese-ore {{which had a}} fractured surface which looked <b>like</b> that of <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> piece of wood. This new manganese mineral was studied in its form, physical properties and chemical composition. The author later named this mineral form as "todorokite"...|$|R
5000|$|Life at {{home with}} Doug and Mel is hard, with {{frequent}} arguments arising between the two. Drama comes to a head when, after offering to play the harp for Brett and Jemaine, Mel tells Doug that harp-playing is very feminine. Doug and Mel decide to separate and, <b>like</b> children from <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> home, Bret and Jemaine are forced to live with separate [...] "parents": Jemaine with Doug, and Bret with Mel.|$|R
6000|$|March 23.--The measure {{carried by}} a single vote.[439] In other {{circumstances}} one would hope for the interference of the House of Lords, but it is all hab-nab at a venture. The worst {{is that there is}} a popular party who want personal power, and are highly unfitted to enjoy it. It has fallen easily, the old Constitution; no bullying Mirabeau to assail, no eloquent Maury to defend. It has been thrown away <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child's <b>broken</b> toy. Well trained, the good sense of the people is much trusted to; we will see what it will do for us.[440] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe!" [...] he repeated. [...] "What--when we {{go beyond}} the {{province}} of reason--human, a thing of sense after all! How often have I so answered. But Meta, when a man has been drawn, in self-sufficient security, to look into a magic mirror, and cannot detach {{his eyes from the}} confused, misty scene--where all that had his allegiance appears shattered, overthrown, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> image, or at least unable to endure examination, then--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Unfinished there, [...] In high mid-air [...] The towers halt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> prayer; [...] Through years belated, [...] Unconsummated, [...] The hope of its {{architect}} quite frustrated. [...] Its very youth [...] They say, forsooth, [...] With a quite {{improper purpose}} mated; [...] And every stone [...] With a curse {{of its own}} [...] Instead of that sermon Shakespeare stated, [...] Since the day its choir, [...] Which all admire, [...] By Cologne's Archbishop was consecrated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you think}} I was coming that way--where {{everybody}} could follow me?" [...] she laughed, softly. [...] "No; I {{came through the}} thicket over there," [...] indicating the direction with her flexible shoulder, [...] "and nearly lost my slipper and my eyes--look!" [...] She threw back the inseparable lace shawl from her blond head, and showed a spray of myrtle clinging <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> wreath to her forehead. The young officer remained gazing at her silently.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a natural}} emotion, not to be suppressed; and it would make way even between the fingers of the hands with which she covered up her face. The {{overcharged}} and heavy-laden breast must some times have that vent, or the poor wounded solitary heart within it would have fluttered <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bird with <b>broken</b> wings, and sunk down in the dust.' ...|$|R
60|$|Barrington was a large, florid man, well {{built and}} well set up. In court he {{presented}} rather a formidable appearance with his truculent chin, his straight, firm mouth, and his commanding presence. Yet {{there was nothing}} about him now which would have inspired fear in the most nervous of witnesses. He looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man all <b>broken</b> up by some unexpected shock.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the Man Therapy {{campaign}} is to provide men approaching crisis, and their loved ones, {{a place to go}} and learn more about men’s mental health, examine their own and consider a wide array of actions that will put them on the path to treatment and recovery. The message is that all men should be aware of their mental health, treat it <b>like</b> they would <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> leg and strive to get better.|$|R
60|$|Angela {{sank down}} on her knees before him, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> lily. Her looks grew faint and despairing. The stately head bowed itself to his feet, and all the golden weight of hair broke loose. But he did not pause or spare her. He ground his teeth. No one could have {{recognized}} in this maddened, passion-inspired man the pleasant, easy-tempered Arthur of an hour before. His nature was stirred to its depths, and they were deep.|$|E
60|$|Neck {{and neck}} they dashed through the darkness, {{and did not}} pull up until panting and spent, they had reached the little cottage by the river. Young Lee, limp and {{dripping}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> water-plant, was stretched upon the sofa, the green scum of the river upon his black hair, and a fringe of white foam upon his leaden-hued lips. Beside him knelt his fellow student, Harrington, endeavouring to chafe some warmth back into his rigid limbs.|$|E
60|$|It {{was easy}} {{to know that the}} ceremonious, gouty, grey-haired gentleman, the only other {{occupant}} of the great pew, was Sir Leicester Dedlock, and that the lady was Lady Dedlock. But why her face should be, in a confused way, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> glass to me, in which I saw scraps of old remembrances, and why I should be so fluttered and troubled (for I was still) by having casually met her eyes, I could not think.|$|E
6000|$|... "By Heavens, {{the fellow}} has reason in his inexplicable impudence!" [...] muttered Ludlow, pacing {{backward}} and forward beneath {{the shadow of}} the tree. [...] "The language and the acts of the girl are in contradiction; and I am a fool to be trifled with, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> midshipman fresh <b>broken</b> loose from his mother's apron-string. Harkee, Master-a-a--You've a name I suppose, like any other straggler on the ocean." ...|$|R
60|$|As Frank spoke, {{he drew a}} small axe {{from his}} belt, and began to lay about him so vigorously that the icy {{splinters}} flew in all directions <b>like</b> <b>a</b> shower of <b>broken</b> crystal. Bryan seconded his efforts, and in less {{than half an hour}} a block of solid ice, about four feet high and two broad, was cut out and detached {{from the side of the}} dome.|$|R
5000|$|William {{knows of}} no such {{arrangement}} and quickly {{attempts to get}} rid of this man he sees as nothing more than a trespasser. Elias sees the couple the same way and develops his own ideas about sending them back to the city. Meanwhile, it quickly becomes obvious that William is of little use in this rustic environment that Elias calls home. Even <b>a</b> simple task <b>like</b> fixing <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> water heater is beyond William's range of expertise. [...] "I pay people to do these things for me," [...] he blurts out. Obviously successful in the professional world, William is at a loss in his newfound sanctuary. William's frustration festers as he observes Elias's adroitness with such tasks.|$|R
