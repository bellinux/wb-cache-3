5|$|John Wesley preached in Shakerley four times, between 1748 and 1752, <b>laying</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> for a {{place of}} worship. In the 1780s George Whitfield who worked with Wesley early in his {{ministry}} also preached there. Tyldesley's first place of worship, Top Chapel {{was built in the}} Square in 1789 for the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion which had broken from the Church of England. Thomas Johnson, gifted the site on the highest point of Tyldesley and Lady Huntingdon, a supporter of Wesley supplied money for building materials. The chapel became known as Top Chapel from its geographical location.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, he {{defeated}} {{and killed}} Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald, at the Battle of Maserfield; {{from this point}} he {{was probably the most}} powerful of the Anglo-Saxon rulers of the time, <b>laying</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> for the Mercian supremacy over the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. He repeatedly defeated the East Angles and drove Cenwalh the king of Wessex into exile for three years. He continued to wage war against the Bernicians of Northumbria. Thirteen years after Maserfield, he suffered a crushing defeat by Oswald's successor and brother Oswiu, and was killed at the Battle of the Winwaed {{in the course of a}} final campaign against the Bernicians.|$|E
5|$|In 907, the Khitan {{chieftain}} Abaoji {{succeeded in}} getting himself appointed khaghan of all Khitan tribes in the north, <b>laying</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> to what would officially become the Liao dynasty. In 936, the Khitan supported the Shanxi rebel Shi Jingtang in his revolt against the Shatuo Turkic Later Tang, which had destroyed the usurpers of the Tang in 923. The Khitan leader, Abaoji's second son Yelü Deguang, convinced Shi to found a new dynasty (the Later Jin, 936946), and received the crucial border region known as the Sixteen Prefectures in return. With the Sixteen Prefectures, the Khitan now possessed all the passes and fortifications that controlled access to the plains of northern China, including the main Great Wall line.|$|E

5|$|The Naval Research Laboratory {{had long}} been {{interested}} in the prospect of using nuclear power for warship propulsion, and sought to create its own nuclear project. In May 1946, Nimitz, now Chief of Naval Operations, decided that the Navy should instead work with the Manhattan Project. A group of naval officers were assigned to Oak Ridge, the most senior of whom was Captain Hyman G. Rickover, who became assistant director there. They immersed themselves {{in the study of}} nuclear energy, <b>laying</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> for a nuclear-powered navy. A similar group of Air Force personnel arrived at Oak Ridge in September 1946 with the aim of developing nuclear aircraft. Their Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project ran into formidable technical difficulties, and was ultimately cancelled.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, Sturdee {{took the}} {{surrender}} of Japanese forces in the Rabaul area. As one of the Army's most senior officers, he succeeded General Sir Thomas Blamey as Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces in December 1945. He became the Chief of the General Staff a second time in 1946, serving in the post {{until his retirement in}} 1950. During this term, he had to demobilise the wartime Army while fielding and supporting the Australian contingent of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. He developed a structure for the post-war Army that included regular combat formations. As a result, the Australian Regular Army was formed, <b>laying</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> for the service as it exists today.|$|E
5|$|In November 1945, King {{created a}} new {{position}} of Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Special Weapons, which was given to Vice Admiral Blandy. Parsons became Blandy's assistant. In turn, Parsons had two assistants of his own, Ashworth and Horacio Rivero, Jr. He also brought Greenbacker from Los Alamos to help set up the new office. Parsons was {{a strong supporter of}} research into the use of nuclear power for warship propulsion, but disagreed with Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, Sr., the head of the Office of Research and Inventions, who wanted the Navy to initiate its own nuclear project. Parsons felt that the Navy should work with the Manhattan Project, and arranged for Naval officers to be assigned to Oak Ridge. The most senior of them was his former classmate Rickover, who became assistant director there. They immersed themselves in the study of nuclear energy, <b>laying</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> for a nuclear-powered navy.|$|E

5|$|The team {{began work}} on the {{expansion}} in summer 1998, but the task became complicated by Epic's organizational structure. During the development of Unreal, the team members at Digital Extremes were working in Ontario, Canada, while the members at Epic were based in North Carolina, United States, requiring regular travel to Ontario. To remedy this, Epic decided to centralize the teams in Raleigh, North Carolina, and by September, work on the expansion could begin. Lead programmer Steve Polge set about <b>laying</b> <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> for the new game types, such as Capture the Flag and Domination, and level designers created {{the first round of}} maps for testing. The content grew quickly, and soon the team realized that it had underestimated the task. In November, after a meeting with publisher GT Interactive, Mark Rein suggested releasing the work as a standalone game instead of an expansion. The team was reticent at first, but soon accepted the idea, and in December the game became known internally as Unreal: Tournament Edition.|$|E
