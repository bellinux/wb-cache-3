5|$|An {{optimized}} netcode {{is present}} in the game, providing smoother online play compared to Fate of Two Worlds. A new spectator mode allows up to six players to watch online matches between other players. Rematch features and <b>leaderboard</b> functionality have also been improved to enhance the game's online experience.|$|E
5|$|The player kills enemies {{by firing}} daggers from their fingers. There are two firing options: {{clicking}} the left-mouse button fires a shotgun-like blast of daggers {{with a wide}} spread, and holding the mouse button down fires a precise, continuous stream of daggers. Some enemies have weak spots indicated by red crystals on their bodies. Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can be gathered by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers. The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy or falling off the stage. At {{the top of the}} screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough has lasted. The player's best survival time is published on a global <b>leaderboard.</b> Accessed via the <b>leaderboard,</b> replays of playthroughs can be downloaded and watched from either a first-person view or a top-down perspective.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the first}} round she led the field in driving accuracy, was in the top 20 in greens in regulation, and was 84th out of 111 in driving distance. Unfortunately, poor putting (last in the field, {{averaging}} over a two-putt) cost her {{a spot on the}} first page of {{the first round}} <b>leaderboard</b> and ultimately caused her to miss the cut.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leaderboards,</b> that compare {{a variety}} of stats with gamers in a set group, such as {{regional}} <b>leaderboards</b> or user-created <b>leaderboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{is typical}} of Xbox Live Arcade games, the game {{features}} online play and <b>leaderboards.</b> Separate <b>leaderboards</b> are used to display single player and multiplayer rankings. Unlike many games which keep the TrueSkill level of the players hidden, Catan displays the calculated current values {{on one of the}} <b>leaderboards.</b>|$|R
25|$|A February 2016 update (originally {{slated for}} January but pushed back) {{implemented}} {{a number of}} features to prevent high score cheating via game exploits, as well as changing the nature of non-Tour mode shows to allow their scores {{to be included in}} <b>leaderboards.</b> To effect this change, Harmonix had to wipe existing <b>leaderboards,</b> but in the future if similar exploits are found, {{they will be able to}} adjust <b>leaderboards</b> for specific song and instruments.|$|R
5|$|Challenge mode employs similar {{gameplay}} {{to that of}} the Story mode. The {{difference is}} that the gameplay for Challenge mode is faster-paced, offers more puzzles, and sacrifices any storyline in this mode. It consists of 30 levels and players must fulfill certain conditions before succeeding. Each level lasts only a few minutes, offering more exciting, yet harder, gameplay. The time needed for players to complete a level is recorded in an online <b>leaderboard</b> which can be viewed by other players.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global <b>leaderboard</b> where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes have}} been made to the {{gameplay}} mechanics for Guitar Hero II: hammer-on and pull-off functionality has been improved, and three note chords have been introduced, scored as triple points if played correctly. There are additional statistics available for a song upon completion, and the scores achieved in either Quick Play or Career mode are saved to the same in-game high-score list. The handedness of the guitar can now be toggled from the Pause menu when playing a song (previously, this was only available from the game's main menu). For the Xbox 360 version, scores can also be compared with other players through Xbox Live via the <b>Leaderboard</b> feature, and there are 50 Achievements that can be earned in the game.|$|E
50|$|The game also {{features}} online <b>leaderboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Leaderboards</b> are an {{effective}} way to show a user quickly where they currently stand within a gamified system. For systems with large numbers of gamers, calculating and publishing player ranks can be challenging. Using Amazon ElastiCache with the Redis engine can enable high-speed at scale for <b>leaderboards.</b>|$|R

5|$|Upon {{completion}} of each puzzle, the player's performance is compared on a <b>leaderboard</b> {{based on the}} number of instructions placed in their reactors, the number of cycles it took to meet the quota, and the number of reactors required to meet the solution. The player also has an option to upload videos of their solution to YouTube. The player, once having cleared a puzzle, can return to previous puzzles to try to improve their solution by reducing the number of instructions, cycles taken, or reactors used. SpaceChem supports downloadable content created by the developers themselves, and user-submitted puzzles through its ResearchNet service. A later addition included an open-ended sandbox mode where players could simply explore the game's capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} puzzles, Barth {{wanted to}} keep puzzles open-ended, allowing the player {{to come to a}} solution without funneling them in a specific direction. The team designed puzzles based on general chemistry concepts without envisioning the specific solution that the player would take. They brainstormed a number of puzzles and then eliminated those with similar solutions, and arranged the others into a reasonable learning curve for the game. Despite this, Barth reflected that the tutorials provided to explain the game's mechanics had mixed responses, from some players who took up the concept easily to others that remained baffled as to the puzzle's goal even when instructions were set out step by step. In some cases, Barth discovered that players made assumptions on limitations of the game from these tutorials such as the idea that the red and blue waldos must remain in the separate halves of the screen. Based on the feedback that players had made on sites that hosted his previous Flash-based games, Barth designed the global-based histograms to allow players to check their solution without feeling overwhelmed by the top players as would be normally listed on a <b>leaderboard.</b> He also devised the means of sharing solutions through YouTube videos due to similar comments and discussions on the previous games.|$|E

25|$|On 6 March 2013, {{the fourth}} DLC, Vergil's Downfall, was released. The DLC adds a new {{section in the}} main game, giving players a new single-player {{campaign}} featuring Vergil as the main character. The DLC has its own <b>leaderboard,</b> stats and set of trophies. This DLC is available for free {{for those who have}} pre-ordered the game on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.|$|E
25|$|United States {{claimed a}} total of 31 medals (16 golds, 9 silver, and 6 bronze) in the <b>leaderboard</b> to {{maintain}} its supremacy as the most successful nation in swimming. Brought by an unprecedented sporting domination, Michael Phelps emerged as the most decorated Olympian of all time after winning six more medals at these Games to bring his total after the 2012 games to 22 (18 golds, 2 silver, and 2 bronze). Battling against the Americans for an overall medal count, China mounted to an unexpected second-place effort on the <b>leaderboard</b> with a tally of 10 medals (five golds, three silver, and bronze) after striking a superb double from Sun Yang in long-distance freestyle (both 400 and 1500 m) and Ye Shiwen in the individual medley (both 200 and 400 m). Meanwhile, France ended on a spectacular fashion in third spot with {{a total of}} seven medals (four golds, two silver, and one bronze), followed by the Netherlands with four, including two golds from Ranomi Kromowidjojo in sprint freestyle (both 50 and 100 m), and South Africa with three.|$|E
25|$|Third round play resumed Sunday at 7:15 am. The 2003 Open Champion, Ben Curtis stormed {{into the}} lead with birdies at {{four of his}} first six holes, and despite a bogey at the 18th hole, Curtis shot two-under 68 for a one stroke lead after 54 holes. Second round leader J. B. Holmes {{remained}} in contention with an even par 70 to place himself in a tie for second with Henrik Stenson. 2007 and 2008 Open Champion, Pádraig Harrington shot a four-under 66 to shoot up the <b>leaderboard</b> into a tie for fourth. Also among those at +1 was Sergio García, who shot a one-under 69. South Korean, Charlie Wi shot a one-over 71 to place himself in the three way tie for fourth. Andrés Romero, who completed his round Saturday, woke up much higher on the <b>leaderboard</b> as his five-under 65 put him four strokes off the lead and in a tie for seventh. Former PGA Champions David Toms and Phil Mickelson sat five and six strokes off the lead respectively.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{each region}} {{would have a}} closed Regional Finals event. The four champions of these events would {{similarly}} automatically qualify for the Capcom Cup. The 16 remaining slots would be filled through the Global Points <b>Leaderboards</b> (eight slots) and the four Regional Point <b>Leaderboards</b> (four times two slots). If a competitor wins more than one Global Premier Event, an additional Capcom Slot opens up on the Global Points <b>Leaderboards.</b> Those that come in second or lower in a Global Premier Event do not automatically qualify for the Capcom Cup as happened last year. Competitors for the Regional Final Events are determined by 12 Ranking Events and two Online Events.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Conversational {{modeling}} {{requires an}} extended time commitment, {{and the difficulty}} associated with capturing {{the wide range of}} conversational stimuli necessitates extended user participation. We propose the use of <b>leaderboards,</b> narratives and deadlines as motivation strategies to persuade user participation in the conversational modeling for virtual humans. We evaluate the applicabil-ity of <b>leaderboards,</b> narratives and deadlines through a user study conducted with medical students (n= 20) for modeling the conversational corpus of a vir-tual patient character. <b>Leaderboards,</b> narratives and deadlines were observed to be effective in improving user participation. Incorporating these strategies had the additional effect of making user responses less reflective of real world con-versations...|$|R

25|$|In September 2012, van Outen was {{announced}} {{as one of}} the celebrities competing on the tenth series of Strictly Come Dancing. She partnered with professional dancer James Jordan. The couple secured top of the <b>leaderboard</b> seven times. However, controversy arose when viewers criticised her participation in the competition because of the advantage of having had previous stage experience. On 20 December 2012, van Outen and Jordan finished as the runners-up alongside Kimberley Walsh & Pasha Kovalev, behind Louis Smith and Flavia Cacace.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, Nintendo of Europe held {{a promotional}} event on November 13, 2010 in Covent Garden, London. Set up as a medieval village, the event {{featured}} demo stations for the game, a <b>leaderboard</b> where Nintendo employees tracked {{those with the}} most play time, and an appearance by Jedward. Slime plushies were given away at the event, and players could add John and Edward Grimes' in-game characters to their inns via tag mode, and receive the Nokturnus treasure map.|$|E
25|$|On August 2, Woods {{captured}} the Buick Open for his fourth win of the season, with a three-shot victory over three other players. After firing an opening-round 71 {{that put him}} in 95th place {{and outside of the}} cutline, Woods responded with a second-round 63, nine-under-par, that vaulted him into contention. A third-round 65 put him atop the <b>leaderboard</b> and he coasted to victory with a final-round 69 for a 20-under 268 four-round total. This was his biggest turnaround pro victory to date.|$|E
