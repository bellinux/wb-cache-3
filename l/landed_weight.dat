5000|$|Because the <b>landing</b> <b>weights</b> of most light {{aircraft}} {{are determined by}} structural considerations and not by stall speed, most VG kits increase only the takeoff weight and not the <b>landing</b> <b>weight.</b> Any increase in <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> would require either structural modifications or re-testing the aircraft at the higher <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> {{to demonstrate that the}} certification requirements are still met.

Factors considered include: Mars mission {{opportunities in the}} 1980 - 1990 time frame; design features of the hardware systems used to return the sample; minimization of probability of back contamination; direct entry of the returning sample capsule at earth vs. orbital capture of the capsule for recovery by the shuttle; and possibility of increasing the <b>landed</b> <b>weight</b> at Mars to support MSSR mission modes involving heavier systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} and capabilities are described of solar electric propulsion (SEP) for performing Mars Surface Sample Return (MSSR) missions. The {{scope of the}} study emphasizes trajectory/payload analysis and the comparison of mission/system tradeoff options. The MSSR mission is examined only for the 1981 - 82 launch opportunity. Several other study constraints which bear directly on the results obtained are: (1) return samples in the range 5 - 25 kg, (2) use of lifting (offset C. G.) atmospheric entry at Mars which allows a low ratio (1. 25) of entry weight to <b>landed</b> <b>weight,</b> and (3) rendezvous and docking in Mars orbit. Major {{results of the study}} are presented as performance curves of earth departure mass versus sample size for a number of different mission/system options. These options represent a spectrum of trip time, launch vehicle capability, combinations of low-thrust and ballistic maneuvers, chemical retro type, and earth recovery mode...|$|E
40|$|Total {{landings}} {{declined in}} 2004 and 2005 due primarily to reduced recreational landings. Commercial landings {{are controlled by}} quota and have remained relatively stable for the past decade. Discards in the recreational fishery are substantial, however only 15 % of the discards {{are expected to be}} lost due to mortality. Commercial discards, based on logbook information, range from 5 % to 13 % of <b>landed</b> <b>weight.</b> The NEFSC spring bottom trawl survey of offshore strata is the basis for evaluating black sea bass biomass status. Adult biomass (> 22 cm) peaked in 2002 but has since declined to the long term average. A similar pattern in biomass decline has been evident in the NEFSC winter survey. Strong juvenile abundance indices (< 14 cm) appeared in 2000 and 2002 winter and spring surveys. However, these strong cohorts have not produced an expected increase in the adult biomass indices. State surveys index local recruitment and also suggest the 2002 year class was above average. A tagging program for black sea bass between Massachusetts and North Carolina was initiated in September 2002.

50|$|As jets began {{flying with}} US {{airlines}} {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the FAA rule in effect at the time mandated that if the ratio between an aircraft's maximum structural takeoff weight and its maximum structural <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> was greater than 105%, the aircraft {{had to have a}} fuel dump system installed. Aircraft such as the Boeing 707 and 727 and the Douglas DC-8 had fuel dump systems.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of megrim captured by Irish and joint venture (Spanish) vessels in Divisions Vll b, c, j, k {{is based on}} landings from both fleets and discards from Irish vessels targeting whitefish and Nephrops. Fishing activity by the joint venture fleet is centred on the 200 m depth contour. Megrim CPUE has declined since 1985. Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis constitutes {{the majority of the}} landings by joint venture vessels; L. boscii amounts up to 2 % by weight of the landings from deeper waters. In catches of undersized megrim, L. boscii was 12 % of the total. Landings of L. whiffiagonis have similar length frequency distributions in the Irish inshore and joint venture fleets. There are indications of what may be seasonal abundance in the discards and landings of Irish vessels fishing inshore. Discards were calculated as 77 % of <b>landed</b> <b>weight</b> {{in the first half of}} the year and 31 % in the second. Megrim with an inshore provenance were slightly larger than those coming from deeper waters. The following growth parameters were calculated: L∞ = 51. 2 cm, k = 0. 17 and to = - 0. 97. A catch curve derived from the combined landed and discarded megrim has a value of Z = 0. 45, slightly less than the value calculated for the inshore Irish fleet (0. 49). F is consequently in much the same position as in the 1989 - 90 assessment, on the negative slope of the yield per recruit curve. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern over the decline of {{fisheries}} and the possibility of the decline becoming worse due to climate change. Studies on small–scale fisheries could help to improve our understanding of the effect of climate on the ecology of exploited stocks.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop an effective biological sampling programme for fish species in the English Channel (ICES Divisions Vild and Vile) which are not subject to quota management, and to prepare these data for use in multispecies, multi-fleet models being developed by the Channel Fisheries Study Group. Length and age data were coIlected for six non-quota species, and length data for a further five species. The samples were coIlected over a period of two years from important ports on the French and UK coasts. The exploitation patterns of each species were described by allocating catches from similar catching gears, regions, seasons and target species into common units referred to as métiers. The most important métiers in terms of <b>landed</b> <b>weight</b> for each species were sampled, and a description of the seasonality and regionality of the fishery was prepared. The results and conclusions of the sampling for each species were presented by métier, and showed that the fisheries for aIl the species studied were to sorne extent seasonal and exploited regionally within VIld and VIle. The data were also assessed in terms of the suitability for use in fisheries models. The data coIlected were adequate for simple modelling studies for the more abundant species. Data for those species which exhibited high seasonality in their fisheries were adequate whilst the fishery was in season, but poor for the remainder of the year.

40|$|Oyster reefs {{around the}} world are declining rapidly, and {{although}} they haven t received as much attention as coral reefs, they are just as important to their local ecosystems and economies. Oyster reefs provide habitats for many species of fish, invertebrates, and crustaceans, as well as the next generations of oysters. Oysters are also harvested from many of these reefs and are an important segment of many local economies, including that of Mobile Bay, where oysters rank in the top five commercial marine species both by <b>landed</b> <b>weight</b> and by dollar value. Although the remaining Mobile Bay oyster reefs are some of the least degraded in the world, projected climate change could have dramatic effects on the health of these important ecosystems. The viability of oyster reefs depends on water depth and temperature, appropriate pH and salinity levels, and the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. Projected increases in sea level, changes in precipitation and runoff patterns, and changes in pH resulting from increases in the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the oceans could all affect the viability of oyster reefs in the future. Human activities such as dredging and unsustainable harvesting practices are also adversely impacting the oyster reefs. Fortunately, several projects are already under way to help rebuild or support existing or previously existing oyster reefs. The success of these projects will depend on the local effects of climate change on the current and potential habitats and man s ability to recognize and halt unsustainable harvesting practices. As the extent and health of the reefs changes, it will have impacts on the Mobile Bay ecosystem and economy, changing the resources available to {{the people who live there}} and to the rest of the country, since Mobile Bay is an important national source of seafood. This project identified potential climate change impacts on the oyster reefs of Mobile Bay, including the possible addition of newly viable habitats in the southeastern regions of the Bay...|$|E
40|$|Two {{species of}} European angler, Lophius plscatorius and L. budegassa occur In Irish waters. L piscatorius is dominant, {{particularly}} {{closer to the}} coast; L. budegassa becomes more important moving south and in landings from medium/deep water. Three stocks of anglers are recognized; this work concerns {{the fish in the}} central one, specifically in ICES Divisions Vllb, c and j,k. Anglers are taken in a mixed demersal fishery, and they are particularly associated with hake and megrim. Most landings of the species come from ICES Divisions VlIg-k. The species have traditionally been taken in a mixed demersal fishery, mainly by France and Scotland. Ireland's landings have increased from 100 t in 1977 to in excess of 2, 000 t in recent years. Species composition of the landings was determined by port sampling. The proportion of Lophius piscatorius, while still dominant, has declined since the mid 1980 s. A short CPUE time series from joint venture vessels fishing medium/deep water (approximately 200 m) shows no consistent trends although the values for 1991 were the lowest in the six years. Irish vessels take anglers of slightly greater weight than do their joint venture (Spanish) counterparts. Length frequency distributions of both species from the Irish trawl fishery are available from 1987 to 1991 inclusive. They are redistributed by age using French ALKs. The age distribution shows no particular trend for L. budegassa whereas that for L. piscatorius shows evidence of strong year classes from the mid 1980 s passing through the population. The sharp reduction in angler CPUE in 1991 may have resulted from the exhaustion of strong mid 1980 s year classes of L. piscatorius. A large plus group in the age distribution of L. piscatorius restricted interpretation of its population structure. Discarding of anglers appears to be very low in the south western Irish trawl fisheries, an estimate of 6. 8 % <b>landed</b> <b>weight</b> being used in this assessment. A catch curve for L. piscaforius suggested a value of Z+ 0. 48; taking M= 0. 15 provides a value for F= 0. 33, to the right of Fmax and in general agreement with what has been concluded for this species in recent assessments...|$|E

50|$|Normally {{the portion}} of the aircraft's weight that exceeds the maximum <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> (but falls within the maximum {{take-off}} weight) is entirely composed of fuel.
