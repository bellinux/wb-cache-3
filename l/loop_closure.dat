Therefore, {{it is crucial}} to enhance their robustness in the presence of numerous false-positive <b>loop</b> <b>closures.</b> Existing approaches tend to fail when working with very unreliable front-end systems, where the majority of inferred <b>loop</b> <b>closures</b> are incorrect. In this paper, we propose a novel middle layer, seamlessly embedded between front and back ends, to boost the robustness of the whole SLAM system. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold: 1) the proposed middle layer offers a new mechanism to reliably detect and remove false-positive <b>loop</b> <b>closures,</b> even if they form the overwhelming majority; 2) artificial <b>loop</b> <b>closures</b> are automatically reconstructed and injected into pose graphs in the framework of an Extended Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother, reinforcing reliable <b>loop</b> <b>closures.</b> The proposed algorithm alters the graph generated by the front-end and can then be optimized by any back-end system.

40|$|Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) {{systems that}} recover the {{trajectory}} of a robot or mobile device are characterised by a front-end and back-end. The front-end uses sensor observations to identify loop closures; the back-end optimises the estimated trajectory {{to be consistent with}} these closures. The GraphSLAM framework formulates the back-end problem as a graph-based optimisation on a pose graph. This paper describes a back-end system optimised for very dense sequence-based <b>loop</b> <b>closures.</b> This arises when the front-end generates magnetic <b>loop</b> <b>closures,</b> among other things.

40|$|Current {{state of}} the art {{solutions}} of the SLAM problem are based on efficient sparse optimization techniques and represent the problem as probabilistic constraint graphs. For example in pose graphs the nodes represent poses and the edges between them express spatial information (e. g. obtained from odometry) and information on <b>loop</b> <b>closures.</b> The task of constructing the graph is delegated to a front-end that has access to the available sensor information. The optimizer, the so called back-end of the system, relies heavily on the topological correctness of the graph structure and is not robust against misplaced constraint edges. Especially edges representing false positive <b>loop</b> <b>closures</b> will lead to the divergence of current solvers. We propose a novel formulation that allows the back-end to change parts of the topological structure of the graph during the optimization process. The back-end can thereby discard <b>loop</b> <b>closures</b> and converge towards correct solutions even in the presence of false positive <b>loop</b> <b>closures.</b> This largely increases the overall robustness of the SLAM system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers.

40|$|<b>Loop</b> <b>closure</b> detection, {{which is}} the task of {{identifying}} locations revisited by a robot in a sequence of odometry and perceptual observations, is typically formulated as a visual place recognition (VPR) task.

40|$|Abstract — Most visual {{simultaneous}} localization and map-ping systems use point {{features as}} their landmarks and adopt point-based feature descriptors to recognize them. Compared to point landmarks, however, lines have strength in conveying the structural information of the environment. Despite the benefit, {{they have not}} been widely used because lines are more difficult in detecting, tracking, and recognizing, and this delayed the use of lines as landmarks. In this paper, we propose a place recognition algorithm using straight line features, which enables reliable detection of <b>loop</b> <b>closures</b> in a large complex environment under significant illumination changes. A vocabu-lary tree trained with mean standard-deviation line descriptor is used in finding the candidate matches between keyframes, and a Bayesian filtering framework enables reliable keyframe matching for large-scale <b>loop</b> <b>closures.</b> The proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art point-based methods using scale-invariant feature transform or speeded up robust features.

40|$|Abstract — Object {{discovery}} and modeling {{have been widely}} studied in the computer vision and robotics communities. SLAM approaches that make use of objects and higher level features have also recently been proposed. Using higher level features provides several benefits: these can be more discrim-inative, which helps data association, and can serve to inform service robotic tasks that require higher level information, such as object models and poses. We propose an approach for online object {{discovery and}} object modeling, and extend a SLAM system to utilize these discovered and modeled objects as landmarks to help localize the robot in an online manner. Such landmarks are particularly useful for detecting <b>loop</b> <b>closures</b> in larger maps. In addition to the map, our system outputs a database of detected object models for use in future SLAM or service robotic tasks.

40|$|Changing environments {{present a}} number of {{challenges}} to mobile robots, {{one of the most}} significant being mapping and localisation. This problem is particularly significant in vision-based systems where illumination and weather changes can cause feature-based techniques to fail. In many applications only sections of an environment undergo extreme perceptual change. Some range-based sensor mapping approaches exploit this property by combining occasional place recognition with the assumption that odometry is accurate over short periods of time. In this paper, we develop this idea in the visual domain, by using occasional vision-driven <b>loop</b> <b>closures</b> to infer <b>loop</b> <b>closures</b> in nearby locations where visual recognition is difficult due to extreme change. We demonstrate successful map creation in an environment in which change is significant but constrained to one area, where both the vanilla CAT-Graph and a Sum of Absolute Differences matcher fails, use the described techniques to link dissimilar images from matching locations, and test the robustness of the system against false inferences...|$|R
40|$|<b>Loop</b> <b>closure</b> detection, {{the task}} of {{identifying}} locations revisited by a robot in a sequence of odometry and perceptual observations, is typically formulated as a combination of two subtasks: (1) bag-of-words image retrieval and (2) post-verification using RANSAC geometric verification. The main contribution {{of this study is}} the proposal of a novel post-verification framework that achieves good precision recall trade-off in <b>loop</b> <b>closure</b> detection. This study is motivated by the fact that not all <b>loop</b> <b>closure</b> hypotheses are equally plausible (e. g., owing to mutual consistency between <b>loop</b> <b>closure</b> constraints) and that if we have evidence that one hypothesis is more plausible than the others, then it should be verified more frequently. We demonstrate that the problem of <b>loop</b> <b>closure</b> detection can be viewed as an instance of a multi-model hypothesize-and-verify framework and build guided sampling strategies on the framework where loop closures proposed using image retrieval are verified in a planned order (rather than in a conventional uniform order) to operate in a constant time. Experimental results using a stereo SLAM system confirm that the proposed strategy, the use of <b>loop</b> <b>closure</b> constraints and robot trajectory hypotheses as a guide, achieves promising results despite the fact that there exists a significant number of false positive constraints and hypotheses.

40|$|Appearance-based {{localization}} {{is increasingly}} used for <b>loop</b> <b>closure</b> detection in metric SLAM systems.

Our underlying approach relies instead upon matching distinctive 'signatures' of individual local scenes to prompt <b>loop</b> <b>closure.</b> A key advantage of this method {{is that it is}} entirely independent of the navigation and or mapping process and so is entirely unaffected by gross errors in pose estimation. Another advantage, which is explored in this paper, is the possibility to enhance robustness of <b>loop</b> <b>closure</b> detection by incorporating heterogeneous sensory observations.

40|$|Abstract—It is {{essential}} for a robot {{to be able to}} detect revisits or <b>loop</b> <b>closures</b> for long-term visual navigation. A key insight is that the loop-closing event inherently occurs sparsely, i. e., the image currently being taken matches with only a small subset (if any) of previous observations. Based on this observation, we formulate the problem of loop-closure detection as a sparse, convex ` 1 -minimization problem. By leveraging on fast convex optimization techniques, we are able to efficiently find <b>loop</b> <b>closures,</b> thus enabling real-time robot navigation. This novel formulation requires no offline dictionary learning, as required by most existing approaches, and thus allows online incremental operation. Our approach ensures a global, unique hypothesis by choosing only a single globally optimal match when making a loop-closure decision. Furthermore, the proposed formulation enjoys a flexible representation, with no restriction imposed on how images should be represented, while requiring only that the representations be close to each other when the corresponding images are visually similar. The proposed algorithm is validated extensively using public real-world datasets. I...|$|R
