5|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 April, German {{aircraft}} conducted surprise attacks on Yugoslav airfields in the 7th Army area, including <b>Ljubljana</b> and Cerklje, where the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group was based. At 07:00, Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters of Jagdgeschwader 27 strafed <b>Ljubljana</b> airfield, attacking hangars and some Potez 25 biplanes.|$|E
5|$|Around 12:00, the Italians {{went over}} to the offensive, with the 3rd Alpine Group tasked to advance to the line Selca–Radovljica, XI Corps to push via Logatec to <b>Ljubljana,</b> VI Corps to drive on Prezid, and V Corps to advance from Fiume towards Kraljevica then Lokve. While one Italian attack south of the Snežnik plateau was stopped by {{elements}} of the Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski and the Italian advance was held up by border troops in some areas, there was little significant resistance, {{and by the end of}} the day they had captured Sušak, Bakar, Delnice, Jesenice, Vrhnika, Logatec and <b>Ljubljana.</b> To assist the Italian advance, the Luftwaffe attacked Yugoslav troops in the <b>Ljubljana</b> region, and the 14th Panzer Division, which had captured Zagreb on 10 April, drove west to encircle the withdrawing 7th Army. The Italians faced little resistance, and captured about 30,000 troops of the 7th Army waiting to surrender near Delnice. When the Italian 14th Infantry Division Isonzo entered <b>Ljubljana,</b> a delegate of the NszS greeted its commander, Generale di Divisione Federico Romero, and symbolically handed him the keys to the city. An official reception was held for Romero that evening, attended by Natlačen and most of the members of the NszS, but because Natlačen and the council preferred that the Germans occupy <b>Ljubljana,</b> he asked Romero for permission to travel to Celje the following day to meet with Lanz.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} he joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia, Đurišić was very {{critical}} of Mihailović's leadership, and argued strongly for all the remaining Chetnik troops {{to move to the}} area of the <b>Ljubljana</b> Gap in modern-day Slovenia. At this point Ostojić and Baćović were also questioning Mihailović's plans. When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move to the <b>Ljubljana</b> Gap independent of Mihailović, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić's forces already in the <b>Ljubljana</b> Gap to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement. When he left Mihailović, he was joined by Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić and the Chetnik detachments commanded by Ostojić and Baćović as well as a large number of refugees.|$|E
50|$|At first, TV <b>Ljubljana's</b> second {{television}} network primarily relayed programs from other Yugoslav television stations. In the late 1980s, however, {{the percentage of}} TV <b>Ljubljana's</b> own programs on the second network increased dramatically.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} the {{captured}} Yugoslav warships, notably Dubrovnik, Beograd and the repaired <b>Ljubljana,</b> were employed by the Italian Regia Marina until the armistice in 1943, whereupon the German Kriegsmarine, {{and to a lesser}} extent the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, appropriated the surviving vessels for their own fleets. <b>Ljubljana</b> was wrecked on a shoal near the Gulf of Tunis whilst in Italian service in April 1943, and Dalmacija entered German service with her previous German name Niobe, but was soon transferred to the Croatian navy as Zniam. Beached on Silba island, she was destroyed by British MTBs in December 1943. Dubrovnik and Beograd were not sunk by Allied forces until April and May 1945 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Television {{programs}} {{featuring the}} Lipizzans include The White Horses, a 1965 children's television series co-produced by RTV <b>Ljubljana</b> (now RTV Slovenija) of Yugoslavia and BR-TV of Germany, re-broadcast in the United Kingdom. It followed {{the adventures of}} a teenage girl who visits a farm where Lipizzan horses are raised.|$|E
5|$|When Yugoslavia {{was drawn}} into the war by the German-led Axis {{invasion}} on 6 April 1941, Beograd and Zagreb were allocated to the 1st Torpedo Division at the Bay of Kotor along with Dubrovnik, but <b>Ljubljana</b> was still under repair at Šibenik. On 9 April, Beograd and other vessels were tasked with supporting {{an attack on the}} Italian enclave of Zara on the Dalmatian coast, but the naval prong of the attack was aborted when Beograd suffered engine damage from near misses by Italian aircraft. She returned to the Bay of Kotor for repairs. Beograd and <b>Ljubljana</b> were captured in port by Italian forces on 17 April, but on the same day, two of Zagrebs officers scuttled her to prevent her capture, and were killed by the resulting explosions.|$|E

5|$|Work {{began in}} 1954 on {{construction}} of the building to Glanz's plans, using Tehnika, a <b>Ljubljana</b> construction firm. Part of the ethos was that local building materials should be used, such as wood, stone and marble. 27 master craftsmen were also used for the metalwork and joinery. It was completed in 1959.|$|E
5|$|About 06:00 on 11 April, LI Infantry Corps recommenced its push south towards Zagreb, {{with lead}} {{elements}} exiting the mountains {{northwest of the}} city in the evening of the same day, while the 1st Mountain Division captured Celje after some hard marching and difficult fighting. Emissaries from the newly formed National Council of Slovenia approached the commander of XLIX Mountain Corps, General der Infanterie Ludwig Kübler to ask for a ceasefire. Also on 11 April, the Italian 2nd Army commenced offensive operations around 12:00, with the XI Corps pushing through Logatec towards <b>Ljubljana,</b> VI Corps advancing in the direction of Prezid, while strong formations attacked south through Fiume towards Kraljevica and towards Lokve. By this stage, the 7th Army was withdrawing, although some units took advantage of existing fortifications to resist. To assist the Italian advance, the Luftwaffe attacked Yugoslav troops in the <b>Ljubljana</b> region, and the 14th Panzer Division, which had captured Zagreb on 10 April, drove west to encircle the withdrawing 7th Army. The Italians faced little resistance, and captured about 30,000 Yugoslav troops waiting to surrender near Delnice.|$|E
5|$|Another event which {{attracted}} {{much debate}} was the Supreme Court's annulment of the 1946 war crimes conviction of Gregorij Rožman. Rožman was the Catholic bishop of <b>Ljubljana</b> {{who had been}} found guilty of war crimes and treason during World War II {{as a result of}} his collaboration with Italian and German occupation forces. Several attempts during the 1990s to review the trial had failed. This had led to Janša's government changing the law, enabling the religious communities to request a review of trials of their deceased members, something which had previously been reserved only for close relatives. After the Archdiocese of <b>Ljubljana</b> initiated the review, the Supreme Court annulled the 1946 trial on procedural grounds, effectively rehabilitating Rožman, a decision that caused much controversy. This proved harmful for Peterle's campaign, as he was closely associated with the Catholic Church. When asked about the Rožman case in a TV debate, Peterle confined himself to remarking that he was a supporter of the rule of law, that the war had divided the nation and that Rožman had played some part in that.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, only two of the ships had been commissioned, with the third being brought into service three months after the war started. Their only significant pre-war task was undertaken by Beograd in May 1939, and involved the transportation of a large portion of Yugoslavia's gold reserve to the United Kingdom for safekeeping. On 24 January 1940, <b>Ljubljana</b> ran into a reef off the Yugoslav port of Šibenik. The hull side was breached and despite efforts to get the ship into the port, it sank close to shore, and some of the crew swam to safety. One crew member died, and the captain was arrested pending an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Babangida {{spent two}} more seasons at Roda JC. Babangida's 10 league goals in 1995–96, {{made him the}} club's top scorer that season. In 1995, Babangida made his European debut, scoring a goal in the UEFA Cup first-round win over Olimpija <b>Ljubljana,</b> Roda's first European {{campaign}} in five years. Roda went on to beat the Slovenian side 5–2 on aggregate, but lost to Benfica in the second round. Solid performances at both international and club level led to interest from Dutch side Ajax, as Louis van Gaal was looking to replace Babangida's compatriot Finidi George, who had recently departed to Real Betis.|$|E
