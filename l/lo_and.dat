5|$|The Allies {{failed to}} achieve any of their goals on the first day. Carentan, St. <b>Lô,</b> <b>and</b> Bayeux {{remained}} in German hands, and Caen, a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained a foothold which the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.|$|E

Audrina is saddened after hearing of Justin's comments, and is worried that he and Kristin are seeing each other. During a later date with Justin, Kristin confesses that she thought he still has feelings for Audrina, and understands that Audrina looks at her as a threat.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (<b>LO)</b> <b>and</b> converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E

25|$|Optical phonons have a non-zero {{frequency}} at the Brillouin {{zone center}} and show no dispersion near that long wavelength limit. This {{is because they}} correspond to a mode of vibration where positive and negative ions at adjacent lattice sites swing against each other, creating a time-varying electrical dipole moment. Optical phonons that interact in this way with light are called infrared active. Optical phonons that are Raman active can also interact indirectly with light, through Raman scattering. Optical phonons are often abbreviated as <b>LO</b> <b>and</b> TO phonons, for the longitudinal and transverse modes respectively; the splitting between <b>LO</b> <b>and</b> TO frequencies is often described accurately by the Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, her singing voice {{strained}} from overwork, {{she appeared in}} the London cast of the Ivor Novello play, Party which opened in London on 23 May 1932. With {{the onset of the}} Depression, she returned to Hollywood and began teaching voice, counting the actors Ramón Novarro and Frances Drake among her pupils. Subsequent theatrical performances on Broadway and on tour included supporting parts in Enter Madame, Night of Love, Claudia, and <b>Lo</b> <b>and</b> Behold. During the 1940s/50s, her voice mellowed to that of a mezzo-soprano and she enjoyed modest success on the concert recital circuit, singing occasionally on radio. On tour, many of her costumes were designed by her friend and patroness, heiress Natalie Hays Hammond, daughter of the real adventurer who discovered King Solomon's Mines.|$|E

25|$|Apart from Yaowarat, Bangkok {{also has}} several other {{distinct}} ethnic neighbourhoods. The Indian community is centred in Phahurat, where the Gurdwara Siri Guru Singh Sabha, founded in 1933, is located. Ban Khrua on Saen Saep Canal {{is home to}} descendants of the Cham who settled in the late 18th century. Although the Portuguese who settled during the Thonburi period have ceased to exist as a distinct community, their past is reflected in Santa Kruz Church, {{on the west bank}} of the river. Likewise, the Assumption Cathedral on Charoen Krung Road is among many European-style buildings in the Old Farang Quarter, where European diplomats and merchants lived during the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Nearby, the Haroon Mosque is the centre of a Muslim community. Newer expatriate communities exist along Sukhumvit Road, including the Japanese community near Soi Phrom Phong and Soi Thong <b>Lo,</b> <b>and</b> the Arab and North African neighbourhood along Soi Nana. Sukhumvit Plaza, a mall on Soi Sukhumvit 12, is popularly known as Korea Town.|$|E
25|$|The hill's {{relative}} {{location to}} Route 9 gave the Rockpile an added significance. Route 9 is {{a road that}} runs parallel to the DMZ from Dong Ha, past the Rockpile, and on through Khe Sanh before becoming a dirt track that crosses the border into Laos. In addition, its location gave the American forces an upper hand in the defense and supply of Khe Sanh Combat Base, Ca Lu Combat Base, and Camp Carroll as {{it was possible to}} interdict potential ambushes along Route 9. Mountains positioned on either side of Route 9 near the Rockpile provided the NVA and VC with excellent cover to mount any ambushes against allied convoys travelling through the area. For these reasons the United States high command decided to keep the Rockpile and the surrounding area as secure as possible for several years {{during the height of the}} conflict. Ultimately, the United States' occupation of the Rockpile forced the NVA and VC to use higher and more dangerous infiltration routes to the west closer to Laos because the normal routes through the Cam <b>Lo</b> <b>and</b> Dong Ha area were essentially closed off.|$|E
25|$|MIPS I has {{instructions}} for signed and unsigned integer multiplication and division. These instructions source their operands from two GPRs and write their results {{to a pair}} of 32-bit registers called HI and LO, since they may execute separately from (and concurrently with) the other CPU instructions. For multiplication, the high- and low-order halves of the 64-bit product is written to HI and LO (respectively). For division, the quotient is written to <b>LO</b> <b>and</b> the remainder to HI. To access the results, a pair of instructions (Move from HI and Move from LO) is provided to copy the contents of HI or LO to a GPR. These instructions are interlocked: reads of HI and LO do not proceed past an unfinished arithmetic instruction that will write to HI and LO. Another pair of instructions (Move to HI or Move to LO) copies the contents of a GPR to HI and LO. These instructions are used to restore HI and LO to their original state after exception handling. Instructions that read HI or LO must be separated by two instructions that do not write to HI or LO.|$|E

25|$|The 741st led the 2nd Infantry Division’s {{assault on}} Hill 192 on 11–12 July in the {{breakout}} from Normandy. Hill 192, the dominant terrain east of St. Lô, {{had to be}} taken in order for the American forces to liberate St. <b>Lõ</b> <b>and</b> establish an organized front line from which to launch Operation Cobra. After taking Hill 192, the 2nd Infantry Division went on the defensive until the start of Operation Cobra. On 26 July, the 2nd Infantry Division, with the 741st Tank Battalion continuing to provide direct fire support, advanced slowly, anchoring the left flank of the main assault of Operation Cobra, which took place to the west of St. Lõ. The division and the 741st advanced together as far as Tinchebray before new orders temporarily sent them on divergent paths. The 2nd Infantry Division was withdrawn from the line {{in order to reduce the}} fortress at Brest while the 741st Tank Battalion reverted to 3rd Armored Group control, under whose direction the battalion raced across western France to the outskirts of Paris at Sceaux. On 27 August, it was attached to the 28th Infantry Division in order to participate with the division in the Liberation Day Parade through Paris on 29 August, a tumultuous procession around the Arc de Triomphe and down the Champs-Élysées just four days after the Germans had formally surrendered the city. After a brief two-day respite, the battalion was on the march again; this time through Compiègne, the Aisne valley and Belgian Luxembourg and into the Duchy of Luxembourg, reaching the West Wall in Germany by 9 September in the vicinity of Sevenig and Roscheid. On 2 October, the 741st Tank Battalion was relieved from attachment to the 28th Infantry Division and again attached to the 2nd Infantry Division, with which it remained until the end of the war.|$|E
