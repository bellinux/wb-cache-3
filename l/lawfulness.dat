5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of proof of {{justifying}} the <b>lawfulness</b> of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by the production of the detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E
5|$|In Arabic, {{the word}} for street (الشارع, ash-shāriʿ) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, {{the point of a}} weapon, and law or <b>lawfulness</b> and {{legitimacy}} in both the secular and religious sense. Among those words are sharia, the term for Islamic religious and moral law. Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the source of all religious law.|$|E
5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} {{that the}} nature and conditions of her detention rendered the detention unlawful. The Court of Appeal accepted that detention that was prima facie lawful can become unlawful if the nature or conditions of the detention fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman conditions must be shown to exist. In general, where {{the manner in which}} the detention is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the conditions of the detention, not the <b>lawfulness</b> of the detention itself.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{passed through}} the Parliament Act, {{without the consent of}} the Lords, is still {{considered}} primary legislation. The importance of this was highlighted in Jackson v Attorney General, in which the <b>lawfulness</b> of the Parliament Act 1949 was questioned. The challenge asserted that the 1949 Parliament Act was delegated rather than primary legislation, and that the 1911 Parliament Act had delegated power to the Commons. If this were the case, then the House of Commons could not empower itself through the 1949 Parliament Act without direct permission from the House of Lords. Since it was passed under the 1911 Act, the 1949 Act had never received the required consent of the Lords. However, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords found that the 1949 Act had been lawfully enacted. The 1911 Act, it concluded, was not primarily about empowering the Commons, but rather had the purpose of restricting the ability of the Lords to reject legislation. This ruling also appears to mean that efforts to abolish the House of Lords (a major constitutional change) by using the Act could be successful, although the issue was not directly addressed in the ruling.|$|E

25|$|In its {{original}} consultation document published on 23 July 2002 the Government decided to expand Stansted and Heathrow, but not Gatwick. However, Medway Council, Kent County Council and Essex County Council sought a {{judicial review of}} this decision. The judge reviewing the <b>lawfulness</b> of the Government's decision ruled that excluding Gatwick from the original consultation was irrational and/or unfair. Following the judge's ruling and the Secretary of State for Transport's decision not to appeal, BAA published new consultation documents. These included an option of a possible second runway at Gatwick {{to the south of}} the existing airport boundary, leaving the villages Charlwood and Hookwood {{to the north of the}} airport intact. This led to protests about increased noise and pollution, demolition of houses and destruction of villages.|$|E
25|$|As {{there has}} been no legal process to assess the <b>lawfulness</b> or {{otherwise}} of the killing, critics argue that the Campaign's first aim to 'find out the truth about Jean’s unlawful killing' reflects a prejudging of the issue. Critics such as Conservative London Assemblyman Brian Coleman have suggested that the involvement of Asad Rehman, a former leader of the Stop the War Coalition and former adviser to Respect politician George Galloway in the campaign shows that the family's campaign had been 'hijacked' and the death of Menezes was being used to 'advance a political aim.' Galloway's secretary said that Rehman had been acting in 'a personal capacity, … not in his role as political adviser', and Menezes family members Alessandro Pereira and Vivien Figueiredo denied any manipulation.|$|E
25|$|Milton {{married in}} Spring 1642, and shortly after, his wife Marie Powell, left him and {{returned}} {{to live with her}} mother. The legal statutes of England did not allow for Milton to apply for a divorce and he resorted to promoting the <b>lawfulness</b> of divorce. Although the laws did not change, he wrote four tracts on the topic of divorce, with The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce as his first tract. The first tract was created during a time of humiliation, and Milton was motivated towards writing on the topic after reading the work of Martin Bucer on divorce. Although {{it is impossible to know}} why exactly Powell separated from Milton, it is possible that Powell's family, a strong royalist family, caused a political difference that was exacerbated by the English Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{privilege}} {{of habeas corpus}} has been suspended or restricted several times during English history, most recently during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although internment without trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during the two World Wars and the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the habeas corpus procedure has in modern times always technically remained available to such internees. However, as habeas corpus is only a procedural device to examine the <b>lawfulness</b> of a prisoner's detention, {{so long as the}} detention is in accordance with an Act of Parliament, the petition for habeas corpus is unsuccessful. Since the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998, the courts have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but such a declaration of incompatibility has no legal effect unless and until it is acted upon by the government.|$|E

500|$|After being indicted by a grand jury, Abramski {{moved to}} dismiss the indictment. Abramski claimed that: (1), his {{misrepresentation}} on Question 11.a. was not “material to the <b>lawfulness</b> of the sale,” under §922(a)(6), since Alvarez was able to lawfully purchase the gun; and (2), since the answer to Question 11.a. is not “required ... {{to be kept in}} the records” of the gun dealer, the false statement is not in violation of §924(a)(1)(A). The District Court denied both motions, and Abramski entered a conditional guilty plea, where he reserved the right to challenge the sentence. Abramski was then sentenced to five years of probation on every count. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court's conviction.|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} scientist Arnold S. Rice writes that Evans also {{worked on a}} series of changes, advertised as reforms, to the Klan structure and sought to promote a positive public opinion of the Klan; Evans felt that his organization should be able to reach out to those who were [...] "struggling with the moral decay and economic distress of the 20thcentury". He increased the Klan's surveillance of members before and after initiation, expelling those considered to be of [...] "questionable morals". He also worked to increase Klan involvement in local policing and denounced acts of violence committed by Klan members, promoting the Klan as a symbol of <b>lawfulness.</b> These efforts, although successful in reducing the number of attacks, were ultimately unable to sway public opinion in the Klan's favor.|$|E
500|$|The two {{met again}} in July at Fremland in Essex. Garnet told Catesby that he [...] "wished {{him to look}} what he did if he {{intended}} anything. That he must first look to the <b>lawfulness</b> of the act itself, and then he must not have so little regard of Innocents that he spare not friends and necessary persons for the Commonwealth." [...] When Catesby offered to tell the priest more, Garnet declined: [...] "I told him what charge we all had of quietness and to procure the like in others." [...] Garnet also spoke with William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, asking him [...] "if Catholics {{were able to make}} their part good by arms against the King", but Monteagle's reply was vague. [...] Author Alan Haynes suggests that Garnet may at that point have become marginalised.|$|E
500|$|Human Rights Watch {{has stated}} that the [...] "re-education through labor" [...] system violates {{international}} law, specifically Article 9 (4.)of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which provides that [...] "Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the <b>lawfulness</b> of his detention..." [...] Re-education through labor has also been criticized by numerous human rights groups for not offering procedural guarantees for the accused, and for being used to detain political dissidents, teachers, Chinese house church leaders, and Falun Gong practitioners. Furthermore, even though the law up until 2007 specified a maximum length of detainment of four years, at least one source mentions a [...] "retention for in-camp employment" [...] system that allowed authorities to keep detainees in the camps for longer than their official sentences.|$|E
500|$|The Gun Control Act of 1968 {{regulates the}} sale and {{transfer}} of guns. Section 922(a)(6) of the act makes it unlawful for any person acquiring a gun from a gun dealer to [...] "knowingly ... make any false or fictitious ... written statement ... likely to deceive" [...] the dealer, [...] "with respect to any fact material to the <b>lawfulness</b> of the sale." [...] Section 924(a)(1)(A) of the same act, makes it unlawful and provides a penalty for anyone who [...] "knowingly makes any false statement or representation {{with respect to the}} information required by this chapter to be kept in the records of a firearms dealer under this chapter." [...] These provisions of the Act only apply to purchasers in the [...] "primary market," [...] that is purchasers buying guns from gun dealers. The provisions do not apply to the [...] "secondary market," [...] that is second hand guns sold or gifted by a private party.|$|E
500|$|Dissenting, Justice Scalia {{would have}} held that {{although}} Abramski made a false statement by claiming {{that he was the}} buyer/transferee, since Alvarez was lawfully able to buy the gun, the statement is not [...] "with respect to any fact material to the <b>lawfulness</b> of the sale," [...] which is the requirement in §922(a)(6). Additionally, the dissent criticized the government's use of the [...] "agency law" [...] principle to determine that Abramski was a third party’s common-law agent for Alvarez. Instead, the dissent believed that common English should be used to interpret statutes, and therefore, under the statue, Abramski was the [...] "person" [...] buying the gun, not Alvarez. Furthermore, the dissent did not think that the statute is [...] "rendered meaningless" [...] simply because one can buy a gun on behalf of another, just like it is not rendered meaningless when one gifts a gun. The dissent also wondered why the majority wouldn't agree that this is yet another loophole to a statute that has so many loopholes, and argued that perhaps it was congress' intent to only limit the actual person at the counter. The dissent also stated that even if the majority had the proper interpretation of the statute, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. Regarding the Section 924 charges, the dissent explained that the statute clearly lists what the dealer is required to maintain on record, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether he is the actual buyer is not on the list. The dissent stated that the majority's interpretation ultimately carried the text too far. [...] "f the bureaucrats responsible for creating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer’s favorite color, a false response would be a federal crime." [...] Justice Scalia concluded with the statement: ...|$|E
500|$|Abramski's first {{defense was}} that the {{misrepresentation}} was not material since his uncle was legally capable of making the purchase himself, and {{that the answer to}} the question of whether he was purchasing the gun for himself was not required to be kept on the firearms dealer's record. When reaching the Supreme Court, Abramski modified his defense and claimed that the law only cares about the person buying the gun from the dealer, not the final receiver of the gun. The Court did not agree with this interpretation and held that the law cared about the final receiver, which is properly considered the person buying the gun. Such straw arrangement, the Court held, are different from allowed transfers where a person buys a gun for himself and later decides to sell it. The court therefore found that the misrepresentation was material and also that the answer was required to be kept on the dealer's record. The Court thus held that the purchase violated 18 U.S.C. §922(a)(6), which makes it unlawful to falsify facts [...] "material to the <b>lawfulness</b> of the sale,” and 18 U.S.C. §924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits misrepresentation with respect to information which a is required to maintain on record. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the declaration about the ultimate recipient of the gun was not material to the sale, and that it is not included in the information that the dealer is required to keep on the records. After the ruling, proponents of gun control stated that the Court's decision will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, while opponents of gun control stated that the ruling is a [...] "horrible injustice".|$|E
