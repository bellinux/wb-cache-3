5|$|The potoos (sometimes called poor-me-ones) {{are large}} near {{passerine}} birds {{related to the}} nightjars and frogmouths. They are nocturnal insectivores which <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> bristles around the mouth found in the true nightjars.|$|E
5|$|The smaller white-winged chough {{has similar}} plumage but has red eyes and is found {{mainly on the}} ground. Australian crow and raven species have white eyes and <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> white rump, and the similar-sized Australian magpie has red eyes and {{prominent}} black and white plumage. The larger grey currawong is readily distinguished by its lighter grey overall plumage and lack of white feathers {{at the base of}} the tail. In northwestern Victoria, the black-winged currawong (subspecies melanoptera of the grey) does have a darker plumage than other grey subspecies, but its wings <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> white primaries of the pied currawong.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cells <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> Dictyostelium 34, 000 -D actin-bundling protein, a calcium-regulated actin {{crosslinking}} protein, {{were created}} to probe the function of this polypeptide in living cells. Gene replacement vectors were constructed by inserting either the UMP synthase or hygromycin resistance cassette into cloned 4 -kb genomic DNA containing sequences encoding the 34 -kD protein. After transformation and growth under appropriate selection, cells <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> protein were analyzed by PCR analyses on genomic DNA, Northern blotting, and Western blotting. Cells <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> 34 -kD protein were obtained in strains derived from AX 2 and AX 3. Growth, pinocytosis, morphogenesis, and expression of developmentally regulated genes is normal in cells <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> 34 -kD protein. In chemotaxis studies...|$|R
5|$|Anthozoans are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. Many species supplement their energy needs by {{making use of}} photosynthetic single-celled algae that live within their tissues. These species live in shallow water and many are reef-builders. Other species <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E
5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which develop to blue, edible berries in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, who picked and ate the berries, before botanists became aware {{of them in the}} 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Ground-dwelling frogs {{generally}} <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> {{adaptations of}} aquatic and arboreal frogs. Most have smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. Some burrowing frogs such as Couch's spadefoot (Scaphiopus couchii) have a flap-like toe extension on the hind feet, a keratinised tubercle {{often referred to}} as a spade, that helps them to burrow.|$|E
50|$|It is in La {{relation}} d'objet that Lacan {{introduces the}} algebraic {{symbol for the}} barred Other, and lack comes to designate <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of <b>the</b> signifier in the Other. Then {{the relation of the}} subject to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of <b>the</b> signifier in the Other, designates the signifier of a <b>lack</b> in <b>the</b> Other. No matter how many signifiers one adds to the signifying chain, the chain is always incomplete, it always <b>lacks</b> <b>the</b> signifier that could complete it. This missing signifier is then constitutive of the subject.|$|R

5|$|Immature {{birds have}} pale brown upperparts, <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> dark head found in adults, and have uniform buff underparts {{that can be}} {{confused}} with juveniles of other munia species such as the tricoloured munia (Lonchura malacca) across the Asian and island populations and the black-throated munia (Lonchura kelaarti) in parts of India or Sri Lanka. Populations within their wide distribution range show variations in plumage color and size.|$|E
5|$|King {{vultures}}, which <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> {{ability to}} smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of}} the dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|PAL {{versions}} of the single-disc volume sets started being released on February 19, 2007;. As with the original Region 1 NTSC DVDs, each set contains four episodes per disc. The Complete Book One Collection was released on January 26, 2009 containing all twenty episodes on five discs. These Region 2 releases <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> commentary tracks and other DVD extras found on the Region 1 releases.|$|E
5|$|Recently an {{alternative}} proteasome was identified in human cells that <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> α3 core subunit. These proteasomes (known as the α4-α4 proteasomes) instead form 20S core particles containing an additional α4 subunit {{in place of}} the missing α3 subunit. Interestingly, these alternative 'α4-α4' proteasomes have been known previously to exist in yeast. Although the precise function of these proteasome isoforms is still largely unknown, cells expressing these proteasomes show enhanced resistance to toxicity induced by metallic ions such as cadmium.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E

5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds {{that human beings are}} cognitively closed in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E

5|$|The F-22 {{is among}} {{only a few}} {{aircraft}} that can supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel-inefficient afterburners; it can intercept targets which subsonic aircraft would <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft would <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> fuel to reach. The Raptor's high operating altitude is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters {{due to a lack}} of aerodynamic drag from external stores. The F-22's structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and composites comprise 39% and 24% of the aircraft's structural weight.|$|E
