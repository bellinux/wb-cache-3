50|$|A solid {{solution}} results when one cation can substitute for another across an appreciable composition range. In carrollite Co2+ can substitute for Cu+ at the A sites, {{and when the}} substitution is complete the mineral formed is called <b>linnaeite,</b> Co2+Co3+2S4. This {{means that there is}} a {{solid solution}} series between carrollite and <b>linnaeite.</b> Also, Ni substitutes for both Co and Cu in the carrollite structure, giving a solid solution from carrollite to cuprian siegenite. Siegenite, Co2+Ni3+2S4, is itself a member of the solid solution series between <b>linnaeite</b> and polydymite, Ni2+Ni3+2S4. (Wagner and Cook found no evidence for solid solution between carrollite and fletcherite, CuNi2S4).|$|E

50|$|Carrollite, CuCo2S4, is a sulfide {{of copper}} and cobalt, often with {{substantial}} substitution of nickel for the metal ions, {{and a member}} of the <b>linnaeite</b> group. It is named after the type locality in Carroll County, Maryland, US, at the Patapsco mine, Sykesville.|$|E
50|$|Stilleite is a {{selenide}} mineral, zinc selenide, {{with the}} formula ZnSe. It {{has been found}} only as microscopic gray crystals occurring as inclusions in <b>linnaeite</b> associated with other selenide and sulfides. It was originally discovered in Katanga Province, Zaire in 1956 and is named for the German geologist, Hans Stille (1876-1966).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>linnaeite</b> {{group is}} a group of sulfides and selenides with the general formula AB2X4 in which X is sulfur or selenium, A is {{divalent}} Fe, Ni, Co or Cu and B is trivalent Co, Ni or, for daubréelite, Cr. The minerals are isometric, space group Fd3m and isostructural {{with each other and with}} minerals of the spinel group. The structure of the <b>linnaeite</b> group consists of a cubic close packed array of X (X is oxygen in the spinels and sulfur or selenium in the <b>linnaeite</b> group). Within the array of Xs there are two types of interstices, one type tetrahedrally co-ordinated and one type octahedrally co-ordinated. One eighth of the tetrahedal sites A are typically occupied by 2+ cations, and half of the octahedral sites B by 3+ cations. Charnock et al. confirmed that carrollite contains Cu wholly within the tetrahedral sites. [...] Thus, the ideal formula one would expect for a spinel like carrollite is Cu2+Co3+2S2−4, but as in the case of copper sulfides in general the oxidation state of the copper atom is 1+, not 2+. An assignment of valences as Cu+Co3+2S1.75−4 is more appropriate; this was confirmed in a study of 2009. The one missing electron per four sulfur atoms is delocalized, leading to metallic conductivity and even superconductivity at very low temperatures, combined with a complicated magnetic behavior.|$|E

The results, which are in agreement with previously postulated qualitative models, support mixing of highest energy occupied orbitals (octahedral site e * and tetrahedral site e orbitals) in CqSa and CuCo 2 Sa with consequent metallic conductivity and temperature independent (Pauli) paramagnetism. This contrasts with FerSo in which spin-splitting of the orbitals in the valence region results in localized outermost electrons and ordered magnetism.

40|$|A novel {{route for}} the {{synthesis}} of complex metal sulfides using hydrothermal coupled dissolution−reprecipitation reactions is reported. Two thiospinels, (Ni,Fe) 3 S 4 (violarite) and Co 3 S 4 (<b>linnaeite),</b> were synthesized using (Fe,Ni) 9 S 8 (pentlandite) and Co 9 S 8 (cobaltpentlandite) as precursors. The Fe/Ni ratio of (Ni,Fe) 3 S 4 can be adjusted by varying the reaction conditions, for example, temperature (125 – 145 °C), pH (2. 90, 3. 90, 5. 00), and precursor stoichiometry ((FexNi 1 −x) 9 S 8, x = 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 55, 0. 6). Pure (Ni,Fe) 3 S 4 can be synthesized by utilizing a flow-through hydrothermal cell rather than a static hydrothermal cell as the fluid flow improves mass transfer and flushes away the Fe 2 O 3 byproduct from the reaction front. Synthesis times range from 10 to 20 days, compared to the traditional dry synthesis route for (Ni,Fe) 3 S 4 that requires 3 months annealing to obtain a product of only 72 ± 3 wt % purity.

40|$|The phase {{relations}} in the sulfur-rich regions of the system Fe–Co–Ni–As–S were investigated with mineral syntheses, and characterization of the products by electron-microprobe analysis and powder X-ray diffraction. The experimental charges were weighed with an atomic ratio (Fe + Co + Ni) /(As + S) of 1 : 2 and a S:As ratio of 3 : 1. Two isothermal sections were investigated, 500 ° and 650 °C. The 500 °C experiments resulted {{in the formation of}} arsenopyrite, cobaltite, cattierite, gersdorffite, <b>linnaeite,</b> monosulfide solid-solution, pyrite, siegenite and vaesite. Pyrite, the most common phase, is found in all Fe-bearing assemblages. The phase assemblages formed at 650 °C involve cattierite, vaesite, cobaltite and gersdorffite in Fe-poor samples. In Fe-rich samples, the phase assemblage is dominated by monosulfide solid-solution and As 1 –xSx melt.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Petrographic, microscopic, and X-ray {{investigations}} of a uranium occurrence near Tiraun, Graubfinden, Switzerland, are described. The uranium mineralization ccurs in greenschist facies metamorphic rocks of the Tavetsch massif and consists essentially of uraninite of various habits with minor chalcopyrite, <b>linnaeite,</b> millerite, galena, marcasite, pyrite, hematite, magnetite, and skutterudite. The ore structure, character-ized by concentrations along foliation planes, boudinage, and rotated (helicitic) textures of uraninite porphyro-blasts, {{is indicative of}} a synmetamorphic (Alpine) remobilization, recrystallization a d enrichment of the ore, which was probably derived from an original 'protore ' in psephites and psammites (9. sandstone-type mineralization) of at least Variscan age. The synmeta-morphic emplacement of the ore took place under medium- to high-temperature conditions (approx. 350 - 400 ~ as demonstrated bythe lattice constants of the uraninite phases and by the ore paragenesis. Late to postmetamorphic tectonism resulted in a partial remobilization (over cm distances) and redistribution of the ore along veinlets that cut the foliation planes. The characteristics of the ore from Tiraun {{are similar to those}} from the synmetamorphic orefrom Preit, northern Italy, as described by Cevales (1961).

Space group symmetry is Fd 3 m, even if lower symmetries are reported owing to the off-center displacement of metal ions. In oxide spinels (φ = O 2 –), A and B cations can be divalent and trivalent (“ 2 - 3 spinels”) or, more rarely, tetravalent and divalent (“ 4 - 2 spinels”). From a chemical point of view, oxide spinels belong to the chemical classes of oxides, germanates, and silicates. Up to now, 24 mineral species have been approved: ahrensite, brunogeierite, chromite, cochromite, coulsonite, cuprospinel, filipstadite, franklinite, gahnite, galaxite, hercynite, jacobsite, magnesiochromite, magnesiocoulsonite, magnesioferrite, magnetite, manganochromite, qandilite, ringwoodite, spinel, trevorite, ülvospinel, vuorelainenite, and zincochromite. Sulfospinels (φ = S 2 –) and selenospinels (φ = Se 2 –) are isostructural with oxide spinels. Twenty-one different mineral species have been approved so far; of them, three are selenospinels (bornhardtite, trüstedtite, and tyrrellite), whereas 18 are sulfospinels: cadmoindite, carrollite, cuproiridsite, cuprokalininite, cuprorhodsite, daubréelite, ferrorhodsite, fletcherite, florensovite, greigite, indite, kalininite, <b>linnaeite,</b> malanite, polydymite, siegenite, violarite, and xingzhongite.

40|$|An {{assessment}} is presented of existing {{data on the}} most important copper and cobalt complexes and sulphides applied to reactive transport modelling. The most important complexes in ore-forming hydrothermal solutions at 150 °C are CoCl(H 2 O) 5 +, CoCl 4 − 2 and CoCl 2 (H 2 O) 2 (aq) for cobalt, and CuCl 2 − and CuCl 3 − 2 for copper. Reactive transport modelling was carried out to simulate the transport and precipitation of copper and cobalt sulphides in sediment-hosted stratiform ore deposits, such as the Central African Copperbelt. A limitation is the lack of thermodynamic data for carrollite (CuCo 2 S 4). Initially chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and cattierite (CoS 2) precipitate in a reducing host rock. Pyrite dissolves in the horizon where both minerals form and it precipitates in adjacent rocks. The continuous supply of copper and cobalt causes formation of the metalrich sulphides bornite (Cu 5 FeS 4) and <b>linnaeite</b> (Co 3 S 4). Chalcopyrite and cattierite precipitate further in the flow direction. In this model, the dissociation reaction of chalcopyrite and bornite are: CuFeS 2 (s) + 2 H+=Cu 2 ++Fe 2 ++ 2 HS− Cu 5 FeS 4 (s) + 2 H+= 4 Cu++Cu 2 ++Fe 2 ++ 4 HS− However, if the dissociation reactions only include Cu+ and Fe 3 +, simulations show the precipitation of only chalcocite (Cu 2 S), which is explained by the low concentration of trivalent iron in solution.

40|$|The N–S Jacobina {{foreland}} basin is a Paleoproterozoic basin (2080 to 1900 Ma) of stacked detrital and schist formations developed along a sinistral wrench–overthrust {{fault of}} the Transamazonian orogeny. At least five successive stages are identified in the westward progradation of the basin, wherein bedding-parallel strike–slip thrusts and prograde metamorphism indicate progressive involvement in the Transamazonian collision. Shearing and associated metamorphic recrystallization indicate a high geothermal gradient and a gradual loading of the underthrust units, with those to the east being deeper seated than those to the west. Basic–ultrabasic dykes and granite stocks cross-cut the lithologies {{and contributed to the}} thermal evolution. Conglomerates and chaotic breccia layers found in several formations mark periods of tectonic instability accompanied by erosion of the earlier stages of basin development. Multistage hydrothermal activity is indicated by a widespread alteration with gold-bearing quartz lodes, conglomerates showing a sulphide–gold–Cr–mineral association, leaching of ultrabasic rocks, and emerald mineralization related to late-tectonic granite emplacement. The economic gold-bearing clastic sediments (conglomerates and minor quartzites deposited during the fourth unit/stage of basin development) have generally been interpreted according to the "modified paleoplacer" model. Such a model, which implies the existence of a gold preconcentration within the quartz–pebble conglomerates, is supported by the lithological controls, reworked pebbles (e. g. cataclastic quartz, quartz–pyrite mylonite and rare fuchsite-bearing rocks) that had been hydrothermally altered during an earlier hydrothermal stage, and lead isotopic compositions revealing an Archean inheritance that is partly preserved in galena inclusions. New basin-scale structural and metallogenic data obtained by the authors, suggest a basin model characterized by successive cycles of sedimentation–faulting/thrusting–erosion ("cannibalism" model) that favours both a "paleoplacer" model and a "mesothermal shear-zone-related epigenetic" model. Heterochronous shear zones, formed between 1988 and 1912 Ma during the development of the basin, acted as feeder zones for postsedimentary mesothermal quartz–tourmaline–muscovite/fuchsite lodes, which constitute a possible source of the reworked hydrothermally altered pebbles. These shear zones controlled (a) an acid leaching of the sediments and the subsequent development of Al-rich assemblages interpreted as advanced argillic alteration zones, and (b) a sulphidation process affecting detrital ilmenite and magnetite and responsible for the high concentration of gold within shear veins containing assemblages of Cr–Ni-bearing minerals (euhedral chromite, Cr–rutile, <b>linnaeite,</b> Cr–tourmaline and fuchsite) and euhedral pyrite that crystallized over andalusite. The conglomerates, with their pore and fissure permeability, acted as a "reservoir and trap" for the mineralizing fluids to give a "hydrothermal shear-reservoir" model...|$|E
40|$|Although pseudomorphic mineral {{replacement}} {{reactions are}} common in all geological environments and many industrial processes, {{few studies have been}} devoted to understanding the mechanisms and kinetics of these reactions. The subjects of this thesis are to understand the mechanisms and kinetics of pseudomorphic replacement reactions by detailed experimental studies on model systems, and to apply the principle of these reactions in the syntheses of novel materials. The mechanisms of pseudomorphic replacement reactions were revealed by a thorough kinetic and textural study of the replacement of pentlandite, (Fe,Ni) ₉S₈, by violarite (Ni,Fe) ₃S₄, under mild hydrothermal conditions (80 °C to 210 °C). Reaction kinetics shows a complex dependence on various physical and chemical parameters including temperature, sample texture of mineral assemblage, pH, and concentrations of various reaction species (e. g., oxidants, metal ions). Textural observations show a sharp phase boundary and a porous product. Both kinetic and textural results indicate a coupled dissolution–reprecipitation mechanism. The coupling between pentlandite dissolution and violarite precipitation is controlled by local solution chemistry as well as the epitaxial nucleation of violarite onto the pentlandite substrate. The latter was confirmed by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis that pentlandite and violarite share a common crystallographic orientation. The rate limiting step depends on solution chemistry and controls the degree and length scale of pseudomorphism: pentlandite dissolution being rate limiting at mild acidic to neutral conditions (1 < pH < 6) results in high degree pseudomorphism (length scale < 20 nm), of which violarite precisely preserves not only the overall morphology but also textural details (e. g., lamellae) of pentlandite; while violarite precipitation being rate limiting in strong acidic conditions (pH 1) the reactions produces low degree pseudomorphism (length scale ~ 10 μm), of which the overall morphology is only roughly preserved without preservation of textural details. The principle of pseudomorphic replacement reactions have been applied to the syntheses of two complex thiospinels, violarite, (Ni,Fe) ₃S₄, and <b>linnaeite,</b> Co₃S₄. Violarite is very difficult to prepare by the traditional dry synthesis route, which requires several months’ annealing and still only results in an impure product. By contrast, pure violarite was synthesized by hydrothermal pseudomorphic replacement within a few days, and the composition is tunable by simply changing temperature, the compositions of the solution and of the pentlandite precursor. Pseudomorphic replacement reactions have also been applied to the syntheses of zeolite monoliths composed of three-dimensional ordered arrays of nanocrystals with uniform size and crystallographic orientation. Such materials have potential applications but have never been prepared. This work demonstrates that pseudomorphic replacement reactions are suitable routes for this purpose by synthesizing monoliths of analcime (NaAlSi₂O₆. H₂O) as an illustration using natural leucite (KAlSi₂O₆) crystals as precursors. The leucite crystals have inherent three-dimensional hierarchical structure of uniformly sized lamellar twins arising from the cubic to tetragonal phase transition. Such uniform lamellar texture was precisely preserved during hydrothermal pseudomorphic replacement reactions in pH buffered NaCl solutions, resulting in three-dimensionally ordered arrays of cubic analcime nanocrystals. Moreover, these analcime nanocrystals have uniform size and crystallographic orientation, which is due to epitaxial nucleation and growth controlled by the leucite precursors. Pseudomorphic mineral replacement reactions make possible the syntheses of zeolites monoliths with very sophisticated shapes and could be used to synthesize other advanced functional materials.
