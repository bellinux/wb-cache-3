5|$|B.spinulosa {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It is {{resistant}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses a major threat to many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to <b>land</b> <b>clearing.</b> As a result, it {{does not appear}} on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} May 2008 with {{preliminary}} <b>land</b> <b>clearing.</b> The first track pieces were installed {{during the week}} of December 7, 2008. In February 2009, Universal launched a website for the attraction, which included a construction blog and photographs chronicling progress of the attraction's construction. The track layout was completed at the end of April 2009 with the crowning of the lift hill.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} aside, B.integrifolia {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It has excellent resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses a major threat to many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to <b>land</b> <b>clearing.</b> As a result, it {{does not appear}} on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E

5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} nests in hollows situated high {{in trees}} with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. With {{much of its}} habitat lost to <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> and development and threatened by further habitat destruction, Carnaby's black cockatoo is listed as an endangered species by the Federal and Western Australian governments. It is also classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Like most parrots, it is protected by CITES, an international agreement that makes trade, export, and import of listed wild-caught species illegal.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{extensive}} clearing of the Wheatbelt in the 1930s, B.cuneata {{must have had}} a highly fragmented distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and makes up only 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now been cleared of native vegetation, with the remaining 7% occurring in remnants of various sizes. Thus <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> must have further fragmented an already fragmented population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.|$|E
5|$|It is a bird of open sclerophyll forests, {{eucalypt}} and acacia woodlands and scrublands, with sparse or no understory, or low {{cover with}} shrubs such as Triodia, Lomandra or Hibbertia. It is less common in mallee scrub. In arid areas and northern Australia, {{it is more}} restricted to woodland alongside rivers and billabongs. It has become more common in southwest Western Australia with <b>land</b> <b>clearing,</b> though has become rare around Darwin on account of urban development.|$|E

5|$|<b>Land</b> <b>clearing</b> {{began on}} December 1, 2000, and {{construction}} on the footers began February 9, 2001. X-Flight was originally supposed to open in early May 2001, but due to technical difficulties, its opening was delayed. During testing, problems were discovered with several devices including the reclining mechanism on the trains and their restraints. X-Flight's media day was eventually held on May 24, 2001, and the ride officially opened two days later on May 26.|$|E
5|$|Threats to B.brownii include loss {{of habitat}} due to <b>land</b> <b>clearing,</b> {{commercial}} exploitation, disease, and {{changes to the}} fire regime. The fragmentation of populations is also of concern, as it causes the genetic diversity of the species to decline, potentially reducing vigour. Climate change is also of concern: depending on the severity of change, the range of this species is predicted to contract by 30% to 50% by 2080.|$|E
5|$|European {{occupation}} of Australia has, on the whole, benefited black-shouldered kites through <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> and irrigation for agriculture and grain harvesting and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much {{larger numbers of}} mice. According to raptor researcher Dr Stephen Debus, this species did not suffer from eggshell thinning {{during the period of}} DDT use in Australia, though he believes it is possible that secondary poisoning may occur from rodenticides used during mouse plagues or from pesticides used during locust plagues. Populations in areas with high sheep and rabbit numbers may decline, as these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.|$|E

5|$|Found across Tasmania and Bass Strait islands, {{the green}} rosella {{is one of}} the commonest birds encountered. It also occurs on {{offshore}} islands such as Maria, Bruny, De Witt and Maatsuyker Islands. Its movements have not been much studied. Although possibly locally nomadic in places, the green rosella is sedentary; even birds at higher altitudes do not migrate. It has become rare on King Island, due to <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> and possibly competition with the introduced common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) for nesting sites. During breeding season there it is restricted to the Pegarah forest, though may venture elsewhere at other times.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long {{abolished}} all large landholding by princes, nobles {{and high}} officials. He dismantled the 800-year-old practice of paying officials and rewarding or endowing nobles with {{a portion of}} the taxes from a village or a group thereof. Existing highways were repaired and new ones constructed, with the north-south road from Saigon to Lạng Sơn put under restoration. He organised a postal service to operate along the highways and public storehouses were built to alleviate starvation in drought-affected years. Gia Long enacted monetary reform and implemented a more socialized agrarian policy. However, the population growth far outstripped that of <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> and cultivation. There was little emphasis on innovation in agricultural technology, so the improvements in productivity were mainly derived from increasing the amount of cultivated farmland.|$|E
5|$|Rumors {{of a new}} {{roller coaster}} being built at Six Flags Magic Mountain first emerged {{in the summer of}} 2004. <b>Land</b> <b>clearing</b> began in mid-2005 around the Samurai Summit area of the park with track for the new roller coaster soon later {{beginning}} arriving from Ohio. Construction permits filed by Six Flags Magic Mountain and a trademark for the name Tatsu (filed on August 23, 2005) were later found by the public. Tatsu was officially announced to the public on November 17, 2005. Both Revolution and Roaring Rapids were temporarily closed in order for the roller coaster to be built. After construction and testing was complete, Tatsu opened to the public on May 13, 2006.|$|E
50|$|The town {{takes its}} name from a {{pastoral}} property named in 1909, being an Aboriginal word meaning plain <b>land,</b> <b>clear</b> of timber. It was previously known as Basin Creek.|$|R
50|$|The land grant {{required}} the settlers {{to survey the}} <b>land,</b> <b>clear</b> trees, build cabins, and plant crops. The settlers were soon growing corn, cotton, tobacco, indigo, fruits and vegetables.|$|R
5000|$|The name {{probably}} {{derives from}} the Middle English 'hous', from Old English 'hus' meaning a house and thwaite - [...] "a piece of <b>land</b> or <b>land</b> <b>cleared</b> of woods and converted to tillage".|$|R
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{threat to the}} bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{is likely to be}} ongoing <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> in semi-arid bioregions of Queensland and NSW. The eastern Australian Bioregions that comprise the core range of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat, particularly the Brigalow Belt (north and south), have been subjected to broad scale clearing and habitat modification since European settlement. Clearing of vegetation for agriculture and removal of hollow bearing trees for firewood collection and forestry are likely to reduce the availability of roosting sites for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat. Clearing of native vegetation and removal of dead wood and dead trees have been recognised as key threatening processes for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat in NSW.|$|E
5|$|Threats to B.cuneata include <b>land</b> <b>clearing,</b> {{which leads}} to direct plant loss and {{population}} fragmentation, grazing pressure, competition from exotic weeds, changes to the fire regime, and encroaching salinity. The Banksia Atlas survey found one population {{to be on the}} side of a road; the plants were aging with no new seedlings noted, and the site was weed-infested. A large part of the surviving populations are on private land, and depend on good relationships with local landowners. Many have obliged by fencing off areas and restricting entry of rabbits. There has been some attempt by CALM to translocate populations away from hazardous areas; these have met with some success, helped with watering in the first year.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal Tasmanians {{have lived}} {{on the island of}} Tasmania for {{thousands}} of years. The earliest archaeological evidence for Aboriginal habitation of Tasmania is from the valley of the Forth River, 35,000 years before the present. Prior to European settlement, Chudleigh was part of the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal tribe. Their range included Deloraine, east of Chudleigh, and the Gog mountain range to the north-west where they mined ochre in the Toolumbunner ochre pits. The Pallittorre people lived in the area and used to have a camping ground, where the Church of England cemetery was established later. <b>Land</b> <b>clearing,</b> road construction, disease and conflicts with settlers drove them from their lands and decimated the population. Their population in the area has been estimated to drop from 200 to 60 during 1827-30. At the time of settlement the Chudleigh area was covered with bogs and wild bush.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, it was {{estimated}} that 13 million trees per year were being destroyed in the Desert Uplands. [...] This placed the percentage of <b>land</b> <b>cleared</b> at 6.8%, the third highest for any Queensland bioregion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{argument}} over the etymology of Versailles tends to privilege the Latin word versare, meaning [...] "to keep turning, turn over and over", an expression used in medieval times for plowed <b>lands,</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>lands</b> (lands {{that had been}} repeatedly [...] "turned over"). This word formation is similar to Latin seminare ("to sow") which gave French semailles ("sowings", [...] "sown seeds").|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} new homes have been built and more are planned to be {{constructed}} on derelict <b>land</b> <b>cleared</b> following the demolition of defective houses on the [...] "Boot Estate". Most of these demolitions took place around 2000.|$|R
5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
5|$|C. b. graptogyne, (Endangered) {{known as}} the {{south-eastern}} red-tailed black cockatoo, is found in southwestern Victoria and southeastern South Australia in an area bordered by Mount Gambier to the west, Portland to the south, Horsham to the northeast and Bordertown to the north. The smallest of the five subspecies, it was only recognised as distinct in the 1980s. It is predominantly dependent on stands of Eucalyptus baxteri (brown stringybark), Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river redgum) and Allocasuarina luehmannii (buloke) for feeding and nesting. These tree species have been all threatened by <b>land</b> <b>clearing</b> and most remaining are on private land; possibly only 500–1000 individuals remain. The subspecies and its habitat {{are the subject of}} a national recovery plan. In 2007 local landowners are being reimbursed for assisting in regenerating suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|Rumors that PortAventura {{would be}} {{investing}} in a new Bolliger & Mabillard Flying Coaster or Dive Coaster roller coaster emerged in late 2010. In May 2011, speculation that the park was planning to build a hypercoaster that would pass over Dragon Khan arose. <b>Land</b> <b>clearing</b> also began {{in the summer of}} 2011. Shambhala was announced to the public on October 24, 2011; the layout of the roller coaster was leaked 2 days earlier. The last piece of track was installed in mid-April 2012 following a signing event and the placement of the several country flags on the track. Testing of the ride began in the same month. Following the completion of testing, a ribbon cutting ceremony was held on May 12, 2012 before opening to the public the same day. Over 300 workers from countries such as Germany, France, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, and United States of America took part in the construction of Shambhala.|$|E
50|$|During the Post-Independence Period (1957-1973), vast {{tracts of}} <b>land</b> were <b>cleared</b> for {{agriculture}} and infrastructure development. After 1974, more <b>land</b> was <b>cleared</b> for agriculture, housing projects, power plants, logging activities, livestock farming, hotel construction, small-scale industries, human resettlement and road building.|$|R

30|$|Seventh, due to {{the fact}} that the local {{communities}} in the invaded area have a record of better harvest in <b>lands</b> <b>cleared</b> of Prosopis, converting some of the invaded grazing lands into cultivable land (especially sorghum) is also another point of recommendation.|$|R
