5|$|In 2000, Clinton {{advocated}} for eliminating {{the electoral college}} and promised to co-sponsor <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.|$|E
5|$|Several {{anti-noise}} {{and electric}} car advocates have opposed {{the introduction of}} artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as {{they argue that the}} proposed system will only increase noise pollution.

5|$|Electoral {{legislation}} remained unchanged. Labor introduced {{bills for}} reform, {{but these were}} defeated {{in both houses of}} Parliament. The premier introduced electoral <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have entrenched his government further than under the Playmander. As electoral legislation was part of the South Australian constitution, it required an absolute parliamentary majority (20 seats, under the current system) to be changed. The LCL relied on Stott in the house, so Labor could obstruct changes by keeping members away and forcing a pair.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Gillibrand {{proposed}} <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> remove {{sexual assault}} cases {{from the military}} chain of command; the bill was cosponsored by Republican senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Gillibrand's bill failed to gain enough votes to break a filibuster in March 2014; however, her efforts likely improved her standing as a lawmaker in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{sponsored}} <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{have required}} nuclear plant owners to notify {{state and local}} authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee. Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.|$|E

5|$|The Gracchus brothers, Tiberius and Gaius, were Romans {{who both}} served as tribunes {{in the late}} 2nd century BC.

After achieving some early success, both were assassinated by enemies of these reforms.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received {{were not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Pollack’s career {{led into}} politics. A summer {{internship}} with the American Jewish Congress prompted a one-year role with the AJC. He {{worked as a}} lobbyist on <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> permit religious headwear for active military personal in noncombat settings. Pollack then relocated to Los Angeles to work for Winner & Associates, a leading political public relations firm. He was assigned to consult the Major Baseball League during the labor strife in the early-1990s. The inception of Pollack’s career in sports business occurred in 1992 when he realized—while flying from LA to New York—that there was a niche {{to fill in the}} industry.|$|E

50|$|Logullo was a {{bereaved}} {{father and}} advocate for stillbirth research and {{legislation in the}} United States and worldwide. In 2005, he and other parents in the State of Florida helped lobby the Florida Legislature to create <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> later <b>would</b> be named Katherine's Law in the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate sponsored by State Rep. Juan-Carlos Planas and State Senator Sen. Stephen R. Wise.|$|R
50|$|The report {{provided}} 40 {{recommendations and}} 10 suggestions (for areas outside of federal government jurisdiction), including <b>legislation</b> amendments <b>that</b> <b>would</b> trigger automatic reviews {{of a proposed}} media merger if certain thresholds are reached, and CRTC regulation revisions to ensure that access to the broadcasting system is encouraged and that a diversity of news and information programming is available through these services.|$|R
5|$|Several {{plantation}} {{owners in}} Hawaii favored {{the importation of}} coolie labor from the East India region. Henry A. P. Carter and British consul James Hay Wodehouse had already visited England in 1879 to open a door for the process. They were discouraged by stipulations that Hawaii {{would be forced to}} pass <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> in essence be a detailed labor contract. There was a further requirement that such a Hawaiian law could not be changed without the approval of the governments of both Great Britain and East India. The prospect was explored through the end of 1880, when Hawaii's immigration board decided the islands could not import Indian labor within the parameters required.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman later {{moved to}} Mansfield, where {{he began a}} law career before {{entering}} politics. Initially a Whig, Sherman was among those anti-slavery activists who formed what became the Republican Party. He served three terms in the House of Representatives. As {{a member of the}} House, Sherman traveled to Kansas to investigate the unrest between pro- and anti-slavery partisans there. He rose in party leadership and was nearly elected Speaker in 1859. Sherman was elevated to the Senate in 1861. As a senator, he was a leader in financial matters, helping to redesign the United States' monetary system {{to meet the needs of}} a nation torn apart by civil war. After the war, he worked to produce <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> restore the nation's credit abroad and produce a stable, gold-backed currency at home.|$|E
5|$|In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court {{granted the}} writ to {{two members of}} the Burr conspiracy. Dr. Erick Bollman and Samuel Swartwout, having been apprehended in New Orleans, were transported to Charleston and then Baltimore on a navy vesselnotwithstanding the writs of habeas corpus issued by a {{territorial}} judge in New Orleans and a district judge in Charlestown. The United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia issued an arrest warrant for Bollman and Swartwout (who were already in military custody), slated the case for trial in D.C., and denied the prisoners bail; Judge William Cranch (also the Supreme Court's reporter of decisions) dissented in part on the ground that there was no probable cause for the arrest warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment. The Senate passed, but the House rejected, <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have suspended the writ for three months and legalized Bollman and Swartwout's arrests. Nearly every member of Congress attended the oral arguments in the Supreme Court.|$|E
5000|$|The day {{following}} the vote, Turkey dismissed the <b>legislation</b> saying <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> “distort and politicize” matters {{and that the}} measure was “against the spirit of alliance and partnership” between the two countries.|$|R
50|$|The Senate on 12/13/12 {{failed to}} advance <b>legislation</b> (S. 3637) <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have {{provided}} a two-year extension of the Transaction Account Guarantee program, practically guaranteeing that the program will expire as scheduled on Dec. 31.|$|R

5|$|In May 1995, several Texas sports teams, {{including}} the Houston Rockets, proposed <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> dedicate state tax revenue {{to build new}} arenas. Although the bill was failed in the Texas House of Representatives, Rockets owner Leslie Alexander announced {{he would continue to}} study the possibility of constructing a new arena in downtown Houston, saying the 20-year-old Summit arena was too outdated to be profitable. Although the Summit's management said they could renovate the building for {{a small part of the}} cost of a new arena, the Rockets began talks with the city of Houston on a possible location for an arena, They also negotiated with Houston Aeros and Summit owner, Chuck Watson, to release them from their contract with the Summit, which ran until 2003.|$|E
5|$|In response, the Senate {{appointed}} a committee chaired by Robert Morris to draft the necessary specifications and <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> officially create a federal mint and coinage. The committee presented a bill before Congress on December 21, 1791, which stated in part {{that the new}} dollar coin (which was to {{form the basis of}} the United States monetary system) should contain 371 grains of silver and a total weight of 416 grains, as Hamilton had earlier recommended. The new silver coins were to be struck in an alloy containing 1,485parts out of 1,664 (about 89.24 percent) fine silver, with the remainder copper, intended to equal the silver in Spanish dollars. However, an assay of the Spanish dollars was in error—they were in fact 65/72 silver (about 90.28 percent) with the remainder copper.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since the bombing, scientists, {{security}} experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.|$|E
5000|$|Dan Hynes has {{sponsored}} new <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> prohibited tax scofflaws from receiving state contracts. He also introduced <b>legislation</b> in 2003, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{do the same}} to corporations that have falsified their financial reports. Among his other measures as Comptroller, was to reform the Local Government Division of his office, increasing the percentage of compliance from Illinois's local government units in financial reporting from 65 to 95 percent.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2012, Thompson, {{along with}} Assemblyman Jarred Huffman, voiced his {{opposition}} {{to a piece of}} water <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> the House <b>would</b> be voting on, which he argued would [...] "kill local jobs, ignore 20 years of established science and overturn a century of California water law." ...|$|R
50|$|After O'Sullivan {{finished}} her relief {{work with the}} Lawrence Strike {{she went on to}} get <b>legislation</b> passed <b>that</b> <b>would</b> improve the conditions in Massachusetts's factories. She was hired in 1914 by the state as the inspector for the Massachusetts Board of Labor and Industries, a position which gave her the power to enforce the laws she helped pass. She held that position until she retired from labor organizing in 1934.|$|R
5|$|Much {{of what he}} did in the Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E
5|$|Solis was not {{a member}} of the Education and the Workforce Committee, but championed the Employee Free Choice Act and was the only member of Congress on the board of American Rights at Work, a pro-union {{organization}} that strongly supports the act, for whom she served as treasurer starting in 2004. On trade she voted against both the Dominican Republic–Central America trade agreement and the U.S.-Peru trade agreement, and also expressed opposition to a purposed bilateral U.S.-Colombia trade agreement, citing concerns about human rights violations. Solis opposed <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> soften job safety requirements. She received 100percent ratings from several pro-labor groups for the years 2005 through 2007, and was a major recipient of union political donations. United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta is one of Solis's role models.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 general {{elections}} {{had left the}} Liberals as a minority government dependent upon the support of Irish Nationalists. As desired by the Nationalists, Asquith introduced <b>legislation</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> give Ireland Home Rule, but the Conservatives and Unionists opposed it. As tempers rose over the Home Rule Bill, which {{would never have been}} possible without the Parliament Act, relations between the elderly Knollys and the Conservatives became poor, and he was pushed into retirement. Desperate to avoid the prospect of civil war in Ireland between Unionists and Nationalists, George called a meeting of all parties at Buckingham Palace in July 1914 in an attempt to negotiate a settlement. After four days the conference ended without an agreement. Political developments in Britain and Ireland were overtaken by events in Europe, and the issue of Irish Home Rule was shelved.|$|E
5000|$|The Queen's speech reaffirmed <b>that</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>would</b> be {{introduced}} [...] "to ensure that in future this Parliament and the British people {{have their say}} on any proposed transfer of powers to the European Union".|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{there are}} two ferry trips to the island every month, one for family members and their guests, and one {{for members of the}} general public. The ferry leaves from a {{restricted}} dock on City Island. There is <b>legislation</b> pending <b>that</b> <b>would</b> adjust the ferry trips to permit for much more frequent and regular travel to Hart Island. In 2017, the City increased the number of allowable visitors per month from 50 to 70.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{some members}} of the Congress have {{proposed}} prohibiting certain child modeling sites. Some states are considering similar legislation.
