500|$|Morison {{has always}} had an {{interest}} in greyhound racing, ever since he attended Walthamstow Stadium as a boy. In January 2013, Morison set up a greyhound racing syndicate alongside his former strike partner at Norwich City, Grant Holt, and the two launched the SMGH Racing Club. Talking of the racing club, Morison stated – [...] "I've got lots of kennels myself, lots of animals, lots of dogs. So me and Grant got together bought a couple of dogs and it's spiralled out of control a <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>because</b> we've bought seven now in the space of about three months. But it's been brilliant". When he finishes playing football, he says it would be [...] "a dream" [...] to be a greyhound trainer.|$|E
500|$|... "When in Rome", {{the opening}} track on Why Should the Fire Die?, {{was chosen as}} the album's only single. The song's title alludes to the American proverb [...] "When in Rome, do as the Romans do", [...] and Chris Thile, the song's author, said [...] "The idea behind the song– and I do love it! - is if there is {{something}} better, it's worth leaning towards just a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> you'll have a great time here regardless." [...] Critics commented on the song favorably, with George Graham saying that [...] "When in Rome" [...] has [...] "rock energy level and some sonic manipulation, with hints of old-time Appalachian music in the fiddle, while the lyrics are definitely in the rock mode." ...|$|E
2500|$|Everest {{led to a}} {{delay in}} the film Mohenjo Daro, another of Gowariker's projects. Gowariker {{came up with the}} {{concepts}} at the same time, but because he was more excited about starting Everest he postponed Mohenjo Daro. Gowariker later clarified this, saying: [...] "What is most important for me is the planning stage. Once that is in place, implementing the ideas becomes easier. The research (for Everest) took longer than usual. So yes, I did have to push the movie a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> Everest took up a lot of my time. It is my dream project and needed more attention." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{median income}} of the area was around $86,000 in 2009 (http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Tottenville-Staten-Island-NY.html). The numbers are a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> higher <b>because</b> Tottenville Beach is {{slightly}} wealthier. Roughly 4% of the population lives below the poverty line.|$|R
2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she {{thought she was going to}} have, which maybe shocked her a <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>because</b> she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E
60|$|I think Stephen's critics {{will admit}} {{that he had a}} good right to be angry, and that they will admire him just a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> he kept his temper. But Mr. Hopper evidently thought he had gone too far.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} we fought. The men were {{trampling}} all over my back, and I lay low. Then our rowers on the left side--tied to their oars, you know--began to yell and back water. I could hear the water sizzle, and we spun round like a cockchafer and I knew, lying where I was, {{that there was a}} galley coming up bow-on, to ram us on the left side. I could just lift up my head and see her sail over the bulwarks. We wanted to meet her bow to bow, but it was too late. We could only turn a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> the galley on our right had hooked herself on to us and stopped our moving. Then, by gum! there was a crash! Our left oars began to break as the other galley, the moving one y'know, stuck her nose into them. Then the lower-deck oars shot up through the deck planking, butt first, and one of them jumped clean up into the air and came down again close to my head." ...|$|E
3000|$|Because I {{work with}} this age group, I feel {{sometimes}} that certain things that you read in the EYLF you feel a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> excluded <b>because</b> it doesn’t, it’s generally saying about children but also not establishing or acknowledging {{the fact that the}} age group for infants and toddlers are a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> different (Tinny) [...]...|$|R
50|$|Lunumiris {{contains}} chili pepper, red onions, Maldive fish, sea salt, {{black pepper}} and a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of lime juice. This {{can be made}} vegetarian, without Maldive fish. This type is hot, but wet, and a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> crispy <b>because</b> of onions. This should be made with mortar and pestle, or grind stone. This can be made also with hands, but it doesn't give the real taste.|$|R
2500|$|Ross Wilson {{said of the}} award: “Daddy Cool first met, played, {{recorded}} and worked together in Melbourne and since those early days we’ve been inducted into the industry hall of fame in Australia. [...] As “hometown heroes,” The Age Music Victoria Hall of Fame means that <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more <b>because</b> it’s a cultural award, not a commercial one.” ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{later said}} that [...] "we {{made a huge}} mistake with Ultramega OK, because we left our home {{surroundings}} and people we'd been involved with and used this producer that really did affect our album {{in a kind of}} negative way. The producer was suggested by SST because they could get a good deal. I regret it, because in terms of material, it should {{have been one of the}} best records we ever did. It actually slowed down our momentum a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> it didn't really sound like us." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to an {{interview}} with Chante Basma of Rock Ur Life, Jonny Hawkins explains that, “Christ Copyright is still about the Mr. MTV thing. It’s serious but it’s also like we’re playing with the words a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> we found it funny to take a word like “Christ” which is a religious icon and take the word “Copyright” which is a business sign. In American spirituality or religion, which was a pure thing, have been now mixed with marketing and corporations. Christ copyright can also be said to [...] "dare the listener to maintain moral integrity and challenge the social normative" ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{accumulation}} {{regime in}} the USA is called finance-led growth regime by French regulationists, but this concept is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> small <b>because</b> we need more comprehensive approach to characterize the latest stage of capitalism. This paper provides new concept as finance-infiltrated growth regime and along with this intensified circulation of money capital. The latter can account major characteristic of capitalism today...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} and explores {{a distinction}} between multi-dimensional and one-dimensional consequentialist moral theories. One-dimensional consequentialists believe that an act's deontic status depends on just {{one aspect of the}} act, such as the sum total of wellbeing it produces, or the sum total of priority- or equality-adjusted wellbeing. Multi-dimensional consequentialists believe that an act's deontic status depends on more than one aspect. They may, for instance, believe that the sum total of wellbeing produced by an act {{and the degree to which}} the wellbeing is equally distributed in the population affect the act's deontic status independently of each other. These two aspects cannot be reduced into any single (composite) aspect. Wellbeing and equality are two separate considerations that cannot be merged into some novel entity that accurately reflects both intuitions. On the multi-dimensional view I defend, such clashes between separate aspects are irresolvable and are best accounted for by claiming that moral rightness and wrongness are non-binary concepts. Some acts are, literally speaking, a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> right (<b>because</b> they maximise wellbeing) and a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> wrong (<b>because</b> they do not maximise equality) ...|$|R
5000|$|I drive Coty a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> crazy, <b>because</b> it's always not {{signature}} enough. I go {{back and}} say things like, 'Can we push the sandalwood a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more, can we make a tiny bit more sexy?' To translate that into actual chemistry is a difficult thing. Then they {{go back and}} say, 'What does she mean by sexy?' And I'm like, 'You know if you take that little piece that smells a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> like wood but has a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of musk? But I {{just want you to}} add a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of sweetness. Can you do that for me?' And then I think we are in the right direction. And then they come with one or two variations and I say, 'No, that's not it.' It's a long process.|$|R
5000|$|In the Los Angeles Times, Day-Lewis {{spoke about}} his {{concerns}} of how Freasier {{would react to}} the more serious scenes: [...] "I started to worry a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> we were very close, and I thought, 'Man, how's he going to feel when I start treating him harshly?' So I kind of sat him down. I created this sort of atmosphere... portentous atmosphere. 'Dillon, you know how I feel about you and {{there are going to}} be moments... I'm not going to treat you nicely. I want you to understand that I love you.' He looked at me like I was insane." ...|$|E
5000|$|Joey Logano, who {{qualified}} second, {{said his}} qualifying performance was [...] "similar to {{last week when}} I won {{the first two rounds}} and came in second in the last one. It stings a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> I really wanted to get a pole. We're mad about second and it's a good thing when you're mad about second because it means your organization and your team is where it needs to be mad." [...] He also added that he's [...] "excited about the race Sunday" [...] and that Pocono [...] "has been a good race track for us in the past.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Weir's first {{experience}} at the Paralympics wasn't a good one, he commented afterwards [...] "I {{had been to the}} Games in Atlanta in 1996 as a young lad of 17 but when I got there it wasn't what I had expected. I could count about five people in the crowd at times. It disheartened me a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> I had missed my teenage years of growing up and being with my friends to compete at a Paralympics. I fell out of love with the sport and when I got back I just didn't want to do it any more." ...|$|E
50|$|We {{have learned}} a lot from {{experience}} about how to handle some of the ways we fool ourselves. One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops, and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It's a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> off <b>because</b> he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It's interesting to {{look at the history of}} measurements of the charge of an electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> bigger than Millikan's, and the next one's a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> bigger than that, and the next one's a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.|$|R
5000|$|Before the portrait, Gloria {{notices that}} Joe's face is too [...] "white" [...] {{and she can}} not send a picture to her family in Colombia of her son that does not look even a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> Colombian. <b>Because</b> of that, she decides to expose him to the sun but this leads to {{dramatic}} consequences when Joe ends up with a sunburn. Manny (Rico Rodriguez) saves the day by giving Joe a make-up which makes him to wear Colombia's flag's colors {{on his face that}} hide the sunburn.|$|R
5000|$|Chris Bailey later said, [...] "For me, it's {{our first}} proper release because (I'm) Stranded {{was just a}} load of demos. Although we still had the same energy as the first album, the added horn section seemed to confuse people and the record sort of disappeared." [...] In another interview, Bailey stated, [...] "When people {{talk to me about}} the early Saints in hallowed terms, I find it a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> amusing, <b>because</b> when I think about {{something}} like [...] "Lost & Found" [...] or [...] "Misunderstood", I kind of think that's crap." ...|$|R

5000|$|She met actor-director Clint Eastwood in 1992, {{when she}} interviewed him for KSBW-TV. As Clint Eastwood {{recalled}} in 2007, She was doing {{an interview with}} me…and we got along really well and I guess we flirted a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> she took the film back to KSBW {{and one of her}} associates said, 'You're going to marry him.' Then we were attending a function out at Spanish Bay and of the hosts said, 'Do you mind sitting with Dina Ruiz?' I said, 'No! Not at all!' We ended up holding hands and doing all that kind of nonsense and then we started dating and we’re still dating. ... She's a very forthright kind of person. It's one of those things you can't put your finger on because it's pheromones or something.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, The OQLF ordered Mandy’s to {{take down}} all English signs in their restaurant.

We do have a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of English <b>because</b> 95% of our client base in Westmount is English”.|$|R
5000|$|Andy Behbakht of TV Overmind wrote [...] "Overall, {{aside from}} a few pacing {{problems}} {{at the start of}} the premiere, Arrow is back and it's the show that I fell in love with to begin with. I did find Oliver's public announcement to Star City as the Green Arrow a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> wonk. <b>Because</b> of the way the camera was aimed at him from the new lair, you could see so easily that it was Oliver Queen. However, with shows like Arrow, you got to suspend your disbelief a <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> and besides, 'I am the Green Arrow' is something I have been waiting to hear for four years, so how much can I really complain? Arrow, I have missed you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk {{rated the}} film 2/5 stars and wrote, [...] "One of the sickest and freakiest movies ever {{to come from}} a nation {{well-known}} for its freaky and sick movies (Germany), Cannibal is shocking, outrageous, sickening ... and just a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> interesting <b>because</b> it's based on actual events." [...] Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, [...] "The only real selling point Cannibal has is its graphic depiction of cannibalism. There are some nasty, nasty moments throughout, but you have to get through a whole lot of nothing before you see them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dowd's columns {{have also}} been {{described}} as often being political cartoons that capture a caricatured view of the current political landscape with precision and exaggeration. For example, {{in the run-up to}} the 2000 presidential election Dowd wrote that Democratic candidate [...] "Al Gore is so feminized and diversified and ecologically correct that he's practically lactating," [...] while referring to the Democratic party as the [...] "mommy party." [...] In a Fresh Dialogues interview years later she said, [...] "I was just teasing him a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> he was so earnest and he could be a little righteous and self important. That’s not always the most effective way to communicate your ideas, even if the ideas themselves are right. I mean, certainly his ideas were right but he himself was - sometimes - a pompous messenger for them." ...|$|E
5000|$|McGrath won {{a record}} of seventy-two 250cc Main Events and {{captured}} seven 250cc supercross championships between 1993 and 2000, a time {{now known as the}} [...] "McGrath Era.". He also won the 1995 250 Outdoor Motocross Championship and had the 1996 title in sight before a late-season injury handed the title to Jeff Emig. He described the loss as follows: [...] "I get mad at myself a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> I should’ve won the ’96 title too, but I was thinking I was invincible and tried a jump at Millville that I never should have attempted and got injured." [...] McGrath also participated in two victories by the U.S. team at the Motocross des Nations -1993 in Austria and 1996 in Spain. His 1998, 1999, 2000 seasons with The Chaparral Motorsports race team was the 1st non-factory team, {{in the history of the}} sport, to win a Supercross Championship ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) {{director}} Ian Judge, the company's 1987 adaptation [...] "came {{about when}} Terry Hands, {{artistic director of}} the company, asked for a show that could be performed annually over the Christmas season, as a revival of J. M. Barrie's play Peter Pan had been previously. ... Judge obtained the rights to the 1939 film. ... An additional verse has been put back into the Academy Award-winning song 'Over the Rainbow,' as well as an entire number, 'The Jitterbug,' that was cut from the movie. Every word of the screenplay has been left in. 'We've just fattened it out a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>because</b> you need a few more words in the theater than you need in the movies.'" [...] In 1986, John Kane was asked by the company to write the book for the adaptation. [...] This hews even more closely to the film's screenplay than the 1945 MUNY version and attempts to recreate the film's atmosphere and some of its special effects.|$|E
50|$|Genetically {{modified}} {{plants are}} a good answer {{to the problem of}} not enough crops to go around. These plants can be engineered to be resistant to all types of abiotic stress. This would eliminate crop yield loss due to extreme temperatures, drought, wind, or salinity. The consumers of crops would enjoy a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> lower prices <b>because</b> the demand on them would be a little lower.|$|R
5000|$|Fabolous also {{explained}} why TINC3 {{would be the}} final chapter in the mixtape series, saying: [...] "I think that's what happens with movies sometimes with the 'Jason Part…' 9s, 10s you up losing a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of flavor <b>because</b> you're just recreating the same thing ten times," [...] he shares.

In the opening match he lost to Novak Djokovic, but managed to take a set off the defending champion before falling in a competitive match on Arthur Ashe Stadium. “It’s never easy to play against Djokovic. It doesn’t matter where or when or what shape I’m in,” said Janowicz. “I was just trying to play my best tennis.
