40|$|Abstract. Petrophysical {{parameters}} {{are not only}} concerned with grain size, {{but also with the}} cementation degree. Therefore, {{it is difficult to determine}} the petrophysical parameters for the <b>loose</b> <b>core</b> using traditional testing technique. This paper discussed the influence of freeze-sampled loose rock on the test result of rock porosity and permeability. In view of the grains scattering problem in oil-bearing loose rock samples caused by sample deoil, the calibration method for rock permeability and porosity is proposed in this paper through the comparison of testing methods. The test result indicates that the method of measuring the rock permeability of the oil-bearing samples followed by measuring the rock porosity of the deoiled samples is effective. This method can meet the requirements during sample deoiling, drying and petrophysical parameters testing, decrease the influence of freeze-sampling technique on the test of petrophysical parameters, resolve the difficult problem of testing petrophysical parameters using the same sample, and improve the authenticity and reliability of the analyzing result...|$|E
40|$|RAFT {{polymerization}} with cross-linking {{was used}} to prepare core cross-linked star polymers bearing temperature sensitive arms. The arms consisted of a diblock copolymer containing N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) and 4 -methacryloyloxy benzoic acid (4 MBA) in the temperature sensitive block and poly(hexyl acrylate) forming the second hydrophobic block, while ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate {{was used to}} form the core. The acid comonomer provides pH sensitivity to the arms and also increases the transition temperature of polyNIPAAm to values {{in the range of}} 40 to 46 °C. Light scattering and atomic force microscopy studies suggest that <b>loose</b> <b>core</b> star polymers were obtained. The star polymers were loaded with 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), an anticancer agent, in values of up to 30 [*]w/w%. In vitro release experiments were performed at different temperatures and pH values, as well as with heating and cooling temperature cycles. Faster drug release was obtained at 42 °C or pH 6, compared to normal physiological conditions (37 °C, pH 7. 4). The drug carriers prepared acted as nanopumps changing the release kinetics of 5 -FU when temperatures cycles were applied, in contrast with release rates at a constant temperature.

500|$|Other die {{components}} include cores and slides. Cores are {{components that}} usually produce holes or opening, {{but they can}} be used to create other details as well. There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and <b>loose.</b> Fixed <b>cores</b> are ones that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies (i.e. the direction the dies open), therefore they are fixed, or permanently attached to the die. Movable cores are ones that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction. These cores must be removed from the die cavity after the shot solidifies, but before the dies open, using a separate mechanism. Slides are similar to movable cores, except they are used to form undercut surfaces. The use of movable cores and slides greatly increases the cost of the dies. <b>Loose</b> <b>cores,</b> also called pick-outs, are used to cast intricate features, such as threaded holes. These <b>loose</b> <b>cores</b> are inserted into the die by hand before each cycle and then ejected with the part {{at the end of the}} cycle.

Other features in the dies include water-cooling passages and vents along the parting lines.

40|$|Nowadays, polymer {{micelles}} {{have attracted}} an increasing interest in pharmaceutical research {{because they could}} be used as efficient drug delivery systems. Micelles of amphiphilic block copolymers are supramolecular core-shell type assemblies of several tens of nanometers in diameter. In principle, the micelle core is usually constructed with biodegradable hydrophobic polymers such as aliphatic polyesters, e. g. poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), which serves as a reservoir for the incorporation of various lipophilic drugs. Water soluble poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is most frequently used to build the micelle corona because it is very efficient in preventing protein adsorption at surfaces and in stabilizing micelles in the blood compartment, making particles invisible to the body defense system. Even if micelles get a high stability in aqueous media thanks to their low critical micellar concentration, micelle dissociation is not always preserved when they are injected in the blood compartment. A way to provide the micelle stability during their administration is to cross-link them. Different kinds of cross-linked micelles can be investigated depending on the localization of the cross-linking. Shell cross-linked micelles or nanocage structures with a degradable core have the great advantage to reach drug encapsulation with a high loading rate. However, cross-linking the hydrophilic shell may affect the stealthiness of the carrier. Thus, we have designed reversibly cross-linked micelles by introducing the cross-linking bridges in the hydrophobic segment of the block copolymer, rather than in the hydrophilic one, leading so to more internal cross-linking and thus preserving the mobility of the hydrophilic segment. Three different localizations of the cross-linking has been targeted; (i) <b>loose</b> <b>core</b> cross-linking of a core-corona system, (ii) tight core cross-linking of a core-shell-corona system (the shell and the core being both hydrophobic and the corona hydrophilic) and (iii) tight shell cross-linking of a similar core-shell-corona system. To reach this goal, three types of amphiphilic copolymers have been used bearing pendent azide groups in the hydrophobic segment. These copolymers have been obtained by starting the ring-opening polymerization of ε-CL and a functional CL, either as a mixture or sequentially from a poly(ethylene oxide) macroinitiator leading to the three targeted architectures. The azide groups located along the PCL backbone have then been used to cross-link the micelles by the Huisgens cycloaddition with a bis-alkyne cross-linker. The choice of this cross-linker has also taken into account the requirement to make the cross-linking reversible. For that purpose, disulfide bridges have been selected in order to impart reversibility to the cross-linking by intracellular reduction. Indeed, the marked concentration difference of glutathione between extra- and intra-cellular environments has already been used to trigger drug release by intracellular disulfide bond cleavage. Accordingly, a bis-alkyne disulfide molecule has been chosen as cross-linker. The micellization and cross-linking of these amphiphilic azido macromolecules have been studied. The reversibility of the cross-linking in reductive environment and the cross-linked micelles stealthiness have been tested...|$|E

This thesis argues that higher frequency waves travelling through stiff masonry structures can trigger two types of failure mechanisms that have not yet been taken into account. First, the high frequencies can cause small vertical inter-stone vibrations that result in irreversible relative displacements of the stones, which may ultimately lead to collapse. The energy needed to cause this deformation and failure comes largely from gravitational forces. The second failure mechanism is associated with the increase of the outward thrust that results from the partial fluidization and densification of the <b>loose</b> granular inner <b>core</b> of some unreinforced masonry walls.

40|$|AbstractThe {{tongue of}} common {{kingfisher}} (Alcedo atthis, Alcedinidae, Aves) was investigated {{by means of}} light and scanning electron microscopy to elucidate its ultramorphological and histological features. The tongue of the studied bird is an elongated, tubby and consistent organ of triangular shape of about 8. 9 mm in length. It drops in the posterior quarter of {{the lower part of}} the very long bill. It is composed of three successive regions; blunt apex, stocky body and root. In addition to the giant conical papillae demarcating the tongue’s body from root, numerous caudally directed spiny conical papillae are differently distributed on the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the lingual body and root. Both papillae appears to help catching and directly swallowing preys, however the apex is covered with superposed foliate papillae. By light microscope, the dorsal lingual epithelium is composed of a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The stratum basale is followed by a thick stratum spinosum of polyhedral cells containing some deeply embedded taste buds and gives rise to the stratum corneum cell layer. The <b>loose</b> connective tissue <b>core</b> (lamina propria) which embraces some blood vessels and melanocytes forms finger-like dermal papillae of different heights under the epithelium.

40|$|Bone is {{a natural}} {{cellular}} composite, with a gradient structure going from a <b>loose</b> interconnected <b>core</b> to an outer dense wall, thus minimising bone weight while maintaining a high mechanical performance. Bone can be repaired using either auto- or allo- grafts, which, however, have a limited availability, or present pathogen transmission risks, respectively. Synthetic tissue grafts are therefore investigated {{in order to provide}} porous scaffolds, seeded with the appropriate type of cells, as templates for tissue regeneration. This study focused on composite scaffolds based on polymer matrices. The objectives were to understand how different foaming phenomena are affected by the addition of fillers into the polymer, to investigate their effect on the structural and mechanical properties of foams, and then to propose and optimise a solvent free process in order to prepare bioresorbable composite scaffolds suitable for bone tissue engineering applications. The comparison of several processes resulting in porous matrices led to choose supercritical CO 2 foaming as a flexible technique to manufacture cellular structures, with the possibility of adding fibres or fillers. First, the integration of glass fibres into polyurethane (PUR) and polyethylene terephtalate (PET) foams, processed by reactive and gas foaming respectively, was investigated in order to study the potential improvement of mechanical properties of porous polymers. With the PUR system, modulus was shown to increase with fibre content, and an optimum fibre length existed. With PET, dense and heterogeneous structures were obtained. In both cases a homogeneous mixing of the two components was required before foaming. Gas foaming of bioresorbable neat polymers, poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), was carried out in a high-pressure vessel. A wide variety of PLA cellular structures was obtained, with open and closed pores, of diameters between 0. 2 and 1. 0 mm, and a range of porosity (70 - 92 %) and modulus (10 - 180 MPa). On the contrary, using PLGA led to closed, larger pores, and a low modulus. Only PLA was therefore considered as a matrix for composite foaming. Hydroxyapatite (HA) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), were then added to PLA in order to improve mechanical resistance, to regulate pH during scaffold resorption, and, owing to their intrinsic osteoconductivity, to favour mineralisation. Composite preforms were prepared by three different techniques: mixing powders in the dry state, dispersion in polymer solution, and melt-extrusion. Observation of the ceramic distribution, measurements of glass transition and melting temperatures, and tensile tests led to select and optimise melt-extrusion as a clean technique for preparing homogeneous ceramic-polymer preforms. Structural analysis of composite foams produced in the highpressure chamber enabled us to define processing windows as a function of pressure release and cooling rates. HA or β-TCP filled PLA foams were obtained, with porosity between 74 and 83 %, pore size between 0. 1 and 1 mm, and modulus between 30 and 250 MPa. Microcomputed tomography confirmed the anisotropy in cellular morphology. Compression tests were also performed and revealed the anisotropic and viscoelastic behaviour of the porous polymer and composite structures. Finally, in collaboration with the Laboratory of Orthopaedic Research (LRO-EPFL) and the Hôpital Orthopédique de Suisse Romande (HO-CHUV), the biocompatibility of the developed structures with human primary foetal bone cells was demonstrated, as they proliferated on the template surfaces and differentiated. Foaming parameters could thus be defined to create composite scaffolds suitable for bone tissue engineering applications. Structural and mechanical properties similar to those of cancellous bone were demonstrated and promising in vitro tests were conducted. Therefore the developed scaffolds can now be evaluated in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Pondering on {{cities as}} complex systems in general; {{the way their}} {{morphological}} and functional aspects are in continuous change, we see cities {{come up with new}} and unexpected spatial and functional patterns. Urban planning in its contemporary form can organize and attenuate the results or the tendencies of urban processes which arise from social metamorphoses. Yet, often, procedures inflected by planning to move the events in a certain direction often fails to accomplish that for more than short periods of time after which it may lead to undesired or even opposite results. This is because our knowledge of the complex nature of the urban system is still insufficient to formulate a new approach to planning that is truly effective and efficient as a tool to “negotiate” spontaneous processes. So, {{what we need is a}} deep understanding of what is going on in our cities which are being transformed so fast and whose transformations are but a surface change hiding a much bigger number of changes and processes touching virtually everything from (among others) social networks to movement patterns to land prices to many small physical and functional changes which go unnoticed. The sophistication we discern in the city is similar to that in many natural and man-made systems which we might call complex, and any attempt to imagine it would fail if it is not based on an explanation which is valid for all these systems; from here rises the core of this research which relies on a thorough investigation of complexity theory in an attempt to understand cities as complex systems. Thus the main objectives of this research are to try answering these questions: How do the diverse “components” of the city come together to make up urban evolution? What are the dynamics of the incessant urban change in all its forms? In such a complex system, is it possible to identify the real processes acting at the local scale but causing transformations at the global scale? Yet, identifying real processes at work at many levels of complexity and at different scales is inseparable from studying resulting geometric patterns, therefore, another fundamental objective of this research is to gain insight into how form and process are intertwined. The apparent complexity and the reality defying planning and outweighing it, all mean that the problem of urban complexity should be confronted in an interchangeable method which has its roots in various other fields, such as: complexity theory, dynamical systems and topology. The research methodology is about exploring those fields and highlighting their interconnections with the concept of complexity in general and later arguing deep similarity with the urban case. Constructing abstract representative models is at the heart of the research in complexity; cellular automata (CA) and multi-agents simulations (MA) are the main simulations used for exploring complexity. It is argued that the computer-aided simulation is a kind of representation which has the ability to reflect a non-linear process, this research introduces a different method than pure representation, which is to approach complexity from all possible directions while benefiting from the conclusions reached by simulations. We proceed by giving an in-depth investigation of complex systems in general, by discussing their universal phenomena such as: catastrophic events, fractals, “oneover-f ” noise, power laws, punctuated equilibrium, and self-organized criticality. Along with a focus on their abilities of self-organization and of reaching a sophisticated kind of order through their own internal logic even if their initial conditions were no more full homogeneity or extreme randomness; this order is usually achieved and maintained by forming large-scale patterns. Therefore, complexity theory shifts the emphasis of research from studying independent variables into to interdependent variables; a dynamic rather than a static conception. It also concentrates on extracting the fundamental mechanisms of all complex systems, such mechanisms are themselves intricate and not easily discerned. Reading present “mutations” in cities in general, we attempt to discern a prevailing pattern. Cities, nowadays, continue to <b>loose</b> their historic <b>cores</b> as they continue to spread making the physical form of the future city will take unclear. Therefore the currently prevailing mutation pattern is one that is at the global level, but the real changes take place at the local level. Urban change in general occurs through relocation of activities which usually causes chain-reaction effects which range from small into catastrophic urban changes. As suggested by the self-organized criticality's proponents, the duration and size of activities involved in such chain reactions follow power laws. We also study the dynamic relation between rates of change of the physical reality of the city on one hand and its body of functions on the other, in addition the relation between the rate of change of the city as a whole and its elements taken individually. This detailed study acts as an adaptation of the theory of self-organized criticality to the urban case. Which is further enriched by incorporating the influence of the movement networks in cities on its dynamics, that is, the tendency of the structure of the grid itself to be the main influence on the pattern of movement. The Core of the study and its most lengthy chapter is an elaboration of all previously discussed concepts and ideas along with conclusions derived while carrying out the discussions. We take off, in this part, first by focusing on some individual urban evolutionary processes by drawing insights from computer-aided simulations, thus, a bunch of example models (which are based on discovering very simple local rules) by various researchers are discussed, this includes Edge city model, Urban potentialdevelopment model, Active walker model, sugar-scape model and urban growth pattern according to critical thresholds model. The conclusions from those models creators are then further analyzed. Thereafter, this research reaches its kernel when it becomes possible to identify the individual “concepts” which are the correct keys to the problem – the basic of the basic and thoroughly explore them. The attempt is to frame the elusive notions of structure, order, network, hierarchic organization and morphogenesis especially from a topological point of view. And deriving conclusions about the issue of process and form through defining the kinds of “shape changing processes” which have complex spatial consequences. An attempt to frame the important concepts of structure, order and structural stability in complex systems especially those with specific spatial manifestations; thus, a discussion about the difference between the notion of a “network” to that of a “structure” is outlined, and an investigation of the detailed interdependence between order and structure is carried out, pointing out that it is the structure which takes precedence rather than order in determining the existence of the other. Structure as a concept is compared to the notion's of rules and sequences in computer systems since a relationship gives a fundamental to the following step or relationship and since the order in which the rules appear can drastically change the overall outcome so this directly implies a global kind of process; finding a global solution to fit in the relations in question so that they keep existing and in the process also support each other, an example is the deformed wheel pattern of roads found in self-organized cities. And it is argued that structural stability is determined by the way the structure has been created, that it is inherent in the structure itself rather than – as it may seem – dependent on external factors. The understanding of structural qualities in cities is linked to morphogenesis and the recognition of the dynamics created by space itself, and here morphogenesis is used as the basis to distinguish true generative processes working in reality to create form. In order to evolve the previous discussion, two particularly interesting characteristics which cities often exhibit are investigated, namely: the rank-size rule of cities (zipf's law), and fractal structure. The reason behind the appearance of Fractality in urban spaces is a key in understanding their complexity, therefore it is studied under its connection to: 1. morphogenesis because in all cases, the notion of scaling is directly connected to that of fractality, and 2. the notions of density and chain reactions arguing that not only that fractality reflected in density and its capacity limits is connected to the location with respect to the center, but, more importantly, the nature of fractality is connected to, or rather, is influential on the extent of the chain reactions in cities. One of the most important issues in understanding the form-process problem is that related to energy, it is natural for things in general to seek the situation with the least potential energy, therefore, finding the best “shape” that is the shape which will result in the least potential energy is crucial for the systems functioning. In selforganized cities there is a quality of “optimization” that is always sought and preserved through the city's evolution, this quality provides us with a clue relating self-organized urban structure, its stability and the principle of minimization of energy. We argue that alongside feedback mechanisms the network is also experimenting new solutions (that includes new or modified focuses, and new or modified forms). We argue that the fundamental mechanism by which this happens in cities is very similar to that which creates a natural river network. The optimization principle is also considered from a topological point of view, realizing that mere saving in distances and better connectivity throughout the system are not of the utmost importance. We point out that topology tells us a relevant lot about shapes and energy through the various embedding domain of existence types of forms. Thorough considerations are presented about the relatedness of the prevailing pattern of diffusion in present-day cities in most parts of the world on one hand and self-organized criticality on he other, through presenting the concept of fluctuations in the complex system which generates the system's stability. Some considerations are made about the patterns of cluster formation in cities by summarizing some of the cluster-growth issues as: Expansion at the global level such as expansion of the urban fringe or many expansions of component clusters. The study then explores the important similarities between the urban phenomena and general phenomena studied by physics centering on the morphological transition in urban form. And links that to transitions in fractal dimensions in cities over time, together with the key notion of the shifting from direct growth to indirect growth in cities. And to strengthen the suggestions of this line of thought a further investigation of the aggregation as mechanism for organization in complex systems is presented supported by concepts about the dynamics accompanying such mechanisms namely, the anticipation mechanisms in a complex systems while explaining the concept of genetic algorithms as a useful tool in our study. A point in our study is reached where an exploration of “form” is needed, thus, a discussion about form and morphogenesis from a dynamic point of view is presented as a key concept in an effort to sum up threads from all the concepts and theories previously presented. Keeping in mind that what is meant by form is not the mere physical appearance, architectural styles or geometric details, what is more relevant is the quality of the interlock between solid and void (built and open space), the general configuration, arrangement and succession of open spaces and the “dynamic” quality of form types. The reasoning starts by some exploration and criticism of the rules of the Bottomup models under the guidance of an understanding of the notion of form. Arguing that state of the art cellular automata models, and multi-agent models and the like seem to accurately represent important mechanisms, the mechanisms themselves, nevertheless, seem to be linear and give an impression of lacking the more intricate complexity we deal with in the city. Based on this argument, the study suggests a modification to such models in order to incorporate those effects, by making use of some topological concepts; such as topological manifolds and vector fields. The study then proceeds to the central argument in understanding “form” which is the “problem of succession of form”; as addressed by René Thom studying morphogenesis from the point of view of topology, tracing not shapes but processes which occur in infinite-dimensional spaces. The key point is that it is a method which puts emphasis above all on the morphogenesis of the process, that is, on the discontinuities of the phenomenon. The study thoroughly investigates the general topological model proposed by Thom in order to parametrize the local states of a system and deriving an interesting “definition” of an object and how every object is characterized by its domain of existence; an idea which is important in our quest to understand embedding of local in the global in a dynamic way. And from there the mathematical notions of form, nonform, structural stability, maps and topological equivalence are reached. key idea here, is that the stability of a form is directly determined by its position in relation to the basins of attraction of the dynamic, so a first step in considering the stability of forms is composing the general attraction mechanisms of the dynamic system. An attempt is presented as to how to see urban forms in the light of these definitions and discussions, and an analysis is argued to be based on characteristics of its global, local and intermediate scales. The study concludes by highlighting the necessity of a multi-disciplinary and non-linear approach, because, as the flow of the study shows, each of the conclusions reached at each section is derived from either concepts from various disciplines or from a purely logical argument or from both, that's why though such conclusions might not look connected, they are threads which do not aim to a single point, but rather aim at knitting a whole intact foundation for a new form of urban sciences, a form that relates their current form with the ambitious science (and philosophy) of complexity theory...|$|R
