40|$|A {{model of}} pulsar magnetospheres is {{described}} which has evolved inductively {{from the work}} of Sturrock, where the radiation is produced near the surface of a neutron star. Some of the theoretical ideas of others, particularly those of Sturrock, are discussed. The braking index n and period-pulse-width distribution of pulsars are first reinvestigated by relaxing the conventional assumption that R sub Y = R sub L, where R sub Y is the radius of the neutral points marking the transition from closed to open magnetic field lines, and R sub L is the radius of the light cylinder. This is replaced by the parameterization R sub Y = R sub * (1 - eta) power R sub <b>L</b> (<b>eta),</b> where R sub * is the neutron star radius. If the ratio frequency radiation is created near the surface and beamed along open field lines, it is found that a good fit to the period-pulse-width distribution can be obtained for eta in the range 0. 5 = or eta = or 0. 7. The relation n = 1 + 2 eta then gives n = 2. 2 + or - 0. 2, which is in good agreement with the values measured for the Crab pulsar...|$|R

We also {{calculate the}} rates for K-L,K-S -> mu e, K-L,K-S -> pi(0) mu e and B-d,B-s -> l(i) l(j). We find that the relative effects of mirror leptons in these transitions are by many orders of magnitude larger than analogous mirror quark effects in rare K and B decays analyzed recently. In particular, in order to suppress the mu -> e gamma and mu(-) -> e(-) e(+) e(-) decay rates and the mu - e conversion rate below the experimental upper bounds, the relevant mixing matrix in the mirror lepton sector V-Hl must be rather hierarchical, unless the spectrum of mirror leptons is quasi-degenerate.

The X-ray structure of CpRu(CO) (PPh 3) (cis- 3 -hexene) + shows that in the solid state the olefin C=C double-bond is orientated parallel to the Cp ring and the ethyl group substituents are pointed up {{and away from the}} PPh 3 ligand, presumably due to the steric bulkiness of the PPh 3. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra for the complexes containing trans- 3 -hexene show that the olefin is rotating rapidly around the metal-olefin bond based on the equivalence of the methyl groups on the olefin, which would appear inequivalent if the olefin were not rotating. Kinetic studies of the substitution of the olefin by PPh 3 in Cp 2 ̆ 7 Ru(CO) 2 (eta 2 -olefin) + complexes show that the lability of 18 : 1 and cis- 3 -hexene are similar. An increase in olefin lability is seen on replacing cis- 3 -hexene with trans- 3 -hexene and Cp with Cp*. Both changes increase the rate of olefin dissociation due to increases in steric crowding between the Cp 2 ̆ 7 ligand and the olefin.;Substitution of CpRu(CO) 2 (eta 2 -trans- olefin) +, where olefin = trans- 3 -hexene, trans- 2 - pentene, trans- 3 -octene, trans- 4 -octene, or trans- 5 -decene, by incoming ligands (L) results in the formation of CpRu(CO) 2 (L) + and the release of both trans-olefin and cis-olefin. Some of the more effective substituting ligands that favor the release of cis-olefins are para-substituted pyridine derivatives, which react with CpRu(CO) 2 (trans- 3 -hexene) + to give cis/trans ratios of 3 -hexene that increase with the basicity of the amine: CF 3 - (18 / 82) 3 ̆c H- (67 / 33) 3 ̆c CH 3 - (74 / 26) 3 ̆c CH 3 O- (76 / 24). Several factors influence the amount of cis-olefin released {{during the course of the}} reaction; specifically, increases in temperature, solvent polarity, olefin side-chain length, and substituting ligand size all serve to reduce the amount of cis-olefin released.

40|$|A {{reexamination of}} the effects of non-zero degeneracies on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is made.

Phosphate-deficient leaves had lower photosynthetic rates at ambient and saturating CO 2 and much smaller carboxylation efficiencies {{than those of}} plants grown with ample phosphate. In addition, phosphate-deficient leaves contained smaller quantities of total soluble proteins and ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) per unit area, although the relative proportions of these components remained unchanged. The specific activity of Rubisco (estimated in the crude extracts of leaves) was significantly reduced by phosphate deficiency in sunflower but not in maize. Thus, {{there was a strong}} dependence of carboxylation efficiency and CO 2 -saturated photosynthetic rate on Rubisco activity only in sunflower. Phosphate deficiency decreased the 3 -phosphoglycerate and ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate (RuBP) contents of the leaf in both species. The ratio of 3 -phosphoglycerate to RuBP decreased in sunflower but increased in maize with phosphate deficiency. The calculated concentrations of RuBP and RuBP-binding sites in the chloroplast stroma decreased markedly with phosphate deficiency. The ratio of the stromal concentration of RuBP to that of RuBP-binding sites decreased in sunflower but was not affected in maize with phosphate deficiency. We suggest that a decrease in this ratio made the RuBP-binding sites more vulnerable to blockage or inactivation by tight-binding metabolites/inhibitors, causing a decrease in the initial specific activity of Rubisco in the crude extract from phosphate-deficient sunflower leaves. However, the decrease in Rubisco specific activity was much less than the decrease in the RuBP content in the leaf and its concentration in the stroma. A large ratio of RuBP to RuBP-binding sites may have maintained the Rubisco-specific activity in phosphate-deficient maize leaves. We conclude that the effect of phosphate deficiency is more on RuBP regeneration than on Rubisco activity in both sunflower and maize...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{accretion}} {{of primitive}} bodies (asteroids and TNOs) from freely-floating nebula particles remains problematic. Here {{we focus on}} the asteroids where constituent particle (read "chondrule") sizes are observationally known; similar arguments will hold for TNOs, but the constituent particles in those regions will be smaller, or will be fluffy aggregates, and are unobserved. Traditional growth-bysticking models encounter a formidable "meter-size barrier" [1] (or even a mm-cm-size barrier [2]) in turbulent nebulae, while nonturbulent nebulae form large asteroids too quickly to explain long spreads in formation times, or the dearth of melted asteroids [3]. Even if growth by sticking could somehow breach the meter size barrier, other obstacles are encountered through the 1 - 10 km size range [4]. Another clue regarding planetesimal formation is an apparent 100 km diameter peak in the pre-depletion, pre-erosion mass distribution of asteroids [5]; scenarios leading directly from independent nebula particulates to this size, which avoid the problematic m-km size range, could be called "leapfrog" scenarios [6 - 8]. The leapfrog scenario we have studied in detail involves formation of dense clumps of aerodynamically selected, typically mm-size particles in turbulence, which can under certain conditions shrink inexorably on 100 - 1000 orbit timescales and form 10 - 100 km diameter sandpile planetesimals. The typical sizes of planetesimals and the rate of their formation [7, 8] are determined by a statistical model with properties inferred from large numerical simulations of turbulence [9]. Nebula turbulence can be described by its Reynolds number Re = L/eta sup(4 / 3), where <b>L</b> = <b>ETA</b> alpha sup (1 / 2) the largest eddy scale, H is the nebula gas vertical scale height, and the nebula turbulent viscosity parameter, and is the Kolmogorov or smallest scale in turbulence (typically about 1 km), with eddy turnover time t.

40|$|Data on the {{volumetric}} liquid-side gas-liquid {{mass transfer}} coefficient, k(L) a, in a Multi-stage Agitated Contractor (MAC) are reported for three gas-liquid systems (air-water, helium-n-octane, and air-Monoethylene Glycol (MEG)). k(L) a (s(- 1)) was determined using a dynamic method with moderately soluble gaseous tracers (acetylene {{for water and}} MEG and methane for n-octane). The observed response curves could be described accurately by coupling the single phase residence time distribution models for gas and liquid phase (Breman et al., (1, 2)), via interfacial gas-liquid mass transfer. All k,a data could be correlated with an average relative deviation of 11. 3 % {{by a combination of}} Calderbanks' relation(3) for k(L) (m s(- 1)) and a modified type of Calderbanks' relation(3) for the interfacial area, a (m(- 1)), which takes a combined effect of the superficial gas velocity (u(G)) and the liquid viscosity (eta(L)) on a into account: a = 51. 1 (P/V) (0. 286) sigma(- 0. 19) (u(G) /v(b)) ((0. 127 + 21. 1 <b>eta</b> <b>L))</b> with g = acceleration of gravity (= 9. 81 m(2) s(- 1)), P/V = volumetric power input (W/m(- 3)), v(b) = bubble rise velocity (m s(- 1)) and the experimental conditions ranging from: superficial gas velocity u(G) = 0. 01 - 0. 09 m s(- 1), stirring speed (N) = 10 - 36. 7 rev s(- 1), eta(L) = 0. 00041 - 0. 021 N m(- 2) s, surface tension (sigma) = 0. 02 - 0. 073 N m(- 1), liquid density (rho(L)) = 684 - 1113 kg m(- 3), gas density (rho(G)) = 0. 16 - 1. 205 kg m(- 3) and liquid diffusion coefficient (L-L) = 1. 3 x 10 (- 10) - 3. 5 x 10 (- 9) m(2) s(- 1). The overall influence of u(G) on k(L) a in this relation is such that k(L) a is hardly affected by u(G) both for water and n-octane, whereas, in contrast, k(L) a is predicted to increase significantly with increasing u(G) for the more viscous monoethylene glycol, The general applicability of the proposed relation for a has to be confirmed by measurements for other liquids and by measurements on a larger scale...|$|R
40|$|The {{livestock}} {{sector accounts}} for 30 % of global land area {{and is a}} major driver of land use change (Geist and Lambin 2002). Steinfeld et al (2006) calculated that deforestation due {{to the expansion of}} pasture and feed crops was responsible for 8 % of total anthropogenic Co 2 emissions. In addition, methane emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management accounted for 32 % and 7 %, respectively of agriculture sector non –Co 2 emissions livestock sector will thus have large impacts on global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels. The objective of this paper: 1) to investigate the particular role played by crop yield increases in the dynamics of livestock production systems; 2) to explore whether these dynamics could lead to sparing of not only cropland but also grassland; and 3) to quantify the implications for related GHG emissions. Crop yield increases since 1961 have spared 85 % of cropland expansion and avoided emissions of some 590 gigatons (Gt) Co 2 -eq in the crop sector, compared to an alternative scenario without productivity increases (Burney, Davis, and Lobell 2010). In a prospective analysis, Tilman et al. (2011) demonstrated that if the current trends of low intensification in developing regions were to continue, five times more additional cropland(1 billion ha) would be needed and three times more GHG emissions would be emitted by 2050 than improvements. However, neither of these studies considered the indirect effects of increases in crop productivity on the dynamics of the required for livestock production. Evenson and Rosegrant (2003) showed that without the improvements that took place in crop genetics between 1965 and 2000, food crop prices would have been 35 - 66 % higher. The price reductions generated by crop yield increases should, ceteris paribus, encourage farmers to replace some of the grass in ruminant rations with crops. This would lead to land sparing and related Co 2 emission reductions in regions where the feed productivity per unit of area is higher for cropland than for grassland. However, because of the multiple and complex relationships between crop, livestock and land-use, clear-cut conclusions about the direction and magnitude of change in land use and GHG emissions cannot be obtained without integrated economic modeling. In this study we implement the global partial equilibrium model GLOBIOM, which has been used extensively in the past: 1) to analyze the effects of biofuel policies on total GHG emissions balance (Havlik et al. 2011; Frank <b>eta</b> <b>l.</b> forthcoming; and Mosnier et al. 2012); 2) to assess the mitigation potential of reduced emissions from deforestation (Bottcher et al 2012); and 3) to investigate future global challenges in the sector in general...|$|R
40|$|The large recent catastrophic {{events of}} Indian Ocean with over 300, 000 {{fatalities}} in 9 different {{countries and the}} 2011 Tohoku tsunami in Japan with about 20, 000 fatalities and over $ 100 B damage to the Japanese economy, have shown the limitations {{of some of the}} modeling approaches used in the past and have stimulated the development of both new models and novel modeling methodologies. In this thesis, some improvements in tsunami modeling is contributed, in part to better simulate tsunami generation by the co-seismic seafloor displacement caused by megathrust earthquakes like the one in Manuscript 1 (Pure and Applied Geophysics, 170, 1333 - 1359, 2013), and also model tsunamis generated by Submarine Mass Failures (SMFs) on or near the continental shelf break Manuscript 2 (published online on Natural Hazards, 42 pps. Nov. 15 th, 2014). Besides, when assessing coastal tsunami hazard along simple coastlines, one usually sets the static reference level in tsunami models to the largest astronomic tide, typically with 10 % exceedence; one also accounts for a potential sea level rise. However, in complex estuaries such as Chesapeake Bay or New York/Hudson River harbor, the dynamic effects of tidal currents on the incoming tsunami waves could, in some situations, enhance tsunami impact. In the Manuscript 3 (to be submitted) of this thesis, a new approach is implemented to simulate dynamic tide-tsunami interactions and is applied to the full case study of tsunami hazard assessment for the Chesapeake Bay mouth and the James River, which are very vulnerable, low lying, coastal environments equipped with major ports (e. g., Norfolk, Virginia Port authority) and resort areas (e. g., Virginia Beach). In the Manuscript 4 (To be submitted), by applying the new modeling tools together with the most recent bathymetric and geophysical data, we revisit the simulation of perhaps the most significant and damaging SMF tsunami case study in modern history: the 1998 Papua New Guinea (PNG) tsunami, to make a valid benchmark for landslide generated tsunami waves. ^ Accurate tsunami hazard assessment for a specific coastal area requires modeling tsunami impact and inundation from all the possible extreme near- and far-field tsunami sources in a given ocean basin. Tsunami generation from each of these sources must first be performed, which usually requires applying a separate model representing the considered geophysical phenomenon (e. g., subaerial landslide, earthquake, volcanic eruption, submarine mass failure, [...] .). Tsunami propagation to the study site must be conducted. Because of the many spatial and temporal scales involved, this requires using a variety of numerical grids. In this thesis, to perform tsunami propagation and coastal impact simulations with a one-way coupling modeling approach, in a series of nested grids of increasingly fine resolution (with commensurately accurate bathymetric data) is implemented. The tsunami propagation model used here, FUNWAVE-TVD (Shi <b>eta</b> <b>l.,</b> 2012; Kirby et al., 2013), is a fully nonlinear and dispersive Boussinesq long wave model that features accurate dissipation by breaking and bottom friction processes. The model has Cartesian and spherical implementations, which are used for simulating nearshore and deep water ocean nested grids, respectively. The model is used to simulate both Submarine Mass Failure tsunami sources and complex co-seismic sources such as for is NHWAVE (Ma et al., 2012), which is a three-dimensional non-hydrostatic sigma-layer model. Coupling between NHWAVE and FUNWAVE will also be applied in the work. ...|$|R
