The work showed that the generation of a surface glaze resulted in the considerable enhancement of the wear characteristics over an untreated OPC surface of concrete. Within both normal and corrosive (detergent, NaOH and HNO 3) environmental conditions the wear rate of the HPDL generated glaze was 3. 5 mg. cm- 2. h- 1.

Within both normal and corrosive environmental conditions, the wear rate of the CO 2 and HPDL generated glazes were consistently higher than the untreated OPC surface of concrete. Life assessment testing revealed that surface glazing of the OPC with both the CO 2 and the HPDL effected an increase in wear life of 1. 3 to 17. 7 times over an untreated OPC surface, depending upon the corrosive environment. The reasons for these marked improvements in the wear resistance and wear life of the CO 2 and HPDL generated glazes over the untreated OPC surface of concrete {{can be attributed to}} the partial (CO 2 laser) and full (HPDL) vitrification of the OPC surface after laser treatment which subsequently created a much more dense and consolidated surface with improved microstructure and phase characteristics which is more resistant in corrosive environments. In addition, the wear life and the wear rate of the HPDL glaze was found to be consistently higher than that of the CO 2 <b>laser</b> <b>glaze.</b> This is due to the fact that CO 2 and HPDLs have very different wavelengths; consequently, differences exist between the CO 2 and HPDL beam absorption {{characteristics of}} the OPC.

In particular, the mechanism to pass the steel samples at high speeds (700 — 1200 mm/s), kept the focus spot exposure times below 1 x 10 - 3 s.

Widely used methods of surface modification include film deposition such as physical vapour deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and diamond like carbon coating (DLC). Internal stresses {{make it difficult to}} bond such coatings to the substrates thus weakening the structure and limiting the life of implants. <b>Laser</b> <b>glazing</b> can achieve an amorphous layer on a component surface. Advantages of an amorphous layer include increased hardness, wear and corrosion resistance. These advantages arise from the elimination of crystalline anisotropy and inter-crystalline defects. These latter crystalline features provide the dislocation nucleation sites and shorter diffusion paths for enhanced oxidation and corrosion degradation. The current study introduced a surface modification method of <b>laser</b> <b>glazing</b> of biomedical AISI 316 L austenitic stainless steel to improve tribological properties. This stainless steel is commonly used in orthopaedics owing to its high corrosion resistance. However, due to its low hardness (250 HV), its tribological properties are poor. A pulsed CO 2 laser was used with peak power and pulse width being varied between 0. 4 to 1. 5 kW and 30 µs to 120 µs respectively. The laser beam spot size, sample speed, percentage overlap and pulse repetition frequency were kept at 90 µm, 570 rpm, 50 % and 5 kHz respectively. These parameters were optimised from literature parameters using design of experiments software. This paper presents and discusses the effects of these processing parameters on the morphology of the glazed zone.

50|$|The {{bond coat}} adheres the {{thermal barrier coating}} to the {{superalloy}} substrate. Additionally, the bond coat provides oxidation protection and functions as a diffusion barrier against the motion of substrate atoms towards the environment.There are five major types of bond coats, the aluminides, the platinum-aluminides, MCrAlY, cobalt-cermets, and nickel-chromium.For the aluminide bond coatings, the final composition {{and structure of the}} coating depends on the composition of the substrate. Aluminides also lack ductility below 750 °C, and exhibit a limited by thermomechanical fatigue strength. The Pt-aluminides are very similar to the aluminide bond coats except for a layer of Pt (5—10 μm) deposited on the blade. The Pt is believed to aid in oxide adhesion and contributes to hot corrosion. The cost of Pt plating is justified by the increased blade life span. The MCrAlY is the latest generation of bond coat and does not strongly interact with the substrate. Normally applied by plasma spraying, MCrAlY coatings are secondary aluminum oxide formers. This means that the coatings form an outer layer of chromium oxide (chromia), and a secondary aluminum oxide (alumina) layer underneath. These oxide formations occur at high temperatures in the range of those that superalloys usually encounter. The chromia provides oxidation and hot-corrosion resistance. The alumina controls oxidation mechanisms by limiting oxide growth by self-passivating. The yttrium enhances the oxide adherence to the substrate, and limits the growth of grain boundaries (which can lead to flaking of the coating). Investigation indicates that addition of rhenium and tantalum increases oxidation resistance. Cobalt-cermet based coatings consisting of materials such as tungsten carbide/cobalt can be used due to excellent resistance to abrasion, corrosion, erosion, and heat. These cermet coatings perform well in situations where temperature and oxidation damage are significant concerns, such as boilers. One of the unique advantages of cobalt cermet coatings is a minimal loss of coating mass over time, due to the strength of carbides within the mixture. Overall, cermet coatings are useful in situations where mechanical demands are equal to chemical demands for superalloys. Nickel-chromium coatings are used most frequently in boilers fed by fossil fuels, electric furnaces, and waste incineration furnaces, where the danger of oxidizing agents and corrosive compounds in the vapor must be dealt with. The specific method of spray-coating depends on the composition of the coatings. Nickel-chromium coatings that also contain iron or aluminum perform much better (in terms of corrosion resistance) when they are sprayed and <b>laser</b> <b>glazed,</b> while pure nickel-chromium coatings perform better when thermally sprayed exclusively.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to seek a connection between sound signals and the processing result by means of systematic variations of power density. The mechanisms of generation of various sound signal forms were to be clarified, in order to provide the user with fundamentals for the development of procedures for process control. Another focus was the reproducible measurement of sound signals. To clarify the mechanisms of sound signal generation, the laser beam power density was varied via pulse energy and focussing so that the treatment and machining processes from <b>laser</b> <b>glazing</b> to drilling were covered. Both in the signal on the workpiece and in the processing beam it was possible to detect skin melting, initial evaporation and the beginning of capillary formation. On the optical system these processes can be diagnosed only to a limited degree. During a test extending over several days in the production of spot welds on relay springs, on one hand, the acoustic receiver equipped with a needle was used and, on the other hand, the suitability of sound emission analysis for process control was tested. During this lap welding of copper alloys, the acoustic receiver was brought into contact with the lower joining partner. It was possible to unambiguously measure any lack of joint strength and the absence of the upper joining partner.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} laser {{surface modification}} work performed {{to improve the}} lifetime of die materials. Die material AISI H 13, with typical hardness {{in the range of}} 42 to 48 HRC, offers high wear and corrosion resistance. However the cyclic high temperature conditions along with exposure to high viscosity molten metal in semi 6 solid forming cause the die to wear and crack with resultant shortened die lifetime. In this study, the thermal stability of die material at elevated temperature was investigated through micro 6 hardness testing and a metallographic study. AISI H 13 samples were laser glazed using CO 2 continuous wave mode laser with 10. 6 9 m wavelength. Samples were attached to a specially designed rotating chuck to enable it to be rotated at speeds up to 1500 rpm and allow flat surface glazing to take place. The microhardness was measured for as 6 glazed samples and annealed samples which were held at temperatures ranging from 550 oC to 800 oC with 50 oC intervals. The metallographic study conducted examined the formation of three zones at different depths which were the glazed zone, the heat affected zone and the substrate. As a result of rapid heating and cooling from the <b>laser</b> <b>glazing</b> process, a metallic glass layer was developed which exhibited an average micro 6 hardness of 900 HV when exposed to 3. 34 E+ 10 W/m 2 laser irradiance within a range of 3. 64 to 5. 66 ms exposure time. Crystallization in glazed zone increased as the annealing temperature increased. As the annealing temperature reached above approximately 600 oC, the microhardness decreased to approximately 600 HV (equivalent to approx. 54 HRC) due to local crystallization. These findings show potential direct application of glazed dies for non 6 ferrous semisolid forming and the requirement for thermal barrier protection for application at higher temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{address the}} {{mitigation}} of sub-surface crack propagation in railroad rails via laser surface modification. The {{goal is to}} reduce the shear forces from rail-wheel friction, which contribute significantly to the nucleation and propagation of cracks in the sub-surface region at rail gage corners. Microhardness scans and tensile tests were performed on samples from cross-sections of unused and heavily used rail heads. The results of these tests indicate that the severe cyclic plastic deformation that occurs at the gage corners, during service, significantly hardens the sub-surface region there, which leads to cracking. <b>Laser</b> <b>glazing,</b> the rapid melting and rapid solidification of a thin surface layer, was used to reduce the friction coefficient of rail steel. The advantages of this process are that specific regions of the rail surface can be targeted; the treatment does not wash away as the currently used liquid lubricants do; it is more environmentally sound than liquid lubricants; and it can be applied in service, during re-work or during rail fabrication. A number of laser treatments were conducted on AISI 1080 steel plates, similar to rail steel, from which friction samples were extracted. Static block-on-ring friction experiments performed on a variety of laser treated surfaces showed reductions in the friction coefficient by about 25 % relative to untreated surfaces at loads corresponding to prototypic rail service loads. The authors laser-glazed two areas on the top surface of a 6 -ft length of rail with multiple pass treatments, one with adjacent passes overlapping, and one with adjacent passes separated by 1 mm. Friction measurements were made after they were subjected to 20, 000 run-in cycles. The laser treatments remained intact after these cycles. Reductions of friction coefficient of ca. 40 %, relative to untreated surfaces, were observed, corresponding to a reduction in the calculated mixed mode crack propagation rate by ca. 79 %...|$|E

The cracks are perpendicular to the surface along the densified layer and tend to branch and deviate from the vertical direction below it, within the porous PS coating. XRD results revealed mainly tV nontransformable tetragonal zirconia with a small percentage of residual monoclinic zirconia for the as-sprayed coating. All glazed coatings presented only tV nontransformable tetragonal zirconia with some variations on preferable crystal orientation.

40|$|The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, a $ 600 million US Department of Energy {{national}} laboratory, serves {{basic science}} by {{carrying out a}} primary mission of nuclear and particle physics research. A technologically related secondary mission now also exists for Jefferson Lab: applied research to develop superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) -based free-electron lasers as cost-effective new manufacturing capabilities for industry. A number of high-technology corporations and research universities, believing in the potential of SRF-driven FELs to overcome the constraints of cost, capacity, wavelength, and pulse-length, have formed the Laser Processing Consortium, and have joined with Jefferson Lab to develop the needed laser technology. Consortium members plan a range of industrial applications. In the area of polymer surface processing, they intend to develop amorphization to enhance adhesion, fabric surface texturing, enhanced food packaging, and induced surface conductivity. In micromachining, applications are ultrahigh-density CD-ROM technology, surface texturing; micro-optical components, and Micro-Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS). In metal surface processing proposed applications are <b>laser</b> <b>glazing</b> for corrosion resistance and adhesion pre-treatments. In electronic materials processing, the authors will investigate large-area processing (flat-panel displays) and a laser-based icluster tool for combined deposition, etching, and in situ diagnostics. The potential commercial value of the technology is significant, impacting several multibillion dollar markets. Moreover, significant additional applications exist in basic and applied research. The FEL is {{laid out in a}} racetrack configuration to utilize energy recovery of the spent electron beam. The electrons are produced in a 350 kV DC photocathode gun and accelerated to 10 MeV in a superconducting accelerating unit with 1 meter of active length. The electrons are then accelerated in an SRF cryomodule up to an energy of 57 MeV. In order to minimize emittance-growth effects and to accelerate the commissioning process, the FEL is placed at the exit of the linac. The electron beam is deflected around two cavity mirrors in two magnetica chicanes with a path-length dispersion (M 56) of 30 cm. After the FEL, the beam can be recirculated for energy recovery and dumped at the injection energy of 10 MeV. The recirculation loop is based on the isochronous achromat used in the MIT Bates accelerator but designed with an energy acceptance of 6 %. They estimate that the power output at 3 {mu}m should be 980 W with a small signal gain of 46 %. This paper will explore the technical and economic justification of the design and present the commissioning progress to date...|$|E
