40|$|The {{influence}} on the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of dibenzothiophene (DBT) of different activation procedures using H 2 S or dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) has been investigated on phosphorus-free and phosphorus-doped CoMo and NiMo industrial catalysts supported on alumina. The comparison of the two sulfiding agents was performed using strictly similar procedures of sulfidation to det. {{the origin of the}} well-known beneficial effect of organosulfides for the activation of hydrotreating catalysts. Partial pressures in H 2 and/or in sulfiding agents have been modified to observe activity variations among the different sulfiding agents used. Comparison between H 2 S and DMDS has also been performed on phosphorus-doped CoMoP/Al 2 O 3 and NiMoP/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Results emphasized the importance of supplying H 2 S to the catalyst at <b>low</b> <b>temps.</b> of activation (around 423 K) even in a low proportion (P H 2 S as low as 3. 3 kPa) to sulfide correctly NiMo and CoMo catalysts. Indeed, through a low consumption of H 2 S, O-S exchange and intramol. redox reactions can be initiated at <b>low</b> <b>temps.</b> of activation leading to a level of sulfidation sufficiently advanced before reaching temps. (above 573 K) at which a strong competition between redn. and sulfidation starts. DMDS appears less efficient than H 2 S for activating NiMo and CoMo catalyst due to its inability to provide H 2 S to the catalyst at these <b>low</b> <b>temps.</b> of activation. At higher temps. (T > 543 K), a good activation cannot be obtained if a high PH 2 /PH 2 S ratio is used whatever the sulfiding agent. Finally, the difficulty of activating the P-doped CoMoP/Al 2 O 3 and NiMoP/Al 2 O 3 catalysts was confirmed. This study confirms that the beneficial role of organosulfide compds. as activating agents is not related to a pure "chem.

5000|$|Leonidas {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{chocolate}} companies in the world. Until 1966, a kilogram of chocolate could be bought for USD 3.30 (approximately EUR 2.50) as opposed to the price of EUR 25.00 per kilogram of chocolate in 2014. In 1983, Leonidas made the most filled chocolates of the Belgian chocolate producers and did not export past London. The fresh butter and cream used in Leonidas chocolate makes them expire faster and more difficult to export. When preservatives were added to the product, the freshest dairy cream was no longer usable. Still, Leonidas chocolate must be eaten within 49 days in average, which is six weeks minus transportation depending if it is cream based, contains alcohol or is foil wrapped or ganache (ganache lasts longer than 60 days). Despite its growth as a company, Leonidas is well-respected and still Belgian. The goods are made in an old plant not far from Brussels and flown at <b>low</b> <b>temp</b> to far stores in locations like Chicago and New York City. The old Crown-Baele factory at 41-43 Graindor Boulevard in Anderlecht remains the company headquarters. In 1993, the Rue au Beurre shop was opened. It is the largest Leonidas shop in the world with a staff of 20. In 2012, Leonidas has 350 shops in Belgium and nearly 1,250 stores in around 50 countries including 340 in France. Some Leonidas stores include a half-open counter to sell pralines to passersby. The company has always promoted the motto, “democracy in chocolate.” Marie Douailly, a French-born representative of Leonidas in Chicago, explains, “Our philosophy is still that you shouldn’t have to be rich to enjoy really good chocolate.” ...|$|E

To find out {{the reason for this}} discrepancy, we have performed the first quantitative investigation on the growth dynamics of the faceted and rough surfaces of He- 3 crystals in the temperature range of 60 - 110 mK. We have applied an original method to obtain the variation of the overpressure on the crystal surface by measuring its curvature and height locally using a Fabry-Perot interferometer. The growth of the rough surface was found to be limited by the transport of the latent heat which elaborates in the liquid, in accordance with theoretical predictions (Puech L., et al. in J. <b>Low</b> <b>Temp.</b> Phys. 62 : 315, 1986; Graner F., et al. in J. <b>Low</b> <b>Temp.</b> Phys. 75 : 69, 1989 and 80 : 113, 1990) and previous measurements near the minimum of the melting curve (Graner F., et al. in J. <b>Low</b> <b>Temp.</b> Phys. 75 : 69, 1989 and 80 : 113, 1990).
