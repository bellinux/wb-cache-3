Out of this threat, a Kurdish general named Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb (Saladin), {{with a small}} band of {{professional}} soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and recaptured Jerusalem in 1187. On the death of Al-Adid, the last Fatimid caliph, in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the Ayyubid Dynasty. Under his rule, Egypt returned to Sunni Islam, Cairo became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from Turkey and southern Russia for military service. Support for the military was tied to the iqta, a form of <b>land</b> <b>taxation</b> in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} effects of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> and <b>land</b> value capture methods. Land value capture methods can be divided into three {{categories}} which are betterment tax, accessibility increment contribution and joint development. Theory of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation,</b> discussion about neutrality and challenges with the use of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> are introduced. Value capture methods and their impacts according to prior research are examined. Finally the incidence of both <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> in general and land value capture methods is studied. Studies from different parts of the world are introduced and patterns in terms of effectivity are identified. By comparing models which estimate the incidence of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> the conclusion can be made that introduction of a land value tax have different effects depending on which kind of factors and sectors are included in the model and if they are mobile or immobile. The factors which influence a value capture mechanism's ability to succeed are found to be increment of accessibility, rate of overall growth in the area, availability of developable land and zoning incentives and constraints. In the use of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> and <b>land</b> value capture the overall characteristics of the area have a significant impact on the results and they should be considered when making policy decisions...|$|R

In 1912, the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court was expanded; Thomas Walker was Minister for Justice and Education, and Attorney General. Workers' compensation provisions were greatly extended. The government also spent heavily on development of the Wheatbelt, especially in the construction of railways. Railway construction was increased, while farmers settling in the eastern wheat belt were provided with assistance in the form of liberalized lending arrangements, technical expertise, and new railways to transport the greatly increased production that took place as a result. Workers were also helped by extensions to the arbitration system. In addition, <b>land</b> <b>taxation</b> was increased, a graduated income tax was introduced, and considerable reforms were carried out in the fields of divorce, criminal law, irrigation, and education.|$|E
25|$|The Nawab of Bengal Siraj Ud Daulah, the {{de facto}} ruler of the Bengal province, opposed British {{attempts}} to use these permits. This led to the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757, in which the Bengal Army of the East India Company, led by Robert Clive, defeated the French-supported Nawab's forces. This was the first real political foothold with territorial implications that the British acquired in India. Clive was appointed by the company as its first 'Governor of Bengal' in 1757. This was combined with British victories over the French at Madras, Wandiwash and Pondichéry that, along with wider British successes during the Seven Years' War, reduced French influence in India. The British East India Company extended its control over the whole of Bengal. After the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the company acquired the rights of administration in Bengal from de jure Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II; this {{marked the beginning of}} its formal rule, which within the next century engulfed most of India. The East India Company monopolised the trade of Bengal. They introduced a <b>land</b> <b>taxation</b> system called the Permanent Settlement which introduced a feudal-like structure in Bengal, often with zamindars set in place.|$|E

40|$|When economists {{think about}} the {{contribution}} that <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> might make to economic performance, {{they are likely to}} think in terms of property tax reform. If taxes on structures are reduced or eliminated, one can expect that more structures will be built, and cities will be taller, more compact and more efficient. 1 But more efficient cities are only the beginning of the contribution that <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> can make to improving economic performance. <b>Land</b> value <b>taxation</b> generalizes into the principle that people should pay for all of their appropriations of natural opportunities, according to the opportunity costs of those appropriations, and the resulting revenue should be shared equally.

2500|$|Hong Kong's {{economic}} policy {{has often been}} cited by economists such as Milton Friedman and the Cato Institute {{as an example of}} laissez-faire capitalism, attributing the city's success to the policy. However, others have argued that the economic strategy is not adequately characterised by the term laissez-faire. They point out that there are still many ways in which the government is involved in the economy, some of which exceed the degree of involvement in other capitalist countries. For example, the government [...] is involved in public works projects, healthcare, education, and social welfare spending. Further, although rates of taxation on personal and corporate income are low by international standards, unlike most other countries Hong Kong's government raises a significant portion of its revenues from land leases and <b>land</b> <b>taxation.</b> All land in Hong Kong is owned by the government and is leased to private developers and users on fixed terms, for fees which are paid to the state treasury. By restricting the sale of land leases, the Hong Kong government keeps the price of land at what some consider as artificially high prices and this allows the government to support relatively some public spending with a low tax rate on income and profit.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the remnant}} of the Mughal Empire revenue system {{existing}} in pre-1765 Bengal, zamindars, or [...] "land holders," [...] collected revenue {{on behalf of the}} Mughal emperor, whose representative, or diwan supervised their activities. In this system, the assortment of rights associated with land were not possessed by a [...] "land owner," [...] but rather shared by the several parties with stake in the land, including the peasant cultivator, the zamindar, and the state. The zamindar served as an intermediary who procured economic rent from the cultivator, and after withholding a percentage for his own expenses, made available the rest, as revenue to the state. Under the Mughal system, the land itself belonged to the state and not to the zamindar, who could transfer only his right to collect rent. On being awarded the diwani or overlordship of Bengal following the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the East India Company found itself short of trained administrators, especially those familiar with local custom and law; tax collection was consequently farmed out. [...] This uncertain foray into <b>land</b> <b>taxation</b> by the Company, may have gravely worsened the impact of a famine that struck Bengal in 1769-70, in which between seven and ten million people—or between a quarter and third of the presidency's population—may have died. However, the company provided little relief either through reduced taxation or by relief efforts, and the economic and cultural impact of the famine was felt decades later, even becoming, a century later, the subject of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's novel Anandamath.|$|E

Broadly speaking, these clauses require taxation to be applied evenly or uniformly within a jurisdiction. However, the exact wording and meaning of these clauses differs from constitution to constitution. Although the federal Uniformity Clause has never been an issue, the wording and interpretation of many state constitutions has created issues peculiar to each state. For example in 1898, the Maryland Court of Appeals (the highest state appellate court) ruled that the use of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> in Hyattsville was unconstitutional. Shortly thereafter, an amendment to the Maryland Declaration of Rights specifically allowed for <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> where authorized by the State Legislature.

60|$|In {{many ways}} I was {{disposed}} {{to regard the}} 1909 Budget as a fine piece of statecraft. Its production was certainly a very unexpected display of vigour on the Liberal side. But, on the whole, this movement towards collectivist organisation {{on the part of}} the Liberals rather strengthened than weakened my resolve to cross the floor of the house. It made it more necessary, I thought, to leaven the purely obstructive and reactionary elements that were at once manifest in the opposition. I assailed the <b>land</b> <b>taxation</b> proposals in one main speech, and a series of minor speeches in committee. The line of attack I chose was that the land was a great public service that needed to be controlled on broad and far-sighted lines. I had no objection to its nationalisation, but I did object most strenuously to the idea of leaving it in private hands, and attempting to produce beneficial social results through the pressure of taxation upon the land-owning class. That might break it up in an utterly disastrous way. The drift of the government proposals was all in the direction of sweating the landowner to get immediate values from his property, and such a course of action was bound to give us an irritated and vindictive land-owning class, the class upon which we had hitherto relied--not unjustifiably--for certain broad, patriotic services and an influence upon our collective judgments that no other class seemed prepared to exercise. Abolish landlordism if you will, I said, buy it out, but do not drive it to a defensive fight, and leave it still sufficiently strong and wealthy to become a malcontent element in your state. You have taxed and controlled the brewer and the publican until the outraged Liquor Interest has become a national danger. You now propose to do the same thing on a larger scale. You turn a class which has many fine and truly aristocratic traditions towards revolt, and there is nothing in these or any other of your proposals that shows any sense of the need for leadership to replace these traditional leaders you are ousting. This was the substance of my case, and I hammered at it not only in the House, but in the press....|$|E

40|$|Recurrent {{property}} taxation is {{an important}} revenue stream for sub-national governments around the world. In its various forms, land value as a base of recurrent taxation has become less common in many countries {{over the past twenty}} years. This has largely been attributed to a number of factors ranging from pressure imposed by opponents of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation,</b> to challenges against non-demonstrable methods of assessing the underlying value of land in highly urbanized locations, where land transactions are few. This paper is a review and critique of the evolution of recurrent property taxation and the transition of the base of this tax from land to improved value in some countries. It analyses the methodological voids which have armed opponents of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> with the justification for such a transition to alternate bases. It further articulates the difference between local government council rating and a broader non-earmarked land tax. A United States case study has been used to demonstrate the demise of land as the base of recurrent property taxation and the emerging similarities in Australia. In conclusion, the paper provides a framework for the harmonious coexistence of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> and the rating of land and establishes key requirements in developing and maintaining a robust <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> system in highly urbanized locations...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the effects of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> on new housing {{development}} in Pittsburgh. <b>Land</b> value <b>taxation</b> generally refers to the <b>taxation</b> of <b>land</b> at rates higher than those levied against buildings and other improvements. Liquidity and incentive effects of shifting the tax base from improvements to land will, according to theory, encourage development. In recent years, real estate tax rate changes in Pittsburgh have consisted of a steady and substantial increase in the land tax rate and fluctuations in the rate applied to improvements. These changes provide a basis for testing the proposition that <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> encourages development. ^ This dissertation is divided into five main chapters, the first of which is an introduction. The second chapter is a review of previous empirical studies of land value taxes, while the third chapter is a discussion of the economic theory of <b>land</b> value <b>taxation.</b> The fourth chapter presents an econometric model for testing the proposition that <b>land</b> value <b>taxation</b> encourages new housing development. The model 2 ̆ 7 s dependent variable is a measure of new housing development based on building permit values. The independent variables include the taxes on land and improvements and other factors affecting new housing development. ^ The results of estimating the model are presented in the fifth chapter. It was found that the improvement tax rate has had a significant inverse effect on the amount of new housing development. This effect has involved the number of new housing units but not the average cost of new units. The land tax rate was found to be an insignificant determinant of the level of new housing development. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Land</b> value <b>taxation</b> in Germany has a {{long history}} pre-dating and post-dating Henry George's own influence. Some of the ideas Henry George stood for had already taken root in German {{practice}} before him, and when his books began to appear almost simultaneously with their American editions in Germany, a German intellectual and political movement began to emerge rallying around the issue of land reform. In this essay, first the intellectual roots of Georgist ideas in German literature are being retraced.

The core of Henry George's ideas, however, is embodied not in the legislation on <b>land</b> added value <b>taxation,</b> but rather appended to the income tax code.

Since the interplay between German income tax legislation and investment decisions is hard to grasp for the uninitiated from a purely theoretical discussion, an example is being analyzed in the fourth section in order to illustrate how this AGeorgist@ system of taxation operates in practice. ...|$|R
