50|$|The <b>lacrimal</b> <b>lake</b> is {{the pool}} of tears in the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac, which drains into {{the opening of the}} tear {{drainage}} system (the puncta lacrimalia). The volume of the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>lake</b> has been estimated to be between 7 and 10 µL.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>lake</b> usually {{contains}} 7-10 µL of tears, {{the maximum}} fluid it can usually hold is 25-30 µL before tearing occurs. Aging usually causes the eyelids {{to become more}} loose which in turn enables the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>lake</b> to hold even more fluid.|$|E

5000|$|The {{lacrimal}} punctum (plural puncta) or lacrimal point, is {{a minute}} opening on the summits of the lacrimal papillae, {{seen on the}} margins of the eyelids at the lateral extremity of the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>lake.</b> There are two lacrimal puncta in the medial (inside) portion of each eyelid.|$|E

When the eyes blink, the lacrimal fluid is spread {{across the surface of the}} eye. Lacrimal fluid gathers in the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>lake,</b> and is drawn into the puncta by capillary action, then {{flows through the}} lacrimal canaliculi at the inner corner of the eyelids entering the lacrimal sac, then on to the nasolacrimal duct, and finally into the nasal cavity. An excess of tears, as with strong emotion, can thus cause the nose to run.http://www.academy.org.uk/tutorials/dilate3.jpg ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{plica semilunaris}} {{is a small}} fold of bulbar {{conjunctiva}} on the medial canthus of the eye. It functions during movement of the eye, to help maintain tear drainage via the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>lake,</b> and to permit greater rotation of the globe, for without the plica the conjunctiva would attach directly to the eyeball, restricting movement. It is the vestigial remnant of the nictitating membrane (the [...] "third eyelid") which is drawn across the eye for protection, and is present in other animals such as birds, reptiles, and fish, but is rare in mammals, mainly found in monotremes and marsupials. Its associated muscles are also vestigial. [...] It is loose, thus eye movements are not restricted by it. Only one species of primate, the Calabar angwantibo, {{is known to have}} a functioning nictitating membrane.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Various {{surgical}} procedures {{are available to}} correct paralytic ectropion, which are applied in irreversible facial paresis. Problems occur when facial paresis has an unclear prognosis, since surgery of the lower eyelid is usually irreversible. We propose a simple method to correct temporary ectropion in facial palsy by applying an adhesive strip. Patients and methods Ten patients with peripheral facial paresis and paralytic ectropion were treated with an adhesive strip to correct paralytic ectropion. We used "Steri-Strips" (45 × 6. 0 mm), which were taped on the carefully cleaned skin of the lower eyelid and of the adjacent zygomatic region until the prognosis of the paresis was clarified. In addition to the examiner's evaluation of the lower lacrimal point in the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>lake,</b> subjective improvement of the symptoms was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS, 1 – 10). Results 9 patients reported a clear improvement of the symptoms after adhesive taping. There was a clear regression of tearing (VAS (median) = 8; 1 = no improvement, 10 = very good improvement), the cosmetic impairment of the adhesive tape was low (VAS (median) = 2. 5; 1 = no impairment, 10 = severe impairment) {{and most of the}} patients found the use of the adhesive strip helpful. There was slight reddening of the skin in one case and well tolerated by the facial skin in the other cases. Conclusion The cause and location of facial nerve damage are decisive for the type of surgical therapy. In potentially reversible facial paresis, procedures should be used that are easily performed and above all reversible without complications. Until a reliable prognosis of the paresis can be made, adhesive taping is suited for the temporary treatment of paralytic ectropion. Adhesive taping is simple and can be performed by the patient. </p...|$|E
