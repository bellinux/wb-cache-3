5|$|The IUCN has {{assessed}} the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> globally as Vulnerable; it is harvested using anchored and floating gillnets, beach nets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, the fins used for shark fin soup, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. The sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> is highly susceptible to local overfishing, {{due to its}} slow reproductive rate and limited movements. Off Southeast Asia, this shark has become scarce {{under the pressure of}} expanding, unmonitored, and unregulated fisheries, and has been assessed there as Endangered by the IUCN. Widespread habitat degradation, including pollution and blast fishing on coral reefs and deforestation in mangroves, poses an additional threat to the survival of this species in the region. Already, the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> has been extirpated in parts of India and Thailand, and has not been reported from Indonesian markets in recent years despite being historically abundant there. Off Australia, the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> is taken in only small numbers intentionally and as bycatch, and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{microsatellite}} DNA evidence, the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> {{is thought}} to have diverged from its sister species N. brevirostris 1014 million years ago, when the closure of the Tethys Sea separated lemon sharks in the Indian Ocean from those in the Atlantic. The ancestral <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> species may have been N. eurybathrodon, the fossilized teeth of which occur in both the United States and Pakistan. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that Negaprion is grouped with the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between the most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} spinner shark were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the spinner shark is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner shark was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem shark species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
50|$|<b>Lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> feed {{at night}} and are mainly piscivorous; however, they {{have been known to}} feed on {{crustaceans}} and benthic organisms. Intraspecific predation, or cannibalism, of juvenile <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> by larger conspecifics has also been documented. Rather than feeding randomly, <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> display a high degree of preference for certain species and size of prey when environmental conditions are favorable. They also tend to prefer a prey when it is more abundant and available. <b>Lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> feed selectively on species that are slower and more easily captured by using a stalking technique. For example, parrotfish and mojarras are common prey in the Bahamas because they use camouflage rather than an escape response and are vulnerable due to their stationary foraging behavior. <b>Lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> feed on prey that are intermediate in size compared to other available prey. This tendency {{can be explained by the}} tradeoff between the probability of capture and the profitability when it comes to prey size. The general trend in the foraging behavior of <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> conforms to the optimal foraging theory, which suggests a positive relationship between prey selectivity and availability.|$|R
50|$|The {{environmental}} temperature influences an individual’s body temperature, which ultimately affects physiological {{processes such as}} growth and metabolism. <b>Lemon</b> <b>sharks,</b> therefore, select warm-water habitats to maintain optimal metabolic levels. They are believed to avoid areas with thick seagrasses because they make finding prey more difficult. <b>Lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> tend to live in or near shallow-water mangroves, which are often the nursery areas of several species of fish. One theory is that <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> select mangrove habitats due to the abundance of prey that resides there, while another theory posits that mangroves provide a safe haven from adult <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> that occasionally feed on juvenile sharks and are unable to enter the shallow waters. Ontogenetic niche shifts, or changes in an animal’s niche breadth or position, to deeper waters are known to occur {{in relation to a}} <b>lemon</b> <b>shark’s</b> size. These changes occur due to the dramatic decrease in the risk of predation as body size increases. Habitat selection clearly depends on a variety of biological and environmental variables.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are found}} from New Jersey to {{southern}} Brazil {{in the tropical}} western Atlantic Ocean. They also live {{off the coast of}} west Africa in the southeastern Atlantic. In addition, <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> have been found in the eastern Pacific, from southern Baja California to Ecuador. This species of shark often occupies the subtropical shallow waters of coral reefs, mangroves, enclosed bays, and river mouths; however, <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> have also been found in the open ocean down to depths of 92 m. Although <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> do swim up rivers, they never seem to travel very far into fresh water. They are found in open water primarily during migrations, and tend to stay along the continental and insular shelves for most of their lives.|$|R
5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the <b>lemon</b> <b>shark,</b> the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} {{is a member}} of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also {{including}} the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the blue shark (Prionace glauca), <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> (Negaprion brevirostris), and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).|$|E
5|$|With a more {{streamlined}} form {{than other}} nurse sharks, the {{tawny nurse shark}} {{is believed to be}} a less benthic, more active swimmer. The characteristics of its body, head, fins, and teeth are comparable to other active reef sharks sharing its range, such as the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> (Negaprion acutidens). Tawny nurse sharks are primarily nocturnal, though they are said to be active at all hours off Madagascar, and in captivity they will become diurnally active if presented with food. During the day, groups of two dozen or more sharks can be found resting inside caves and under ledges, often stacked atop one another. Individual sharks have small home ranges that they consistently return to each day.|$|E

5|$|A slow-moving {{predator}} feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> seldom travels long distances and many individuals {{can be found}} year-round at certain locations. Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with females giving birth {{to no more than}} 13 pups every other year, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Although they are potentially dangerous to humans and known to respond vigorously to any provocation, under normal circumstances, sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious and tend to retreat if approached. The IUCN has assessed this species as Vulnerable; its low reproductive productivity and rate of movement limits the capacity of depleted stocks to recover. Off India and Southeast Asia, this species has been severely depleted or extirpated by unregulated exploitation for its meat, fins, and liver oil.|$|E
5|$|Several {{apparently}} unprovoked {{attacks on}} humans {{have been attributed}} to the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark.</b> Due to its formidable size and teeth, it is regarded as potentially dangerous, and certainly this species has been known to defend itself quickly and vigorously if touched, speared, or otherwise provoked or alarmed. Once agitated, this shark can be a persistent adversary; in one case, a shark forced a swimmer to seek refuge atop a coral head, and circled for hours before giving up. However, observations by divers show that normally this shark is shy and hesitant to approach, even when presented with bait. Often, the shark will move away when a diver enters visual range. Young sharks are reportedly more aggressive and inquisitive than the adults. At Moorea, sicklefin lemon sharks are the main attraction of daily shark-feeding ecotourism dives. This shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} fish are {{viviparous}}. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply {{with that of the}} embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and <b>lemon</b> <b>shark.</b> Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E

Four species of reef shark have been identified: grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus), whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) and <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> (Negaprion brevirostris), which are all listed on the IUCN Red List of threatened species, as ‘near threatened’ species.|$|E
25|$|Irrespective of {{the cause}} of their {{ultimate}} extinction, during the long time of their existence the pseudotooth birds furnished prey for large predators themselves. Few if any birds that coexisted with them were large enough to harm them while airborne; {{as evidenced by the}} Early Eocene Limnofregata, the frigatebirds coevolved with the Pelagornithidae and may well have harassed any of the small species for food on occasion, as they today harass albatrosses. From the Middle Miocene or Early Pliocene of the Lee Creek Mine, some remains of pseudotooth birds which probably fell victim to sharks while feeding are known. The large members of the abundant Lee Creek Mine shark fauna that hunted near the water's surface included the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), Carcharias sand tiger sharks, Isurus and Cosmopolitodus mako sharks, Carcharodon white sharks, the snaggletooth shark Hemipristis serra, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo), Carcharhinus whaler sharks, the <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> (Negaprion brevirostris) and hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna), and perhaps (depending on the bird fossils' age) also Pristis sawfishes, Odontaspis sand tiger sharks, and Lamna and Parotodus benedeni mackerel sharks. It is notable that fossils of smaller diving birds – for example auks, loons and cormorants – {{as well as those of}} albatrosses are much more commonly found in those shark pellets than pseudotooth birds, supporting the assumption that the latter had quite low population densities and caught much of their food in mid-flight.|$|E
500|$|The sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> {{was first}} {{described}} as Carcharias acutidens by German naturalist Eduard Rüppell, in the 1837 Fische des Rothen Meeres (Fishes of the Red Sea).

The type specimen, designated in 1960, is a 68-cm-long individual {{caught in the}} Red Sea off Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The specific epithet acutidens {{is derived from the}} Latin acutus meaning [...] "sharp", and dens meaning [...] "teeth".

40|$|Sharks face {{a number}} of {{obstacles}} for surviving their first several years of life and many species occupy nursery areas. Although estimates of survival, particularly for young age classes, are essential for assessing, monitoring and effectively managing animal populations, there have been relatively few calculations of survival within shark populations and even fewer estimates based on direct methods for sharks on their nursery grounds. We used tag-recapture methods to estimate the population size and survival of juvenile <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> (Negaprion brevirostris) on their nursery grounds at Atol das Rocas, a marine protected area in Brazil. Sharks were sampled from 1999 to 2003. Population size estimates ranged from 12 to 100 juvenile sharks and survival estimates ranged between 24 - 54 % {{with a mean of}} 44. 6 % over the most robust sampling periods. The population of juvenile <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> declined over the course of our study, whereas survival rates may have increased over the same time period. Even a modest level of fishing and removal of mature females in adjacent areas may dramatically affect small populations of sharks within a small and isolated nursery such as Atol das Rocas. The lower survival rates and population size at Atol das Rocas could be the result of differences in physical characteristics of this nursery in comparison to others used by <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> in the northwestern Atlantic. Such comparatively lower populational parameters suggest that the population of young <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> is fragile at the Atol das Rocas nursery...|$|R
5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark's</b> diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their mouths and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to their mouths and gills.|$|R
500|$|The sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark,</b> or sharptooth <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> (Negaprion acutidens), is {{a species}} of requiem shark {{belonging}} to the family Carcharhinidae, widely distributed in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. It {{is closely related to}} the better-known <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> (N. brevirostris) of the Americas; the two species are almost identical in appearance, both being stout-bodied sharks with broad heads, two dorsal fins of nearly equal size, and a plain yellow-tinged coloration. As its common name suggests, the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> differs from its American counterpart in having more falcate (sickle-shaped) fins. This large species grows up to [...] long. It generally inhabits water less than [...] deep in a variety of habitats, from mangrove estuaries to coral reefs.|$|E
500|$|As {{with other}} members of its family, the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> is viviparous; the {{developing}} embryos are sustained by a placental connection formed from their depleted yolk sacs. Females give birth to one to 13 (usually six to 12) pups every other year in shallow nursery areas, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Unlike in the American <b>lemon</b> <b>shark,</b> cant evidence indicates this species is philopatric (returns to the site of their birth to reproduce). Parturition occurs in October or November at Madagascar and Aldabra, and in January at French Polynesia; ovulation and mating for nonpregnant females takes place at around the same time. The embryos develop a placenta after around four months of gestation, when they still possess vestiges of external gills. The young are born at a length of [...] Juvenile sharks grow slowly, at a rate of [...] per year. Both sexes attain sexual maturity at a length of [...]|$|E

The second dorsal fin, nearly equal to the first in size, is located over or slightly forward of the anal fin. No ridge is seen between the dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are long and broad, originating below the space between the third and fourth gill slits. The anal fin has a strong notch in the rear margin. The precaudal pit (a cavity just forward of the caudal fin) is oriented longitudinally. The large dermal denticles are overlapping and bear three to five horizontal ridges each. The coloration is a plain yellowish brown or gray above and lighter below, with more yellow on the fins. This species attains a maximum known length of , though it typically does not exceed [...]|$|E
5000|$|However, one {{consequence}} that may arise is {{increased levels of}} inbreeding within the nursing sites. Another consequence includes coercive mating by males, which can force females into polyandrous mating {{even if they do}} not receive any benefits from this mating system. Copulation requires a substantial amount of energy and females that mate with multiple males causes a negative effect on their overall fitness. [...] Female <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> give birth to four to eighteen pups every two years. This two-year reproductive cycle usually occurs in <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks,</b> sandbar sharks, and nurse sharks. One hypothesis states that females can engage in polyandry to find genetically dissimilar and therefore compatible males to produce high quality offspring. However, no concrete evidence has been found to strongly support this hypothesis. Further research needs to be conducted to determine whether any direct or indirect benefits exist for elasmobranch sharks.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOptical {{measurements}} of the refractive state of the eyes of various shark species typically have depicted sharks as hyperopic (far-sighted) with little evidence of accommodation (i. e. the ability to change focus for visualizing objects at different distances from the eye). In this study, we used infrared video retinoscopy to measure the refractive state in juvenile <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> (Negaprion brevirostris). This technique allows dynamic measurement of refractive state in free-swimming animals as they pass by an aquarium window. We found that unrestrained <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> are focused emmetropically relative to a 1 -m distant photorefractor for the lateral visual field. However, when restrained either right side up or upside down (the latter inducing tonic immobility), the sharks become increasingly hyperopic, an artifact also reported in some other vertebrates. In addition, unrestrained <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> display small amplitude accommodative excursions. Thus, refractive state measurements on restrained sharks in general may not reflect the natural, resting state of the shark eye, but rather, an induced hyperopia and lack of accommodative function. Such an artifact may be present in other vertebrate species, underscoring the need to obtain {{measurements of}} refractive state in unrestrained animals...|$|R
40|$|Group {{behaviours}} are widespread among fish but comparatively {{little is}} known about the interactions between free-ranging individuals and how these might change across different spatio-temporal scales. This is largely due to the difficulty of observing wild fish groups directly underwater over long enough time periods to quantify group structure and individual associations. Here we describe the use of a novel technology, an animal-borne acoustic proximity receiver that records close-spatial associations between free-ranging fish by detection of acoustic signals emitted from transmitters on other individuals. Validation trials, held within enclosures in the natural environment, on juvenile <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> Negaprion brevirostris fitted with external receivers and transmitters, showed receivers logged interactions between individuals regularly when sharks were within 4 m (, 4 body lengths) of each other, but rarely when at 10 m distance.

A study at Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles found, of the tagged sharks that were later recaptured, over 90% were still within [...] of their initial tagging location. Another study at Moorea in French Polynesia found that some of the local sharks were year-round residents of the island, while others were more transitory and visited only occasionally.|$|E
500|$|The {{range of}} the sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> extends from South Africa to the Red Sea (including Mauritius, the Seychelles, and Madagascar), {{continuing}} eastward {{along the coast of}} the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, extending as far north as Taiwan and the Philippines, and as far south as New Guinea and northern Australia. This species is also found around numerous Pacific islands, including New Caledonia, Palau, the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu, and French Polynesia. This species likely colonized the central Pacific by infrequently [...] "hopping" [...] from one island to the next. Significant levels of genetic differentiation between sicklefin lemon sharks in Australia and French Polynesia, [...] apart, suggest that little intermingling occurs between regional subpopulations.|$|E
500|$|The sicklefin <b>lemon</b> <b>shark</b> has a robust, stocky {{body and}} a short, broad head.

Short furrows are present {{at the corners of}} the mouth. Thirteen to 16 (usually 14) tooth rows occur on either side of both jaws, not including the tiny teeth at the symphysis (the jaw midline). The upper teeth have a large cusp rising from a broad base, with a notch on each side; these teeth become increasingly angled towards the corners of the mouth. The lower teeth resemble the upper teeth, but are narrower and more erect. The teeth of sharks over [...] long are finely serrated.|$|E

50|$|Overall, {{polyandry}} is {{the dominant}} mating system in <b>lemon</b> <b>sharks</b> and sandbar sharks. However, geography {{can play a role}} in mating systems.
