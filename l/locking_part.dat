50|$|Padlock seals {{are usually}} {{supplied}} as a completely plastic seal, shaped {{as a standard}} padlock would be. Technically, they can be classed as a fixed length seal. They feature {{the same types of}} tamper-evident protection as variable length and fixed length have available - numbering, bar-coding and branding - but fit some different applications. The most common use for these seals is for airline duty-free trolleys. One {{reason for this is that}} plastic padlocks can be placed over a <b>locking</b> <b>part</b> as any metal padlock would be to secure, but do not require keys to open, they simply break off at their built in break point using hands or a small pair of wire cutters. They are secure due to the audit trail available as a result of the sequential numbering.|$|E
5000|$|Will Maddox (Blake Shields) has {{a theory}} about {{students}} not liking the idea of school and authority and thinking {{that it is a}} prison. He tests this theory and examines the boundaries of authority and his friendships. A few years before, a student, John Stanton (Michael Shannon) was committed to an insane asylum, reasons unknown to most everybody except the principal. One day he escapes, releasing everyone else from the asylums around. Maddox sees this defiance which is the start of his anarchy. Maddox wants to [...] "help him" [...] and understand him more so they start a correspondence and Stanton tells him what to do and how to do them. This is includes the erasing of student grades, posting posters/fliers, <b>locking</b> <b>part</b> of the student body in a room among other things. Maddox gets his friends involved and challenges authority and gets most of the school behind him, including an administrator for a while. He is so consumed with creating chaos and disorder that his friends start to see the destruction, but they have to save themselves, and him before he can take complete control over the school.|$|E
30|$|The {{plate is}} mounted with drill guides and is, with a spacer {{to protect the}} periosteum, {{distally}} placed on the lateral femur condyle and proximally {{in line with the}} femur shaft in the frontal and sagittal plane. Temporary fixation distal to the osteotomy is performed with a K-wire drilled through a guiding sleeve. Plate position is checked fluoroscopically. As the TomoFix is an internal fixator, precise fit to the femur is not necessary. After drilling, at least four self-tapping locking screws are inserted distally. Next, a bicortical self-tapping lag screw is inserted eccentrically in the dynamic part of the combi-hole directly superior to the osteotomy putting the osteotomy under axial compression. Three self-tapping monocortical or bicortical (depending on bone quality and patient’s stature) screws are inserted in the remaining holes proximal of the lag screw. Finally, the lag screw is changed for a self-tapping bicortical locking screw inserted in the <b>locking</b> <b>part</b> of the combi-hole. After a final check with the image intensifier, the wound is closed over a non-suction drain. Care is taken to meticulously close the fascia lata before subcutaneous closure. The skin is closed subcuticularly.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Insufficient primary {{stability}} is still reported for proximal humerus fractures in elderly patients. Fixation stability {{could be improved}} by aiming locking screws at bone volumes with better properties. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the bone regions engaged by the locking screws of a Proximal Humeral Nail (MultiLoc PHN), and to evaluate the influence of peri-screw bone quality on bone-nail construct stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve cadaveric humeri were divided into two groups. The distal <b>locking</b> <b>part</b> of the PHN was fixed to the specimens. The nails were removed and the bones scanned using HR-pQCT. Bone properties were evaluated at the locations where the proximal locking screws would have been positioned after complete instrumentation. A three-part fracture model was used for mechanical testing of the instrumented bones, considering axial displacement and varus deformation as parameters of interest. RESULTS: The secondary locking screws targeted bone volumes in the posteromedial part of the humerus with statistically significant higher quality, thus reducing varus deformation. Significant correlation was found between axial displacement and bone properties at the primary proximal screws. Significant correlation was found between the varus deformation and apparent BMD at the secondary locking screws. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study confirmed that directing the proximal locking screws at bone regions with better properties can improve fixation stability...|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Harry Soref started Master Lock {{off with the}} first {{laminated}} padlock. Plates that were punched from sheet metal were stacked and assembled.

The entire stack of plates, loaded with the <b>lock</b> <b>parts</b> in it, was riveted together. This padlock was popular for its low cost and an impact-resistant laminated plate design.

Byzantine iconography differs little as to head-dress from that of the catacombs.
