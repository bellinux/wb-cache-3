40|$|The Kentish/snowy plover Charadrius alexandrinus {{is a small}} {{cosmopolitan}} shorebird (body mass {{about 40}} - 44 g). In {{the last few years}} we have developed a suite of methods to investigate its behaviour and ecology in the field. We thought this practical guide may be useful for students and researchers with an interest in small plovers. Some aspects of these methods may be relevant for other shorebirds and ground-nesting birds in general. Our fundamental motivation in writing this guide is to show that the Kentish plover is an easy species to work with, if one is willing to pay attention to a few potential pitfalls. We hope that this guide will elicit further research. Please contact us if you have questions and comments, and let us know of any errors. Note that Kentish plovers have been studied in several countries and by a good range of researchers, and we don't claim that our methods work best. Many Kentish plover populations are now declining.

40|$|Can {{you really}} trust ‘the name you can trust’? asks Richard Denniss HAVE you ever {{wondered}} why they put advertisements for petrol on television? Has anyone ever been prompted by these advertisements to rush out and {{fill up with}} the brand of petrol in question? While there are many {{lessons to be learned}} from the recent Pan Pharmaceutical fiasco, the biggest lesson for consumers is that brand image is no more valuable than the adhesive label it is printed on. Increasingly, companies are spending billions of dollars on advertising in an attempt to build their brands at the expense of building their businesses. Marketing expenditures are eating into the amount of money available to actually provide for the quality production processes the advertisements allude to. Take a look at the list of more than 1000 products that have been recalled after the revelations of dodgy practices at Pan. ‘Household names’ that we ‘know and trust’ are listed along with small distributors that we have never even heard of. But as the recent massive recall shows us, the only thing differentiating the big brands from the small is the higher prices the big names need to charge you to cover the costs of all that advertising. We are told that Pan was producing five million pills a day, yet most people had never heard of the company. Pallet loads of pills were trucked around the country to where the ‘value’ was added, the bottling and labelling warehouses. From there, the once-identical pills were shipped into our shops where they could be sorted, one last time, by price with the expensive bottles at eye level and the cheaper ones down near the floor. Of course, {{it is not just the}} pharmaceutical industry that plays this trick on consumers. Many identical manufactured goods can be purchased at different prices from different distributors. Have you ever driven past the ‘no-name brand’ biscuit factory or met someone who worked in the ‘black and gold brand’ cannery? Probably not, as these products were more than likely manufactured and packed at the same factory as your favourite brand. For example, some Australians are apparently reluctant to buy a car made in Korea. According to the marketing people a big country like Australia demands a special kind of car. But when Korean car manufacturer Kia was producing the Ford Festiva, many buyers seemed unconcerned, or perhaps unaware. Brand image has even become so central to the strategy of many large companies that they are striving to become ‘virtual’ companies, outsourcing all functions except senior management and the marketing people. This strange notion of ‘essential personnel’ can only succeed if it is perception rather than performance that most determines consumer decision-making. While Shakespeare may have thought that a rose by any other name was still a rose, contemporary management couldn’t disagree more. Anyone, it seems, can provide high-quality service. Anyone, the logic goes, can produce high-quality products. But only a select few can devise the appropriate marketing strategy. That, we are told, is where the real value is created. But as the shutdown of the Pan factory has shown, virtual companies, built on the foundations of brand image and hype, are as ephemeral as the claimed health benefits of some alternative remedies. Now that the major manufacturer on which the brand-focused companies relied is out of the market, the virtual companies are little more than a phone number and a stockpile of worthless product labels. Actual manufacturers, on the other hand, continue to supply goods to the market. They can also take responsibility for the quality of those goods. It might be an old-fashioned idea, but real wealth creation is built on the back of the production of actual goods and services. However, in a rich country such as ours, where people have more money and less time, the big profits come not from production but from persuasion. Companies know that we might whinge about spending an extra cent a litre for petrol but we will happily pay twice as much for brand-name products than we will for no-name ones. Unfortunately for consumers, the lesson from Pan Pharmaceuticals is that you shouldn’t trust a product just because you have seen an advertisement for it. But if that is the case, how should consumers chose between one brand and another? Unfortunately, the only solution is to collect more information yourself rather than relying on that provided in the form of marketing. Information can be obtained from organisations such as the Australian Consumers Association, which publishes regular comparisons of goods in their Choice magazine. Alternatively, for low-priced items which are bought frequently, consumers need to get into the habit of conducting their own regular taste tests. The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be is a loyal customer. Improved shopping habits are a start, but it is also time that the Government tipped the balance back in favour of consumers. We take it for granted that ingredients are included on food packaging, but imagine how much simpler the recall of vitamins would have been if all packaging clearly stated who the manufacturer was. Not the distributor or the bottler, but the factory that manufactured the pills people bought. No doubt most companies considered household names would be reluctant to see manufacturer labelling on our medicines, foods, white goods and electrical equipment. In such an environment consumers could easily tell that goods came from the same factory and would be less willing to ‘pay for the name they can trust’. But opposition from distributors should be seen to be what it really is: evidence that such a reform would be likely to succeed in its objective of increasing consumer awareness, reducing prices, and ensuring that all companies take responsibility for the goods and services they supply to the market.
