He chooses to leave out of loyalty to Bhagavan and heads to Palasa, the village of Sandhya where Sandhya's brother Ashok (Subbaraju) is a valiant and kind-hearted cop. He comes across S. I. Paparayudu (Brahmanandam), and he solves the {{problems}} of the village by cleverly using Paparayudu. Jaidev cannot hide the truth from Sandhya anymore. Jaidev tells Sandhya about his life in Kolkata. Jaidev tells Sandhya that he made it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> Paparayudu solved the problems of village. Since Jaidev told the truth, Sandhya still loves him.|$|E

A hydrophobicity plot lacking any patterns which {{are common to}} possible membrane-spanning domains. The structures of other multimeric membrane proteins (such as diphtheria toxin) provide the answer to how PA manages to span the membrane. It is thought that PA acts like these multimeric membrane proteins that form β-barrels made from stretchs of both polar and non-polar amino acids from each monomer.|$|E

25|$|After {{the test}} subject has seen {{and responded to}} all of the inkblots (free {{association}} phase), the tester then presents them again one at a time in a set sequence for the subject to study: the subject is asked to note where he sees what he originally saw and what makes it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> (inquiry phase). The subject is usually asked to hold the cards and may rotate them. Whether the cards are rotated, and other related factors such as whether permission to rotate them is asked, may expose personality traits and normally contributes to the assessment.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{features}} different {{title music}} from the pilot; this music, composed by Jonathan Wolff, is used {{throughout the rest of}} the series. The standup interstitials for this episode were recorded twice. Originally, the set for the interstitials was brightly lit and was designed to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a church basement, but then it was remade to look like a nightclub and the material was performed again. The scene that was set in the bank was originally set in a dry cleaner's. However, this was moved and some of the material was moved to a later episode called [...] "The Stock Tip".|$|E

500|$|Knowing {{that they}} could not match the quality of other computer-animated films, the film was instead {{designed}} to imitate the look of stop motion. Cory Edwards cited Rankin-Bass as an inspiration and explained, [...] "If we approach our <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> – photographed miniatures in stop-motion – and if that nostalgia resonates with our audience as far as that look, then we're not going to shoot ourselves in the foot trying to put every freckle and hair on photoreal creatures." [...] Edwards contrasted the technically innovative, but critically panned 1986 film Howard the Duck with the simple, but beloved puppet character Kermit the Frog to illustrate to his crew the importance of well-written, likeable characters over technical quality.|$|E
500|$|In 2010 Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} a planned spin-off television series, 2013, {{which would have}} been a sequel to the film. 2012 executive producer Mark Gordon told the magazine, [...] "ABC will have an opening in their disaster-related programming after Lost ends, so people would be interested in this topic on a weekly basis. There's hope for the world despite the magnitude of the 2012 disaster as seen in the film. After the movie, {{there are some people who}} survive, and the question is how will these survivors build a new world and what will it <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> <b>That</b> might make an interesting TV series." [...] However, plans were later canceled for budgetary reasons. It would have been Emmerich's third film to spawn a spin-off; the first was Stargate (followed by Stargate SG-1, Stargate Infinity, Stargate Atlantis, Stargate Universe), and the second was Godzilla (followed by the animated [...] ).|$|E
500|$|... "We {{did a lot}} of work on {{character}} and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," [...] Hui noted. [...] "In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us {{a long time to get}} right." [...] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a Chia Pet. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, a {{research}} {{team led by}} David Burney and Ramilisonina performed interviews in and around Belo sur Mer, including Ambararata and Antsira, to find subfossil megafaunal sites used early in the century by other paleontologists. [...] During carefully controlled interviews, the team recorded stories of recent sightings of dwarf hippos (called kilopilopitsofy) and of a large lemur-like creature known as kidoky; {{a report of the}} interviews was published in 1998 with encouragement from primatologist Alison Jolly and anthropologist Laurie Godfrey. [...] In one interview, an 85-year-old man named Jean Noelson Pascou recounted seeing the rare kidoky up close in 1952. [...] Pascou said that the animal looks similar to a sifaka, but had a human-like face, and was [...] "the size of a seven-year-old girl". It had dark fur and a discernible white spot both on the forehead and below the mouth. [...] According to Pascou, it was a shy animal that fled on the ground instead of in the trees. [...] Burney interpreted the old man as saying that it moved in [...] "a series of leaps", but Godfrey later claimed that [...] "a series of bounds" [...] was a better translation — a description that would closely match the foot anatomy of monkey lemurs, such as Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur. [...] Pascou could also imitate its call, a long single [...] "whoop", and said that kidoky would come closer and continue calling if he imitated the call correctly. [...] The call Pascou imitated was comparable to that of a short call for an indri, which lives {{on the other side of}} Madagascar. [...] When shown a picture of an indri, Pascou said kidoky did not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> and that it had a rounder face, more similar to a sifaka. [...] Pascou also speculated that kidoky could stand on two legs and that it was a solitary animal.|$|E

Smith said that the two first met during the premiere of the film The Ladies Man. He said, [...] "I'm looking at Will and thinking, 'People really think I look like him? I don't fucking <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> He looks {{me up and down}} and says, 'You're very handsome,' and walks away. Totally deadpan. I was like, 'You're funny. You're funny.'" ...|$|E

You'll hear someone make one comment and then they'll show a clip of somebody's face to make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> is their facial reaction to that statement, but really, somebody made that face the day before to something else. It's just piecing things together to make a story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gellius {{says that}} in his day humanitas is {{commonly}} used as a synonym for philanthropyor kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human beings. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean {{what we might call}} [...] "humane" [...] or [...] "polite" [...] learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of humanitas to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to us. He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge as well as a grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of Antoninus Pius (one these reforms, [...] for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). [...] "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of humanitas, Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Christian, the Millennium Falcon set was {{the most}} {{difficult}} to build. Christian wanted the interior of the Falcon to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a submarine. He found scrap airplane metal [...] "that no one wanted in those days and bought them". He began his creation process by breaking down jet engines into scrap pieces, giving him the chance to [...] "stick it in the sets in specific ways". It took him several weeks to finish the chess set (which he described as [...] "the most encrusted set") in the hold of the Falcon. The garbage compactor set [...] "was also pretty hard, because I knew I had actors in there and the walls had to come in, and they had to be in dirty water and I had to get stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt them but also not bobbing around". A total of 30 sets consisting of planets, starships, caves, control rooms, cantinas, and the Death Star corridors were created; all of the nine sound stages at Elstree were used to accommodate them. The massive rebel hangar set was housed at a second sound stage at Shepperton Studios; the stage was the largest in Europe at the time.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{building}} was considered excessively large. The Guardian described it in 1978 as [...] "an awful warning against thinking too big in Britain's cities", and [...] "so castle-like in its outer strength that any passing medieval army would automatically besiege {{it rather than}} shop in it...". The underground railway scheme was abandoned by 1976 and the only deck access was across Corporation Street to another Town &City development in the Shambles. At the official opening, one of its champions, Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw, Mayor of Manchester, commented, [...] "I didn't think it would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> when I saw the balsa wood models". [...] The [...] "unrepentant" [...] architects responded that they had provided {{what they had been}} asked to provide. Kenneth Stone said in 1978 [...] "We're not responsible for everything in there, but we're not sorry about the decisions we took as opposed to those which were forced upon us." [...] The critics' opinion did not mellow with time, and it was described as [...] "aggressive externally" [...] in 1991. The Economist noted in 1996 that it had [...] "long been regarded as one of Europe's ugliest shopping centres.... the epitome of lousy modern architecture... was hated". The Financial Times in 1997 called it [...] "outstandingly ugly" [...] and in 2000 [...] "one of Britain's least-loved buildings".|$|E
