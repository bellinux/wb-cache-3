40|$|Lightsticks are fishing gadgets {{that provide}} {{fluorescent}} lighting when two organic solutions are mixed. In NE Brazil, low-income coastal residents ignore their conventional use and collect lightsticks stranded on beaches. The <b>lightstick</b> solution is then used for various purposes, including direct human skin exposure. We assessed the reactions and possible cell damages {{on the skin}} of Wistar rats. Animals were exposed to <b>lightstick</b> contents, UV radiation and/or seawater. <b>Lightstick</b> exposure led to erythemas, oedemas and vesicles. Histopathologic alterations included proliferation of the epidermis and inflammatory infiltrates. In spite of the short time of experimentation (4 days), the rats exposed to the <b>lightstick</b> content alone and together with UV radiation and/or seawater provided evidence of irritation/alteration reactions that may evolve into skin cancer. Our results demonstrated {{a few of the}} potential problems associated with <b>lightstick</b> dumping into the ocean and highlight the need for further investigations about this new type of marine pollutant...|$|E

A variety of lentic, freshwater habitats in Texas were sampled using six aquatic light traps, each with a different colored cyalume <b>lightstick.</b> Initially, a control trap was used without a <b>lightstick</b> to show that the macroinvertebrates were not attracted to the traps at random, but to the lights inside them. The colors used were red, green, yellow, blue, orange, and white. All tests were initiated 30 minutes after sunset and lasted for four hours. Statistical analyses indicated that eight macroinvertebrate taxa were significantly more attracted to certain wavelengths of light, and that the green and yellow lightsticks attracted more individual macroinvertebrates than the other colors. Tests also were conducted using water samples and organisms from a single site. Water from a pond on the Range Science area of Texas A&M University was used in this second experiment to test in the laboratory, the responses of macroinvertebrates from one location to different wavelengths of light underwater. Ten trials were performed in a man-made tank using the same <b>lightstick</b> colors at the same times as the field experiment. Some of the macroinvertebrate families were significantly not attracted to any light, but some families were attracted to the green and yellow lightsticks more {{than any of the other}} colors. Of the taxa that were attracted to specific wavelengths of light, virtually all were attracted to many wavelengths of light. These taxa were caught in traps with any one of the six colors significantly more times than they were caught in the traps without a <b>lightstick</b> in it. Many different taxa were attracted to red lightsticks much less often than would be expected if the organisms were swimming into the traps at random...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{longline}} fishing {{data were analyzed}} and experiments were conducted with gear equipped with hook timers and timedepth recorders in the Réunion Island fishery (21 ° 5 ʹS lat., 53 ° 28 ʹE long.) to elucidate direct and indirect effects of the lunar cycle and other operational factors that affect catch rates, catch composition, fish behavior, capture time, and fish survival. Logbook data from 1998 through 2000, comprising 2009 sets, indicated that swordfish (Xiphias gladius) catch-per unit of effort (CPUE) increased during {{the first and last}} quarter of the lunar phase, whereas albacore (Thunnus alalunga) CPUE was highest during the full moon. Swordfish were caught rapidly after the longline was set and, like bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), they were caught during days characterized by a weak lunar illumination—mainly during low tide. We found a significant but very low influence of chemical <b>lightsticks</b> on CPUE and catch composition. At the time the longline was retrieved, six of the 11 species in the study had > 40...|$|R
40|$|In the Hawaii-based {{longline}} fishery, {{changes in}} fishing operations to target different species produce {{changes in the}} effectiveness of fishing effort units. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices used in resource monitoring were improved by segregating dissimilar types of fishing effort. Cluster {{analysis was used to}} classify longline sets in relation to species composition of the catches. Based on proportions of eight species and three broader species groups in 46 961 longline sets from 4 years (1991 - 1994) of commercial fishery data, five effort clusters were identified. Spatial distribution of sets and differences in fishing operations among clusters were then compared to reveal apparent differences in fishing strategies. Three clusters comprised N 80 % of the total sets, and the catch compositions suggested targeting for either broadbill swordfish (two clusters) or bigeye tuna. The other two clusters were most similar to the tuna cluster, but their catch compositions indicated a mixed-species fishing strategy. Fishing operations were most different between sets in the tuna and swordfish clusters. Swordfish sets were characterized by (1) the largest vessels, (2) the least number of hooks per set, (3) the greatest number of <b>lightsticks,</b> (4) the longest set duration, (5) the highest percentage of night sets, (6) a larger percentage of sets within the full moon phase, and (7) the lowest percentage of sets within the main Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone. Time series of CPUE for three species (bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and swordfish) based on different clusters were compared, and the most appropriate CPUE time series for resource monitoring are recommended. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.
