50|$|The {{molecules}} of some crystals and ceramics are permanently polarised: {{some parts of}} the molecule are positively charged, while other parts are negatively charged. These materials produce an electric charge when the material changes dimension {{as a result of an}} imposed external force. The charge produced is referred to as piezoelectricity. Many crystalline materials such as the natural crystals of quartz and rochelle salted together with manufactured polycrystalline ceramics such as <b>lead</b> <b>titanate</b> zirconate and barium titanate exhibit piezoelectric effects. Piezoelectric materials are used as buzzers inside pagers, ultrasonic cleaners and mobile phones, and in gas igniters. In addition, these piezoelectric sensors are able to convert pressure, force, vibration or shock into electrical energy. Being capable only of measuring active events, they are also used in flow meters, accelerometers and level detectors, as well as motor vehicles to sense changes in the transmission, fuel injection and coolant pressure. When a voltage or an applied electric field stresses a piezo element electrically, its dimensions change. This phenomenon is known as electrostriction, or the reverse piezoelectric effect. This effect enables the element to act as a translating device called an actuator. Piezoelectric materials are used in power actuators, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, and in acoustic transducers, converting electric fields into sound waves.|$|E
