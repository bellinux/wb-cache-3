5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive. Although critics felt that it lacked a classic single and considered it a minor <b>letdown</b> compared to Body Talk Pt. 1, it received praise for being solid and club-ready. In Sweden, the album {{reached the top of}} the Sverigetopplistan chart. It also reached number one in Denmark and number three in Norway. In the United States, it peaked at number forty-one, becoming Robyn's highest position on the chart.|$|E

25|$|The {{return to}} London in October was a <b>letdown.</b> The grey skies and bad food {{compared}} unfavorably with his recent retreat, {{and he was}} suffering from digestive problems (these recurred throughout much of his later life), though it was also good to be home. But he already had plans to return to Paris.|$|E

25|$|Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao, {{billed as}} The Fight of the Century, or the Battle for Greatness, was a {{professional}} boxing match between undefeated five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. and eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao. It took place on May 2, 2015, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mayweather Jr. won the contest by unanimous decision, with two judges scoring it 116–112 and the other 118–110. Although the fight {{was considered to be}} one of the most anticipated sporting events in history, it was largely considered a <b>letdown</b> by critics and audiences alike upon its broadcast.|$|E
25|$|Former Everton player Howard Kendall {{returned}} to the club as manager for the 1981–82 season, having won promotion from the Third Division with Blackburn Rovers and taken them within a whisker of a second successive promotion. Kendall's reign {{got off to a}} promising start with a 3–1 win over Birmingham City on the opening day of the season, and they finished eighth in the First Division. Their steady progress continued into 1982–83, as they finished seventh and only narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place. The only real <b>letdown</b> that season was a 0–5 home defeat by Liverpool on 6 November 1982.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{exposure}} {{that came from}} A Walk to Remember, Switchfoot attracted attention from multiple record labels, and ultimately signed with Columbia Records/SonyBMG. Their major label debut, The Beautiful <b>Letdown,</b> under Columbia Records/Red Ink, represented the band's evolution from the predominantly lo-fi, indie rock sound of their early albums, toward a more layered, synth-influenced sound that helped launch the band to mainstream popularity. This shift sonically {{could be attributed to}} the fact that the album was the first to include keyboardist Jerome Fontamillas, formerly of industrial bands Mortal and Fold Zandura. Fontamillas had been touring with Switchfoot since 2000, following the release of Learning to Breathe.|$|E

He eventually retired from Competitive Eating due to his family's concerns about its effect on his health.|$|R
5000|$|Despite these <b>letdowns,</b> Acura gained {{prominence}} in the 1990s with a young group of customers: [...] "tuner" [...] enthusiasts.

25|$|The Nuggets duo of Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson got Denver {{off to a}} fast start, winning Game 1 {{and taking}} home-court {{advantage}} away from Tim Duncan and the Spurs. Despite the early <b>letdown,</b> the Spurs showed their championship mettle and bounced back for a 97-88 win in Game 2. In the pivotal Game 3, the Nuggets built an eight-point first-quarter lead before Manu Ginóbili's eight second-quarter points put San Antonio up 43-40 at halftime. A back-and-forth contest turned in the final 2:24 of the third quarter: Michael Finley hit two 3-pointers, and Robert Horry later hit a 3 that gave the Spurs a 75-67 lead {{at the end of}} the quarter. They hung on for a 96-91 win.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically, {{a breast}} pump is {{analogous}} to a milking machine used in commercial dairy production. A misconception is that the breast pump suctions milk out of the breast. A breast pump's job is to trigger the milk ejection response or <b>letdown.</b> Pumps achieve this by using suction to pull the nipple into the tunnel of the breast shield or flange, then release, which counts as one cycle. Thirty to sixty cycles per minute can be expected with better-quality electric breast pumps. The breast pump is not as efficient at removing milk from the breast as most nursing babies. Most manufacturers have multiple sizes of nipple tunnels available. These tunnels {{range in size from}} 24mm to 36mm.|$|E
25|$|Denver started strong {{again in}} Game 4 {{and led by}} eight at halftime. But San Antonio stormed back after Anthony went to the bench {{in the third quarter}} with his fourth foul. The Spurs held a one-point lead with 30 seconds left when Horry, playing for his seventh {{championship}} ring, hit a 3 from the right corner to help seal a 96-89 win. The stunned Nuggets did not recover from the Game 4 <b>letdown.</b> Finley was the hero in Game 5, hitting a team-playoff-record eight threes for 26 points as San Antonio won 93-78 to end the series, marking the Nuggets' fourth straight season where they lost in the first round in five games. This is the second time in three seasons that the Nuggets lost the first-round series to the Spurs, after taking Game 1 in San Antonio (the first also happened in five games).|$|E

5000|$|A Brief History of Amazing <b>Letdowns</b> is a 1994 mini-album by the American indie rock band, Lilys, {{released}} on the SpinART label on 10-inch vinyl and CD. The lead track, [...] "Ginger", {{was used in}} a CK1 commercial. The album was issued in the UK in 1998. The album saw the band make their first major stylistic shift; The early My Bloody Valentine-influenced sound {{had given way to}} what Trouser Press described as [...] "pleasant, straightforward guitar pop".|$|R
50|$|Despite {{achieving}} great {{regular season}} success, {{culminating in the}} 1978-79 campaign in which they finished with {{the best record in}} the NHL, the Islanders suffered a series of <b>letdowns</b> in the playoffs. In both 1976 and 1977, they lost in the semi-finals to the eventual champion Montreal Canadiens, and then suffered an upset loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1978 quarter-finals, on a game-winning goal by Lanny McDonald in overtime of Game 7. Then, in 1979, the rival Rangers defeated Arbour's Islanders in the semi-finals 4-2. Arbour won the Jack Adams Award for the team's stellar regular season.|$|R
25|$|Gibbs' squads {{struggled}} to build success off two moderately successful seasons, 1991 and 1993. In 1991, OU went 9-3, finished the season ranked No. 16 {{in the nation}} by the Associated Press, and soundly defeated Virginia in the Gator Bowl. In the 1992 follow-up campaign, however, OU finished 5-4-2, unranked and did not earn {{an invitation to a}} post-season bowl. Further, OU dropped games to rivals Nebraska and Texas and tied Oklahoma State. The draw with the Cowboys marked the first time since 1976 OU did not beat OSU in the annual Bedlam game. Gibbs' Sooners rebounded with a 9–3 record, a No. 17 finish in the final Associated Press poll and a Sun Bowl victory in 1993. En route, OU beat then-fifth-ranked Texas A, 44–14, and recorded its only victory against Texas under Gibbs. The 1994 season proved to be another <b>letdown,</b> though, as OU finished 6–6. Gibbs announced his resignation prior to OU's losses to Nebraska in the regular-season finale and Brigham Young University in the Copper Bowl. Ultimately, it was his record against Oklahoma's major rivals that did him in. Gibbs went 2–15–1 against Texas, Nebraska and Colorado. In addition to his record, he was thought to be uncomfortable around alumni and the media, and with being a head coach in general. Gibbs' final record as head coach at OU was 44-23-2.|$|E

500|$|Derek Elley of Variety {{said that}} it [...] "is a highly enjoyable, often dazzlingly staged vehicle dragged down by a {{sluggish}} final half-hour".

Usually, the phrase [...] "My momma told me there'd be days like this" [...] {{is something you}} say to make yourself feel better {{at the end of}} a tough day: the implication is that a good day might be just around the corner. The singer, steeling himself against disappointments and <b>letdowns,</b> does not want to feel too good on the good days: 'When all the parts of the puzzle start to seem like they fit / Then I must remember there'll be days like this.'" ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song deal with love and relationships, and the feeling that comes when Cosgrove is kissing her boyfriend. During their review of the single, commonsensemedia stated on the song's lyrics, [...] "Young love can be innocent, sweet, and irrepressible. It can also be {{incredibly}} annoying when taken to a super-sweet extreme. That's where we're at with this single. Lovebirds not jaded by love's <b>letdowns</b> can celebrate the purely poppy sounds and Cosgrove's limitless enthusiasm here. The rest {{of us will be}} left with a headache from constant eye rolling. After one listen you'll forever understand the meaning of 'bubblegum pop.'" ...|$|R

Twenty years after the original release, Retro Gamer wrote that while Killer Instinct was popular in arcades, it had been outdone by Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2 by 1996, and ultimately proved mediocre in comparison.|$|E
500|$|Although the 1984 season had all off {{the makings}} of a memorable one for West Virginia, the Mountaineers {{experienced}} another <b>letdown.</b> [...] WVU started the season with a 7–1 record, posting an upset victory over No. 4 Boston College and its first victory over Penn State in 25 meetings along the way.

The sets and locations give us a proper sense of alien awe," [...] Ebert commented. [...] "Tim Burton made a film that's respectful to the original, and respectable in itself, but that's not enough.

50|$|Overactive {{let-down}} (OALD) is the forceful ejection of {{milk from}} the breast during breastfeeding.
