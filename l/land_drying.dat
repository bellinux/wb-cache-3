40|$|Earth Observation {{from space}} offers the {{opportunity}} to produce time-series of geophysical products {{that can be used}} to assess the state and changes of land surfaces. The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is used to monitor the state and evolution of terrestrial vegetation, and also constitutes a state variable in advanced Earth system models that contain a detailed enough description of the terrestrial biosphere. This present study reports a 12 -year (1998 - 2009) time series of FAPAR derived from the combination of two satellite-based sensors. We find that FAPAR exhibits large-scale inter-annual variations and multi-year trends. The fraction of land grid cells showing positive anomalies, as computed by the deviation from the 12 -year climatology, shows a rapid decrease in the early part of the analysis period (until 2004). Large negative anomalies can be associated with previously reported large-scale climate events, such as global <b>land</b> <b>drying</b> associated with El Ni¿no Southern Oscillation 2000 - 2003, or the European drought of 2003 or recent Australian droughts The present analysis demonstrates that FAPAR is an important global variable suitable for large-scale monitoring of climate impacts on the terrestrial biosphere.

40|$|Bottom sediments can be {{significant}} sinks {{for a variety}} of heavy metals and metalloids coming from various anthropogenic sources. When these sediments are dredged and disposed of to <b>land,</b> <b>drying</b> and oxidation can lead to several changes in their physico-chemical properties, such as redox potential and pH, and hence to changes in metal mobility. Therefore, this work was conducted to study the adsorption-desorption behaviour of one selected heavy metal – copper – in three bottom sediment samples before and after drying. Moreover, possible geochemical associations of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn in the air-dried sediments were studied using a modified BCR sequential extraction protocol. Generally, redox state of the sediments changed from the highly anoxic to oxic and adsorption of Cu 2 + decreased when the originally anoxic sediments were dried. On the other hand, the enhanced release of Cu 2 + was observed from the air-dried sediments. The adsorption-desorption data showed that the changes in metal leachability occurred between originally anoxic and air dried sediments. In terms of water and soil pollution by Cu and likely other heavy metals, it appears that the dredged, air-dried sediments could represent somewhat greater contamination risks when compared with the originally anoxic sediments. Using the sequential extraction data, leaching potential of heavy metals and arsenic in the air-dried sediments was possible to evaluate wit...|$|E

This study documents an attempt to apply a regional evapotranspiration model (SEBAL) and crop information for assessment of regional crop (summer maize and winter wheat) actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in Huang-Huai-Hai (3 H) Plain, China. The average seasonal ETa of summer maize and winter wheat were 354. 8 and 521. 5 mm respectively in 3 H Plain. A high-ETa belt of summer maize occurs in piedmont plain, while a low ETa area {{was found in the}} hill-irrigable <b>land</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> area. For winter wheat, a high-ETa area was located in the middle part of 3 H Plain, including low plain-hydropenia irrigable <b>land</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>land,</b> hill-irrigable <b>land</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>land,</b> and basin-irrigable <b>land</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b> Spatial analysis demonstrated a linear relationship between crop ETa, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A stronger relationship between ETa and NDVI was found in the metaphase and last phase than other crop growing phase, as indicated by higher correlation coefficient values. Additionally, higher correlation coefficients were detected between ETa and LST than that between ETa and NDVI, and this significant relationship ran through the entire crop growing season. ETa in the summer maize growing season showed a significant relationship with longitude, while ETa in the winter wheat growing season showed a significant relationship with latitude.

Based on the total GRDP of agriculture, food crops have the highest value compared to other subsectors. However, {{when compared to other}} sectors, the the total GRDP of the agricultural sector inin East Java is still lower than that of the manufacturing and trade sectors. To increase its contribution,  agricultural sector needs policies, regulations, programs and specific intervention for food crops performance in each district. The objectives of the study were to analyze factors affecting the GRDP of food crops sub-sector in East Java, and to analyze the efficiency level of the food crop sub-sector in the districts/cities in East Java. The research method was the Stochastic Frontier Analysis with Front 4. 1 application. The dependent variable was GRDP of  food crops, and the independent variables consist of irrigated <b>land,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> area, the number of agricultural labors, the number of subsidized fertilizer, the subsidized of two-wheel tractors, and water pump. Based on the survey, the factors that significantly influence the GDP were irrigated <b>land</b> area, <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> area, number of employees, and subsidized two-wheeled tractors. The findings suggested that the area of irrigated <b>land,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land,</b> the number of labor, and the subsidized two-wheel tractor had significant effect towards the GRDP of the food crops sub-sector.
