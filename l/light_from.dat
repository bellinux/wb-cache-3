5|$|Different studies {{generally}} find varying {{values for}} elemental abundances. This is often because spectrographs attached to telescopes do not collect all the <b>light</b> <b>from</b> objects being observed, instead gathering <b>light</b> <b>from</b> a slit or small aperture. Therefore, different observations may sample {{different parts of}} the nebula.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit <b>light</b> <b>from</b> their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the abdomen when flying and a green <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct <b>light</b> <b>from</b> a source (blue lines) and <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The {{result is an}} asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E

5|$|On March 22, 2005, NASA {{released}} {{news that}} infrared <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the planet had been {{measured by the}} Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of <b>light</b> <b>from</b> an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star's constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited {{in front of the}} star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of the <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet's temperature as at least 750°C (1300°F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The cosmic {{abundance}} of vanadium {{in the universe}} is 0.0001%, making the element nearly as common as copper or zinc. Vanadium is detected spectroscopically in <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the Sun and sometimes in the <b>light</b> <b>from</b> other stars.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is {{the general}} appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of <b>light</b> <b>from</b> its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible.|$|E

5|$|As Eddington {{pointed out}} in 1924, densities of this order implied that, {{according}} {{to the theory of}} general relativity, the <b>light</b> <b>from</b> Sirius B should be gravitationally redshifted. This was confirmed when Adams measured this redshift in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is photosensitive, and {{containers}} {{are often}} covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent <b>light</b> <b>from</b> affecting it.

5|$|Masaccio's use {{of light}} was also revolutionary. While earlier artists like Giotto had applied a flat, neutral <b>light</b> <b>from</b> an unidentifiable source, Masaccio's light emanated from a {{specific}} location outside the picture, casting {{the figures in}} light and shadow. This created a chiaroscuro effect, sculpting the bodies into three-dimensional shapes.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the <b>light</b> <b>from</b> a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation that the <b>light</b> <b>from</b> distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E

5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} <b>light,</b> <b>from</b> an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by <b>light</b> <b>from</b> the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
5|$|As the Universe expands, {{more distant}} objects recede from the Earth faster, {{in what is}} called the Hubble Flow. The <b>light</b> <b>from</b> very distant galaxies is {{significantly}} affected by the cosmological redshift. While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.|$|E
