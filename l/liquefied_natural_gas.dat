The cyclone caused extensive damage along the coastline, including {{in the city of}} Sur and the village of Ras al Hadd at the easternmost point of the Omani mainland. In Muscat, winds reached 100km/h (62mph), leaving the capital city without power. Strong waves and heavy rainfall flooded streets and some buildings. Police workers in the city sent text messages to keep people away from flooded streets to prevent electrocutions. Little damage was reported to the oil fields of the nation. The <b>liquefied</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> terminal in Sur, which handles 10million tonnes of gas each year, was badly hit by the storm and could not be operated. Overall, the cyclone killed 50people in the country; by the fourth day after it struck the country, 27 people had been reported missing.

5|$|Sabah {{currently}} receives 5% oil royalty (percentage of {{oil production}} {{paid by the}} mining company to the lease owner) from Petronas over oil explorations in Sabah territorial waters based on the 1974 Petroleum Development Act. Majority of {{the oil and gas}} deposits are located on Sabah Trough basin in the west coast side. Sabah was also given a 10% stake in Petronas <b>liquefied</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (LNG) in Bintulu, Sarawak. Income inequality and the high cost living remain the major economic issues in Sabah. The high cost living has been blamed on the Cabotage Policy, although the cause was due to the smaller trade volumes, cost of transport and efficiency of port to handle trade. The government has set to review the Cabotage Policy even thought the cause was due to other reasons with the World Bank has stated that the result was due to weak distribution channels, high handling charges and inefficient inland transportation. It was finally agreed to exempt the policy from 1 June 2017; with foreign ships will go directly to ports in the East without need to go to West Malaysia although Cabotage Policy on transshipment of goods within Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan remain. Prime Minister Najib also promised to narrow development gap between Sabah and the Peninsular by improving and built more infrastructures in the state. Based on a latest record, the total unemployment in the state have been reduced from 5.1% (2014) to 4.7% (2015), although the number of unemployment was still high. Slum is almost non-existent in Malaysia but due to the high number of refugees arriving from the troubling southern Philippines, Sabah has since saw a significant rise on its numbers. To eliminate water pollution and improve a better hygiene, the Sabah state government are working to relocate them into a better housing settlement. As part of the BIMP-EAGA, Sabah also continued to position itself as a main gateway for regional investments. Foreign investment are mainly concentrated in the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP) areas. Although country such as Japan have mainly focusing their various development and investment projects in the interior and islands since after the end of Second World War. Following America's abandonment in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPPA) economic agreements in early 2017, Sabah began to turns its trade to China and India markets.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{processes}} for <b>liquefying</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in large quantities.

The other method is the Linde process, with a variation of the Linde process, called the Claude process, being sometimes used. In this process, the gas is cooled regeneratively by continually passing it through an orifice until it is cooled to temperatures at which it liquefies. The cooling of gas by expanding it through an orifice was developed by James Joule and William Thomson and is known as the Joule–Thomson effect.

With respect to the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> business, this may have implications for the future development in prices as the effect of increased upstream competition is temporary and likely to weaken a lot sooner than effects from learning and technological change.

50|$|While it is cost {{effective}} to <b>liquefy</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> for storage, transport, and use, roughly 10 to 15 {{percent of the}} gas gets consumed during the process. The optimal process contains four stages of propane refrigeration and two stages of ethylene refrigeration.

Efficiency can be tied to the pure component cascade processes which minimize the overall source to sink temperature difference associated with refrigerant condensing. The optimized process incorporates optimized heat recovery along {{with the use of}} pure refrigerants. All process designers of liquefaction plants using proven technologies face the same challenge: to efficiently cool and condense a mixture with a pure refrigerant. In the optimized Cascade process, the mixture to be cooled and condensed is the feed gas. In the propane mixed refrigerant processes, the two mixtures requiring cooling and condensing are the feed gas and the mixed refrigerant. The chief source of inefficiency lies in the heat exchange train during the liquefaction process.|$|R

30|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{system is}} an {{important}} component of the overall energy system. Primary energy in nature goes through the process of being exploited, transported, refined, stored and distributed, and finally being consumed by the end users. In this process, energy flows from the production side to the consumer side, which also be regarded as a complete energy system. The energy system can be divided into the global energy system, national energy system and urban energy system according to its scope, and can be divided into the petroleum, coal, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> and renewable energy systems according to the types of energy. According to systematic theory, all systems in reality are open and constantly exchange material, energy and information with the external environment, which ensure the systems work stably (Zhao et al. 2001). As a subsystem of the global energy system, China’s <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> supply and demand system is bound to be closely related to other energy systems of different energy types or ranges. International <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> trade is achieved only by pipeline or shipping, but the huge costs of constructing pipelines and <b>liquefying</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> restrict the trade in <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> between different regions, so the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> systems among different regions are relatively isolated. Currently, there are three main <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> markets worldwide. These are the North American market, the European market and the Asia Pacific market according to the development level, and even in the Asia Pacific market China’s <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> development lags behind Japan and South Korea; therefore, in this paper China’s <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> system will be separated from the global energy system to be analyzed separately. In addition, because of the low degree of competition in China’s <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> market and the leading role of the Chinese government in the price of <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> the impact of price on <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> supply and demand is relatively low; thus, the price factor is not taken into account in this paper.|$|R

40|$|The {{global demand}} for <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> is growing as gas is a cleaner partner to {{renewable}} energy than oil and coal. To {{be able to}} exploit remote offshore gas fields Shell is developing a floating facility to produce, treat and <b>liquefy</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> called a Floating Liquid Natural Gas (FLNG) vessel. To make the FLNG vessel a cost effective option for LNG production {{the costs of the}} vessel need to be reduced. This thesis evaluates which changes to the current electrical system on FLNG vessels are able to reduce the total costs of the vessel. For this evaluation a current design of an electrical system for FLNG vessels is used as a template, but reference is also made to all-electric electrical systems that have a larger total load. The possible changes are evaluated in three areas: First an estimate on the cost advantages of implementing each change to the electrical system is made. Besides the equipment and installation costs also the cost impact of the required space and weight of the equipment is taken into account. Secondly the technical operational performance of the system is evaluated using simulations of the electrical system. A final evaluation is made for the impact of the change to system performance factors such as safety, availability, maintenance and efficiency. The analysis shows that a cost reduction of approximately 30 M USD can be achieved by removing large HV transformers from the system, resulting in an electrical system with one voltage level less than the original design. The electrical performance simulations show that a number of additional changes are required to keep the short-circuit current levels of the system within the switchgear ratings. Alternative system designs are proposed for currently typical 130 MW systems and for future all-electric systems with a total load of over 300 MW.

40|$|If two <b>liquefied</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gases</b> (LNG) {{obtained}} {{from two different}} sources are inappropriately fed into a storage tank, lighter LNG may lie over heavier LNG forming a stratification, which could eventually lead to a rollover. Few models available in the literature predict time to rollover in LNG storage tanks. These are semi-empirical in nature as they are based upon empirical correlations to estimate heat and mass transfer coefficients across the stratified layers. We present a lumped parameter model in order to predict time to rollover and to investigate its sensitivity to variation of heat and mass transfer coefficients. The novelty of the present work {{is its ability to}} estimate heat and mass transfer coefficients from the real time data using an inverse methodology. We assimilate the real time LNG level-temperature-density (LTD) data from LNG storage tank in order to estimate heat and mass transfer coefficients from the densities of the stratified layers. The optimized heat and mass transfer coefficients are then used to predict time to rollover. We present a sequence of LTD profiles {{obtained from}} real time LNG terminal and which are leading to rollover in one case study (Section 4. 1). The time to rollover predicted using this inverse methodology is compared with the LTD profiles obtained from real LNG tank and also with time to rollover obtained using empirical correlations. Heat transfer coefficients estimated using empirical correlations are found to be over-estimated for some case studies, which under predict time to rollover. For the real time case study, time to rollover predicted using empirical correlations is under predicted by about 84 %, where as that using the inverse methodology is under predicted by about 20 %.
