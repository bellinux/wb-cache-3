The {{purpose of the present study}} is to compare different methods of <b>lipids</b> <b>extraction</b> and harvesting for freshwater Selenastrum Capricornutum microalgae.

Previously oil extraction, the collected samples were homogenized and their moisture content was analysed obtaining values of 55 - 96 %. Two extraction methods were used: Soxhlet and ultrasound. The use of ultrasound favours cell disruption and increases the extraction yield. In extraction methods, polar, non-polar solvents, and mixes of solvents were used. N-hexane and acetone were used as solvents for Soxhlet extraction, and ethanol, acetone, methanol, chloroform, and a mixture of chloroform and methanol in 1 : 2 and 2 : 1 ratios, for extraction ultrasound assisted method.

50|$|Scenedesmus {{is known}} to have high biomass {{productivity}} among green algae, and has been actively researched for its use for bio-diesel production. Its heterotrophic production of biomass and lipid in optimized conditions is reported to have higher efficiency than its autotrophic production. Optimization of biomass productivity as well as lipid content through varying concentration of supplemental nutrients has been done in numerous studies; currently, Scenedesmus lipid yield after optimization has reached ~60% dry cell weight, lower than some other algae. However, Scenedesmus is more efficient at capturing CO2 than other algae. Like many algae species, Scenedesmus required nitrate-deficient condition to profoundly increase its lipid yield. A significant improvement (up to six-fold) of feedstock yields was achieved by adding varying concentrations of ethanol under a 12-hr photoperiod and in the dark. The most significant improvement in lipid production was obtained when stationary phase cultures were transferred to media deficient in nitrate for 7 days and phosphate for 3 days, respectively. Extraction of oils with methanol or ethanol from the Scenedesmus remains a challenge and its lower lipid content adds to the cost of production. In a recent study, Scenedesmus abundans was isolated from Dal Lake, Kashmir and proved to be a suitable raw material for biodiesel production. The alga increased significantly in biomass and lipid content with the nitrogen concentration of 0.32g/L of nitrogen. A two-step transesterification was found to be best suited for transesterification, while Folch extraction was best for <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Evert Gorter and François Grendel (Dutch physiologists) {{approached}} {{the discovery of}} our present model of the plasma membrane structure as a lipid bi-layer. They simply hypothesized that if the plasma membrane is a bi-layer, then the surface area of the mono-layer of lipids measured would be double the surface area of the plasma membrane. To examine their hypothesis, they performed an experiment in which they extracted lipids from a known number of red blood cells (erythrocytes) of different mammalian sources, such as humans, goats, sheep, etc. and then spreading the lipids as a mono-layer in a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. They measured the total surface area of the plasma membrane of red blood cells, and using Langmuir's method, they measured {{the area of the}} mono-layer of lipids. In comparing the two, they calculated an estimated ratio of 2:1 Mono-layer of lipids:Plasma membrane. This supported their hypothesis, which led to the conclusion that cell membranes are composed of two apposing molecular layers. The two scientists proposed a structure for this bi-layer, with the polar hydrophilic heads facing outwards towards the aqueous environment and the hydrophobic tails facing inwards away from the aqueous surroundings {{on both sides of the}} membrane. Although they arrived at the right conclusions, some of the experimental data were incorrect such as the miscalculation of the area and pressure of the lipid mono-layer and the incompleteness of <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction.</b> They also failed to describe membrane function, and had false assumptions such as that of plasma membranes consisting of mostly lipids. However, on the whole, this envisioning of the lipid bi-layer structure became the basic underlying assumption for each successive refinement in modern understanding of membrane function.|$|E

Infrared spectra revealed the incomplete extraction after all three extraction methods applied to M. circinelloides and it was shown that mechanical disruption using bead beating and HCl treatment were necessary to complete the extraction in this species. FTIR spectroscopy was used to identify components, such as polyphosphates, that may have negatively affected the extraction process and resulted in differences in extraction efficiency between M. circinelloides and M. alpina. Residual lipids could not be detected in the infrared spectra of M. alpina biomass after extraction using the Folch and Lewis methods, indicating their complete <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> in this species. Bligh extraction underestimated the fatty acid content of both M. circinelloides and M. alpina biomass and an increase in the initial solvent-to-sample ratio (from 3 : 1 to 20 : 1) was needed to achieve complete extraction and a lipid-free IR spectrum. In accordance with previous studies, the gravimetric lipid yield was shown to overestimate the potential of the SCO producers and FAME quantification in GC-FID was found to be the best-suited method for lipid quantification.
