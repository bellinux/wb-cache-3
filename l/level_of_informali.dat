In 1993 Greeman organized the ‘Books For Struggle’ drive, collecting 88 cartons of non-Stalinist Left books and periodicals to be shipped to Russia. In 1997, he helped establish the Victor Serge Public Library in Moscow and in 1998 co-founded the Praxis Research and Education Center in Moscow, which promotes anti-totalitarian socialism in the ex-Soviet space. Praxis has published Serge’s works {{for the first time in}} Russian translation as well as books by anarchists like Volin and libertarian Marxists like Maximilian Rubel and Raya Dunayevskaya. Praxis also publishes a newspaper, Free Thought, and holds annual international conferences. These projects are funded in part by the Victor Serge Foundation Inc., a 501(c)(3) US non-profit, established in 1997 by Vlady Kibalchich, Serge’s son, with Greeman as Secretary, to accept tax-free contributions and promote Serge’s writings and philosophy internationally.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} the potential predictive value of cathepsins B, D and K {{in a series}} of 51 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas. While almost always benign, craniopharyngiomas exhibit a high propensity to recur postsurgically and biological markers are therefore needed to predict their recurrence. We have previously demonstrated the potential predictive value of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (Lefranc et al. J. Neurosurg. 2003; 98; 145 - 153). METHODS AND RESULTS: Computer-assisted microscopy was used to determine quantitatively the immunohistochemical <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of the alpha, beta and gamma RAR subtypes and cathepsins B, D and K. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of cathepsin D and of cathepsin B correlated significantly with the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> RARbeta. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of cathepsin K correlated significantly with the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of RARgamma. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas are characterized by low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARbeta and high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARgamma. The tendency to recurrence seems, at least partly, to relate to the fact that (i) craniopharyngiomas with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARbeta express low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cathepsin D, and (ii) craniopharyngiomas with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARgamma express high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cathepsin K.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{study was to examine the}} {{relationship}} between <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias and <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction. Additionally, this study aimed to investigate whether there are gender differences in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction, and whether there are gender differences in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias. There were 35 participants in this study (15 males and 20 females). The Participants were aged between 18 and 29. Each participant was examined on an individual basis throughout the course of one month. Participants were asked to complete an Implicit Associations Test (Weight IAT-bodies) to measure <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias and the Body Image Satisfaction Scale (BISS) to measure <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction. Hypothesis 1 stated that lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction were related to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias against overweight individuals. Hypothesis 1 was not supported as results showed that there was an extremely weak, negative relationship. Hypothesis 2 stated that females score lower on <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction than males. Hypothesis 2 was supported as data from the study showed that females scored lower than males on <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction. Hypothesis 3 stated that females score higher on <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias than males. There was no significant difference found between males and females in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias. However, as hypothesized, females scored higher than males on <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias. It is recommended that future research obtains a larger sample in order to possibly find a significant difference between males and females. These findings also suggest that the relationship between high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias and low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction may only exist among obese individuals. Findings from the current study have implications for knowledge of gender differences in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction. Additionally, findings from the current study contribute towards research into <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias among 18 - 29 year olds and how it can affect <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction.

We further compare the relative importance of two kinds of balancing selection (heterozygote advantage and selection arising from spatial heterogeneity), the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> adaptation and the stability of the resulting polymorphic equilibria. The different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> environmental heterogeneity and gene flow have a large influence on the final <b>level</b> <b>of</b> polymorphism.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between language brokering and its effects on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> stress of the brokers. Specifically, the relationships between language brokering, parentification, stress, and gender were explored. Gender differences in the strength of this relationship were also examined. The following was expected: high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> brokering would correlate positively with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification; high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> brokering would correlate positively with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress; high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification would correlate with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress; and that both brokering and parentification were gender specific, with female subjects reporting higher levels. The participants were 90 Latino undergrad students attending universities in the New York City area. The students completed several self-report measures including a parentification questionnaire, a language-brokering questionnaire, and stress scales. ^ Results showed that high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> language brokering were positively correlated with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification. Although no gender differences were found for <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> language brokering, females reported higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification. Those who reported high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> brokering did not report high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress.

The {{results of the present study}} emphasized the need for understanding the ramifications and long-term consequences of language brokering, particularly for the Latino community. While brokering itself may not lead to a heightened degree of stress, cultural nuances within the Latino community serve to further perpetuate the pressures associated with brokering. As such, once a pattern of brokering has been established and identified, interventions must be developed to decrease the occurrence of long term impairment of individual and family functioning. ...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of Chinese {{commercial}} banks over the period 2003 - 2013, this paper tests the interrelationships between credit risk, competition and cost efficiency in the Chinese banking industry under a three-stage least square estimator. The findings suggest that a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> competition leads to higher credit risk of Chinese commercial banks and a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> efficiency leads to lower credit risk. In addition, {{it is found that}} higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> efficiency results in higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> competition in the Chinese banking industry and higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> credit risk precede an increase in the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> competition. Finally, the results show that Chinese commercial banks with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> credit risk have lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cost efficiency and competition-efficiency hypothesis holds in the Chinese banking industry. The results provide policy implications to the Chinese government and banking regulatory authorities...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} thesis is to test a theory claiming that <b>level</b> <b>of</b> democracy directly influences <b>level</b> <b>of</b> organized crime and then to test a hypothesis claiming that key factor for successful fight against organized crime is presence of principles of good governance. Existence and strength {{of the relation between}} democracy, good governance and organized crime is tested by statistical analysis {{on a wide range of}} states. Results of this analysis are then verified within frame of instrumental case studies of the states with low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> democracy, low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> good governance and high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> organized crime (states of Central Asia) and a state with low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> democracy, high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> good governance and low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> organized crime (Singapore) ...|$|R
40|$|The Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), {{measures}} of career maturity, career decision-making, career goals, and well-being {{were administered to}} 504 high school students. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated bidimensionality rather than unidimensionality for the LOT-R, with the two factors of optimism and pessimism being largely unrelated. Those with high optimism reported high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> career planning and exploration, were more confident about their career decisions, and had more career related goals. Those with high pessimism reported low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> career and decision-making knowledge, were more career indecisive, and reported low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> school achievement. For well-being, those with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> optimism reported high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> self-esteem and low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> psychological distress, whereas those with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pessimism reported low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> self-esteem and more psychological distress.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about using prosody to {{automatically}} detect {{one aspect of}} a speaker’s internal state: their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty. While past work on classifying <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty used the perceived <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty as the value to predict, we find that this quantity often differs from a speaker’s actual <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty as gauged by self-reports. In this work we build models to predict a speaker’s self-reported <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty using prosodic features. Our data is a corpus of single-sentence utterances that are annotated with (1) whether the statement is correct or incorrect, (2) the perceived <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty, and (3) the self-reported <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty. Knowing the self-reported <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty, {{in conjunction with the}} perceived <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty, allows us to assess what we will refer to as the speaker’s transparency. Knowing the self-reported <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty, in conjunction with the correctness of the answer, allows us to assess what we will refer to as self-awareness. Our models, trained on prosodic features, correctly classify the self-reported <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty 75 % of the time. Intelligent systems can use this information to make inferences about the user’s internal state, for example whether the user of a system has a misconception, makes a lucky guess, or needs encouragement. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was to determine whether}} uncontrollable and controllable stressors differentially affected <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> subjective well-being in a group of ethnically diverse urban adolescents. Additionally, the researcher examined what types of coping skills were utilized in the face <b>of</b> high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> uncontrollable stress. Lastly, a moderational model was proposed, wherein active coping was hypothesized to strengthen the inverse relationship between uncontrollable stress and subjective well-being. Results revealed that higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> uncontrollable stress were related to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> negative affect. Additionally, the use of active and adaptive coping strategies was associated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> positive affect and life satisfaction. Adaptive coping was associated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> maladaptive coping. As expected, maladaptive coping was predictive <b>of</b> lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> subjective well-being. Lastly, youth who reported employing higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> active coping appeared to have more stable <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> negative affect than youth who reported employing lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> active coping. These results highlight the importance of tailoring prevention programs to urban youth, who are often faced with notably high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> uncontrollable stress and may need support related to applying coping skills in their lives. Additionally, this research sheds light on the importance of addressing the value of resiliency in urban youth populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the degree of relationship between the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> divorce or separation adjustment of custodial mothers and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> self-concept of randomly selected children in their custody. [...] Twenty-nine pairs of subjects participated in this study. Each pair consisted of a divorced or separated mother and one of the children in her custody, randomly chosen if she had more than one child living with her. Each mother was administered the Fisher Divorce Adjustment Scale (FDAS) and each child was administered the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (CSCS). [...] The results of the FDAS and CSCS were analyzed to answer each research question. The Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient was calculated to determine if a significant correlation existed; (i) between the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> divorce or separation adjustment of mothers and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> self-concept of a randomly chosen child in her custody; (ii) between the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> divorce or separation adjustment of mothers and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> self-concept of a randomly chosen male child in her custody; (iii) between the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> divorce or separation adjustment of mothers and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> self-concept of a randomly chosen female child in her custody.
