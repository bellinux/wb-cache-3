40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to observe select <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibitions</b> in order to {{determine}} if the exhibitions would be able to comply with the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), should it be become a mandatory program. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the livestock identification systems that were in place at the exhibitions to check-in and release the following livestock species: beef cattle, dairy cattle, dairy goats, meat goats, sheep, and swine and (2) to identify additions and/or changes that needed to be made to make the systems NAIS compliant. ^ During a time period spanning from January-November 2008, the researcher travelled to six different <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibitions.</b> The following exhibitions were evaluated: the National Western Stock Show (NWSS) in Denver, Colorado, the North American International Livestock Exposition (NAILE) in Louisville, Kentucky, the Indiana State Fair (ISF) in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Indiana county fairs in Monroe, Putnam, and White counties. Data was collected as the researcher both participated in and observed the check-in and release procedures at the different exhibitions. In order to maintain consistency from exhibition to exhibition, the researcher maintained a standard set of questions and observed similar species of <b>livestock</b> at all <b>exhibitions.</b> In addition, observations were based on a HACCP plan and utilized the same seven objectives. ^ Overall, results from the study indicated that <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibitions,</b> regardless of size, needed to implement several changes in order to become NAIS compliant. The study found that the biggest barrier to NAIS compliance was the differences between the exhibitions. Thus, results would also indicate that the implementation of an online, uniform computer system that can be linked between the exhibitions would be extremely beneficial. The study also found that exhibitions that require a PIN from exhibitors are more ready to become NAIS compliant than those exhibitions that do not require a PIN. Results of the study also indicate that a uniform animal identification system, such as RFID tags, would also increase the readiness of these exhibitions to become NAIS compliant by increasing the ability of the exhibitions to forward certain information to a tracking database within a certain timeframe. ^ It was concluded that in order for <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibitions</b> to become NAIS compliant, similar entry forms, animal identification methods, health requirements, entry and exit points, and the implementation of a release form would be needed. Additional research needs to be done that focuses on different types of <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibitions,</b> such as those in the southern parts of the United States, outside of Indiana, or within organizations such as the National Junior Swine Association. This additional research would ensure a complete evaluation, as this study was confined to the National Western Stock Show, North American International Livestock Exposition, the Indiana State Fair, and county fairs within Indiana. ...|$|R

40|$|Cattle and swine are comingled {{across the}} nation on {{numerous}} occasions when they are exhibited by seedstock producers and junior (4 -H and FFA) exhibitors at state and national shows, {{as well as at}} county fairs. <b>Livestock</b> <b>exhibitions</b> provide an opportunity for animal diseases to spread by convening large numbers of animals from geographically disperse areas, comingling these animals at the exhibition site, and subsequently dispersing them to potentially be comingled with commercial animals making <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibitions</b> a crucial part of livestock traceability. ^ The purpose of this research is to identify the potential for disease spread originating at <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibitions</b> and to identify the economic value of alternative measures to prevent or control a disease outbreak. Specifically, this research addresses the issues in the context of potential spread of foot-and-mouth disease and pseudorabies originating from the Indiana State Fair. The North American Animal Disease Spread Model is utilized to simulate hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease and pseudorabies outbreaks affecting the cattle and swine industries in a three county region in West Central Indiana under alternative policies aimed at containing the disease events. ^ Results indicated that exhibition animals that have been exposed to PRV or FMD at the state fair and return to the home farm would devastate commercial animal agriculture in that region. Resulting disease outbreaks would result in the destruction {{of the majority of the}} animals in the three county area. Additionally, results indicated that changes within a range of traceability levels for small cattle and swine farms resulted in less than a 2 % change in the number of animal destroyed in this region. This is primarily due to the small sample sized used in this research. However, these results suggest that policies which prevent or control the disease outbreak along with improving animal traceability should be implemented. The expected economic benefits of policies analyzed in this research are determined based on a range of probabilities of a disease outbreak occurring. A conservative probability of an outbreak is used to determine the expected economic benefits based on the destruction cost determined when using the North American Animal Disease Spread Model. ...|$|R

40|$|Livestock {{projects}} enable {{youth to}} build valuable life skills while growing their knowledge in a livestock animal species by competing against other livestock exhibitors. Traditionally, livestock projects {{are meant to}} provide youth exhibitors with learning experiences through its competitive nature and through the cooperation with adults. The adults that youth work with in a livestock project could be a parent, show jock, or 4 -H volunteer. While youth-adult interactions in a livestock project are intended to provide positive exhibition experiences for youth, youth-adult interactions can also shape the way youth view competition in their livestock project, and impact the skills that are learned or developed. ^ The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe and explain factors that predict youth livestock exhibitors’ perceptions of life skill development informed by their <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibition</b> experiences, youth-adult interactions regarding livestock knowledge, views of competition, and <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibition</b> motives. The population for this study were junior high and high school students (N= 159) that were enrolled in an agricultural education course and that also exhibited a beef, sheep, swine, or goat project. Quantitative data was collected using the Youth <b>Livestock</b> <b>Exhibition</b> Experiences Survey which included items related to participants’ <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibition</b> experiences, sources of livestock knowledge, views of competition, <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibition</b> motives and life skills. Descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, frequencies, percentages and medians were used to analyze the data.

First, youth livestock exhibitors in this study reported their parent was their main source of livestock knowledge and skills in their livestock project. Second, youth perceived adults modeled highly positive behaviors when working with youth in a livestock project. Third, participants agreed that competition was a driving force behind their motivation to strive for excellence in their livestock project and viewed competition in <b>livestock</b> <b>exhibition</b> to be a positive event. Fourth, youth livestock exhibitors in this study agreed they gained life skills through their engagement in a livestock project.
