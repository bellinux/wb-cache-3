St Gallgo's and St Eugrad's have been in the same parish since at least 1253.|$|E

In that way, Tumnus was the initial inspiration for the entire Narnia series.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2006, <b>Lewis</b> has <b>said</b> that {{he barely}} knew Wilkes {{and that he}} did not {{remember}} seeing him in nearly a decade. But Wilkes says their relationship was closer than that. [...] Ever since they went on a scuba-diving trip together in 1993, he <b>said,</b> <b>Lewis</b> had referred to him as his [...] "diving buddy." [...] They occasionally dined together or met at political functions, Wilkes said. At a Las Vegas fund-raiser in April 2005, Wilkes <b>said,</b> <b>Lewis</b> greeted him as [...] "Brento" [...] and hugged him as Wilkes surprised Lewis with $25,000 in campaign contributions.|$|R

500|$|Lewis {{released}} her third studio album Glassheart on 12 October 2012, {{almost a year}} after the original release date of November 2011. The album had been conceptualised in July 2010, following Lewis' completion of her first tour, The Labyrinth. The album title Glassheart was inspired from a conversation that Lewis had with Ryan Tedder. During the conversation, Tedder asked Lewis about her past experiences with love and life in general. Lewis' response led him to the word [...] "Glassheart." [...] During an interview with Clyde 1 radio, <b>Lewis</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Glassheart represents protecting your heart, yourself and protecting your emotions, its very poignant". On 8 October 2012, a week before the album's UK release, Lewis announced her supporting tour of the same name.

5000|$|The {{historian}} John <b>Lewis</b> Gaddis <b>said</b> {{that the}} 1954 accords [...] "were so hastily drafted and ambiguously worded that, {{from the standpoint}} of international law, it makes little sense to speak of violations from either side." ...|$|R
500|$|The 19th-century writer Samuel <b>Lewis</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} new church was [...] "apparently of {{substantial}} construction, but is much inferior in style to the old building." [...] The historian and clergyman Edmund Tyrrell Green, writing a survey of Anglesey church architecture and contents in 1929, described the church as [...] "hideous", although {{he said that the}} font was [...] "remarkable" [...] for its [...] "very graceful patterns in relief showing influence of Greek classical design." ...|$|E
500|$|Samuel <b>Lewis</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} new church was [...] "a plain {{structure}} in the old English style, with strong buttresses, which have a good effect, being so well suited to the exposed situation of the building." [...] Writing in 1846, the priest and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that the church, [...] "a modern erection of the Pseudo-Norman style", stood in [...] "a highly picturesque situation." [...] He said that the cross at {{the east end of}} the roof came from the old church.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century, {{the writer}} Samuel <b>Lewis</b> <b>said</b> {{that it was}} [...] "small and of rude workmanship", but had [...] "several curious features" [...] such as the font that made it [...] "valuable". The {{antiquarian}} Angharad Llwyd, writing in 1833, described it as [...] "a small cruciform structure, situated in a little barren valley", with the south transept [...] "bearing evidence of very great antiquity." [...] She stated {{that there were some}} windows [...] "in the later English style, of good design, especially the east window of the chancel, which is a very superior composition." ...|$|E

[...] This was denied by <b>Lewis,</b> who <b>said</b> he did not release such a statement. <b>Lewis</b> also <b>said,</b> [...] "I support Carrie's right to express her personal beliefs even if they do not coincide with my own.

50|$|C. S. <b>Lewis</b> is <b>said</b> to {{have spoken}} enthusiastically about William Tyndale's {{rejection}} of the secular/sacred divide. This {{is based on the}} Puritan ideals of leading an ordered and disciplined life that integrates both secular and religious aspects.|$|R

However they did not start {{anything}} again, James said she understood why because of their complicated backstory. However Geoff continued to support Nicole as he realised that [...] "a lot of people she was closest to have deserted her". Nicole's unpredictable behaviour continued thereafter.

500|$|The 19th-century writer Samuel <b>Lewis</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} rebuilt church [...] "forms {{a very good}} {{specimen}} of the early English style of architecture", adding that it was [...] "effective from its simplicity {{and the absence of}} pretension." [...] He added that the interior had been [...] "fitted up in a neat and appropriate manner, and the details throughout appear to have been carefully studied". A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that the [...] "impressive" [...] tower and steeple" [...] form [...] "a landmark visible for many miles." [...] It also comments that rendering on part of the tower and the south wall makes them less attractive than the north wall.|$|E
500|$|After Speaker's death, Cobb said, [...] "Terribly depressed. I {{never let}} him know how much I admired him when we were playing against each other...

[...] Lajoie said, [...] "He {{was one of the}} greatest fellows I ever knew, both as a baseball player and as a gentleman." [...] Former Boston teammate Duffy <b>Lewis</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "He was a team player. As great a hitter as he was, he wasn't looking out for his own average ... Speaker was the bell cow of our outfield. Harry Hooper and I would watch him and know how to play the hitters." ...|$|E
50|$|Some of <b>Lewis's</b> contemporaries <b>said</b> {{the novel}} was too bleak, even humorless, in its {{conveyance}} of ignorant small-town life and people.

500|$|The date of {{construction}} of the first church {{in this area is}} uncertain, although a church was recorded here in 1254 during the Norwich Taxation of churches. The 19th-century writers and antiquarians Angharad Llwyd and Samuel <b>Lewis</b> <b>said</b> that St Ffinan, to whom the church is dedicated, established the first church here towards the beginning of the 7th century, possibly around 620. [...] Llwyd described the old church in 1833 as [...] "a small neat edifice". The current building was designed by the architect John Welch and erected in 1841, with the first service held on 6 July of that year. Welch also designed the church of St Nidan, Llanidan, in the south of Anglesey, which was built between 1839 and 1843.|$|E
500|$|Jorge Gonzalez, {{executive}} director of a veterans resource center near Fort <b>Lewis,</b> <b>said</b> that the Kandahar killings offer more proof that the base is dysfunctional: [...] "This was not a rogue soldier. JBLM is a rogue base, with a severe leadership problem", {{he said in a}} statement. Base officials responded, saying that the crimes committed by its soldiers were isolated events which do not [...] "reflect on the work and dedication of all service members." [...] Robert H. Scales, a retired U.S. Army major general and former commandant of the Army War College, suggested that the major factor in the shootings was the overuse of infantry personnel {{in the last ten years}} for close combat in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Samuel <b>Lewis</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} church, which he {{described}} as [...] "a plain edifice", was [...] "beautifully situated near a small lake, and surrounded with pleasing scenery". The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church on 4 September 1867. [...] He said that the church [...] "has been so completely modernised, that it is doubtful whether any original feature remains but the bell-gable and one single light window in the north wall". He said that the font was of [...] "singular design": [...] "octagonal, swelling downwards and each face concave." [...] He {{also said that the}} site was [...] "wild and striking." [...] A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that it is [...] "a typical, well-preserved rural church and is well worth a visit." ...|$|E
