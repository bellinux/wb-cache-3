5|$|In November 1902 {{the newly}} merged company {{announced}} two bills for the 1903 parliamentary session under the GNP name. The first bill requested minor powers {{which included the}} purchase of additional <b>land</b> <b>for</b> stations, and sought minor amendments to previous Acts.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these three systems, Hurricanes John, Linda, and Ioke all threatened <b>land</b> <b>for</b> a while. John and Ioke had minimal impact on Johnston Atoll and John caused heavy surf in Hawaii. Linda was briefly forecast to approach southern California, and it passed close to Socorro Island near peak intensity.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{differ on}} why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the <b>land</b> <b>for</b> a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not {{economical}} to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed {{what was to become}} of the land.|$|E

5|$|The {{congregation}} leased <b>land</b> <b>for</b> burials in the Chevra Thilim Cemetery on Canal Street, a {{site that}} had been used by Tememe Derech as early as 1860, and which was shared with several other congregations. In the 1930s Beth Israel purchased its own cemetery on Frenchmen Street.|$|E
5|$|The <b>land</b> <b>for</b> {{the fort}} was {{appropriated}} from James Roach, a building contractor in Washington {{who was the}} second-largest landowner in the county, behind only the Lee family. Soldiers tore up land, dug trenches, and used gardens for latrines. Roach's mansion on Prospect Hill was vandalized by Union forces during the construction of Fort Runyon, but survived the war and was demolished in 1965. Other <b>land</b> <b>for</b> Fort Runyon and Fort Jackson came from the demolition of Jackson City, a collection of gambling establishments, saloons, and a racetrack that were located {{at the southern end}} of the Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounding}} area {{was part of}} the manor of Moston, near the now demolished Moston Hall. It was owned by Sir Edward Tootal Broadhurst, a local industrialist, who in 1920 donated 80 acres of the <b>land</b> <b>for</b> use as a park, as a recognition of victory in the First World War.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} after Nelson's death, the state traded <b>land</b> <b>for</b> Nelson's estate, which became part of Jonathan Dickinson State Park. The site {{is now known as}} the Trapper Nelson Zoo Historic District. After the land was {{converted}} to a park, but still unopen to the public, the camp was often vandalized. One of Nelson's tool sheds was burned down; the arsonist attempted to burn other buildings but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|A large {{interchange}} {{near the}} Naval Weapons Station Earle serves Industrial Way West, County Route 547 (Wyckoff Road), New Jersey Route 36, Hope Road, the Garden State Parkway, the Tinton Falls interchange (exit 105), and County Route 38 (Wayside Road). The route continues northwestward into Colts Neck. The freeway continues {{to the northwest}} through wooded <b>land</b> <b>for</b> several miles, crossing over Normandy Road and {{to the south of}} the Pebble Creek Golf Club. Exits along this stretch include New Jersey Route 34, County Route 537 (Colts Neck Road), New Jersey Route 79 (South Main Street), County Route 520, and County Route 3 (Tennent Road), which connects to Freehold Borough and Marlboro.|$|E
5|$|After Mission San Fernando Rey de España was {{established}} in 1797, the administrators there realized they would need more <b>land</b> <b>for</b> agriculture and livestock, and they looked north to the Santa Clarita Valley to establish their estancia, or mission rancho. Subsequently, the Tataviam who had been living there were relocated to the Mission, where they were baptized and put to work. The Estancia de San Francisco Xavier was built in 1804 at the confluence of Castaic Creek and the Santa Clara River.|$|E

5|$|After being {{appointed}} {{governor of}} the newly formed Indiana Territory in 1800, William Henry Harrison sought to secure title to Native American lands to open more <b>land</b> <b>for</b> settlers; in particular, he hoped the Indiana Territory would attract enough settlers to qualify for statehood. Harrison negotiated numerous land cession treaties with American Indians, including the Treaty of Fort Wayne on September 30, 1809, in which Miami, Pottawatomie, Lenape, and other tribal leaders sold 3,000,000acres (approximately 12,000km²) to the United States.|$|E
5|$|After {{settling}} at Glen Noe, {{the chiefs}} {{are said to}} have held the <b>land</b> <b>for</b> centuries. While presumably owning the property outright originally, it is generally agreed that at some, uncertain date, they acquired a feudal obligation to the Campbells of Breadalbane. Initially, this entailed only a symbolic payment. Tradition identifies this as a snowball supplied at midsummer and a white calf surrendered but then killed and shared by landlord and tenant as a token of mutual esteem.|$|E
5|$|After {{the land}} had been surveyed, the first buyer was the Education Board, {{securing}} <b>land</b> <b>for</b> {{a school in}} the market square, and a teacher's house on the adjacent section. Both these buildings were also built in concrete and exist to this day. The school was built to a northern hemisphere design and has windows {{on the south side}} only to stop children from becoming distracted, but the windows are on the wrong side to utilise the sun. Since the school closed in 1938 it has been used for functions and as a hall. The former teacher's house is used as a bach. Both buildings are owned by Ashburton District Council.|$|E

5|$|Agent Orange was to {{a lesser}} extent used outside Vietnam. Land in {{neighbouring}} Laos and Cambodia was also sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War because forests on the border with Vietnam were used by the Vietcong. Some countries, such as Canada, saw testing, while other countries, such as Brazil, used the herbicide to clear out sections of <b>land</b> <b>for</b> agriculture.|$|E
5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by <b>land</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time since the}} Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E
5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of <b>land</b> <b>for</b> crop growth {{has led to a}} significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.|$|E
