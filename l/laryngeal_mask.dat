5|$|Although {{it offers}} the {{greatest}} degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration, tracheal intubation {{is not the only}} means to maintain a patent airway. Alternative techniques for airway management and delivery of oxygen, volatile anesthetics or other breathing gases include the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway, i-gel, cuffed oropharyngeal airway, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP mask), nasal BiPAP mask, simple face mask, and nasal cannula.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway and the Combitube.|$|E

Cricoid force greater than 40 N can compromise airway patency and make tracheal intubation difficult. Cricoid pressure may displace the esophagus, make ventilation with a facemask or with an <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway (LMA) more difficult, interfere with LMA placement and advancement of a tracheal tube and alter laryngeal visualization by a flexible bronchoscope. However, other investigators have found that cricoid pressure does not increase the rate of failed intubation.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Various supraglottic airway {{devices are}} {{routinely}} used to maintain airway patency {{in children and}} adults. However, oropharyngeal airways or <b>laryngeal</b> <b>masks</b> (LM) are not routinely used during neonatal resuscitation. METHODS: The aim {{of this article was}} to review the available literature about the use of supraglottic airway devices during neonatal resuscitation. We reviewed books, resuscitation manuals and articles from 1830 to the present using the search terms "Infant", "Newborn", "Delivery Room", "Resuscitation", "Airway management", "Positive Pressure Respiration", "Oropharyngeal Airway" and "Laryngeal Mask". RESULTS: No study was identified using oropharyngeal airways during neonatal resuscitation. Four trials including 509 infants compared positive pressure ventilation with a LM, bag and mask or an endotracheal tube. Infants in the LM group were intubated less frequently compared to infants in the bag and mask ventilation group 4 / 275 vs. 28 / 234 (OR 0. 13, 95 % CI 0. 05 - 0. 34). Infants resuscitated with the LM had significantly less unsuccessful resuscitations 4 / 275 vs. 31 / 234 (OR 0. 10, 95 % CI 0. 03 - 0. 28). Two trials including 34 preterm infants compared surfactant administration via LM vs. endotracheal tube. LM surfactant administration was safe and no adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety of oropharyngeal airways during neonatal resuscitation remain unclear and randomized trials are required. The current evidence suggests that resuscitation with a LM is a feasible and safe alternative to mask ventilation in infants > 34 weeks gestation and birth weight > 2000 g. However, further randomized control trials are needed to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes following use of <b>laryngeal</b> <b>masks.</b> In addition, surfactant administration via LM should be used only within clinical trials.

25|$|Supraglottic airway — a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any {{airway device}} that is seated above {{and outside the}} trachea, as an {{alternative}} to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia. There are many types of SGAs available including the Esophageal-tracheal Combitube (ETC), Laryngeal tube (LT), and the obsolete Esophageal obturator airway (EOA).|$|E
500|$|Fiberoptic layngoscopes {{have become}} {{increasingly}} available since the 1990s. In contrast to the conventional laryngoscope, these devices allow the laryngoscopist to indirectly view the larynx. This provides a significant advantage in situations where the operator needs to see around an acute bend in order to visualize the glottis, and deal with otherwise difficult intubations. Video laryngoscopes are specialized fiberoptic layngoscopes that use a digital video camera sensor to allow the operator to view the glottis and larynx on a video monitor. Other [...] "noninvasive" [...] devices which can be employed to assist in tracheal intubation are the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway (used as a conduit for endotracheal tube placement) and the Airtraq.|$|E

50|$|Supraglottic {{techniques}} use {{devices that}} are designed to have the distal tip resting above the level of the glottis when in its final seated position. Supraglottic devices ensure patency of the upper respiratory tract without entry into the trachea by bridging the oral and pharyngeal spaces. There are many methods of subcategorizing this family of devices including route of insertion, absence or presence of a cuff, and anatomic location of the device's distal end. The most commonly used devices are <b>laryngeal</b> <b>masks</b> and supraglottic tubes, such as oropharyngeal (OPA) and Nasopharyngeal airways (NPA). In general, features of an ideal supraglottic airway include the ability to bypass the upper airway, produce low airway resistance, allow both positive pressure as well as spontaneous ventilation, protect the respiratory tract from gastric and nasal secretions, be easily inserted by even a nonspecialist, produce high first-time insertion rate, remain in place once in seated position, minimize risk of aspiration, and produce minimal side effects.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) and heart diseases are considered independent {{risk factors for}} mortality and major cardiopulmonary complications after surgery. Coronary artery disease, heart failure and COPD share common risk factors and are often encountered,- isolated or combined-, in many surgical candidates. Perioperative optimization of these high-risk patients deserves {{a thorough understanding of}} the patient cardio{{pulmonary disease}}s as well as the respiratory consequences of surgery and anesthesia. In contrast with cardiac risk stratification where the extent of heart disease largely influences postoperative cardiac outcome, surgical-related factors (ie, upper abdominal and intra-thoracic procedures, duration of anesthesia, presence of a nasogastric tube) largely dominate patient’s comorbidities as risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications. Although most COPD patients tolerate tracheal intubation under “smooth ” anesthetic induction without serious adverse effects, regional anesthetic blockade and application of <b>laryngeal</b> <b>masks</b> or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation should be considered whenever possible, in order to provide optimal pain control and to prevent upper airway injuries as well as lung baro-volotrauma.

2500|$|It {{can be used}} as a {{short-term}} measure, for example during an operation or critical illness (often in the setting of an intensive-care unit). It may be used at home or in a nursing or rehabilitation institution if patients have chronic illnesses that require long-term ventilatory assistance. [...] Due to the anatomy of the human pharynx, larynx, and esophagus and the circumstances for which ventilation is needed, additional measures are often required to secure the airway during positive-pressure ventilation in order to allow unimpeded passage of air into the trachea and avoid air passing into the esophagus and stomach. The common method is by insertion of a tube into the trachea: intubation, which provides a clear route for the air. This can be either an endotracheal tube, inserted through the natural openings of mouth or nose, or a tracheostomy inserted through an artificial opening in the neck. In other circumstances simple airway maneuvres, an oropharyngeal airway or <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway may be employed. If the patient is able to protect his/her own airway and non-invasive ventilation or negative-pressure ventilation is used then an airway adjunct may not be needed.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{cervical}} dystonia {{may cause}} difficulties in airway management. Sakai et al.

40|$|Objective: Few {{studies have}} {{compared}} airway management via <b>laryngeal</b> <b>masks</b> (LM) or <b>laryngeal</b> tubes (LT) {{in patients with}} out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study evaluated whether LT insertion by emergency medical service (EMS) personnel affected ventilation and outcomes in OHCA patients (vs. the standard LM treatment). Methods: This prospective, cluster-randomized, and open-label study evaluated data that were collected by the Sapporo Fire Department between June 2012 and January 2013. We selected the 14 EMS teams that treated {{the greatest number of}} OHCA patients in Sapporo, Japan during 2011, and randomized the teams into Groups A and B. In the first study period (June 2012 to September 2012), Group A treated OHCA patients via LT and Group B treated OHCA patients via LM. In the second period (October 2012 to January 2013), Group A treated OHCA patients via LM and Group B treated OHCA patients via LT. If necessary, both groups were allowed to use an esophageal obturator airway (EOA) kit. The primary endpoints were time from cardiopulmonary resuscitation to device insertion and the rate of successful pre-hospital ventilation. The secondary endpoints were return of spontaneous circulation and survival and favorable neurological outcomes at 1 month after cardiac arrest. Results: LT was used in 148 OHCA patients and LM was used in 165 OHCA patients. Our intention-to-treat analyses revealed no significant differences in the primary and secondary outcomes of the LT- and LM-treated groups. Conclusion: Prehospital advanced airway management via LT provides similar outcomes to those of LM in OHCA patients...|$|R

50|$|On 5 December 1987, Dr Brain {{received}} {{the first case}} of all-factory-made, silicone cuffed, LMA Classic™ <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> distributed by The <b>Laryngeal</b> <b>Mask</b> Company Limited. The LMA ClassicTM was launched in the UK and the British anaesthesia community were quick to realise {{the potential benefits of}} the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask.</b> Within 3 years of launch in the UK, the device had been used in at least 2 million patients and was available in every hospital. By 1992, the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> was approved for sale and being sold in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, India and the United States. The anaesthesia community had been calling for practice guidelines and in 1992 the ASA commissioned a task force to establish practice guidelines for managing difficult airway situations. The ASA algorithm for difficult airways was published in 1993 and stressed an early attempt at insertion of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> if face mask ventilation was not adequate. The <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> revolutionised anaesthetic practice and by 1995 had been used in excess of 100 million patients and was available in more than 80 countries throughout the world. The <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> had now been widely accepted as a form of airway management.|$|E
50|$|The <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway is a {{tube with}} an {{inflatable}} cuff. A <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway can be positioned {{in the lower}} oropharynx to prevent airway obstruction by soft tissues {{and to create a}} safe channel for ventilation. The <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway is the standard rescue ventilation when endotracheal intubation cannot be accomplished. To insert the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway into the patient, the deflated mask should be pressed against the hard palate, rotated past the base of the tongue, and reaching the pharynx. Once the mask has been placed in the correct position, the mask can be inflated. Some benefits of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway include minimization of gastric inflation and protection against regurgitation. A potential problem the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway poses is that over inflation will make the mask more rigid and less able to adapt to the patient’s anatomy, compressing the tongue and causing tongue edema. In that case, the mask pressure should be lowered or a larger mask size should be used. If non-comatose patients are given muscle relaxants before the insertion of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway, they may gag and aspirate when the drugs are worn off. At that point, the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway should be removed immediately to eliminate the gag response and buy time to start at new alternative intubation technique.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first study}} of a <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> in 23 {{patients}} was conducted at London Hospital in 1982. Insertion and ventilation using the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> in 16 anaesthetised, paralysed female patients was successful, achieving a seal greater than 20 cm H2O in all patients. Emergence from anaesthesia was also noted to be uneventful and only 3 patients complained of a sore throat, a marked contrast to endotracheal tube anaesthesia. Following {{the success of the}} initial study, Dr Brain successfully inserted and ventilated 6 anaesthetised, non-paralysed patients. Finding no difference {{between the first and second}} group of patients, Dr Brain realised that muscle relaxtion was not required for insertion. Finally, Dr Brain used the device in a dental extraction patient, he realised that because the space in and around the glottis was filled by the mask, the need for packing was much reduced and more impressively the larynx was completely protected from surgical debris. Brain realised the exciting possibility that the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> could be applied to head and neck surgery [...] and also observed that [...] "In two patients the anatomy was such as to suggest that endotracheal intubation might have presented at least moderate difficulty. Neither presented difficulty with regard to insertion of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> [...] ". By 1985, experience with the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> prototype had reached 4000 cases. Dr Brain published a case series in Anaesthesia in 1985 describing the management of 3 difficult airway patients, illustrating the use of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> for airway rescue. Dr Brain with 5 co-authors published a second paper in anaesthesia describing the use of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> in over 500 patients, adding considerable credence to the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> concept. However the limitation of the prototypes remained, a new material was urgently needed.|$|E

50|$|The best-known {{example is}} the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway or LMA™. A <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway is an airway placed into the mouth and set over the glottis and inflated. Other {{variations}} include devices with oesophageal access ports, so that a separate tube can be inserted from the mouth to the stomach to decompress accumulated gases and drain liquid contents. Some devices can have an endotracheal tube passed through them into the trachea.|$|E
50|$|A <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> has an {{airway tube}} that connects to an {{elliptical}} mask with a cuff. The cuff {{can either be}} of the inflating type (achieved after insertion using a syringe of air), or self-sealing. Once inserted correctly (and the cuff inflated where relevant) the mask conforms to the anatomy with the bowl of the mask facing {{the space between the}} vocal cords. After correct insertion, the tip of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> sits in the throat against the muscular valve that is located at the upper portion of the esophagus.|$|E
50|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that {{insertion}} and use of the standard tracheal tube is easy, providing a clear airway in the majority of cases. Comparative studies indicate that the standard laryngeal tube is generally as effective as the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway, while some studies indicate that the Pro-seal <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> may be more effective than the standard laryngeal tube under controlled ventilation conditions in general anaesthesia.The indications and contraindications for use of the laryngeal tube {{are similar to those of}} the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airway and include the use in general anaesthesia for minor surgical operations. Several studies describe the usefulness of the device in securing a difficult airway, even in cases where insertion of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> had failed. The double-lumen laryngeal tube-Suction II, with the possibility of placing a gastric tube, has been found to have distinct advantages over the standard laryngeal tube and has been recommended as a first-line device to secure the airway in emergency situations when direct laryngoscopy fails in neonates and infants. The laryngeal tube is also recommended for medical personnel not experienced in tracheal intubation, and as a rescue device when intubation has failed in adults. According to the manufacturer the use of Laryngeal tubes is contraindicated in people with an intact gag reflex, known oesophageal disease, and people who have ingested caustic substances.|$|E
50|$|A <b>{{laryngeal}}</b> <b>mask</b> airway — {{also known}} as laryngeal mask— is a medical device that keeps a patient's airway open during anaesthesia or unconsciousness. It {{is a type of}} supraglottic airway.|$|E
50|$|In roughly {{increasing}} {{order of}} invasiveness are {{the use of}} supraglottic devices such as oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> airways; followed by infraglottic techniques such as tracheal intubation and finally surgical methods.|$|E
50|$|Dr Brain made cadaveric plaster casts of {{the space}} around and behind the glottis, a space adapted to the {{acceptance}} of foreign bodies {{in the form of}} food, therefore likely to tolerate an inflated cuff. Dr Brain recognised that if the boat shaped space were to be filled by an expandable cuff, an end to end seal could be formed. Dr Brain experimented with the Goldman Dental nasal mask cuff, if the flanges were drawn together in the midline, they produced a remarkable approximation to the plaster casts. The final step to create the first prototype <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> was to incorporate a tube. Satisfied by the results of inserting the prototype <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> into cadavers, the prototype <b>laryngeal</b> <b>mask</b> was first used in the summer of 1981 in a 40-year-old male patient undergoing an elective inguinal hernia repair. To Dr Brain’s delight, it was possible to ventilate the lungs, indicating not only that the device provided a clear airway, but that it also formed an effective seal with the glottic inlet.|$|E
