30|$|When {{examining}} stability {{with regards}} to pin construct, the study also demonstrated that at both 15 ° and 25 ° of rotation, the configurations including a medial pin were more stable than those without (p <  0.001). In these samples, two lateral and one medial pin was the most stable construct overall, followed by one lateral and one medial pin, three <b>lateral</b> <b>pins,</b> and lastly two <b>lateral</b> <b>pins.</b> This finding was true whether comparing large pin models or small pin models.|$|E
30|$|Arthrograms {{confirmed}} that the medial pin was always extracapsular. However, because of the overlapping capsular anatomy on the lateral condyle, {{it was not always}} possible to determine capsular penetration by <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> on arthrograms.|$|E

[11]. A “gothic arch” was visualised on the obturator oblique image and its centre was the guide for pin insertion whilst the 30 ° internal iliac view was used to guide insertion above the greater sciatic notch. A true lateral image was obtained of the acetabulum and the apex was identified with a 1.6 -mm K-wire.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{outcomes}} of <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> versus cross pinning in pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures. Data Sources: The Cochrane library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, specific orthopaedic journals, abstracts/papers from conferences and meetings, and reference lists of articles were searched from inception to September 2007. Study Selection: All randomized controlled trials and cohort studies comparing outcomes (ie, loss of fixation, iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury, and Flynn criteria) between crossed and <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> were identified. Data Extraction: Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data by using a standardized data extraction form. Data Synthesis: Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Q test. Pooled relative risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Eighteen of 1829 studies were included with 1615 supracondylar fractures (837 and 778 children with cross and <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning,</b> respectively). The average age was 6. 1 ± 0. 9 years. The risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury was 4. 3 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 1 – 9. 1) times higher in cross <b>pinning</b> compared with <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning.</b> There was no significant difference for loss of fixation, late deformity, or Flynn criteria between the two types of <b>pinning.</b> Conclusions: <b>Lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> is preferable to cross pinning for fixation of pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures as a result of decreased risk of ulnar nerve injury...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{commonly}} accepted {{treatment of}} displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children is fracture reduction and percutaneous pin fixation; however, there is controversy about the optimal {{placement of the}} pins. A crossed-pin configuration {{is believed to be}} mechanically more stable than <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> alone; however, the ulnar nerve can be injured {{with the use of a}} medial pin. It has not been proved that the added stability of a medial pin is clinically necessary since, in young children, pin fixation is always augmented with immobilization in a splint or cast. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the results of reduction and Kirschner wire fixation of 345 extension-type supracondylar fractures in children. Maintenance of fracture reduction and evidence of ulnar nerve injury were evaluated in relation to pin configuration and fracture pattern. Of 141 children who had a Gartland type- 2 fracture (a partially intact posterior cortex), seventy-four were treated with <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> only and sixty-seven were treated with crossed pins. Of 204 children who had a Gartland type- 3 (unstable) fracture, fifty-one were treated with lat-eral pins only and 153 were treated with crossed pins. Results: There was no difference with regard to maintenance of fracture reduction, as seen on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, between the crossed pins and the <b>lateral</b> <b>pins.</b> The configuration of the pins did not affect the maintenance of reduction of either the Gartland type- 2 fractures or the Gartland type- 3 fractures.

30|$|The {{treatment}} of displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children by closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation has consistently given satisfactory results [6, 7, 19]. A crossed pin construct {{in the form}} of a lateral and medial pin fixation method as popularized by Swenson [13] has the advantage of better biomechanical stability, although iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury is possible with the medial pin. Conversely, a lateral pinning entry method has the advantage of avoiding ulnar nerve injury, but this construct has been thought to be less stable. Biomechanical studies have shown that a medially and laterally crossed Kirschner wire configuration is 25  % more rigid than three <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> and 37  % stronger than two parallel <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> [11]. Redisplacement of the fracture has been reported to be a significant complication after using lateral Kirschner wires alone [9, 12]. A lateral Kirschner wire configuration may not allow full extension of the elbow, and, thus, prevents examination of the carrying angle during surgery [14].|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} from {{previous}} biomechanical studies that {{the addition of a}} medial pin providing crossed-pin fixation improves the stability of SCH fractures, and that the use of two <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> alone is associated with a higher likelihood of loss of fixation [6, 12, 14]. In line with these findings, our results showed that the two crossed-pin configurations were stronger than the configurations using <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> alone. Furthermore, when comparing the amount of torque required to produce 15 ° and 25 ° of rotation, the crossed-pin configurations using small pins were stronger than both lateral pin configurations using large pins. Although not reaching significance, there was a trend of increasing stability of the lateral pin configurations with increasing pin size. This would suggest that the use of larger (> 1.6  mm) laterally placed pins may reduce the need for a medial pin, which risks injury to the ulnar nerve, and therefore lateral-only pinning improves safety [23, 24]. According to a systematic review by Slobogean et al., there is an iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury for every 28 patients treated with crossed pinning compared with lateral pinning [25]. Current American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guideline recommendations for the treatment of pediatric SCH fractures are for two or three <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> with avoidance of the medial pin [26]. From a clinical standpoint, the surgeon is focused on obtaining a good reduction and stable pin fixation. In most cases in the clinical situation a medial pin is not needed unless the fracture remains unstable following lateral-only pinning.|$|E
30|$|In summary, most {{infections that}} occur after pinning of supracondylar humerus {{fractures}} are superficial {{and can be}} managed with oral antibiotics and local wound care. In rare cases of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis, satisfactory long-term functional outcomes can be expected when treated aggressively with surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics. The parallel <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> configuration may {{increase the risk of}} capsular penetration. Intracapsular pin placement can be avoided by divergent <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> or crossed-pin configuration.|$|R
30|$|In the two <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> model, {{the torque}} {{required}} to produce 15 ° of rotation was 0.50 N m for the small pins and 0.64 N m for the large pins (p =  0.08). Similarly, in the two <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> model at 25 °, torque for the small pins was 0.68 N m compared to 0.91 N m for the large pins (p =  0.07). In the three <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> model at 15 °, torque for the small pins was 0.78 and 0.87 N m for the large pins (p =  0.33). In the three <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> model at 25 °, torque for the small pins was 1.14 and 1.35 N m for the large pins (p =  0.11). In the one lateral and one medial pin model at 15 °, torque for the small pins was 1.14 and 1.47 N m for the large pins (p =  0.01). In the one <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> and one medial pin model at 25 °, torque for the small pins was 1.58 and 2.23 N m for the large pins (p =  0.002). In the two lateral and one medial pin model at 15 °, torque for the small pins was 1.29 and 1.60 N m for the large pins (p =  0.02). Finally, in the two lateral and one medial pin model at 25 °, torque for the small pins was 2.04 and 2.50 N m for the large pins (p =  0.02).|$|R
30|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>pin</b> {{fixation}} offers similar {{functional and}} radiological outcome and almost equal mechanical stability compared with medial–lateral pinning without {{the risk of}} iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury.|$|R
30|$|Of 490 children, 21 (4.3  %) {{developed}} pin tract infection. There were 15 (3.1  %) superficial and six (1.2  %) deep infections (osteomyelitis and septic arthritis). Both DASH and PREE {{scores were}} excellent at {{a mean of}} 18  years post-surgery. The risk of intracapsular pin placement using parallel <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> {{was found to be}} greater (p <  0.05) than either crossed or divergent lateral pinning configurations.|$|E
30|$|The {{advantage}} of medial−lateral entry pin fixation is probably increased biomechanical stability, although iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury {{may result from}} placement of the medial pin [2, 4, 7]. Conversely, the {{advantage of}} lateral entry pin fixation is avoidance of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury, although the construct may be less stable biomechanically [2, 8 – 10]. A few studies reported {{that there is no}} significant advantage of cross pins in comparison to <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> [11, 12].|$|E
30|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} variations of recommended pinning techniques. Swenson [3], Flynn et al. [4], and Nacht et al. [5], using two pins, inserted medially and laterally through the medial and lateral epicondyles. The risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury is always a concern during insertion of the medial pin with a reported incidence of 2 – 8 % [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Arino et al. [11] recommended inserting the two wires through the lateral epicondyles to avoid ulnar nerve injury. Biomechanically, fixation provided by the two <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> is less secure, as it may allow rotation of the fracture, with the medial column rotating posteriorly. It {{was found that the}} torque required to produce 10 ° of rotation is 37 % less with the use of two lateral parallel pins than with the use of medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> [4, 12]. It has been argued that insertion of two lateral cross-pins will provide a biomechanically stable fixation with avoiding the risk of ulnar nerve injury [13]. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the results of percutaneous lateral cross-wiring technique in treatment of unstable or irreducible type II and III supracondylar humeral fractures in children.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Supracondylar {{fracture}} in children {{when it is}} displaced, {{it is very difficult}} to reduce the fracture. That too after reduction, maintaining the reduction is very difficult. While reducing the {{fracture in}} closed reduction with <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> first the result is not predictably good. Cross pinning will be giving mechanically stable fixation than <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> alone. <b>Lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> alone imparts less rotational stability of fracture. Our aim of study is to prevent rotational instability by putting medial pinning first by avoiding the ulnar nerve injury using radiological assistance followed by <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred and six cases of displaced supracondylar fracture were included in study. The mean age of the patient was 7 yrs. (3 - 12 yrs.), the male and female patient ratio was 72 : 34 and left side was involved in 63 patients whereas right side in 43 patients. The most common mode of trauma was fall from height on outstretched hand with elbow in extension. All the 106 patients were consecutively admitted. Patient had extension type of injury with 63 patients had Gartland type III fracture and 43 had Gartland type II fracture. Posteromedial displacement was noted in 63 patients whereas posterolateral displacement noted in 43 patients. In all cases, medial K wire was first inserted after closed reduction, then after stabilising the fractured rotation using image guidance. Lateral K-wire was removed on 3 weeks (21 days) and follow up was done at 6 weeks and 12 weeks when they were evaluated according to Flynn’s criteria. RESULTS Results were graded according to Flynn’s criteria. CONCLUSION Medial K wire technique provides stable fixation and rotational stability has been correlated according to this technique. ...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objectives: Supracondylar {{fracture}} {{is one of}} the commonest {{fractures in}} children. Although the technique of pinning is controversial, percutaneous medio-lateral entry pinning is theoretically considered more stable biomechanical construct. The drawback of this method is injury to ulnar nerve which is not encountered in only <b>lateral</b> entry <b>pinning.</b> Materials & Methods: This was a prospective, comparative and observational study done in 60 patients which was alternately divided into two groups. The first group (A) underwent medio-lateral entry pinning and the second group (B) underwent <b>lateral</b> entry <b>pinning.</b> They were followed for 24 weeks and the outcome was assessed using Flynn’s criteria. Results: At twenty-four weeks, the mean loss of range of motion of elbow in medio-lateral pinning group was 3. 70 degrees (SD± 1. 93) and that in <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> group was 4. 23 degrees (SD ± 1. 38). The mean loss in carrying angle at twenty-four weeks in medio-lateral group was 2. 93 degrees (SD± 2. 19) and that in lateral group was 4. 17 (SD± 2. 24). There were 2 (6. 67 %) cases of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury in medio-lateral pinning group. Out of thirty patients, in medio-lateral pinning group, 25 had excellent results, 5 had good results and none had fair or poor results. While out of 30 patients in <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> group, 23 had excellent results, 7 had good results and none had fair or poor results. Conclusion: There is no significant difference in outcome in terms of loss of carrying angle and range of motion between the medio-lateral pinning group and the <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> group at the end of 6 months.

30|$|Over a 19 -year period (1983 – 2002), we {{identified}} 21 of 490 children (4.3  %) who developed pin tract infection after closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation for displaced supracondylar humerus fracture at our institution. The {{mean age of}} these 21 children {{at the time of}} the injury was 5.0  ±  2.7  years (range 1 – 11  years). Thirteen were male and eight were female. Eleven cases involved the left side and ten the right. According to Wilkins' modification of the Gartland classification, 8 were type II and 13 were type III fractures [19]. Pin configuration consisted of parallel <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> in 12 patients, divergent <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> in 3, crossed pins in 4, and two lateral and one medial pin in 2 patients. The pin configuration was based on surgeon preference. We did not study the pin configuration in the remaining 469 children who did not develop pin tract infection. Preoperative antibiotics were not administered in 9 of 19 patients (47  %); data were missing in two patients. The average duration between arrival in the emergency department and time of surgery was 34.3  ±  76.5  h (range 1  h– 14  days). Excluding one patient for whom an accurate time could not be assessed and three patients who underwent surgery due to loss of reduction 3, 5, and 14  days after initial closed reduction and cast application, the mean surgical delay was 9.3  ±  7.4  h (range 1 – 23  h).|$|E
30|$|According {{to earlier}} studies, the {{advantage}} of medial–lateral entry pin fixation is increased biomechanical stability [7, 15], although iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury may result from placement of the medial pin [4]. Conversely, {{the advantage of}} lateral entry pin fixation is avoidance of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury, although the construct may be less stable biomechanically [10, 11, 16, 17] and failure to provide torsional stability, for which some have suggested adding a third medial pin [11, 18]. A biomechanical study by Zionts et al. [7] demonstrated that crossed pinning is more stable than lateral pinning in rotational testing as well as varus and valgus loading. However, a study by Skaggs et al. [10] demonstrated no clinical difference in stability between crossed and <b>lateral</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|E
30|$|The optimal pin {{configuration}} {{is a subject}} of considerable debate in relation to ulnar nerve injury and biomechanical principles [3]. Randomized clinical trials have shown that lateral-entry pin fixation and crossed-{{pin configuration}} are equally effective {{in the treatment of}} displaced supracondylar fractures [21, 22]. However, the risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury following percutaneous fixation using a crossed-pin technique has been well documented [8, 9, 10]. Many authors have concluded that fixation with <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> is a safer and more effective method for displaced supracondylar fractures in children [11, 23, 24, 25]. Studies have also demonstrated that the site of pin insertion is less important for fracture stability than the site at which the pins cross the fracture [5, 26, 27]. Kallio et al. [28], who focused on optimal lateral pin placement technique, recommended divergent pin placement for maximum stability and avoidance of joint penetration. In a biomechanical comparison of all three configurations, Lee et al. [29] reported that divergent lateral pin configuration provided greater stability than parallel pin configuration, and demonstrated similar stability compared with crossed-pin configuration. This was confirmed by another biomechanical study showing that the best torsional, valgus, and extension resistance are associated with the most divergent configuration of the <b>lateral</b> <b>pins,</b> in which the diverging pin crosses the fracture site at the medial edge of the coronoid fossa [30]. Based on the results of our cadaveric study, parallel lateral pin configuration may increase the risk of intracapsular pin placement compared to divergent lateral pin configuration. Thus, of the three configurations, divergent lateral pin placement is most desirable, since it has less potential for nerve injury, ensures optimal fracture stability, and in addition reduces the risk of intracapsular pin placement.|$|E
30|$|The {{management}} of displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus with closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation {{is the most}} widely accepted method of treatment, but controversy continues regarding the pin fixation techniques. A prospective randomized controlled study was undertaken to compare the stability, functional outcome and iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury between <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> fixation and medial–lateral pin fixation.|$|R
30|$|We {{found no}} {{significant}} correlation between the time to surgery and complications, operative time, or need for open reduction. These findings support the trend of treating Gartland type III supracondylar humerus fractures in a less urgent manner. In addition, our study supports the concept that cross pinning leads to more complications than <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning,</b> including an 8 -fold increase in iatrogenic nerve injury.|$|R
30|$|This {{study does}} have certain limitations. Since it {{involved}} procedures performed {{over the period}} 1983 – 2002, the standard of treatment and approach to treating these fractures, {{including the use of}} preoperative antibiotics, varied among studied cases. Due to the retrospective study method employed, we had to rely on medical records, which were not always complete. Many patients who were contacted by phone had moved, and radiological or clinical follow-up was not feasible. Because of the difficulty in procuring pediatric cadaveric elbows, the cadaveric study was performed on adult elbows. Thus, absolute measurements would differ in pediatric patients. Still, it is reasonable to accept that divergent <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> is safer than parallel <b>lateral</b> <b>pinning</b> for avoiding intra-articular placement of pins. The association between intracapsular pin placement and deep infection cannot be established from the current study. Similarly, the association of other risk factors such as preoperative antibiotics, time to surgery, and host-related factors with pin tract infection could not be established from our results.|$|R
30|$|Each sawbone humerus (Sawbones # 1052, {{pediatric}} humerus 26  cm, Pacific Research, Vashon Is., WA, USA) was osteotomized transversely at the mid-olecranon fossa with a 2 -mm oscillating saw {{to simulate}} a Gartland type III fracture. The osteotomy was then reduced and stabilized with pins using a hand-held power wire driver. Four pin configurations were compared: two lateral, three lateral, one lateral and one medial, and two lateral and one medial pins. We compared 1.25 - and 1.6 -mm smooth stainless steel pins {{for each group}} (Synthes, Paoili, PA, USA). A total of eight test groups was therefore included. Ten humeri were tested in each configuration, making a total of 80 humeri. Bi-cortical fixation of both fragments was achieved with each pin, and <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> were placed in divergent fashion.|$|E
40|$|Pediatric elbow {{fractures}} can {{be challenging}} to manage. Compression of the medial column in Gartland Type I and Type II supracondylar fractures must be reduced to prevent varus deformity. Gartland Type III fractures may be stabilized with two <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> or a medial lateral cross-pin technique. Non-displaced lateral condyle fractures require vigilant follow-up. Open reduction of displaced lateral condyle fractures should avoid posterior dissection. T-condylar fractures in children rarely have the articular comminution found in adults. Monteggia fractures in children can be managed well if recognized and treated promptly. Restoration of the ulnar length often reduces the radial head. Angulated proximal radius fractures need to be reduced in order to restore the ability to supinate and pronate. It {{is important to recognize}} and understand the diagnostic features of each type of fracture {{in order to determine the}} best course of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background: Displaced supracondylar {{fractures}} {{are notorious}} for difficulty in reduction, maintenance of reduction and frequent involvement of neurovascular structures. No general agreement on the treatment is evident with controversy prevailing regarding the ideal timing of surgery, method of maintenance of reduction and configuration of the pin fixation. A crossed pin configuration, though believed {{by some to be}} mechanically more stable than the <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> alone, has the risk of ulnar nerve injury due to the medial pin. <b>Lateral</b> <b>pins</b> alone impart less rotational stability to the fracture although it has been attributed mainly to technical errors of pin placement. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy of treatment of this fracture using one lateral and one trans-olecranon K-wires or lateral entry K-wires alone. Materials and Methods: Ninety cases of displaced supracondylar humerus fractures were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 6. 7 years (range 3 – 12 years). The male/female ratio was 5 : 1 and left side was involved in 70 % whereas 30 % had right sided injuries. The most common mode of trauma was fall from height with elbow in extension. All the 90 consecutively admitted patients had extension type injury with 73. 3 % fractures being Gartland type III and 26. 7 % were type II. Posteromedial displacement was noted in 70 % whereas 30 % fractures were posterolaterally displaced. In 60 cases, lateral entry wires alone were used whereas, in 30 cases, one lateral and another transolecranon transarticular K-wire was used. K-wires were removed at 3 weeks postoperatively and followup was done at 6 weeks and 12 weeks when they were evaluated according to the criteria described by Flynn. Chi-square test was used as a statistical test of significance to compare results among different variables. Results: Results were graded according to Flynn's criteria. Excellent results were achieved in 12 (13. 3 %), good in 54 (60 %), fair in 15 (16. 7 %) while in nine patients (10 %) poor results were obtained. Conclusions: Both lateral entry K-wires and lateral-trans-olecranon wire techniques provide stable fixation when observing the guidelines for wire placement and consistently satisfactory results can be obtained, both cosmetically and functionally with both the techniques...|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{treating}} Gartland type III supracondylar humerus {{fractures in}} a non-urgent fashion {{did not increase}} the risk of complications or conversion to open reduction in our study population.

30|$|Most infections after pinning of supracondylar humerus {{fractures}} are superficial and can {{be managed}} with pin removal, oral antibiotics, and local wound care. Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis are rare complications; when they do occur, {{they seem to be}} associated with parallel <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> configuration, though a causal relationship could not be established from the current study. Satisfactory long-term outcomes of these deep infections can be expected when treated aggressively with surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics.|$|R
30|$|Infection after {{percutaneous}} pinning of supracondylar fractures is a not {{an uncommon}} event, {{as evidenced by}} our study. Our overall incidence of 4.3  % is slightly higher compared to other reports in the literature, {{which may have been}} due to bundling of pin tract irritation, hypergranulation tissue, and pin loosening/migration in the pin tract infection group. Most of these infections were superficial and were treated with oral antibiotics and wound care. However, the procedure is not completely benign, as evident in six of our patients who developed deep infections requiring surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics. The recognition and prompt treatment of pin tract infection is of utmost importance. Despite the infections, patients reported excellent functional results at skeletal maturity at a mean 18  years after the index procedure. Five of six (83  %) patients with deep infection had parallel <b>lateral</b> <b>pins.</b> However, two deep infections presented late, and one was lost to follow-up. Also, we did not study pin configuration in the remaining 469 children who did not develop infection, and thus cannot establish a causal relationship between infection and parallel pinning.|$|E
30|$|The {{principles}} of biomechanical stability of external fixation {{would indicate that}} pin diameter, number and spread combined with pin clamp and clamp–bar interfaces {{need to be addressed}} individually and together in order to achieve a maximally performing construct in the clinical setting. In the standard cantilever-loaded mode, the monolateral fixator is at risk of pin loosening and breakage. During failure the distractive force is lost and the desired biological effect reduced. Modifications of this frame have been developed to counter this problem by which fixation is supplemented by additional <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> or by extending the fixation to the iliac crest [14]. In this study {{we have been able to}} show that it is possible to introduce three 6 -mm pins into the peri-acetabular region with an angular separation of 55 °. Studies by Johnson and Fischer [20] showed that as angular separation increases from 0 ° to 90 °, the bending stiffness also increases. The increased insertion angle of the post capital pin reduces the risk of sciatic nerve damage and improves the stability of fixation by increasing the angular separation between pins.|$|E
30|$|The average {{loss of the}} {{carrying}} angle, Baumann angle, M–D angle and range of motion in the lateral pinning cases in our study {{may be related to}} a comparatively less stable construct with two <b>lateral</b> <b>pins</b> compared to crossed medial–lateral pins. According to the classification by Gordon et al. [5], the mild loss of reduction in two cases of lateral entry group in our study suggest that lateral entry is biomechanically weaker. Although radiological and clinical union occurred in a similar time period without any residual deformity, the loss of both the range of motion and {{the carrying}} angle was greater in these two patients, compared to those without loss of reduction. In a recent analysis of the two techniques by Lee et al. [19], the loss of reduction in the lateral entry group was 0 – 11.8  %. An older study by Kallio et al. found a reduction of 14  % [12], a study by Davis et al. found 29  % [20], while a study by Skaggs et al. found 0  % [10]. The risk of loss of reduction after lateral entry pin fixation can be minimized by following proper pin placement technique, with divergent pins, pins that engage the lateral and central columns, and the use of a third lateral pin if needed.|$|E
40|$|Immobilization in cast {{has been}} {{standard}} treatment for un displaced supracondylar fracture of humerus. Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning {{provides the best}} cosmetic and functional results. The fracture can be fixed with pinning in any desired position. Use of medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> fixation provides more s tability. The pins must continue into the opposite cortex to provide good fixation.

30|$|Supracondylar humerus {{fractures}} constitute 60 – 65  % {{of all the}} fractures {{around the}} elbow joint, with a peak incidence between 4 and 7  years of age in children [1]. The main complications associated with supracondylar fractures are malunion, ischemic contracture and neurovascular damage [2, 3]. Of the methods described {{for the treatment of}} displaced extension-type supracondylar humeral fractures, closed reduction with percutaneous pin stabilization is the current preferred method of treatment [1]. However, controversy persists between lateral or crossed medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>pin</b> fixation techniques [4].|$|R
