5|$|French {{settlers}} {{began to}} arrive from settlements {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi in 1764 due to fears of British control, given the transfer of eastern land to Great Britain after the Treaty of Paris. The local French lieutenant governor moved to St. Louis in 1765 and began awarding land grants. As part of the peace negotiations to end the Seven Years' War, Spain gained control of Louisiana according to the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1762. Due to travel times and the Louisiana Rebellion of 1768, the Spanish took official control in St. Louis only in May 1770. After the transfer, the Spanish confirmed French land grants, and Spanish soldiers provided <b>local</b> <b>security.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 2006, 2,000 ADF {{personnel}} were again deployed to East Timor {{as part of}} Operation Astute, following unrest between elements of the Timor Leste Defence Force. Australian forces {{were involved in a}} number skirmishes during this time, including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by Alfredo Reinado at Same on 4 March 2007. However, by early-2010 the security situation had been stabilised and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the <b>local</b> <b>security</b> forces as part of a small international force. Following a drawdown, the International Stabilisation Force commenced withdrawing from Timor-Leste in November 2012, a process which was completed in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|Kagame first {{provided}} {{troops and}} military training to aid a rebellion against Zaire by the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi group living near Bukavu in the Zairian South Kivu province. With Rwandan army support, the Banyamulenge defeated <b>local</b> <b>security</b> forces and began attacking the Hutu {{refugee camps in}} the area. At the same time, Kagame's forces joined with Zairian Tutsi around Goma to attack two of the camps there. Most refugees from the attacked camps moved to the large Mugunga camp. In November 1996 the Rwandan army attacked Mugunga, causing an estimated 800,000 refugees to flee. Many returned to Rwanda {{despite the presence of}} the RPF; others ventured further west into Zaire.|$|E

5|$|Aqil {{secured a}} durable {{alliance}} with the Beni Sakhr, consecrated through his marriage to a woman from the tribe. From Transjordan, he and his band of irregulars raided areas {{on both sides of}} the Jordan River until he was invited back to the Galilee by Acre's kaimakam in 1847. The latter had sought to neutralize Aqil and his allies' marauding activities, and thus pardoned Aqil. He was also given command of 75 bashi-bazouk in Lower Galilee. Thereafter, he was commissioned with overseeing that region's security. In particular, the successive governors of Acre entrusted him with protecting the Galilee's trade routes and maintaining general security in the area, which he did successfully. With time, he became an unofficial mutasallim (tax collector) for much of northern Palestine, including the Jezreel Valley, Safad, Tiberias and Nazareth. The tax he collected was not on behalf of the authorities, but rather a tribute payment (khuwwa) to receive his protection. While this unofficial system proved successful in guaranteeing <b>local</b> <b>security,</b> later historians criticized it as akin to a protection racket.|$|E
5|$|By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes {{had begun}} invading Italy {{from the north}} as their culture {{expanded}} throughout Europe. Most of this was unknown to the Romans at this time, who still had purely <b>local</b> <b>security</b> concerns, but the Romans were alerted when a particularly warlike tribe, the Senones, invaded the Etruscan province of Siena {{from the north and}} attacked the town of Clusium, not far from Rome's sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed {{by the size of the}} enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. Perhaps unintentionally the Romans found themselves not just in conflict with the Senones, but their primary target. The Romans met them in pitched battle at the Battle of the Allia around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, under their chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town before being either driven off or bought off.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I {{were all}} volunteers. Particularly during the war's early stages, not all male {{settlers}} of fighting age {{were expected to}} abandon their civilian lives for service abroad. Many {{of them were in}} vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone. Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to <b>local</b> <b>security</b> by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told readers that men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that conscription might be required if not enough joined up.|$|E
5|$|The first {{blood was}} shed deep in Malaysian territory, with the Indonesian-staged Brunei Revolt on 8 December 1962. This operation, {{with the goal}} of seizing the oilfields as well as European hostages, was swiftly crushed by British forces that flew in from Singapore. The {{conflict}} proper, however, began in April of the following year, as 'volunteer' Indonesian forces made occasional raids across the Sarawak border. These raids were small, generally composed of groups smaller than platoon size, and their damage was minimised with relative ease by <b>local</b> <b>security</b> forces. The turning point came on 16 September, when the Malaysian Federation was formally created. In Indonesia, the response to the frustration of their plans to prevent the Federation's birth was serious and violent. A mob converged upon the British embassy in Jakarta, smashing windows and doors in protest. Sukarno authorised stronger raids by Indonesian regular forces, and even launched seaborne attacks into peninsular Malaysia. The raiding would continue {{for the duration of the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{withdrawal}} of Israeli forces, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser issued several reforms in Gaza, including the expansion of educational opportunities and civil services, provision of housing {{and the establishment of}} <b>local</b> <b>security</b> forces. As in Egypt, political activity in Gaza was severely curtailed, but the government-sponsored Arab National Union was established in place of the All-Palestine Government that Nasser abolished in 1959, which gave the city's citizens a greater voice in national politics. In 1959, with the abolishment of the All-Palestine Government, Gaza had officially {{become a part of the}} United Arab Republic, a union of Syria and Egypt, under the pan-Arab policy of Nasser. In reality however, Gaza turned to be under direct Egyptian military governorship, which also continued upon {{the withdrawal}} of Syria from the UAR shortly afterwards. When the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded in 1964, Nasser formally, but not practically, proclaimed that it would hold authority over Gaza, and a year later, conscription was instituted for the Palestinian Liberation Army.|$|E

5|$|While {{leading the}} Allied Forces during World War I, the British won {{control of the}} city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was {{included}} in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction. In the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned {{to be part of}} an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees fleeing nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing <b>local</b> <b>security</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to bolster the {{strength}} of White's 11th MSF Company, Shungel sent a mortar platoon of about 35 Montagnard CIDG out from Khâm Đức to reinforce the small garrison at Ngok Tavak during {{the last days of}} April. It was intended that the Montagnards would provide <b>local</b> <b>security</b> for the garrison, when the 11th MSF Company was out on patrol. Mistrust developed between White's men and the Montagnard soldiers, because the latter was known to contain VC infiltrators. On 28 April, elements of the PAVN 2nd Division received a message which stated that 'scouts' were ready to cause confusion and disruption in the allies' defensive plan around Khâm Đức. The Montagnards were placed outside the camp's perimeter, where they roamed freely inside the Marines' area during the days before and after the arrival of the howitzers. On 9 May, the Montagnards decided to return to Khâm Đức, but shortly afterwards they turned back to Ngok Tavak, claiming they had been ambushed by an unknown enemy unit. White and his Nung soldiers were skeptical about the claim, as they believed the story about an ambush was a lie and that no real fighting had occurred. As a result, White insisted that the Montagnards stay outside his perimeter.|$|E
