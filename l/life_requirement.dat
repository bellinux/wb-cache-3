40|$|Energy {{efficient}} dynamic clustering {{offers a}} flexible paradigm to reconfigure the network {{in order to}} maximise network’s life-time in resource constrained ad hoc sensor networks. The load profiles of parent nodes (PNs) {{can be used to}} define its current state as well as to predict potential failures caused by energy loss due to high loads on particular PNs. This paper proposes a novel dynamic clustering algorithm for load balanced routing based upon route efficiency. The algorithm exploits the pattern and load of traffic and energy dissipation rate of each node on the route to calculate the node and route efficiencies. The proposed algorithm maintains PNs in a state whereby the network <b>life</b> <b>requirement</b> is met by the PNs comprising the backbone of the network.
