This differential heating produces a strong pressure gradient which drives southwest monsoon winds during June, July, and August. Satellite and meteorological observations, aerosol measurements, sediment trap studies, and mineralogical studies indicate an atmospheric mode of transport for modern <b>lithogenic</b> sediments in the northwest Arabian Sea. Analyses of <b>lithogenic</b> grain size and mass accumulation rate (MAR) records from the Owen Ridge indicate that eolian transport has been the primary mode of transport for the past 370 kyr. Visual inspection shows that the MAR record is positively correlated with global ice volume {{as indicated by the}} marine delta 18 O record. In contrast, the grain-size record varies at a much higher frequency, showing little correlation to either the MAR or the delta 18 O records. Spectral analyses confirm these relationships, indicating that the <b>lithogenic</b> grain-size and MAR records are coherent only over the precession band whereby the grain size leads the MAR by 124 ° (~ 8 kyr). We conclude that an eolian transport mechanism is the only mechanism that allows for this phase difference {{and at the same time}} is supported by comparison of the grain size and MAR with independent eolian records. We use <b>lithogenic</b> grain size as a paleoclimatic indicator of summer monsoon wind strength and <b>lithogenic</b> MAR as a paleoclimatic indicator of source-area aridity. These interpretations are supported by comparison of the <b>lithogenic</b> records to independent indicators of wind strength (Globigerina bulloides upwelling record) and aridity (a loess record from central China). Such comparisons indicate high coherence and zero phase relationships. Our work supports the findings of previous studies which have documented the link between monsoon strength and the Earth's axial precession cycles. Both the <b>lithogenic</b> MAR and the grain-size records have high coherency with precessional insolation. Maximum <b>lithogenic</b> MAR (source-area aridity) is in phase with delta 18 O (global ice volume) and leads maximum precessional insolation by 88 ° (~ 6 kyr). We attribute this lead to the influence of glacial conditions on the aridity, and therefore the deflation potential, of the source areas. Maximum <b>lithogenic</b> grain size (summer monsoon wind strength) lags maximum precession by 148 ° (~ 9 kyr).

Here we investigate the provenance of size-selected dust deposited on sea ice in McMurdo Sound, south-western (SW) Ross Sea. The isotopic signature of McMurdo Sound dust (0. 70533 < 87 Sr/ 86 Sr< 0. 70915 and - 1. 1 < εNd(0) < 3. 45) confirms that dust is locally sourced from the McMurdo Sound debris bands and comprises a two-component mixture of McMurdo Volcanic Group and southern Victoria Land lithologies.

The <b>lithogenic</b> MAR has strong 100, 41, and 23 k. y. cyclicities and is forced primarily by changes in source-area aridity associated with glacial-interglacial cycles. The <b>lithogenic</b> grain size, on the other hand, exhibits higher frequency variability (23 k. y.) and is forced by the strength of summer monsoon winds which, in turn, are forced by the effective sensible heating of the Indian-Asian landmass and by the availability of latent heat from the Southern Hemisphere Indian Ocean. These forcing mechanisms combine to produce a wind-strength record which has no strong relationship to glacial-interglacial cycles.

The grain-size decrease appears to be coincident with a loss of spectral power near the 41 k. y. periodicity. However, the grain-size decrease is not paralleled in the Globigerina bulloides upwelling record, an independent record of summer monsoon wind-strength (Prell, this volume). These observations leave us with competing hypotheses possibly involving: (1) a decrease in the sensitivity of monsoon windstrength to obliquity forcing, (2) decoupling of the grain size and G. bulloides records via a decoupling of the nutrient supply from wind-driven upwelling, and/or (3) a change in dust source-area or the patterns of dust transporting winds. Comparison of the <b>lithogenic</b> grain size and weight percent records from Hole 722 B with those from a nearby core shows that the major and most minor events are well replicated. These close matches establish our confidence in the <b>lithogenic</b> extraction techniques and measurements. Further, reproducibility on a core-to-core scale indicates that the eolian depositional signal is regionally strong, coherent, and well preserved. The <b>lithogenic</b> weight percent and magnetic susceptibility are extremely well correlated in both the time and frequency domains. From this we infer that the magnetically susceptible component of Owen Ridge sediments is of terrestrial origin and transported to the Owen Ridge via summer monsoon winds. Because of the high correlation with the <b>lithogenic</b> percent record, the magnetic susceptibility record can be cast in terms of <b>lithogenic</b> MAR and used as a high resolution proxy for continental aridity. In addition to primary Milankovitch periodicities, the Hole 722 B grain-size record exhibits periodicity at 52 k. y. and at 29 k. y. Both periodicities are also found in the grain-size record from piston core RC 11 - 210 in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Comparison of the two grain-size records shows significant coherence and zero phase relationships over both the 52 and 29 k. y. periodicities suggesting that the strengths of the Indian Ocean monsoon and the Pacific southeasterly trade winds share common forcing mechanisms. Two possible origins for the 52 and 29 k. y. periodicities in the Hole 722 B wind-strength record are (1) direct Milankovitch forcing (54 and 29 k. y. components of obliquity) and (2) combination periodicities resulting from nonlinear interactions within the climate system. We find that the 52 and 29 k. y. periodicities show stronger coherency with crossproducts of eccentricity and obliquity (29 k. y.) and precession and obliquity (52 k. y.) than with direct obliquity forcing. Our working hypothesis attributes these periodicities to nonlinear interaction between external insolation forcing and internal climatic feedback mechanisms involving an interdependence of continental snow/ice-mass (albedo) and the hydrological cycle (latent heat availability) ...|$|E
40|$|Identifying {{the source}} of {{atmospheric}} dust is crucial {{to better understand the}} global marine biogeochemical cycle as phytoplankton growth relies on dissolved micronutrient elements available in the open ocean. Mineralogical, geochemical and Sr isotope analyses of a one year-time series (April 2003 –April 2004) of deep ocean particle flux at the Madeira Abyssal Plain in the subtropical northeast Atlantic are presented. The <b>lithogenic</b> fraction has a high occurrence of palygorskite and smectite and an absence of kaolinite together with Sr isotopic compositions similar to the Northeast Atlantic aerosols. This indicates the Anti-Atlas Moroccan chain of Paleozoïc age as the source region. The <b>lithogenic</b> fraction supplies 4 times more Fe during a dust event than during the spring-summer aeolian input. A continuous input of only 1 % of the <b>lithogenic</b> iron made available over a year period, could lead to an increase in primary productivity of 40 % relative to today's value...|$|E

Trace metals in soils can have either a <b>lithogenic</b> origin when they inherit from the lithosphere or an anthropogenic origin when they result from man's activities (mining, metallurgy of non-ferrous metals, combustion of fossil energy sources, solid waste or sewage sludge) [5].

40|$|Increased export {{production}} (EP) in the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ) of the Southern Ocean due to iron fertilisation {{has been}} proposed as a key mechanism for explaining carbon drawdown during the last glacial maximum (LGM). This work reconstructs marine EP since the LGM at four sites around New Zealand. For {{the first time in}} this region, 230 -Thorium-normalised fluxes of biogenic opal, carbonate, excess barium, and organic carbon are presented. In Subtropical Waters and the SAZ, these flux variations show that EP has not changed markedly since the LGM. The only exception is a site currently north of the subtropical front. Here we suggest the subtropical front shifted over the core site between 18 and 12 ka, driving increased EP. To understand why EP remained mostly low and constant elsewhere, <b>lithogenic</b> fluxes at the four sites were measured to investigate changes in dust deposition. At all sites, <b>lithogenic</b> fluxes were greater during the LGM compared to the Holocene. The positive temporal correlation between the Antarctic dust record and <b>lithogenic</b> flux at a site in the Tasman Sea shows that regionally, increased dust deposition contributed to the high glacial <b>lithogenic</b> fluxes. Additionally, it is inferred that <b>lithogenic</b> material from erosion and glacier melting deposited on the Campbell Plateau during the deglaciation (18 - 12 ka). From these observations, it is proposed that even though increased glacial dust deposition may have relieved iron limitation within the SAZ around New Zealand, the availability of silicic acid limited diatom growth and thus any resultant increase in carbon export during the LGM. Therefore, silicic acid concentrations have remained low since the LGM. This result suggests that both silicic acid and iron co-limit EP in the SAZ around New Zealand, consistent with modern process studies...|$|E
