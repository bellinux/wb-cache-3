40|$|The Potts model {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in classical statistical mechanics, illustrating many fundamental phenomena. One example is the existence of partially long-range-ordered states, in which some degrees of freedom remain disordered. This situation may arise from frustration of the interactions, but also from an irregular but unfrustrated lattice structure. We study partial long-range order in a range of antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts models on different two-dimensional lattices and for all relevant values of $q$. We exploit the power of tensor-based numerical methods to evaluate the partition function of these models and hence to extract the key thermodynamic properties [...] entropy, specific heat, magnetization, and susceptibility [...] giving deep insight into the phase transitions and ordered states of each system. Our calculations reveal a range of phenomena related to partial ordering, including different types of entropy-driven phase transition, the role of <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularity,</b> very large values of the critical $q_c$, and double phase transitions.

40|$|Understanding how {{the nervous}} system {{achieves}} reliable performance using unreliable components is important for many disciplines of science and engineering, {{in part because it}} can suggest ways to lower the energetic cost of computing. In vision, retinal ganglion cells partition visual space into approximately circular regions termed receptive fields (RFs). Average RF shapes are such that they would provide maximal spatial resolution if they were centered on a perfect lattice. However, individual shapes have fine-scale irregularities. Here, we find that irregular RF shapes increase the spatial resolution in the presence of <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularities</b> from ≈ 60 % to ≈ 92 % of that possible for a perfect lattice. Optimization of RF boundaries around their fixed center positions reproduced experimental observations neuron-by-neuron. Our results suggest that <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularities</b> determine the shapes of retinal RFs and that similar algorithms can improve the performance of retinal prosthetics where substantial irregularities arise at their interface with neural tissue...|$|R
5|$|Imperfections in {{the crystal}} lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond {{may be the}} result of <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularities</b> or {{extrinsic}} substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the diamond growth. The defects affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which type a diamond is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic band structure.|$|R
40|$|Using {{ferromagnetic}} resonance (FMR) and {{transmission electron microscopy}} we studied the structural and magnetic properties of lattice mismatched magnetic ultrathin multilayers of the system Au/Fe/Au/Pd/Fe(001) prepared on GaAs(001). We observed a correlation between the periodic <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularities</b> due to the misfit accommodation processes and the resulting magnetic properties of the multilayer system: In samples with a network of misfit dislocations the FMR measurements have shown that {{a significant part of}} the damping is extrinsic and caused by two magnon scattering. The angular dependence of the FMR linewidth reflects the in-plane symmetry of the dislocation arrangement. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|Scanning {{tunneling}} microscopy {{has developed}} into {{a powerful tool for}} the characterization of conductive surfaces, for which the overlap of tip and sample wave functions determines the image contrast. On insulating layers, as the CaO thin film grown on Mo(001) investigated here, direct overlap between initial and final states is not enabled anymore and electrons are transported via hopping through the conduction-band states of the oxide. Carrier transport is accompanied by strong phonon excitations in this case, imprinting an oscillatory signature on the differential conductance spectra of the system. The phonons show a characteristic spatial dependence and become softer around <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularities</b> in the oxide film, such as dislocation lines...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhase {{decomposition}} in Al– 6 Mg alloy doped with Sc up to 0. 6 wt. % {{was first}} investigated through positron lifetime and coincidence Doppler broadening spectroscopic (CDBS) measurements. The results varied significantly with the degrees of doping and heat treatment conditions {{due to the}} entrapment and annihilation of positrons at vacancies and <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularities</b> like coherent and semi-coherent precipitate-matrix interfaces. Sc-vacancy complexes helped in fine scale precipitation of Al 3 Sc during the annealing. The substructure stabilization is effected more at low annealing temperature and shorter annealing times. The precipitation behaviour in 0. 2 wt. % Zr-doped Al- 6 Mg- 0. 4 Sc alloy under different annealing conditions was also studied. Although Sc has better diffusivity in Al- 6 Mg than Zr, the latter {{appeared to be an}} ideal additive to generate new precipitates of the form Al 3 Sc 1 -xZrx and the differences are reflected in the positron lifetimes and CDBS ratio curves. Transmission electron microscopy showed spheroidal precipitates with complete absence of facets, implying the modification of the surface morphology of the precipitates...|$|R
30|$|Open {{image in}} new window. We {{know that the}} {{dimension}} of B parameter {{is similar to the}} applied field (Oe). It is thought that this parameter B is used for a high magnetic field. The presence of this parameter B in Equation[*] 8 is under investigation. Approximately, this 1 /H term results from small linearly extended elastic dipoles due to the agglomeration of vacancy type so-called free volumes [26], or on the basis of Brown's theory, it may have its origin in the presence of defects in samples: inclusions, voids, or simply inhomogeneities or <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularities</b> [27]. The molecular field coefficient γ of these samples takes reasonable value. In Weiss' original theory, the molecular field coefficient γ has a positive value, and it is perfectly well understood that the molecular field, having a finite and positive value when the atomic moments are all parallel and in the same direction, can cause this ordered state [28]. It seems that the high value of the quantum number J must be equivalent to the assumption that the value of J is the same for all spin pairs, not just nearest-neighbor pairs [19].|$|R
40|$|If the {{specific}} heat C(T) {{of a solid}} is given {{as a function of}} temperature from T= 0 to ∞ with infinite accuracy, the frequency spectrum f(ν) is uniquely determined. What information about f(ν) can be derived from specific heat data of experimental accuracy? The following conclusions give the answer. (1) Experimental specific heats determine accurately the low frequency part of the frequency spectrum but allow a latitude, wide enought to fit almost any theory, for its high frequency part. (2) In a Debye plot (effective Debye temperature θ versus T) peaks and dips in the region 0 <T<θ/ 10 represent dips and peaks in the low frequency part of the frequency spectrum. The correspondence is so simple that it can be interpreted at a glance. The peaks and dips are superimposed on a simple Debye spectrum and presumably have a direct physical meaning, in terms of <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularities.</b> Only their centers and total weights are obtainable, so that they act effectively as single Einstein frequencies. (3) In the region θ/ 5 <T<∞ all information obtainable about f(ν) consists of the first few even moments (three for specific heat errors of order one percent, five for 0. 1 percent). These can be represented respectively by two or three weighted equivalent Einstein functions without direct physical meaning. (4) The region θ/ 10 <T<θ/ 5 corresponds to the high frequency part of the frequency spectrum, but hardly any information can be derived here...|$|R
40|$|Fission gas {{behavior}} {{within the}} fuel structure {{plays a major}} role for the safety of nuclear fuels during operation in the nuclear power plant. Fission gas distribution and retention is determined by both, micro- and lattice-structure of the fuel matrix. The ADOPT (Advanced Doped Pellet Technology) fuel, containing chromium and aluminum additives, shows larger grain sizes than standard (undoped) UO 2 fuel, enhancing the fission gas retention properties of the matrix. However, the additions of such trivalent cations shall also induce defects in the lattice. In this study, we investigated the microstructure of such doped fuels as well as a reference standard UO 2 by positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). Although this technique is particularly sensitive to lattice point defects in materials, a wider application in the UO 2 research is still missing. The PAS-lifetime components were measured in the hotlab facility of PSI using a 22 Na source sandwiched between two 500 -μm-thin sample discs. The values of lifetime at the center and the rim of both samples, examined to check at the radial homogeneity of the pellets, are not significantly different. The mean lifetimes were found to be longer in the ADOPT material, 220 [*]ps, than in standard UO 2, 190 [*]ps, which indicates a larger presence of additional defects, presumably generated by the dopants. While two-component decomposition (bulk[*]+[*]one defect component) could be performed for the standard material, only one lifetime component was found in the doped material. The absence of the bulk component in the ADOPT sample refers to a saturated positron trapping (i. e., all positrons are trapped at defects). In order to associate a type of lattice defect to each PAS component, interpretation of the PAS experimental observations was conducted with respect to existing experimental and modeling studies. This work has shown the efficiency of PAS to detect lattice point defects in UO 2 produced by Cr and Al oxides. These additives create <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularities,</b> which are acting as sinks for fission products on one hand and trapping positrons on the other hand. Fitting of the obtained experimental data with a suitable theoretical model can provide a valuable qualitative assessment of these defects. At this stage of the research, some of the existing models were used for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Maarten Broekmans {{has studied}} the alkali-silica {{reaction}} in two Dutch concretes by means of optical microscopy, geochemical analyses on bulk material and after selective digestion in acid, and with element mapping in polished thin sections. He furthermore characterized {{the nature of the}} silica/quartz in the Norwegian mylonites studied previously by Wigum in his PhD-thesis (1995), in the Ohio cherts previously studied by Kneller (1967), and some Dutch cherts by assessing their crystallinity indices following the XRD-method of Murata&Norman (1976). The thesis suggests a simple and straight-forward system to rate concrete damage by assessing and classifying the crack fabric in impregnated full cores under fluorescent illumination. This method does not distinguish between different causes for the observed cracking, but it is quick and does not require expensive instrumentation nor special training. However, identifying the true cause of the cracking is of course essential and can be done as a second stage by thin section petrography. Typically, chert is the main alkali-reactive constituent in Dutch concrete. However, petrographic observations on sand- and siltstone grains in the aggregate indicate that these generate ASR-gel as well, which was not generally accepted in the Netherlands until before recently. The necessary alkali may very well be provided by interstitial clay minerals, and eventually by detrital muscovite on a very local scale with very limited reach. In geological-sedimentary literature, the catalytic effect of sheet silicate minerals (clays, micas) upon the dissolution of quartz is well documented. There is a strong resemblance of the observations made in the ASR-concrete to the features described from sedimentary-diagenetic sandstone compaction, and a similar process is suggested to occur in ASR. This is partly supported by element maps on Na, K, Ca, Si, Fe and S on intact and ASR-cracked chert, and intact and ASR-cracked sandstone. There are marked differences in their alkali-household. The silica involved in an alkali-silica reaction is hardly characterized, often only identified as silica or quartz. However, there are many qualities and/or properties of silica {{that may or may not}} affect its solubility, including polymorphism, <b>lattice</b> <b>irregularities</b> (vacancies, dislocations, twinning planes, domain structures), foreign ions and water in the quartz structure, etc, etc. Which of these qualities and/or properties do apply depends on conditions. Thus, merely identifying the alkali-reactive silica as 'quartz' is not good enough, but rises questions about which methods to use for that, and with which criteria? There are few procedures available to determine the quality of the quartz lattice; among those most frequently used is the XRD-method of Murata&Norman (1976), who use relative peak-heights in the quintuplet at 67. 74 degrees two-theta in a diffractogram. However, all qualities that do have an effect on the quartz lattice are lumped together, and no further distinction can be made which of these are relevant for that particular sample. Thus, increased (alkali-) solubility cannot be attributed to one single quartz property. This is confirmed in literature, by the great discrepancies reported when the same samples are analyzed by XRD and IR or DTA/TGA. Quartz content of analyzed silica may vary at random from 0...|$|R
40|$|Background] The "pasta" {{phase of}} nuclear matter may play an {{important}} role in the structure and evolution of neutron stars. Recent works suggest nuclear pasta has a high resistivity which could be explained by the presence of long lived topological defects. The defects act as impurities that decrease thermal and electrical conductivity of the pasta. [Purpose] To quantify how topological defects affect transport properties of nuclear pasta and estimate this effect using an impurity parameter Q_imp. [Methods] Contrast molecular dynamics simulations of up to 409 600 nucleons arranged in parallel nuclear pasta slabs (perfect pasta) with simulations of pasta slabs connected by topological defects (impure pasta). From these simulations compare the viscosity and heat conductivity of perfect and impure pasta to obtain an effective impurity parameter Q_imp due to the presence of defects. [Results] Both the viscosity and thermal conductivity calculated for both perfect and impure pasta are anisotropic, peaking along directions perpendicular to the slabs and reaching a minimum close to zero parallel to them. In our 409 600 nucleon simulation topological defects connecting slabs of pasta reduce both the thermal conductivity and viscosity on average by about 37 %. We estimate an effective impurity parameter due to the defects of order Q_imp∼ 30. [Conclusions] Topological defects in the pasta phase of nuclear matter have an effect similar to impurities in a crystal <b>lattice.</b> The <b>irregularities</b> introduced by the defects reduce the thermal and electrical conductivities and the viscosity of the system. This effect can be parameterized by a large impurity parameter Q_imp∼ 30. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, 3 table...|$|R
