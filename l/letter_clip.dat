As an evangelical Anglican missionary doctor who spent decades working in Rwanda and Uganda, he was the revival's most dedicated historian. His eye to posterity led him to preserve thousands of <b>letters,</b> newspaper <b>clips,</b> photographs, sermon notes, and other sundries. And through his dozens of published editorials, pamphlets, booklets, and his quintessential revival history Quest for the Highest: An Autobiographical Account of the East African Revival, he has probably done {{more than any other}} single person to form the historical perception of the revival, particularly in the West.|$|R

In 1869 he informed Pisemsky that his One Thousand Souls had been translated into German and enjoyed [...] "great success in Berlin". [...] "So now {{the time has come for}} you to step outside the borders of your motherland and for Aleksey Pisemsky to become a European name," [...] Turgenev wrote on October 9, 1869. [...] "The best Berlin critic, Frenzel, in National Zeitung devoted a whole article to you where he calls your novel 'a rare phenomenon', and I tell you, now you are well known in Germany," [...] wrote Turgenev in another <b>letter,</b> enclosing <b>clips</b> from other papers, too. [...] "The success of One Thousand Souls encourages [...] to start upon the novel Troubled Seas and I am so happy both for you and for Russian literature in general… Critical reviews of One Thousand Souls here in Germany are most favourable, your characters are being compared to those of Dickens, Thackeray, etc, etc", he continued. Julian Schmidt’s large article in Zeitgenossensche [...] Bilder, part of the series devoted to first class European authors, provided for Pisemsky another cause to celebrate, and following Turgenev's advice, in 1875 he visited Schmidt to thank him personally.|$|R

5000|$|Edward Fella {{started out}} his career being a {{commercial}} artist for 30 years(1957-1987). The {{most of his}} works he did during this time was Automotive and health care posters. According to this article, his first job right after he finished high school was an apprentice at Phoenix studio, {{it was his first}} job in the commercial space.". His day to day work during his time as a commercial artist was drawing head lines and lay outs which helped refine his style and skills. His illustrations were reflective of the trends of the time, while the typography he used was ironic to commercial art deco type. Fella explored many different types of techniques that helped him through his career in design such as found typography, scribbles, brush writing, typesetting, rubdown <b>letters,</b> public domain <b>clip</b> art, stencils and much more. Fella was given the name « the king of zing » because of his whimsical illustration style he had. During the 60's and 70's Fella felt that his commercial work was not enough for him and started to become very active in Detroit's culture scene. He offered his services to some alternative art institutions. He also became the designer for the Detroit focus gallery. While there he created dozens of event posters and directed the Detroit focus quarterly. These types of assignments gave Fella the push to print the kind of experimental and crazy designs that he was doing in private. Fella used direct a positive photostat machine and made collages with images and type that had readily available. One of Fella's main creative outlet was his after the fact posters. These posters were made to give attended for events, he makes a small amount of poster to give to people that attend the event instead of having to make a bunch of posters for only a small amount of people to see and come to the event. He made these posters for lectures and for appearances he made. Since he made the posters for people that came to the event he had more creative freedom because {{he did not have to}} make it appeal to a commercial audience. The posters also helped him to continue expanding his body of work. In 1985 Fella retired from the commercial industry and decided to go back to school and enrolled in Cranbrook Academy of Art.|$|R
