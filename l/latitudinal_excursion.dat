40|$|Solar {{energetic}} particles, {{which are}} believed to originate from corotating interacting regions (CIRS) at low heliographic latitude, were observed by the Ulysses spacecraft even as it passed over the Sun's poles. One interpretation of this result is that high-latitude field lines intercepted by Ulysses connect to low-latitude CIRs at much larger heliocentric distances. The Fisk model explains the <b>latitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of magnetic field lines in the solar corona and heliosphere as the inevitable consequence of the interaction of a tilted dipole in a differentially rotating photosphere with rigidly rotating coronal holes. We use a time-dependent three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) algorithm to follow {{the evolution of a}} simple model of the solar corona in response to the differential rotation of the photospheric magnetic flux. We examine the changes of the coronal-hole boundaries, the redistribution of the line-of-sight magnetic field, and the precession of field lines in the corona. Our results confirm the basic idea of the Fisk model, that differential rotation leads to changes in the heliographic latitude of magnetic field lines. However, the <b>latitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of magnetic field lines in this simple "tilted dipole" model is too small to explain the Ulysses observations. Although coronal holes in our model rotate more rigidly than do photospheric features (in general agreement with observations), they do not rotate strictly rigidly as assumed by Fisk. This basic difference between our model and Fisk's will be explored in the future by considering more realistic magnetic flux distributions, as observed during Ulysses polar excursions...|$|E
40|$|Since its {{launch in}} October 1990, Ulysses has {{provided}} good quality magnetic field data, practically covering {{the whole time}} interval until now. We have studied the very long time scale evolution of the interplanetary magnetic field, in particlular, we have search for recurrent disturbances in the magnetic field. The magnetic field vectors have been mapped back to the Sun along Parker spirals, {{in order to determine}} the Heliographic longitude of the source regions in the corona. It was found that the position of many high field sources drifts systematically relative to the corona assumed to rotate with the equatorial rotation period of the Sun. The results are compared to similar observations on the eastward drift of magnetic sectors observed after about June 1992. Changes associated with both the declining phase of the solar cycle and the <b>latitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of Ulysses are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The inclinations of {{the neutral}} {{line at the}} {{ecliptic}} plane derived from source surface model maps of coronal fields are measured for the interval from June 1976 to March 1992. The mean and median values of 53 deg and 57 deg {{are close to the}} average inclinations determined earlier from minimum variance analyses of solar wind measurements at sector boundaries, but the mode falls in the 80 deg - 90 deg bin. This result, which is based on the model assumptions implicit in deriving the source surface maps, predicts that the heliospheric current sheet typically intersects the ecliptic plane nearly at right angles, even without steepening by stream interaction regions. High inclinations dominate the solar cycle for about 7 years around solar maximum. Dips to lower inclination occur near solar minimum, but high variance admits a wide range of inclinations throughout the cycle. Compared to the smooth solar cycle variation of the maximum <b>latitudinal</b> <b>excursion</b> of the neutral line, often treated as the tilt angle of a flat heliospheric current sheet, the noisy variation of the inclinations reflects {{the degree to which the}} neutral line deviates from a sine wave, implying warps and corrugations in the current sheet. About a third of the time the neutral line so deviates that it doubles back in longitude...|$|E
40|$|Employing daily wind {{data from}} the ECMWF, we perform passive {{particle}} advection to estimate the Lagrangian velocity correlation functions (LVCF) associated with the midlatitude tropospheric flow. In particular we decompose the velocity field into time mean and transient (or eddy) components {{to better understand the}} nature of the LVCF's. A closely related quantity, the absolute dispersion (AD) is also examined. Given the anisotropy of the flow, meridional and zonal characteristics are considered separately. The zonal LVCF is seen to be non-exponential. In fact, for a broad set of intermediate timescales it is better described as a power law of the form τ^-α with 0 <α< 1. Indeed, the implied long time correlation in the zonal flow results in a superdiffusive zonal AD regime. On the other hand, the meridional LVCF decays rapidly to zero. Interestingly, before approaching to zero it shows a region of negative correlation. A physical argument based on the rotational inhibition of <b>latitudinal</b> <b>excursions,</b> mediated through the time mean flow, is put forth to account for this anticorrelation. As a result the meridional AD, apart from showing the classical asymptotic ballistic and diffusive regimes, displays transient subdiffusive behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Actual energy {{paths of}} long, extratropical {{baroclinic}} Rossby {{waves in the}} ocean are difficult to describe simply because they depend on the meridional-wavenumber-to-zonal-wavenumber ratio tau, a quantity {{that is difficult to}} estimate both observationally and theoretically. This paper shows, however, that this dependence is actually weak over any interval in which the zonal phase speed varies approximately linearly with tau, in which case the propagation becomes quasi-nondispersive (QND) and describable at leading order in terms of environmental conditions (i. e., topography and stratification) alone. As an example, the purely topographic case is shown to possess three main kinds of QND ray paths. The first is a topographic regime in which the rays follow approximately the contours f/h(alpha c) = a constant (alpha(c) is a near constant fixed by the strength of the stratification, f is the Coriolis parameter, and h is the ocean depth). The second and third are, respectively, "fast" and "slow" westward regimes little affected by topography and associated with the first and second bottom-pressure-compensated normal modes studied in previous work by Tailleux and McWilliams. Idealized examples show that actual rays can often be reproduced with reasonable accuracy by replacing the actual dispersion relation by its QND approximation. The topographic regime provides an upper bound (in general a large overestimate) of the maximum <b>latitudinal</b> <b>excursions</b> of actual rays. The method presented in this paper is interesting for enabling an optimal classification of purely azimuthally dispersive wave systems into simpler idealized QND wave regimes, which helps to rationalize previous empirical findings that the ray paths of long Rossby waves in the presence of mean flow and topography often seem to be independent of the wavenumber orientation. Two important side results are to establish that the baroclinic string function regime of Tyler and K se is only valid over a tiny range of the topographic parameter and that long baroclinic Rossby waves propagating over topography do not obey any two-dimensional potential vorticity conservation principle. Given the importance of the latter principle in geophysical fluid dynamics, the lack of it in this case makes the concept of the QND regimes all the more important, for they are probably the only alternative to provide a simple and economical description of general purely azimuthally dispersive wave systems...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous in situ {{measurements}} of HCl and ClO {{have been made}} {{for the first time}} in the southern hemisphere, allowing a systematic study of the processes governing chlorine activation between 15 and 20 km in the 1994 Antarctic winter. Data for several other gases (O_ 3, NO, NO_y, OH, HO_ 2, N_(2) O, CH_ 4, CO, H_(2) O, CFCs), particulates, and meteorological parameters were collected from the ER- 2 aircraft out of New Zealand as part of the 1994 Airborne Southern Hemisphere Ozone Experiment/Measurements of Atmospheric Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft (ASHOE/MAESA) campaign. Observations from the ER- 2 in the fall (April–May), prior to polar night, show that chlorine activation begins with 60 – 75 % of inorganic chlorine as HCl. By midwinter (July–August), near-total removal of HCl is observed. The wintertime loss of HCl in air recently exposed to extreme temperatures is found to be correlated with high levels of reactive chlorine (ClO and its dimer, Cl_(2) O_ 2) in the linear fashion expected from the stoichiometry of the heterogeneous reaction of hydrochloric acid with chlorine nitrate on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) : HCl + ClONO_ 2 → Cl_ 2 + HNO_ 3. To constrain the role of different heterogeneous reactions and PSC types, we have used a photochemical trajectory model which includes heterogeneous sulfate and PSC chemistry. Model calculations of the evolution of reactive gases are compared with the in situ observations. In addition, simultaneous {{measurements of}} OH and HO_ 2 are used as a diagnostic for the occurrence of the heterogeneous reaction HOCl + HCl → Cl_ 2 + H_(2) O, which contributes to suppressed levels of HO_x inside the vortex. It is shown that the amount of chlorine activation is not strongly dependent on the composition of PSCs. However, HO_x levels exhibit different signatures depending on the type of heterogeneous surfaces that affected chlorine activation. Furthermore, this analysis implies that in the edge region of the Antarctic vortex, the observed near-total removal of HCl can result from <b>latitudinal</b> <b>excursions</b> of air parcels in and out of sunlight during the winter, which photochemically resupply HOCl and ClONO_ 2 as oxidation partners for HCl...|$|R
