It is a tragic <b>little</b> <b>story,</b> simply and beautifully told, with a running commentary by the author on the philosophy of sex, and it is unique in Australian literature.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a <b>little</b> <b>story</b> to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

After being released from prison into a dystopian society in which music itself has been criminalized, he lapses into insanity.|$|E

The small group first appeared in episode seven when the Whiskers accidentally crossed over into their territory. The meeting ended without incident as the Whiskers willingly returned to their own land. Risca, a former dominant female of the Whiskers, led the Gattaca.

500|$|In {{response}} {{to how he}} would like to be remembered, Cope responded, [...] "When I kick the bucket, there'll be a <b>little</b> <b>story</b> that'll say, 'Creator of Towel Dead'". On February 27, 2008, Cope died of respiratory failure in Pittsburgh. The following day, an article from the Associated Press concerning Cope's death was entitled [...] "Former Steelers broadcaster, Terrible Towel creator Cope dies". Upon Cope's death, over 350 fans gathered downtown Pittsburgh in snowy weather for a tribute to the inventor. The ceremony concluded with one minute of silent Towel waving. Days later, Saturday Night Live cast member Seth Meyers waved a Terrible Towel on Saturday Night Live, in tribute to Cope.|$|E
500|$|On 4 October 2006, it was {{announced}} that actress Nadine Lewington had been cast in the role of Maddy. Lewington had made a previous appearance in series 20, episode 22 of Holby City sister show Casualty. Lewington recalls of her role: [...] "I was a young married mum of one with another on the way. I loved my little bump. My reckless hubbie had had a motorbike accident, in which a baby was injured, after promising to give the bikes up. I threatened to leave him, Charlie Fairhead gave him what for and told him how lucky he was to have me and he promised to be model father after all. Happily ever after. It was a really sweet <b>little</b> <b>story</b> actually. Very touching".|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell {{said the}} episode [...] "was pretty damn funny, but I'm {{predisposed}} to Butters in general {{as well as}} the wide world of pimping." [...] Wired writer Chris Kohler said the topical and timely jokes in [...] "Butters' Bottom Bitch", such as the satire on ACORN, were a strong example of what kept South Park funny and relevant. Not all reviews were positive. Sean O'Neal, also of The A.V. Club, gave the episode a C grade, and said [...] "It was basically one note held for the run of the ep, in service of a simple <b>little</b> <b>story</b> without many surprises."

500|$|Richard Keller of TV Squad gave [...] "Stewie Kills Lois" [...] a {{much more}} {{negative}} review.

He stated that he did not find the episode funny, but rather disjointed, with <b>little</b> <b>story</b> and too many cutaway gags and flashbacks. In his review of [...] "Lois Kills Stewie", Keller gave {{a much more}} positive review. He did mention {{that the end of the}} episode was somewhat predictable, as they had killed Cleveland and Stewie. He commented positively to some of the jokes of the episode, and in the overall he mentioned he liked the two episodes, but he was not so keen of the ending of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Crosby {{insisted upon}} the {{inclusion}} of the contentious track [...] "Mind Gardens", which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no [...] "rhythm, meter, or rhyme". [...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd never heard anything like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a <b>little</b> <b>story</b> and what it said was true ... if you build walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E

2500|$|Film critic Tag Gallagher wrote {{at length}} about Wagon Master in his 1986 book, John Ford: {{the man and his}} films. His summary is, [...] "That Wagon Master (1950), one of Ford’s major masterpieces, grossed about a third of any of the cavalry {{pictures}} surely came as no surprise. It was a personal project, with no stars, <b>little</b> <b>story,</b> deflated drama, almost nothing to attract box office or trendy critics. Its budget was $999,370, its highest paid actor got $20,000 (Ward Bond). Almost every frame bursts with humanity, nature and cinema, quite like Rossellini’s Voyage in Italy. The story, resembling the Carey-Fords of the teens more than a 1950s western, was written by Ford himself, the only such instance after 1930." ...|$|E

The work is in one act and premiered in 1914 in a double bill with Enrico Caruso in the leading tenor role in Pagliacci. The opera featured Frances Alda in the title role. It failed to make an impression and received only six performances. Its conversational style is complemented by orchestral motivic commentary. Just before the work opened, Herbert added [...] "A Perfect Day" [...] at Alda's request. Although not a success, because of Herbert's popularity, G.

2500|$|This {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of the Band's [...] "grittily distinctive" [...] sound coming together, according to Hoskyns. Its author, Robertson, has explained that it was based on an actual Yazoo Street in a town in Arkansas, Helm's home state: [...] "I thought, 'Wow, they don't have streets like that in Canada. There's no streets up there called Yazoo!' It was like, 'Jesus, let me make up a <b>little</b> <b>story</b> here about stuff going on in this kind of almost red light district.' Everything was lit in red in that song for me." [...] Initially, Robertson recorded the lead vocal for the first version of this song, but because it was set in the South, the Hawks decided that Levon Helm would be a more appropriate singer, employing what Hoskyns describes as his [...] "best redneck-wildcat yelp".|$|E

2500|$|As Raimi and his {{producing}} partner Robert Tapert progressed {{through various}} drafts, {{they realized that}} there was a potential franchise on their hands.

[...] Goldin said that they [...] "spent {{a lot of time talking}} and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of the nuts and bolts of the story." [...] The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script. For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, [...] "I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift off into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves." ...|$|E

[...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and I was dead to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me.
