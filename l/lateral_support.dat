It then lifts its right hind leg (while being {{supported by the}} diagonal pair front right and left hind). Next, the left front foot touches the ground (the horse is now supported by all but the right hind leg); then the horse lifts its right front leg (it is now supported laterally on both left legs), and shortly afterwards it sets down the right rear leg (only the front right leg is now lifted). Then it lifts its left rear leg (diagonal support), puts down the front right (<b>lateral</b> <b>support),</b> lifts the left front, puts down the rear left, and the pattern repeats.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{voussoir}} arches, {{which require}} support for each element until the keystone is in place, domes are stable during construction as each level is made {{a complete and}} self-supporting ring. The upper portion of a masonry dome is always in compression and is supported laterally, so it does not collapse except as a whole unit {{and a range of}} deviations from the ideal in this shallow upper cap are equally stable. Because voussoir domes have <b>lateral</b> <b>support,</b> they can be made much thinner than corresponding arches of the same span. For example, a hemispherical dome can be 2.5 times thinner than a semicircular arch, and a dome with the profile of an equilateral arch can be thinner still. The optimal shape for a masonry dome of equal thickness is a revolved catenary curve, similar to the curve of a parabola. This shape provides for perfect compression, with none of the tension or bending forces that masonry is weak against. The pointed profiles of many Gothic domes more closely approximate this optimal shape than do hemispheres, which were favored by Roman and Byzantine architects due to the circle being considered the most perfect of forms. Adding a weight {{to the top of the}} pointed dome, such as the heavy cupola at the top of Florence Cathedral, changes the optimal shape to perfectly match the actual pointed shape of the dome.|$|E

500|$|Though the {{building}} had undergone previous alterations—for example, the Church Extension and Missionary Society had [...] "removed deteriorated parapets from the towers" [...] in 1880—it did not undergo significant renovations until the early 1890s. That year the rose window {{on the front of}} {{the building}} was removed, [...] "possibly because it had Christian motifs", and replaced with a large arched window, still in keeping with the Gothic style. The work was undertaken by the architectural firm of (Ernest) Schneider & (Henry) Herter, German immigrants who had worked on a number of other synagogues, including the Park East Synagogue. In 1893 they fixed [...] "serious structural problems", the consequence of neglected maintenance. The work included [...] "stabiliz the front steps, add brick buttresses to the sides of the church for <b>lateral</b> <b>support,</b> again in a Gothic style, and replac the original basement columns with six-inch cast iron columns."

2500|$|The {{collapse}} of the World Trade Center has been called [...] "the most infamous paradigm" [...] of progressive collapse, also called [...] "Pancaking". Once the collapse initiated, the mass of failing floors overwhelmed the floors below, causing a progressive series of floor failures which accelerated as the sequence progressed. Soon, large portions of the perimeter columns and possibly the cores were left without any <b>lateral</b> <b>support,</b> causing them to fall laterally towards the outside, pushed by the increasing pile of rubble. The result was that the walls peeled off and separated away from the buildings by a large distance (about 500 feet in some cases), hitting other neighboring buildings. Some connections broke as the bolts snapped, leaving many panels randomly scattered. Significant parts of the naked cores (about 60 stories for the North Tower and 40 for the South Tower) remained standing {{for a few seconds}} before they also collapsed.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} in-plane experimental {{testing and}} numerical modelling of timberconcrete floor diaphragms. The experimental tests investigated the in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm and the stiffness {{and strength of}} different connections between the diaphragm and the lateral load resisting system. The test model was 1 / 3 scale and three meters square in plan. Seven tests with {{a different kind of}} connection between the floor and the rigid <b>lateral</b> <b>supports</b> (which simulated a timber lateral load resisting system) have been performed. The results of the experimental testing are used to calibrate numerical models which are used to investigate the effects of the floor flexibility on the seismic behaviour of post-tensioned timber buildings. For the experimental tests, screw and nail fasteners were used to connected to floor unit to the <b>lateral</b> <b>supports.</b> These fasteners were embedded into the concrete slab or timber edge joints at different orientations. The stiffness of the diaphragm connections was vastly different for each detail. Screws installed at a 45 ? angle (inclined) to the <b>lateral</b> <b>supports</b> were four times stiffer than the screws installed orthogonal to the <b>lateral</b> <b>supports.</b> The initial stiffness of the inclined fasteners was similar for timber-to-timber and concrete-to-timber connections. For the timberto- timber connections the orientation did not seem to influence the strength of the connection. The tested diaphragm had an uncracked stiffness of 4000 kN/mm and a cracked stiffness of 300 kN/mm. For the tested floor unit it was concluded that the influence of the diaphragm flexibility was negligible compared to the connector flexibility. The floor flexibility can be idealized as three different parts, the deformation of the connectors, the shear deformation of the diaphragm and the flexural deformation of the diaphragm. The numerical analyses showed that in most perceivable situations the connection deformation will govern the in-plane seismic response of the floor. Hence, it is justified to model it as a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) element. The influence of the floor flexibility on the seismic response of post-tensioned timber buildings is small. In most cases neglecting the floor flexibility is a conservative approach for the structural design of the building. However, structures with stiff walls and long floor spans there can be a significant amplification of the seismic response. For that case, a simple SDOF representation is proposed. Code-based recommendations for predicting the peak floor accelerations are found to be inadequate. A methodology is proposed to more accurately predict the expected peak floor accelerations for desig...|$|R

2500|$|In November 2008, NIST {{released}} its final {{report on the}} causes of the collapse of 7World Trade Center. This followed their August 21, 2008 draft report which included a period for public comments. In its investigation, NIST utilized ANSYS to model events leading up to collapse initiation and LS-DYNA models to simulate the global response to the initiating events. NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the twin towers, nor did the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs). But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near Column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> across nine floors, Column 79 soon buckled – pulling the East penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the entire building above to fall downward as a single unit. [...] From collapse timing measurements taken from a video of the north face of the building, NIST observed that the building's exterior facade fell at free fall acceleration through a distance of approximately 8 stories (32 meters, or 105 feet), noting [...] "the collapse time was approximately 40 percent longer than that of free fall for the first 18 stories of descent." [...] The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.|$|E
60|$|If a man {{dreamt of}} a great pile of stones in a nightmare, he would dream of such a pile as the Cheese-Wring.

It rises perpendicularly to a height of thirty-two feet, without <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> of any kind. The fifth and sixth rocks are of immense size and thickness, and overhang fearfully, all round, the four lower rocks which support them. All are perfectly irregular; the projections of one do not fit into the interstices of another; they are heaped up loosely in their extraordinary top-heavy form, on slanting ground half-way down a steep hill. Look at them from whatever point you choose, there is still all that is heaviest, largest, strongest, at the summit, and all that is lightest, smallest, weakest, at the base. When you first see the Cheese-Wring, you instinctively shrink from walking under it. Beholding the tons on tons of stone balanced to a hair's breadth on the mere fragments beneath, you think that with a pole in your hand, with one push against the top rocks, you could hurl down the hill in an instant a pile which has stood for centuries, unshaken by the fiercest hurricane that ever blew, rushing from the great void of an ocean over the naked surface of a moor.|$|E

50|$|Compared {{to running}} shoes, {{badminton}} shoes have little <b>lateral</b> <b>support.</b> High levels of <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> {{are useful for}} activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected.

For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is more than just a safety concern: proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.|$|E
