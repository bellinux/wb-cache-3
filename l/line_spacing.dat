5|$|The latest {{proposed}} extremely large astronomical telescopes, {{such as the}} Thirty Meter Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope, will be of segmented design. Their primary mirrors will be {{built from}} hundreds of hexagonal mirror segments. Polishing and figuring these highly aspheric and non-rotationally symmetric mirror segments presents a major challenge. Traditional means of optical testing compares a surface against a spherical reference {{with the aid of}} a null corrector. In recent years, computer-generated holograms (CGHs) have begun to supplement null correctors in test setups for complex aspheric surfaces. Fig.15 illustrates how this is done. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> on the order of 1 to 10µm. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. The same test setup can be used for the innermost mirrors as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.|$|E
25|$|As {{a second}} example, {{consider}} the methoxymethyl radical, H2C(OCH3). The two equivalent methyl hydrogens will give an overall 1:2:1 EPR pattern, each component {{of which is}} further split by the three methoxy hydrogens into a 1:3:3:1 pattern to give a total of 3×4= 12 lines, a triplet of quartets. A simulation of the observed EPR spectrum is shown at the right and agrees with the 12-line prediction and the expected line intensities. Note that the smaller coupling constant (smaller <b>line</b> <b>spacing)</b> {{is due to the}} three methoxy hydrogens, while the larger coupling constant (<b>line</b> <b>spacing)</b> is from the two hydrogens bonded directly to the carbon atom bearing the unpaired electron. It is often the case that coupling constants decrease in size with distance from a radical's unpaired electron, but there are some notable exceptions, such as the ethyl radical (CH2CH3).|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} question {{discussed in}} this dissertation {{is the problem of}} characterizing the linear and convex functions on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces.</b> A linear function is shown to be a convex function. The linear and convex functions are characterized, that is, a function f:[right arrow] X? is linear [convex] if and only if f[subscript l] is linear [convex] in the usual sense on each line of a generalized <b>line</b> <b>space</b> X. We prove that if a function has at least one support at each point on its graph, then it is a convex function. In the first chapter the basic concepts of abstract convexity spaces are introduced. The next chapter is concerned with join systems which are shown to be examples of abstract convexity spaces. On the other hand, a domain-finite, join-hull commutative abstract convexity space with regular straight segments satisfies the axioms of a join system. Consequently, such abstract convexity spaces satisfy the separation property. In Chapter III, the linearization of abstract spaces is done using a linearization family. The following chapter is on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces</b> and graphically it is shown that Pasch?s and Peano's axioms do not hold in a certain generalized <b>line</b> <b>space.</b> It is also proved that the separation property may not hold, in general, in a generalized <b>line</b> <b>space.</b> Finally, the convex and linear functions are studied on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces.</b> The linearization of generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces</b> is done by means of the properties of a linearization family...|$|R
25|$|In {{the often}} {{encountered}} case of I= 1/2 nuclei (e.g., 1H, 19F, 31P), the line intensities {{produced by a}} population of radicals, each possessing M equivalent nuclei, will follow Pascal's triangle. For example, the spectrum at the right shows that the three 1H nuclei of the CH3 radical give rise to 2MI+ 1= 2(3)(1/2)+ 1= 4 lines with a 1:3:3:1 ratio. The <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> gives a hyperfine coupling constant of aH = 23 G {{for each of the}} three 1H nuclei. Note again that the lines in this spectrum are first derivatives of absorptions.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the source}} of an EPR {{spectrum}} {{is a change in}} an electron's spin state, it might be thought that all EPR spectra for a single electron spin would consist of one line. However, the interaction of an unpaired electron, by way of its magnetic moment, with nearby nuclear spins, results in additional allowed energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra. In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei. The hyperfine coupling constant of a nucleus {{is directly related to the}} spectral <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a novel dichromatic-based method for {{estimating}} illuminant chromaticity. The proposed method is essentially based on the Dichromatic Slope and Dichromatic <b>Line</b> <b>Space</b> that we introduce. Dichromatic slope is {{the slope of the}} dichromatic line that passes the image chromaticity of a pixel in chromaticity space. It is specularity-invariant and can be computed for each pixel. Accordingly, each pixel can be projected into a three-dimensional dichromatic <b>line</b> <b>space</b> defined in terms of image chromaticity and dichromatic slope. Reliable dichromatic lines can then be obtained by detecting local maxima in dichromatic <b>line</b> <b>space.</b> Illuminant chromaticity is easily estimated by finding the intersections of the resulting dichromatic lines. The proposed method has some advantages. It does not require precise color segmentation, and therefore, can deal with highly textured images. In addition, the proposed method does not suffer from nearly parallel dichromatic lines and it can estimate artificial illuminant chromaticity. ...|$|R
