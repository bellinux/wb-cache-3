The {{cationic}} peptide dendrons synthesized {{and studied}} are lower generation polylysine-based partial dendrimers {{with or without}} lipid chains in the core. The dendrons with lipidic chains can be utilized as protein and liposomal mimics because of their unique structural properties. The full assignments of three different dendrons (<b>L)</b> (<b>NH),</b> (C) (<b>L)</b> (<b>NH)</b> and (C) (<b>L)</b> (<b>NH)</b> were obtained in DO and HO/DO using a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. The hydrophobic lipidic core of branched polylysine dendrons was found to induce aggregation upon increasing concentration. Because non-lipidic dendrons do not self-assemble, the behaviour and internal structural features of two different dendrons with one and three C hydrocarbon chains were explored. The critical association concentration clearly depends {{on the number of}} core hydrophobic residues and the association starts at 0. 025 mM for (C) (<b>L)</b> (<b>NH)</b> and 0. 05 mM for (C) (<b>L)</b> (<b>NH).</b> Chemical shift analysis also revealed that the hydrophobic chains of the dendrons associate in the core, whereas the polar head groups (NH) are mainly located at the surfaces of the aggregates. The T relaxation time measurements showed that the mobility of the hydrocarbon chain is greater with the monomeric form of dendron (C) (<b>L)</b> (<b>NH)</b> than that of monomer (C) (<b>L)</b> (<b>NH).</b> The inter-chain hydrophobic interactions restrict the flexibility of the dendron with three hydrocarbon chains. As expected, the flexibility of the monomeric form is higher than that of the aggregated state for both of the dendrons. Copyright ?? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

Five concentrations of ammonium chloride were tested using 96 -h static-renewal toxicity tests at 12 and 208 C. Based on their respective mean 96 -h lethal concentration to 50 % (LC 50 s), V. iris (0. 11 mg/ <b>L</b> <b>NH</b> 3 -N) was more sensitive than L. fasciola (0. 26 mg/L NH 3 -N). At 96 h, significant differences in sensitivity to un-ionized ammonia between the two temperatures were not observed for either species. Comparison of LC 50 s reported for other aquatic organisms to the 96 -h LC 50 s calculated for juvenile L. fasciola and V. iris shows these two mussel species {{to be among the}} most sensitive to un-ionized ammonia. Based on reported levels of un-ionized ammonia in the aquatic environment from anthropogenic sources, un-ionized ammonia may be an important limiting toxicological factor to freshwater mussel populations.

The optimization involves the testing of a new range of capacitors between 47 and 330 pF and inductors from 18 to 56 nH on a fabricated reconfigurable WIMAX antenna (RWA). Advanced Design System (ADS) software is deployed to obtain simulation results using the touchstone block implementation technique. Four sets of the capacitor—inductor values are proposed based on the reflection coefficient (S 11) and transmission coefficient (S 21) to possibly achieve the best performance of the RWA. The four sets are; set 1 : C = 47 pF, <b>L</b> = 56 <b>nH,</b> set 2 : C = 100 pF, <b>L</b> = 56 <b>nH,</b> set 3 : C = 150 pF, <b>L</b> = 56 <b>nH</b> and set 4 : C = 330 pF, <b>L</b> = 56 <b>nH.</b> It is discovered that by simulation, set 2 produces the optimal S 11 and S 21 {{compared to the other}} combination sets.

At subsequent periodic data gathering, 37 % of the poults in Trial I and 27 % of the poults in Trial II exhibited NH before developing the typical normal transitional to round heart (NT- » R) ECG pattern of the round heart syndrome. Necropsy findings confirmed myocardial alterations in a majority of the poults with N H whether or not the typical round heart ECG pattern ensued. Application of this finding is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{sewage sludge}} cake from textile {{manufacturing}} was evaluated by soil incubation experiments and a greenhouse experiment {{for use as}} a soil amendment to provide crop N. Although the sludge had 96 % of N in organic combination, 20 % of total sludge N was released to soil as mineral N over 28 days. N mineralization from the sludge was indistinguishable from that seen for alfalfa shoot in parallel incubations. However, nitrification inhibition was seen for the alfalfa amendment. Soil respiration was low for the sludge treatments compared to the alfalfa treatments, suggesting that carbon substrates in the sludge were less easily broken down. A second incubation experiment indicated that fine fragmentation of the sludge is not necessary to ensure mineralization proceeds. In a greenhouse experiment, sludge N was approximately 25 % as available to Zea mays <b>L.</b> as <b>NH</b> 4 NO 3. The textile manufacturing sludge offered potential to offset N fertilizer requirement...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of short-term nitrogen (N) enrichment on Gracilariopsis heteroclada growth and agar quality. Planting materials were soaked in different concentrations of ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) for 6 h. Total thallus N content was highest in Gp. heteroclada enriched in 300 mg <b>l</b> - 1 <b>NH</b> 4 Cl. Growth experiments showed that this enrichment treatment (300 mg <b>l</b> - 1 <b>NH</b> 4 Cl for 6 h) increased the growth of Gp. heteroclada (4. 22 Â± 0. 09 % day - 1) compared with the control (3. 68 Â± 0. 12 % day - 1). Pond culture using enriched Gp. heteroclada resulted in high growth rates (6. 14 Â± 0. 50 % day - 1). No epiphyte growth was observed during either the growth experiment or the pond culture. There {{were no significant differences}} between the agar yields of the enriched (3. 65 Â± 0. 36 %) or control (3. 78 Â± 0. 18 %) Gp. heteroclada. Additionally, no significant differences were detected when the gel strength of the enriched (611 Â± 22 g cm - 2) and control (587 Â± 11 g cm - 2) Gp. heteroclada were compared. The results suggest that the short-term N enrichment method could be an alternative culture strategy to increase Gp. heteroclada production and lower farming costs.

30|$|Protection against orally {{challenged}} S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains on male BALB/c mice by oral feeding with Lactobacillus rhamnosus NH 001 {{have been}} associated with the ability to confer immune enhancement. Results showed that infected and treated mice produced higher serum and intestinal titers of anti-Salmonella antibodies, higher ex vivo phagocyte capability, significant decrement in mean pathogen infection on liver and spleen and higher survival to infection respect the control group (Gill et al. 2001). Protection mechanisms have been also observed in BALB/c male mice fed with Bifidobacterium lactis strain HN 109 isolated from yogurt, conferring protection against Salmonella infection by those mechanisms described above for <b>L.</b> rhamnosus <b>NH</b> 001, including a reduced translocation of Salmonella in spleen and liver (Shu et al. 2000). Finally, colonization experiments with axenic C 3 /He/Oujco male mice with two strains of Bifidobacterium sp. isolated from infant stools protected challenged mice against infection of S. enterica serovar Typhymurium. Protection mechanisms were associated with colonization of the digestive tract of germ-free mice assayed and the efficient antimicrobial activity against infected Salmonella by established bifidobacteria (Lievin et al. 2000).|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{disappearance}} of atomic oxygen was measured at several pressures in a fast flow pyrex reactor system with its walls treated with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 (s), H 2 SO 4 (<b>l),</b> and <b>NH</b> 4 CL (s). Atomic oxygen, P- 3 was generated by dissociation of pure, low pressure oxygen {{in a microwave}} discharge. Concentrations of atomic oxygen were measured at several stations in the reactor system using chemiluminescent titration with NO 2. Recombination efficiencies calculated from experimentally determined wall recombination rate constants are in good agreement with reported values for clean Pyrex and an H 2 SO 4 coated wall. The recombination efficiency for (NH 4) 2 SO 4, results in a slightly lower value than for H 2 S 04. A rapid exothermic reaction between atomic oxygen and the NH 4 Cl wall coating prevented recombination efficiency determination for this coating. The {{results show that the}} technique is highly useful for wall recombination measurements and as a means of extrapolating to the case of free stream aerosol-gas interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{observation}} that alkylation of amine ligands {{can lead to}} enhanced coordination to silver(I) is investigated through the determination of structures and incremental binding enthalpies for Ag+(L), ionic clusters (with <b>L</b> = <b>NH</b> 3, NH 2 Me, NHMe 2, NMe 3, H 2 O, MeOH, and Me 2 O for n = 1 - 2), using density-functional and CCSD(T) electronic structure methods. For the nonalkylated complexes Ag+(H 2 O), Ag+(NH 3), Ag+(H 2 O) (2), and Ag+(NH 3) (2), the calculated binding enthalpies agreed well with experimental values for all but Ag+(NH 3) (2), while good agreement between the binding entropies was achieved for all but Ag+(H 2 O). As {{a function of the}} degree of alkylation, the calculated binding enthalpies initially increase but then decrease. The results are interpreted in terms of the bonding models of Meyerstein and of Deng et al. as arising from increased ligand sigma -donating ability and reduced ion-ligand electrostatic interactions. It is clear that gas-phase effects are insufficient to explain the sometimes observed increased binding energies of tertiary macrocyclic amines compared to secondary ones...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations of the ammonia and methanol-based clathrate hydrates {{with the emphasis}} on characterizing hydrogen-bonding interactions of these guest molecules with the water lattice. Systems studied include structure II (sII) binary clathrate hydrates of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (large cage, <b>L)</b> + <b>NH</b> 3 (small cage, S) and THF (L) + CH 3 OH (S), the structure I (sI) pure <b>NH</b> 3 (<b>L),</b> pure CH 3 OH (<b>L),</b> the binary <b>NH</b> 3 (<b>L)</b> + CH 4 (S), and binary CH 3 OH (L) + CH 4 (S) clathrate hydrates. We simulated these clathrate hydrates with the transferable intermolecular potential with four point changes (TIP 4 P) water potential and the TIP 4 P/ice water potential to determine the effect of the water potential on the predicted hydrogen bonding of the guest molecules. Simulations show that, despite strongly hydrogen bonding with the framework water molecules, clathrate hydrate phases with NH 3 and CH 3 OH can be stable within temperatures ranges up to 240 K. Indeed, a limited number of thermodynamic integration free energy calculations show that both NH 3 and CH 3 OH molecules give more stable guest-host configurations in the large sI clathrate hydrate cages than methane guests. Predictions of hydrogen bonding from simulations with the two different water potentials used can differ substantially. To study the effect of proton transfer from water to the basic NH 3 guests, simulations were performed on a binary NH 3 + CH 4 sI clathrate hydrate where less than 10 % of the ammonia guests in the large cages were converted to NH 4 + and a water molecule of the hydrate lattice in the same large cage was converted to OH-. The small percentage of proton transfer to ammonia guests in the large cages did not affect the stability of the resultant hydrate. The structural perturbations in the lattice that result from this proton transfer are characterized. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

The complexes were characterised by elemental analysis, conductance, TGA, UV-Visible, IR and NMR spectral studies. Both the peroxide {{and the other}} ligands acts as chelates coordinating through their oxygen at C (2) and nitrogen at N (3) {{and the presence of}} monomeric oxoperoxovanadium (V) species, have been established by IR, 1 H and 51 V NMR studies. The complexes appeared to possess pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. The terminal oxo ligand and the oxygen of the uracil or cytosine at C (2) occupy the axial position while the peroxide and the other donor ligands are in the equatorial position. The UV spectral studies confirm the presence of Vanadium in its + 5 oxidation state. The administration of the potassium salts of the complexes reduces the blood glucose level in Swiss Albino mice compared to that of KVO 3. The complexes also readily oxidise cysteine to Cystine in aqueous solution. The possible mechanism for the insulin-mimic activity of the complexes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of MoL 3 [L = NH 2 and N(tBu) Ar] with CO was explored using DFT {{in order to}} rationalize why CO cleavage is not observed experimentally for this system {{in contrast to the}} corresponding N 2 reaction which results in spontaneous cleavage of the N-N bond. The binding of CO to MoL 3 was found to be both kinetically and thermodynamically favored over the binding of N 2, with the formation of the encounter complex, L 3 Mo-CO, calculated to be without barrier and exothermic. While the overall reaction to form the C-MoL 3 and O-MoL 3 products was calculated to be energetically favorable, both the encounter complex and intermediate dimer, L 3 Mo-CO-MoL 3, were found to be lower in energy than the products, with the final C-O cleavage step calculated to be endothermic by 169 kJ mol- 1 and 163 kJ mol- 1 for <b>L</b> = <b>NH</b> 2 and N(tBu) Ar, respectively. The unfavorable CO cleavage step {{can be attributed to the}} fact that Mo does not possess the optimum d-electron configuration to sufficiently stabilise the carbide and oxide products relative to the CO-bridged intermediate dimer...|$|R

When exposed to 2 mmol <b>l</b> − 1 <b>NH</b> 4 HCO 3 or 15 N-labelled ammonia solution for 4 days, the rate of urea excretion increased to seven {{times that of the}} control (in 20 % synthetic sea water) and remained at this level for 4 days. The proportion of nitrogen excreted as urea reached 62 % of total nitrogen excretion (ammonia-N + urea-N). 15 N-enrichment of the amide-N in glutamine in the tissues of fish exposed to 15 N-labelled ammonia was virtually {{the same as that of}} ammonia-N: i. e. approximately twice that of urea-N in the excreta and the tissues. Glutamine contents and glutamine synthetase activities in the liver and muscle increased greatly following exposure to ammonia. Urea and citrulline Summary contents in the muscle and whole body of the exposed fish increased significantly, whereas uric acid contents remained unchanged. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III (CPSase III) mRNA expression and CPSase III activity were detected in the muscle, skin and gill, but levels were negligible in the liver. Furthermore, all other ornithine–urea cycle (O-UC) enzymes were also detected in muscle, skin and gill. Thus, M. abei clearly shows the transition from ammoniotely to ureotely under ammonialoading condition and is able to produce urea mainly via the O-UC operating in multiple non-hepatic tissues as a means for ammonia detoxification...|$|R

Solution behavior, lipophilicity, cytotoxicity with regard to one colorectal (HCT 116) and two ovarian (A 2780 and A 2780 Cp 8) human carcinoma cell lines, and in vitro DNA- and G-quadruplex-binding properties were evaluated. In particular, the cytotoxicity of [PtCl 2 (NH 3) (2 -aminonaphthalene) ] was better than that of cisplatin for all cell lines, and rather resembled that of oxaliplatin. The solution behavior of the whole series of complexes and the absence of an evident relationship between lipophilicity and cytotoxicity seem to suggest that all these experimental parameters are probably smoothed out during the 3 -day cytotoxicity experiments and do not strongly affect the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations. The results of electrophoretic studies indicate that different kinds of interaction with DNA can be involved in the mode of action of these complexes, with intercalation in double-stranded DNA and stacking on G-quadruplex DNA being strongly implicated in particular for [PtCl 2 (NH 3) (2 -aminonaphthalene) ]...|$|R
