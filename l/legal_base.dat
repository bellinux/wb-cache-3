25|$|El Capitan has a {{controversial}} history regarding BASE jumping, and the National Park Service has effectively banned the practice. Michael Pelkey and Brian Schubert {{made the first}} BASE jump from El Capitan on July 24, 1966. Both men sustained broken bones from the jump. During the 1970s and with better equipment and training, many BASE jumpers made successful and safe jumps from El Capitan. In 1980 the National Park Service experimented with issuing BASE-jumping permits. The first <b>legal</b> <b>BASE</b> jump was performed on August 4, 1980 by Dean Westgaard of Laguna Beach. These legal jumps resulted in no major injuries or fatalities. However, some jumpers exhibited significant disregard for the park's rules and the environment. After a trial lasting only ten weeks, the National Park Service ceased issuing permits and effectively shut down all BASE jumping on El Capitan. On October 22, 1999, BASE jumper and stuntwoman Jan Davis died during a jump protesting {{the death of a}} jumper who had landed safely but drowned while fleeing park rangers.|$|E

2500|$|The Capistrano {{decision}} also {{rejected the}} argument that higher water tier prices that exceed the cost of service may be justified as “penalties” not within the purview of Proposition 218 restrictions. [...] In holding that this argument is inconsistent with Proposition 218, the court stated that “t would open up a loophole in article XIII D, section 6, subdivision (b)(3) [...] so large it would virtually repeal it. All an agency supplying any service would {{need to do to}} circumvent article XIII D, section 6, subdivision (b)(3), would be to establish a low <b>legal</b> <b>base</b> use for that service, pass an ordinance to the effect that any usage above the base amount is illegal, and then decree that the penalty for such illegal usage equals the incrementally increased rate for that service.

A scrutiny of the content of the third part shows that the work of the legal experts from the Commission, the Council and the Parliament, has been far more innovative as it might seem at first glance.
