500|$|La Coupole (...) , {{also known}} as the Coupole d'Helfaut-Wizernes and {{originally}} codenamed Bauvorhaben 21 (Building Project 21) or Schotterwerk Nordwest (Northwest Gravel Works), is a Second World War bunker complex in the Pas-de-Calais department of northern France, about [...] from Saint-Omer, and some 14.4 kilometers (8.9 miles) south-southeast from the less developed Blockhaus d'Eperlecques V-2 launch installation in the same area. It was built by the forces of Nazi Germany between 1943 and 1944 to serve as a <b>launch</b> <b>base</b> for V-2 rockets directed against London and southern England, and is the earliest known precursor to modern underground missile silos still in existence.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Sonic and Tails {{approach}} Angel Island {{in their}} biplane, the [...] "Tornado". Sonic jumps {{off the plane}} and, using the Chaos Emeralds, turns into Super Sonic, and zooms towards the island. When they arrive, Knuckles ambushes Sonic from underground, steals the emeralds, and disappears inland. As Sonic and Tails travel through the island, they frequently encounter Knuckles and Robotnik, who hinder their progress with various traps. Sonic and Tails eventually arrive at the <b>Launch</b> <b>Base,</b> where the destroyed Death Egg is being repaired. They fight with Knuckles, but the Death Egg launches back into the sky, leaving him behind. They fight Robotnik one last time on a platform attached to {{the underside of the}} Death Egg. They defeat him, and the resulting explosion drops [...] Sonic and Tails away from the Death Egg, which crash-lands farther off on Angel Island again. The story continues in Sonic & Knuckles.|$|E

500|$|Aloy {{locates the}} {{remnants}} of the company Faro Automated Solutions and discovers that the old world was destroyed nearly 1000 years ago after Faro lost control of its automated [...] "peacekeeper" [...] military robots. The robots, which could self-replicate and consumed biomass as fuel, overran the planet and consumed the biosphere, stripping Earth of all life. Project Zero Dawn, a top secret project spearheaded by Dr. Sobeck, was a plan to create an automated terraforming system to eventually shut the robots down and restore life to Earth. Aloy is then contacted by Sylens (Lance Reddick), a secretive figure interested in uncovering what happened to the [...] "Old Ones". Aloy eventually learns that Dr. Sobeck was sent to an Orbital <b>Launch</b> <b>Base</b> to complete Zero Dawn and Sylens reveals that the base is located under the Citadel, the centre of Eclipse power. Aloy heads for the base and inside, she learns that Zero Dawn was a vast underground system of databases, factories, and cloning facilities all controlled by a single artificial intelligence named GAIA (Lesley Ewen). Once all life had been extinguished, GAIA developed a countermeasure to deactivate all of the Faro robots and then build its own robots to restore the Earth's biosphere. Once the planet was habitable again, GAIA reseeded life on Earth based on stored DNA and taught the first human clones not to repeat their predecessors' past mistakes. It is also revealed that HADES was one of GAIA's subsystems designed to enact controlled extinction if the outcome of Zero Dawn was not favourable for human existence. Aloy reaches Dr. Sobeck's office, where she downloads a registry to give her access to the door from which she was born. She is captured by Helis and sentenced to death at the Citadel, but escapes with the help of Sylens.|$|E
