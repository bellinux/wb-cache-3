30|$|Where {{there is}} {{significant}} yaw movement, part of the yaw rotation is manifested as a distributed curvature along the track bridge and part as concentrated rotations at the ends. The extent of each is governed by the lateral bending stiffness of the frame {{made up of the}} (<b>longitudinal)</b> <b>rails</b> and the (transverse) bearer bars. The fasteners that connect the rails to the bearer bars allow some rotation, and if fasteners with no longitudinal restraint are used, then the rotation is essentially free, so that system is flexible and promotes distributed curvature along the track bridge. Guard rails mounted rigidly in the track panel provide more frame action, make the track bridge stiffer, and thus force more of the total rotation into the concentrated rotations at the ends of the track bridge.|$|E

A finite element model was used to predict the implications on acceleration time history by yield-strength variation of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rails.</b> Results indicate that lower mean deceleration can be attained by lower-yield-stress material, but caution must be taken to avoid stiff engine-firewall contact as this can create high mean decelerations.

Construction of the OBS assumes the use of the SKYLON Single-Stage-to-Orbit (SSTO) spaceplane, which imposes design and assembly constraints due to its payload mass limits and payload bay dimensions. It is assumed that the space transport infrastructure and high mission energy vehicles would also make use of SKYLON to deploy standard transport equipment and stages bound by these same constraints. The OBS is therefore a highly modular arrangement, incorporating some of these other vehicle system elements in its layout design. Architecturally, the facilities of the OBS are centred around the assembly dock which is in the form a large cylindrical spaceframe structure with two large doors on either end incorporating a skin of aluminised Mylar to enclose the dock. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>rails</b> provide internal tether attachments to anchor vehicles and components while manipulators are used for the handling and assembling of vehicle structures.

40|$|Abstract. Current crash {{structures}} in cars are still using the buckling of metallic structures {{to absorb the}} kinetic energy {{in case of an}} impact. The disadvantage of this technology is that changes within the static structural behaviour, like e. g. the stiffness or eigenfrequencies, will cause changes in the crash behaviour, even if this is not desired. This correlation between static and dynamic behaviour causes many development loops to adjust the crash behaviour, e. g. through optimizing trigger geometries which lower the initial crash forces. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Vehicle Concepts has developed a novel method to offer an efficient way of absorbing energy by peeling the outer skin of load bearing structures, like the crash boxes and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rails.</b> This technology provides an adjustable force level without changing the static behaviour of the front structure itself. This property offers the opportunity to create adaptable crash behaviour with only smallest changes within the peeling depth. Furthermore, it is possible to generate close to ideal force-deflection curves, which offers the potential to achieve high specific energy absorption. The DLR will show results of static and dynamic testing of crash tubes and of a vehicle front structure equipped with this mechanism. In addition the implementation of the methodology into the dynamic simulation with LS-Dyna will be shown. Benefits and limitations of this novel energy absorption method will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine and rank the Small Overlap Frontal Crash as one of the eight-group taxonomy proposed by Ford. The Ford taxonomy classifies real-world frontal-impact crashes based on the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS). Frontally-impacted vehicles were identified for 1985 – 2008 model year passenger vehicles with Collision Deformation Classification (CDC) data from the 1995 – 2008 years of NASS. Small overlap frontal cases were identified where there was no engagement of the vehicle frame rails, and the direct damage was located entirely outside of the vehicle frame rails. The results are that full engagement and offset (offset category means the direct damage overlaps the vehicle frame rail, with the center of direct damage between the frame rails) were the most frequent crashes contributing 35 % each. The frequency of the small overlap frontal was 6 %. The risks of injury (AIS ≥ 2) for the full engagement, offset, and small overlap were 8 %, 6 %, and 3 % respectively. For this study, the number of small overlap vehicles was 1, 118 and the number of injured nearside occupants was 100. This study—following the Ford approach and reasonably identifying the location of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rails</b> based on CDC—suggests that the small overlap is at worst a moderately dangerous crash in the overall scheme of frontal crashes. The implications of this study are that the safety community should reexamine the significance of the small overlap frontal crash against an overall taxonomy of crashes...|$|E
30|$|Continuously welded rails (CWRs) are an {{important}} technology in modern railway track structures. Nowadays, most new railways worldwide belong to super long continuously welded rail tracks.

A set of identical specimen which was simplified from actual automotive <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rail</b> was fabricated, and quasi-static testing (i. e., compression and bending test) were conducted. The main {{objective of this}} research was to study the failure mode, bending and tensile behaviour of the structure under bending and axial compression. In order to get the compressive load-displacement response and its corresponding deformation pattern, the compression test was carried out using a Universal Testing Machine. Stress-strain curve and energy absorption of the specimen were derived from the compressive load-displacement response. It was found that the quasi-static response of the specimen in compression case was affected by the number and position of spot welds. For the bending test, the bending load was found to be fluctuated with the displacement in a way analogous to the folding behaviour and deformation of the cross-section of the specimen. Bending moment-rotation characteristic was derived from bending load-displacement curve to investigate the energy absorption of the specimen in bending case. Lastly, the von Mises stress at the top and bottom surface of the specimen is increased with increment of the punch head travel distance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Considerable <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rail</b> {{forces and}} {{displacements}} may develop in {{continuous welded rail}} (CWR) track on long-span bridges due to temperature variations. The track stability may be disturbed due to excessive relative displacements between the sleepers and ballast bed and the accompanied reduction in frictional resistance. For high-speed tracks, however, solving these problems by installing rail expansion devices in the track is not an attractive solution as these devices may cause a local disturbance of the vertical track stiffness and track geometry which will require intensive maintenance. With reference to temperature, two actions are considered by the bridge loading standards, the uniform variation in the rail and deck temperature and the temperature gradient in deck. Generally, the effect of temperature gradient has been disregarded in the interaction analysis. This paper mainly deals with the effect of temperature gradient on the track-bridge interaction {{with respect to the}} support reaction, rail stresses and stability.

30|$|The {{technology}} of continuously welded rails (CWRs) {{is important in}} modern railway track structures. To measure rail stress, resistance strain gauges are preferred due to their good stability, sensitivity, and resistance to external interference. Based on the bi-directional strain method, we present a new method for measuring <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rail</b> stress using resistance strain gauges and develop a monitoring device for rail stress to realize long-term and multi-point measurement. Also relevant experimental verification and analysis are conducted. Results indicate that under various constraints the rail stress–strain values can be calculated just with the measured total longitudinal strain and total vertical strain. Considering the measurement error caused by sectional feature of sensors, we put forward a correction equation applicable to different stress conditions. Although the temperature values of the four full-bridge stress gauges can offset each other, the measurement error caused by rail flexural strain can also be eliminated {{to a certain extent}} at the same time, the non-uniform distribution of rail cross section temperature and unbalanced flexural strain still affect the measurement error. The experimental results also show that the developed rail-stress-monitoring sensor is suitable for measuring rail stress with reliable working performance.|$|R

As rails used for testing had different histories in terms of accumulated tonnage, the test data were corrected to average out the accumulated tonnage. We estimated the remaining service lives for laid rails on the urban railway using equations developed {{in the past to}} estimate rail base bending stress and that surface irregularities into consideration.

30|$|Due to solar radiation, {{temperature}} distribution along the vertical {{direction of a}} simply supported beam bridge section is nonuniform, which would cause warping deformation of bridge. The deformation causes vertical displacement and additional <b>longitudinal</b> force of <b>rail</b> because {{of the interaction between}} bridge and track. The increased longitudinal force affects the strength and stability of CWR [5, 6], and vertical displacement of rail causes vertical irregularity, thus affecting the riding comfort of vehicles. In some extreme conditions, the vertical displacement and longitudinal force both become large, and result in buckling of track. Researchers such as Tao et al. [7], Ye et al. [8], and Lee [9] expatiated on the {{temperature distribution}} of bridge. Kumar et al. [10] found that temperature difference load (TDL) could significantly increase the <b>longitudinal</b> force of <b>rail</b> under the assumption that temperature was distributed linearly along the vertical direction of a bridge section, and hence suggested that the impact of TDL should be considered into the design of CWR on bridge. An et al. [11] studied the effect of TDL on the additional expansion and contraction force of CWR. These studies, however, only considered the effect of TDL on <b>longitudinal</b> force of <b>rail,</b> but ignored the effect of load on the vertical displacement of rail.|$|R

The investigation and analysis has led to insights into track behaviour and stress state. The study concluded that the conventional rail creep method is useful for general indications of track stress condition and follows a similar trend to rail stress monitor data.

40|$|Thermally-induced {{longitudinal}} stress in continuously welded rail (CWR) is a recognized problem within the railroad industry {{in terms of}} both safety and maintenance. Daily and seasonal temperature cycles can lead to high <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rail</b> stress that can result in rail failure. Ultrasonic nondestructive techniques have been previously attempted to monitor this stress. These techniques have had many limitations such that alternative methods are of great interest. The research illustrated in this thesis is a novel attempt at a solution to address these needs. The technique is based on ultrasonic backscatter which results from the multitude of reflections that occur at grain boundaries due to the variation of the single-crystal elastic constants. The resultant backscatter has previously been theoretically modeled and is influenced by the material’s stress state through the covariance of elastic moduli. This thesis aims to present experimental confirmation of the stress influence on ultrasonic backscatter. Backscatter results are presented for mechanically and thermally-induced uniaxial stresses in various samples. The results indicate that backscatter is a sensitive indicator of a material’s stress state. The sensitivity leads to the belief that this technique may form the starting point for reliable stress measurement devices used on CWR and other structural components. Advisor: Joseph A.

In the present paper, the effect of environmental variations on corrugation growth are investigated using field measurements and mechanics-based modelling. Statistically significant relationships between average daily rainfall, humidity {{and the growth of}} rail corrugation were investigated using meterological and railway site field monitoring of a metropolitan network test site with a recurring rail corrugation of about 95 mm wavelength.

The modelling is developed to provide insight and mechanics based analysis of the field corrugation growth under changes in environmental conditions and vehicle speed variability. Results show a strong correlation between variations in rainfall and corrugation growth that is consistent with changes in steady state wear. Changes in contact patch geometry and the damage mechanism as the corrugation amplitude grows are shown to have substantial but slower effects on growth.

40|$|Monitoring the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rail</b> {{movement}} or rail creep {{is regarded as}} one of the effective ways to understand the rail-stress states in critical locations such as fixed structures (level crossings,turnouts and fixed top bridges), in sags at the bottom of gradients or any track segment with a history of buckles. However, rail stress can be changed due to thermal and mechanical loads in both longitudinal and vertical directions. Many railway companies use a fixed schedule to assess rail creep, particularly in critical locations. This may not be adequate to reduce the risk of summerbuckling and winter pull-apart problems. Current practice of creep measurement does not consider the effect of rail temperature, the vertical movement of track, inherent inaccuracy of the measurement system and any non-uniformity in track structures. In a field test, Total Station Survey equipment has been used to monitor the changes inlongitudinal and vertical displacements of the rail at points on a tangent track section in the heavy haul Blackwater system of the QR National network at Edungalba. This 26 tonne axle load track section with 1 % gradient and 60 kg/m rail was instrumented with strain gauges, thermocouples and rail stress modules.

By the help of the simulations, all mode conversions at the crack and rail surfaces were cleared up leading to a better understanding and inerpretation of the recieved signals. A significant attenuation of the rail bottom echo for the three different crack locations were found for both, shear and longitudinal waves. The most important difference between the two wave modes is the fact the interaction between primary shear wavefront and crack or rail surfaces does not produce new echoes in the A-scan like head-waves or secondary echoes as descriebed for the P-wave. It should be mentioned that the method using piezoelectric shear wave transducers is unpracticable for fast testing of resl rails in railway tracks due to coupling-problems. But this can be solved bhy using EMA-transducers. Further investigations should i nvolve more realistic crack geometries and various crack parameters such as width, length, depth, orientation, surface roughness and so on, different frequencies and moreover, shear waves with a polarization plane perpendicular to the rail cross-section.

High <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rail</b> stresses contribute to many problems such as track buckling, rail joint failure, rail breakage and failure of turnouts. The direct and indirect costs of track buckling problems are very high. The influences of rail temperature, SFT and lateral misalignment of track on track buckling need comprehensive investigation. In this paper, an experimental design comprising strain gauges, thermocouples and rail stress sensors has been implemented on the QR heavy haul 60 kg/m rail network. A new creep measurement technique using internal rail stress has been developed. The changes in rail neutral temperature due to the variation of actual rail temperature and the occurrence of rail creep in straight and curved track is quantified. Modes of differences of SFT in the two rails at a location, and of SFT in straight track and in curved track are discussed. The relationship of SFT to rail temperature is also presented. Daily variation in rail temperature due to ambient air temperature is presented. Field trials showed that SFT can vary by 2 - 30 C during the day. Based on this finding and the derivation of an equation for change of SFT, an improvement in utilising rail creep measurements for assessing track condition has resulted. This finding suggests {{that it is possible to}} determine the SFT throughout a day rather than just a single SFT value. This paper also presents a simple track stability management tool that is based on two major parameters, namely rail stress and track resistance.

40|$|Buckling of {{railroad}} track {{continues to be}} problematic for railway engineers and maintenance personnel across all railway networks. Thermal forces are the principal longitudinal load on railroad track. In an effort to ensure track stability under dynamic loads, the magnitude to which longitudinal thermal stresses develop {{is controlled by the}} choice of an appropriate Design Neutral Temperature (DNT). The <b>longitudinal</b> movement of <b>rail,</b> referred to as creep, causes a deviation of the rails’ neutral temperature (RNT) from that of the DNT. It is crucial that the RNT is maintained at or near the DNT to provide the necessary leeway for dynamic traffic loads and ensure lateral stability of the track. However, techniques for monitoring the RNT are very limited and difficult to employ. Railway networks generally rely on preventative measures, such as track strengthening work, to control the risk of buckles occurring. This approach to managing the risk of track buckles is resource hungry and time consuming. This project develops a recursive methodology for identifying situations where the <b>longitudinal</b> movement of <b>rail</b> is likely to result in the accumulation of longitudinal stresses, which is conducive to buckling. The methodology has been developed for the Western and South-Western systems of Queensland Rail.
