5|$|Fagrskinna and Heimskringla largely follow Oddr's account but simplify it and diverge {{from it in}} some respects. According to Heimskringla, Sigvaldi sailed from Wendland with Olaf and a {{fleet of}} Wendish ships and <b>led</b> <b>him</b> into the ambush.|$|E
5|$|His {{comparative}} studies of religions and interaction with scholars, <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to respect all religions {{as well as}} become concerned about imperfections {{in all of them}} and frequent misinterpretations. Gandhi grew fond of Hinduism, and referred to the Bhagavad Gita as his spiritual dictionary and greatest single influence on his life.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Miller (1802–56) from Cromarty was a stonemason and self-taught geologist. His 1841 {{publication}} The Old Red Sandstone {{became a}} bestseller.

5|$|Kohlberg {{suggested}} {{that there may be}} a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning.

5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Atheis came, according to Oemarjati, {{sometime during the}} early 1940s. In Mihardja's observations, Marxism–Leninism and anarcho-nihilism {{were among the most}} common ideologies in Indonesia; this <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to depict Rusli and Anwar as holding those ideologies. Meanwhile, emerging writers such as Idrus, Asrul Sani, and Chairil Anwar were increasingly critical of the older generation of Indonesian authors, whom they decried as narrow-minded and provincial. Mihardja, who was older than many contemporary writers and wrote in a similar style to the older authors, disliked this comparison; according to Maier, this may have <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to represent Chairil Anwar as a much-flawed character. Mihardja formalised his concept throughout the early 1940s and completed the writing during a period of unemployment from May 1948 until February 1949.|$|E
5|$|This crisis <b>led</b> <b>him</b> {{to apply}} to lecture on {{philosophy}} rather than mathematics.

Edward, however, discovered the plot when Robert, Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field, and gave away the plan.|$|E

5|$|Albert Speer {{said that}} though Himmler seemed pedantic and {{insignificant}} on the surface, {{he was a}} good decision maker, had a talent for selecting highly competent staff, and successfully inserted the SS into every aspect of daily life.

5|$|Already lightly {{regarded}} {{because he}} was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead of a party primary, Fields further weakened his position due {{to some of his}} personal preferences.

He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, but he and his wife did not attend. Fields' frugality also <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had {{left him with a}} good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career.

His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
