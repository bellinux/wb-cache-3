5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian National Union, invited the Christian Democrats {{to join them}} in forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. <b>Looking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup. In keeping with this strategy, they allowed members of the Lithuanian National Union to take over the most prominent posts.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> planet. Its orientation {{is such that}} the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface {{is thought to be}} {{near the edge of the}} Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E

5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they are perceived as three groups, then the pictures {{in each of the}} three units inform upon each other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E
5|$|The Second Treaty of Paris in 1783 {{ended the}} American Revolution and {{established}} the United States of America. The treaty extended the new country's western boundary to the Mississippi River {{and within the}} first year after it was signed 50,000American settlers crossed the Appalachian Mountains. As it was difficult to return east across the mountains, the settlers began <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Spanish colonies of Louisiana and Texas to find places to sell their crops. Spain closed the mouth of the Mississippi to foreigners from 1784 until 1795 despite Thomas Jefferson's 1790 threat to begin an Anglo-Spanish war over the matter. Americans risked arrest to come to Texas, many of them desiring to capture wild mustangs in West Texas and trade with the Indians. In 1791, Philip Nolan became the first Anglo-American known to pursue horse-trading in Texas, and he was arrested several times for being within Spain's borders. The Spanish feared that Nolan was a spy, and in 1801 they sent 150troops to capture Nolan and his party of 6men; Nolan was killed during the ensuing battle. By 1810, many Americans were trading guns and ammunition to the Texas Indians, especially the Comanche, in return for livestock. Although some chiefs refused to trade with them and reported their movements to Spanish authorities, other bands welcomed the newcomers. A drought made rangeland scarce and stopped the Comanche's herds from increasing. To meet the American demand for livestock, the Comanche turned to raiding the area around San Antonio.|$|E

The mentions of melancholia and sadness are specific and related to particular events and illness. Richard Holmes, in his biography of Percy Shelley, argues that [...] "her agonizing and loveless suspension between the Godwin and Shelley households was clearly the root circumstance" [...] of her suicide. Locke argues that [...] "most probably because she could absorb no more of the miseries of Skinner Street, her father's inability to pay his debts or write his books, her mother's unending irritability and spitefulness", all of which she blamed on herself, she committed suicide.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Russo-Turkish war also led to the internationalization of the Armenian Question. Many Armenians in the eastern provinces (Turkish Armenia) of the Ottoman Empire greeted the advancing Russians as liberators. Violence and instability directed at Armenians during the war by Kurd and Circassian bands had left many Armenians <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> invading Russians as the ultimate guarantors of their security. In January 1878, Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople Nerses II Varzhapetian approached the Russian leadership with the view of receiving assurances that the Russians would introduce provisions in the prospective peace treaty for self-administration in the Armenian provinces.

2500|$|In Moltmann's opinion, {{all should}} be seen from an eschatological perspective, <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> days when Christ will make all things new. [...] "A proper {{theology}} would therefore have to be constructed {{in the light of}} its future goal. Eschatology should not be its end, but its beginning." [...] This does not, as many fear, 'remove happiness from the present' by focusing all ones attention toward the hope for Christ's return. Moltmann addresses this concern as such: [...] "Does this hope cheat man of the happiness of the present? How could it do so! For it is itself the happiness of the present." [...] The importance of the current times is necessary for the Theology of Hope because it brings the future events to the here and now. This theological perspective of eschatology makes the hope of the future, the hope of today.|$|E

A ceremony commemorating the disaster is held annually at the memorial every Nov 12, featuring a reading of the names of those killed aboard the aircraft and on the ground, with a formal moment of silence observed at 9:16a.m., the estimated time of the crash. The memorial wall, designed by Dominican artist Freddy Rodríguez and Situ Studio, has windows and a doorway <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> nearby Atlantic Ocean and angled toward the Dominican Republic.

2500|$|After the Revolution, {{the members}} of the Livingston family whose ancestral estate were the portion of the Hudson's eastern shore now the Hudson River Historic District, a National Historic Landmark (NHL), {{continued}} to enjoy the semi-feudal landownership they had broken with the Crown to protect. They made sure their estate houses, like Clermont Manor and Montgomery Place, both also NHLs, provided ample views of the Escarpment across the river, lands which the family had started to acquire. [...] "The view to be had from these houses became of the very first importance," [...] according to Catskill historian Alf Evers. [...] "... man <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Catskills from the east bank could see a view the equal in almost every respect to the already famous ones admired by so many tourists to England's Lake District." [...] Horatio Spafford voiced a similar opinion at the time. [...] " [...] associate a mass of interesting, picturesque and sublime objects, no where exceeded in this country", he wrote in his 1813 gazetteer of the state. Later on, they followed the principles of Andrew Jackson Downing in designing their landscapes to provide views from its roads and paths. Even after the Livingstons moved on to other regions of the country, their reputation made the Catskills known in Britain as well as the U.S.|$|E
2500|$|The god {{indicated}} that they were getting closer when they arrived at a place called Nexticpan, which is where the San Antonio Abad Hospital is now, and later to a place called Mixiuhcan, now the colonia of Magdalena Mixiuhcan. They wandered another 36years knowing that they were extremely close. Then they sent two priests named Axolóhua and Cuauhcoatl to look for the sign promised by their god. The two found an islet near the western shore of Lake Texcoco surrounded by green water. In the middle of the islet was a nopal and perched upon it was an eagle with its wings spread and its face <b>looking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sun. When the eagle left, Axolóhua submerged himself into the waters around the island and Cuaucoatl went back to report what he saw. The people were confused because what the two priests had seen was only part of the sign they were told to expect. Twenty-four hours later Axolóhua returned stating that while underwater, he saw the god Tlaloc who told him that they did indeed find the place and that they were welcome. They moved to the islet and began to construct their city. Later versions of the story have a snake in the eagle's mouth. The Mexica called their city Tenochtitlan meaning [...] "place of the nopal," [...] referring to the myth of its discovery. Gongora gives the day 18July1327, but at least three other codices (Azcatitlan, Mexicanus and Mendoza) placed the time of its founding in the year 1325, and los Anales de Tlatelolco adds the day-sign [...] "1 Zipaktli," [...] correlated to the beginning of summer solstice on 20 June.|$|E
