40|$|Abstract. In this report, delay bounds in {{data flow}} systems with non-FIFO service {{disciplines}} are explored. It is shown that conventional network calculus definitions of a service curve are not satisfying {{under the assumption}} of non-FIFO service. Either the definition is too strict {{to allow for a}} concatenation and consequent beneficial end-to-end analysis, or it is too loose and thus results in infinite delay bounds. Hence, a new definition is proposed and demonstrated to achieve both finite delay bounds and a concatenation of systems resulting in a favourable end-toend analysis. In particular, we show that the celebrated pay bursts only once phenomenon is retained under non-FIFO service. This is contrary to a finding by Rizzo and Le Boudec [20]. The reasons for this contradiction are also discussed. The new service curve definition preserves the min-plus algebraic approach known from network calculus at the cost of a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>tightness</b> of delay bounds under certain circumstances. This is shown by devising an alternative method that achieves tight bounds; this method departs from the algebraic approach. Yet, despite the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>tightness</b> the algebraic approach bears a number of advantages. Most important, it allows to deal elegantly with the frequent situation of a mixture of FIFO and non-FIFO servers, eventually resulting in better delay bounds...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} a fundamental problem of tightness of ultra-high vacuum systems (UHV) at cryogenic {{temperatures in the}} light of continuum damage mechanics (CDM). The problem of indentation of a rigid punch into an elastic-plastic half-space is investigated based on rate independent plasticity with mixed kinematic and isotropic hardening. The micro-damage fields are modeled by using an anisotropic approach with a kinetic law of damage evolution suitable for ductile materials and cryogenic temperatures. The model has been experimentally validated and the results are used to predict the onset of macro-cracking (<b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>tightness)</b> and the corresponding load (contact pressure). The algorithm is applied in the design of UHV systems for particle accelerators. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For {{a minimal}} circle homeomorphism f we study {{convergence}} in law of rescaled hitting time point process of an interval of length ε> 0. Although the point {{process in the}} natural time scale never converges in law, we study all possible limits under a subsequence. The new feature is the fact that, for rotation numbers of unbounded type, there is a sequence εn going to zero exhibiting coexistence of two non-trivial asymptotic limit point processes depending on the choice of time scales used when rescaling the point process. The phenomenon of <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>tightness</b> of the first hitting time distribution {{is an indication of}} this coexistence behaviour. Moreover, tightness occurs if and only if the rotation number is of bounded type. Therefore tightness of time distributions is an intrinsic property of badly approximable irrational rotation numbers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The fuel {{injector}} acts a double role: {{it is the}} valve of the pump supplying fuel to the combustion chamber and the device spraying a supplied dose. As the valve it may operate as a self-opening or self-closing valve, depending on the pressure produced by the fuel pump, or the valve controlled by external signals. Techniques and diagnosis methods for {{fuel injector}}s depend on a fuel injector’s control system and construction details. For practical reasons the fuel injector is a sectional valve with a separated component called atomizer. Atomizers must be cooled. It is possible to cool with fuel or with external water- or oil-cooling system. In case of liquid-cooled fuel injectors, apart from malfunctions causes known from literature, decrease of the cooling efficiency may appear, as {{the effect of the}} penetration of fuel from injector to the cooling system of injector. There are no reports concerning detectability of fuel leakage into cooling liquid with known techniques and diagnosis methods of injection systems and fuel injectors. In the article there will be presented as follows: a connection of the atomizer and injector body as the place of fuel leakage into the cooling system, reasons for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> leak <b>tightness</b> in connection <b>of</b> atomizer with the body of atomizer and methods applicable for the leak <b>tightness</b> analysis, mechanisms <b>of</b> injector’s malfunction caused by the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> leak <b>tightness.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> applied and possible methods of injectors diagnosis in the aspect of identification of said leakiness will be carried out...|$|R

In this respect the use of metallic brazes as sealing material is considered to have advantages incomparison to the widely used brittle glasses or glass ceramics. In this study the mechanical properties of reactive air brazed YSZ-steel joints and their long-term stability at high temperatures in air and dual atmospheres are investigated. Silver-based braze compositions like Ag- 4 CuO are used for reactive air brazing <b>of</b> gas <b>tightness</b> samples.

40|$|In Africacrypt 2009, Galindo and Garcia {{proposed}} a lightweight identity-based signature (IBS) {{scheme based on}} the Schnorr signature. The construction is simple and {{claimed to be the}} most efficient IBS till date. The security is argued, primarily, by using the Multiple-Forking (MF) Algorithm which is used to launch nested replay attack on the adversary and, consequently, contradict the discrete-log assumption. However, this security argument was shown to be flawed, and subsequently fixed, by Chatterjee et al [...] The resulting security, though, is still quite loose with a tightness gap of O q 6 (where q denotes the bound on the number of queries to the random oracle). The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>tightness</b> is, in fact, inherited from the MF Algorithm. In this paper, we contemplate a better security bound for Galindo-Garcia IBS (GG-IBS).

40|$|We {{consider}} the voter model on Z, starting with all 1 's {{to the left}} of the origin and all 0 's to the right of the origin. It is known that if the associated random walk kernel p has zero mean and a finite r-th moment for any r> 3, then the evolution of the boundaries of the interface region between 1 's and 0 's converge in distribution to a standard Brownian motion (B_t) _{t> 0 } under diffusive scaling of space and time.

40|$|The optimum {{cutting of}} {{various parts of}} a shoe, prior to shoe {{manufacture}} requires knowledge of the topographical variation of what are termed “lines of tightness”. Currently the cutting operation for shoe parts is guided by a general assumption about {{the pattern of the}} lines <b>of</b> <b>tightness.</b> There is a need to have available a system which can determine, in a non-destructive way, the lines <b>of</b> <b>tightness</b> in an indvidual piece of leather. Initially an image analysis system was developed to investigate the uni-axial deformation behaviour of leather. This technique provided more information about the stress-strain behaviour of a leather sample along the gauge length than a conventional mechanical test and it was possible to accurately measure the strain distribution along the gauge length. A system was developed which could determine the relative displacement of marked spots along the gauge length of the sample using images captured during a uni-axial, bi-axial or multi-axial tensile test. The separation of the marked spots along the direction of applied stroke allowed the determination of longitudinal strain while contraction across the width was also measured in some cases, which was useful in calculating the Poisson’s ratio of leather for which a great variation was observed between different locations (Butt, Belly, Neck etc). Various approaches were investigated to determine the lines <b>of</b> <b>tightness.</b> Firstly, the local Poisson’s ratio was observed since a higher value of this parameter was associated with these lines <b>of</b> <b>tightness.</b> Secondly, biaxial stretching of leather by a series of actuators for each axis indicated the lines <b>of</b> <b>tightness</b> along the actuator with lower strain values. Thirdly, the strain was measured when the leather was stretched along number of known axes. This latter technique appeared to be the best approach and mathematical modeling was investigated to provide further refinement. A mechatronics-based device by industrial application of the third approach was also proposed. The software was written using a graphical programming system (LabVJ EW) ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> {{coordination}} in supply chains quantifies the inefficiency (i. e. the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> total profit) due to {{the presence}} of competition in the supply chain. In this thesis, we discuss four models: one model with multiple retailers facing the multinomial logit demand, and three supply chain configurations with one supplier and multiple retailers in a i) quantity competition among retailers with substitute products, ii) price competition among retailers with substitute products, and iii) quantity competition among retailers with complement products, producing differentiated products under an affine demand function. As a special case, we also consider the symmetric setting in the four models where all retailers encounter identical demand, marginal costs, quality dierences, and in the multinomial logit demand case, when there are identical variances in the consumers' utility functions. The main contribution in this thesis lies in the precise quantification <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> profit due to lack of coordination, through analytical lower bounds. We provide bounds in terms of the eigenvalues of the demand sensitivity matrix, or the demand sensitivities. For the multinomial logit demand model, the lower bounds are {{in terms of the number}} of retailers and the predictability of consumer behaviour. We use simulations to provide further insights on the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> coordination and <b>tightness</b> <b>of</b> the bounds. We find that a supply chain with retailers operating under Bertrand competition offering substitute products is the most ecient with an average profit <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> less than 15 %. We also nd that competitive supply chains can be coordinated when offering substitute products. (cont.) This occurs under the symmetric setting when there is a 'reasonable' number of Cournot retailers under intense competition, or when demand is 'more' inelastic in a Bertrand competition setting. As an example, in the presence of six Cournot retailers under intense competition, the profit loss is 2. 04 %, and when demand is perfectly inelastic in a Bertrand competition, the supply chain is perfectly coordinated with profit <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 0 %. For the multinomial logit demand case, we nd that higher predictability of consumer behaviour (i. e, when consumers' choices are more deterministic) increases profits both under coordination and under competition, and a larger number of retailers decreases profits under competition, but 3 increases profits under coordination. The net result is that efficiency 'deteriorates' when the number of competitive retailers and predictability of consumer behaviour increases. by Koon Soon Teo. Thesis (S. M.)
