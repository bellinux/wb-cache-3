5|$|The American style Castle Doctrine is {{also not}} applied however it is usually {{considered}} acceptable to defend from a violent home invasion with a firearm. In 2014, an amendment of laws concerning self-defense was proposed {{with the aim of}} giving greater <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> defenders, especially in cases when they would not normally meet the bar for legitimate self-defense under the current legislation, but face extraordinary circumstances, such as confusion {{as a consequence of the}} attack, or when facing home invasion.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{session of}} the Senate begins with a call to order by the President of the Senate. After the call to order, the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At {{the discretion of the}} presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.|$|E
5|$|Technically, a slave {{could not}} own property, but a slave who {{conducted}} business might be {{given access to}} an individual account or fund (peculium) that he could use {{as if it were}} his own. The terms of this account varied depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.|$|E

The character of the passengers had largely changed, and most of them were now country folks, lumberjacks, and city people bound for a season of hunting. The steam heat had died out in the car which the boys occupied, and it was growing colder and colder.|$|R
6000|$|And I wondered. Half {{the souls}} {{of us on the}} Elsinore slept. The Samurai slept. Yet the old first mate, who should have slept, kept a bitter watch on the for'ard-house.

5|$|The Halo series {{features}} voice work {{by television}} and film actors including Ron Perlman, Orlando Jones, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert Davi, and Terence Stamp. Voice acting became more important as Halo: Combat Evolveds sequels were developed; Halo 2 had 2,000 lines of combat dialogue, while Halo 3 has {{in excess of}} 14,000 lines. The actual technology for the trilogy changed very little; while some actors voiced their lines in remote locations, others traveled to Bungie to record their lines. In interviews, Halos voice actors stated {{that they had no}} idea that the games would become such a critical and commercial success. Steve Downes, the voice of the game's protagonist, stated that generally when a voice actor has finished their lines, their involvement with the game ends. As the characters in Combat Evolved were relatively undefined, the voice actors were given <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> develop their own style and personality.|$|E
25|$|The new law {{aimed at}} harmonizing the Soviet republics' {{copyright}} laws, which had {{in some areas}} drifted apart over the years. This was achieved by making the 1991 Fundamentals more explicit and giving the republics less <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> devise their own rules.|$|E
25|$|In the Australian second innings, with Australia eight wickets {{down and}} a lead of only 75, his ninth-wicket {{partnership}} of 83 with Bob Massie gave Australia enough <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> achieve a narrow victory.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} contract design on the enforceabil-ity of quality in outsourced public contracts. Using a four-year panel data of 102 cleaning contracts, {{our findings suggest that}} quality enforcement highly depends on the ex ante contracting process. Moreover, since those quality improvements are not accompanied by prices increases, our results suggest that public contract managers have significant <b>leeways</b> <b>to</b> reduce rent-seeking behaviors for standard transactions. Such findings are in line with propositions from the theoretical literature on the endogenous veri-fiability of quality. They also depart from previous studies on this issue by focusing on determinants of enforcement that are left to the managers’ discretion...|$|R

25|$|The state {{retained}} {{both its}} powers {{and its role}} in the rural economy in the 1980s. Decollectivization, like the collectivization of the 1950s, was directed from the top down. Sometimes, apparently, it was imposed on communities that had been content with their collective methods. But in permitting households and communities greater <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> decide what to produce and in allowing the growth of rural markets and small-scale industries, the state stepped back from the close supervision and mandatory quotas of the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|After Trudeau's Liberals {{upgraded}} their minority {{government to}} {{a majority in}} the 1974 federal election, they had more <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> act on abolishing the capital punishment in Canada. In 1973, Liberals had renewed the provisions of Bill C-168, passed by Lester B. Pearson's minority government in 1968, which imposed a five-year moratorium {{on the use of the}} death penalty. With a majority behind them, Allmand and Trudeau, both ardent abolitionists, prepared to go further than Pearson had gone and decided to try and abolish the death penalty altogether.|$|E

25|$|Warren's Court ordered {{lawyers for}} indigent {{defendants}} in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), and prevented prosecutors from using evidence seized in illegal searches, in Mapp v. Ohio (1961). The famous case of Miranda v. Arizona (1966) summed up Warren's philosophy. Everyone, even one accused of crimes, still enjoyed constitutionally protected rights, {{and the police}} had to respect those rights and issue a specific warning when making an arrest. Warren {{did not believe in}} coddling criminals; thus in Terry v. Ohio (1968) he gave police officers <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> stop and frisk those they had reason to believe held weapons.|$|E
25|$|The Philippine {{government}} {{is planning to}} buy anti-aircraft guided missiles from Israel.

25|$|Due to 2012's {{national}} budget cuts, the AHR was removed. The regulation of assisted reproduction was then delegated to each province. This delegation provides provinces {{with a lot}} of <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> do as they please. As a result, provinces like Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba have put almost the full costs of IVF on the public healthcare bill. Dr. Santiago Munne, developer of the first PGD test for Down's syndrome and founder of , saw these provincial decisions as an opportunity for his company to grow and open more Reprogenetics labs around Canada. He dismissed all controversies regarding catalogue babies and states that he had no problem with perfect babies.|$|E

However, at the same time, manager Hade convinced Bailey, <b>Leeway</b> and Currie <b>to</b> downsize the Thompson Twins to a core of the three in April 1982. Accordingly, the other four members of the band were notified that the band was breaking up; they were each paid £500 and were allowed to keep their instruments and equipment in exchange for an undertaking not to perform together under the name [...] "Thompson Twins".|$|R

Swa's nominee, his uncle Saw Mon II proved an able ruler and ruled Arakan {{until his death}} in 1380/81 (or 1383/84). This time, Swa sent Saw Me, governor of Talok and one of his long-serving loyalists, to Arakan. But Saw Me proved to be a tyrant and was driven out of Arakan in 1385/86.

25|$|Medicaid {{is a joint}} {{federal and}} state program that helps with medical costs for about 74 million people (as of 2017) with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers {{benefits}} not normally covered by Medicare, like nursing home care and personal care services. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to low-income and disabled people. It is a means-tested program that is jointly funded {{by the state and}} federal governments and managed by the states, with each state currently having broad <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> determine who is eligible for its implementation of the program. States are not required to participate in the program, although all have since 1982. Medicaid recipients must be U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, and may include low-income adults, their children, and people with certain disabilities. Poverty alone does not necessarily qualify someone for Medicaid. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), the percent of Medicaid program costs covered by the federal government, ranges from 50% for higher-income states to 75% for states with lower per-capita incomes.|$|E
25|$|CBS had a thirteen-month <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> {{find a new}} Dallas-Fort Worth affiliate, as its {{contract}} with KDFW did not expire until July 1, 1995; the affiliation contracts for KTBC and KTVI expired around the same time, giving the networks that were already affiliated with the three former Argyle stations slated to switch to Fox a longer grace period to find new affiliates than CBS, NBC and/or ABC were given {{in most of the}} other markets affected by the Fox-New World deal (ABC's affiliation contracts with WGHP and WBRC ended even later, respectively expiring in September 1995 and September 1996). CBS first approached longtime NBC affiliate KXAS-TV about negotiating an affiliation deal, ultimately to be turned down by its then-owner LIN Broadcasting; WFAA was eliminated as an option as ABC reached a new long-term agreement with then-owner of the station, Belo, to extend affiliation contracts for WFAA and other Belo-owned stations that were affiliated with the network. This left KTVT as CBS's only viable option among the Metroplex's VHF television stations, particularly as it was the only other English language station in the market that had a news department (at the time, KTVT had been producing a prime time newscast, which debuted in 1990). On September 14, 1994, Gaylord Broadcasting reached an agreement to affiliate KTVT with CBS, in exchange for also switching its sister independent station in Tacoma, Washington, KSTW (now a CW owned-and-operated station), to the network (Time Warner would later file an injunction attempting to dissolve a previous agreement with Gaylord to turn KTVT, KSTW and KHTV (now CW affiliate KIAH) in Houston into charter affiliates of The WB at that network's launch in January 1995).|$|E

25|$|Though Polk {{genuinely}} {{desired to}} avoid a war with Mexico, he more strongly desired the acquisition of Texas and Alta California. As in Texas, Mexico had failed to establish strong control over the sprawling expanse of California, and, as in Texas, many Americans had migrated to the region. Polk was particularly worried that the British or another European power would eventually establish control over California if it remained in Mexican hands. Polk hoped that {{a show of force}} by the U.S. military under Taylor and Conner could avert war and lead to negotiations with the Mexican government. In late 1845, Polk sent diplomat John Slidell to Mexico to purchase California for $20–40million. Slidell arrived in Mexico City in December 1845. Though Mexican President José Joaquín de Herrera was open to negotiations, Slidell's ambassadorial credentials were refused by a Mexican council of government. In December 1845, Herrera's government collapsed in large part due to his willingness to negotiate with the United States, as the possibility of the sale of large portions of Mexico aroused anger among both the Mexican elites and broader populace. Herrera was succeeded by General Mariano Paredes, and Mexico began to write a new constitution. As successful negotiations with the unstable Mexican government appeared unlikely, War Secretary Marcy ordered General Taylor to advance to the Rio Grande River. Polk began preparations to support a potential new government led by the exiled Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna with the hope that Santa Anna would sell parts of California. Polk had been advised by Alejandro Atocha, an associate of Santa Anna, that only the threat of war would allow the Mexican government the <b>leeway</b> <b>to</b> sell parts of Mexico.|$|E
