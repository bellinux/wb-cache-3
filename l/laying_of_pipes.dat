40|$|Guidelines are {{developed}} for above ground water pipelines across waterways and highways. Research is mainly {{based on the}} prevailing practices of the NWS&DB and a literature review. Of the two main groups of crossing, first is when the pipeline can be run directly across the bridge and straight in to the soil which can often simplify {{many aspects of the}} design, and second is crossing by raising the level (by using multiple offsetting bends in the approach areas of the water way/highway) of the pipe line at the abutments to avoid the disturbance to the flow of the waterways. This study is on the first method where pipeline runs directly across the bridge and straight in to the soil. Having reviewed the available data and after designing the supports for selected diameters and spans {{it was found that the}} span is the major criteria for selecting the type of the crossing. Design was carried out for 300 mm dia. And for 500 mm -dia Spigot and Socket pipelines and Flanged pipelines, of 18 m span and 24 m span crossings. Space trusses were designed using angle iron sections and compound structures were designed using universal beam (UB) sections with rolled steel channels (RSC). Design was carryout according to BS 5950 1990 '. Analysis was done using SAP 2000. The data obtained through the questionnaire survey shows that for socket and spigot pipes where the span is less than 10 m concrete supports at ends were adequate, for spans greater than 10 m supports were required at intermediate positions, for spans less than 18 m compound sections were used while for larger spans space trusses were used. According to the literature survey and the analysis of the results of this study, guidelines were prepared for the pipelines run directly across the waterway/highway and straight in to the soil span exceeding three meter. Design guidelines to support water pipelines across waterways and highways are described in this report. It is recommended to use only end supports for spans less than 10 m, compound structures for spans up to 25 m, plate girders or space trusses for spans up to 100 m. Where the construction depth is not sufficient, it is better to select a space truss as the pipe support. Results of the detailed design shows that the weight of the compound structures is lesser than the space trusses but when the span increases the depth of the UB needs to be increased to satisfy the deflection criteria. Therefore, it is recommended to use space trusses for larger spans. Cost was calculated for all supports designed based on current market prices of steel and the pipe supply cost from NWS&DB rate book. The comparison of overall costs (inclusive of material, fabrication, supply and <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipes,</b> corrosion protection, and maintenance), shows that the cost of the compound structures is less than the space trusses. The comparison of, support cost according to the span and the diameter shows a significant cost variation in the type of the support where the diameter of pipes and the span increased. This shows that, when the span and the diameter of the pipe increase, the support structure should be selected very carefully. It is recommended to use one end fixed and the other roller to facilitate the expansion and contraction. If the pipe supports are at a lateral bend of the pipe line, the unbalanced horizontal load at the bends also should be arrested adequately. Though, the practice In Sri Lanka is to use double flanged (DF) pipes in crossings, use of Socket and Spigot (So/Sp) reduce the total cost of the crossing by 10 to 17 % for 300 mm dia. and 19 to 28 % for 500 mm dia. pipes, depending on the type of the structure. These So/Sp pipes can be used in direct crossings. However, in So/Sp type lateral effects due to wind load condition could cause the pipe to malfunction. Therefore, wind effects on So/Sp type pipe lines should be checked very carefully. By considering the life cycle it is advisable to use hot dip galvanizing for corrosion protection rather than painting, Cost reduction percentage of galvanizing is 270 % to 680 % comparing with painting (including 25 years maintenance for painting...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} {{has caused}} many service failures in linepipe steel. Service conditions present several avenues by which hydrogen can adversely affect the mechanical properties of such steel. Fesseler [1] reported that local mechanical damage can arise from handling and <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> {{and that some}} cathodic protection schemes can in fact inject dangerous amounts of hydrogen into a steel. There can be synergism between these two aspects which can give extremely high hydrogen charging conditions resulting in failure [2]. Metallurgists in {{the oil and gas}} industries refer to this type of failure as hydrogen stress cracking (HSC). Future synthetic natural gas from coal gasification may contain as much as 50 % H 2 which will be very deleterious to linepipe properties. Sulfides present in natural gas, hydrogen sulfide or carbon disulfide, tend to inhibit the recombination of 2 HADS → H 2 and therefore favor atomic hydrogen absorption into a steel [3]. Welding of linepipe is a potential source of nearly every known hydrogen problem depending on the circumstances of the technique [4]. Thus it is apparent that NDE techniques adaptable to field use will be important to the maintenance of thousands of miles of existing and future pipelines. The particular use of positron annihilation to be described could be one such technique...|$|R

40|$|The {{district}} heating industry is currently searching for new installation fashions for district heat distribution networks {{in order to}} decrease the cost of installation. The heat losses cause {{a large part of}} the lifetime cost and environmental impacts of {{district heating}} networks. This paper presents how the multipole method can be used for quick and accurate determination of heat losses from different installation alternatives of one or more insulated pipes in the ground. The multipole method utilises the cylinder geometry and the fact that real and imaginary parts of analytic functions satisfy Laplace equation to solve steady state heat conduction problems around pipes. The problem is solved in complex coordinates by using line sources and multipoles at the pipes. An equation system for the strengths of the line sources and multipoles is obtained. The equation system may be implemented in Mathcad or similar. Within negligible computer time a result of very high accuracy is obtained. As an example heat losses from two pipes in the ground are calculated. Two laying alternatives are studied: side-by-side and one pipe placed on top of the other. As heat is lost through the ground surface the total heat loss will increase slightly for shallower <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pipes</b> and for the supply pipe put on top <b>of</b> the return <b>pipe.</b> Influences <b>of</b> the input parameters are studied for the side-by-side laying case. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{analyzes the}} application of method of horizontal directional drilling (HDD) {{for the construction of}} engineering communication for Kyiv’s dense urban development. The main advantages of this modern technology <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> <b>pipes</b> <b>of</b> different diameter in complicated hydrogeological conditions are high accuracy and constant control of the trajectory, the possibility of work regardless of the season and work in a confined space without disturbing the surface structures that already exist. The most common depth of HDD in urban areas is about 2 – 3 m. As a result of intensive anthropogenic and technological impact in urban soils negative processes are developing that impair their strength characteristics. Soil decompression, violations of water-air and thermal balance, chemical and biological contamination lead to the surface deformations in the field of application of horizontal drilling. The negative aspect is that after filling of soil and repair of surface subsidence, these processes do not stop over time and continue to fracture surface. The aim of the research is to establish the causes of the continuation of active deformation processes of soil environment after the construction of engineering communication using the method of horizontal directional drilling. Most of sewage networks are within the impact zone of roads, so the research was conducted for soil near their proximity, samples were taken at various depths to allow man-made human impact on the deformation properties of soil foundations. For the qualitative and quantitative analysis of substances in soils, roentgen spectral analysis was used. It is a non-destructive method for determining element composition. To determine the oil content we used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

This has been substantiated by the discovery of a burial site in this location during the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> gas <b>pipes</b> in St Anthony Street. The site of the monastery reputedly extended down to Henderson Gardens and all along the street still known as Yardheads.

This would suggest the monastery had large gardens and orchards extending to this point. It is said that the monastery suffered great damage during the Siege of Leith in 1560. After the Scottish Reformation the monastery was allowed to languish; other buildings being gradually erected in its place and removing all physical traces of its existence.
