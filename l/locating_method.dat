The existing data-extrapolating techniques are inefficient {{because they are}} designed without concerning the specialities of the extrapolating equations. Besides, there exists little work on locating the narrow band after data extrapolating—a very important problem in narrow band level set methods. In this paper, we put forward the general Huygens’ principle, {{and based on the}} principle we present two efficient data-extrapolating algorithms. The algorithms can easily locate the narrow band in data extrapolating. Furthermore, we propose a prediction–correction version for the data-extrapolating algorithms and the corresponding band <b>locating</b> <b>method</b> for a special case where the direct band <b>locating</b> <b>method</b> is hard to apply.

Basically five major areas are discussed: ➀ the source of forced oscillations; ➁ detecting methods for forced oscillations; ➂ distinguishing methods of forced oscillations; ➃ <b>locating</b> <b>methods</b> for forced oscillations; ⑤ the impact of forced oscillations on power systems. In addition, future opportunities to study [...] forced oscillations are discussed. It can be concluded that in a large power system, GCEs (such as PSS and AVR) are often reported as the sources of forced oscillations in recent years. As it has been reported, the resonance between forced oscillations and electromechanical modes can cause catastrophic events. In addition, forced oscillations in a power system have negative impacts on mode estimation algorithms. Thus, they should be detected and located in their early stage.|$|R

40|$|As a fi rst {{step towards}} a new {{approach}} for the simulation of two-phase fl ows, {{the objective of this}} work is to check out the prediction of a model dedicated to large and distorted bubbles on two-bubble coalescence cases. The multifi eld hybrid approach for two-phase fl ow modelling consists in dealing separately with the small and spherical bubbles, treated with a dispersed approach, and with the large and distorted ones, whose interface is located. The overall method relies also on an existing building block, consisting in a set of averaged models dedicated to dispersed bubbles, which has already been validated and has given a reasonable agreement with experimental data in cases where the spherical shape assumption is still valid for the dispersed phase. This paper aims to assess a conservative interface <b>locating</b> <b>method</b> based on level set adapted to two-fl uid model for two-phase fl ows. The interface <b>locating</b> <b>method</b> is a part of a model dedicated to the simulation of large and distorted bubbles.

The main outcome is the simulation of bubble coalescence where the distortion of the interface during the coalescence phenomenon is followed. The ability to simulate coalescence phenomena correctly is an important issue in the modelling of slug fl ows with interface locating methods...|$|E

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, numerical simulation analysis and experimental testing of a steel braced space frame model are performed.
