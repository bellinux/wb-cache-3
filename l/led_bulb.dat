50|$|The SP2 was an all-new design {{introduced}} in 1979. It replaced the Mamod Minor 2 and {{was similar to}} it in a few ways. It had {{the same type of}} boiler as the Minor 2 as well as the engine unit and frame. The exhaust was a simple open port as the Minor 2. These engines were powerful engines for their size and could drive a full workshop of four tools quite easily. The SP2D is a version of the SP2 with an integral dynamo. The SP2D has a larger-diameter flywheel which drives the dynamo - mounted inside the base of the chimney - by a belt. A small <b>LED</b> <b>bulb</b> is fitted {{to the top of the}} chimney.|$|E

5000|$|Hollow Flashlight {{utilizes}} the thermoelectric {{effect to}} convert radiant body heat into electricity to power an <b>LED</b> <b>bulb</b> {{without the need}} for batteries or kinetic energy. Consisting only of a PVC tube housing, aluminum tube, Peltier tiles, and the circuit, Makosinki managed to source the materials for her prototype for $26. Applying the hand to one side of Peltier tiles while ambient air cools the other side, enough energy is generated to light several LED bulbs. She developed two working prototypes. At 5 °C temperature gradient, they produce 3 and 4 foot-candles of light, respectively. At 10 °C temperature gradient, they produce 4 and 5 foot-candles of light, respectively. At 10 °C ambient temperature, the flastlight maintains a steady beam of light for over 20 minutes. She has since made improvements to the device including the ability to store harvested electricity, adapted into a wearable headlamp, and has garnered interest for commercial production. The device can now provide over 6 lux of light at a distance of 12 inches and can provide on-demand light for 60 minutes without body contact. The [...] "hollow flashlight" [...] was inspired after learning that a friend living in the Philippines struggled in school without any light to study at night and no time during daylight-hours. She aims to provide her device for free to people in developing nations.|$|E
5000|$|Earlier methods {{instructed}} {{that the}} carpet nozzle must maintain {{contact with the}} surface of the carpet, utilizing the suction, while later instruction manuals recommended the nozzle be slightly above with only the brush establishing contact and improving airflow around the surface being cleaned. For delicate surfaces, the drive belt that spins the brush can be detached so that only suction is used. In 1970 with the introduction of the Classic, a small plastic window was installed in the belt lifter handle so the belt could be visually inspected as being intact and installed on the turbine driveshaft. When the Heritage Model was introduced in 1982, the Brush Performance Indicator Light was installed {{in the top of the}} carpet nozzle, which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush. A small <b>LED</b> <b>bulb</b> would light up when the brush was spinning; if the light appeared to blink or wasn't illuminated, it meant the brush wasn't rotating at the desired speed, and that the nozzle needed to be adjusted up or signifying that an inspection of the drive belt was needed, and replaced the plastic window on the belt lifter handle. In 1984 with the Heritage II model, the Toe-Touch latch was modified with a custom adjustment feature called [...] "Micro Matic", which facilitated the ability to incrementally adjust the preset height positions, allowing for the carpet nozzle to clean glued down, minimal pile carpets. The feature was no longer offered with the Generation 3 model introduction.|$|E
50|$|The {{adjacent}} railings along Prestbury Road were reinstated. It is {{not known}} when these were removed but, as the land belonged to 1 Pittville Lawn until the mid 1960s, it is possible they were removed around that time. The grassed areas, in front of 1 Pittville Lawn and along the concrete block wall opposite, were planted with Photinia, Cistus, Lavender and twelve 'Samaritan' roses on 17 October 2013. The roses along with a plaque commemorate Samaritans Cheltenham & District's 50th anniversary in the town. The plants and associated costs were funded by a generous donation from the Samaritans.Street signs for Pittville Lawn and Prestbury Road have been installed. The former is a refurbished old sign and the latter a new one made in the old style.Four new lamps were mounted in March 2014. These are replicas of the originals, {{two of which are}} {{at the entrance to the}} Municipal Offices in the Promenade. The new lamps use LED bulbs and are very bright. Two pedestrian gates and four carriage gates were made and hung over several months in the summer and autumn, with completion in early November 2014. The carriage gates are closed, but can be opened if need be. A new lantern was made to fit into the oval space under the Cheltenham coat of arms. This is also lit by an <b>LED</b> <b>bulb.</b> This makes the area glow at night and, we hope, is safer for pedestrians. Raising the money (just under £300,000) for the restoration has been a major undertaking and the Friends of Pittville charity is very grateful to the many individual donors, and to the charitable trusts, and the borough and county councils, which have made grants toward the restoration.The restored gates were formally re-opened by the Mayor of Cheltenham, Cllr Simon Wheeler, on 7 April 2015, who arrived in a vintage horse-drawn open carriage. He unveiled a granite tablet recording the start of the restoration project in 2012, the year of HM the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.|$|E
