2500|$|During her {{reign as}} Miss America Williams was criticized in some venues for winning. She later stated that [...] "there {{were a lot}} of people that did not want me to be {{representative}} of the United States and Miss America. And not just white people alone. There {{were a lot of}} people who had issues [...] I was too light. My eyes were the wrong color. My hair wasn't the right texture and getting criticism for being who I was." [...] She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, You Have No Idea). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she [...] "wrote a book about everything that I went through, and I spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin." ...|$|E
5000|$|Influenced by Charlie Chaplin and the escapism of the cinema, Landau pursued {{an acting}} career. He {{attended}} the Actors Studio, becoming {{good friends with}} James Dean.

2500|$|As Raimi and his {{producing}} partner Robert Tapert progressed {{through various}} drafts, {{they realized that}} there was a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and [...] "lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions." [...] Goldin said that they [...] "spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of {{the nuts and bolts of}} the story." [...] The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script. For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, [...] "I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift off into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves." ...|$|E

5000|$|Death Magnetic, {{at least}} the title, to me started out {{as kind of a}} tribute to people that have fallen in our business, like Layne Staley and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the people that have died, {{basically}} — rock and roll martyrs of sorts. And then it kind of grew from there, thinking about death… some people are drawn towards it, and just like a magnet, and other people are afraid of it and push. Also the concept that we're all gonna die sometimes is over-talked about and then a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> never <b>talked</b> about — no one wants to bring it up; it's the big white elephant in the living room. But we all {{have to deal with it}} at some point.|$|R
5000|$|... was {{the only}} real confidant Muldoon had in power. I {{had a feeling that}} Muldoon may have enticed him into {{politics}} as someone who had a good knowledge of the National Party and whom he liked. As a minister, McLachlan was slow and not very active, but he was influentially placed in the middle of cabinet. Muldoon could trust him completely; he knew that unlike others McLachlan would never compete. They spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> together, <b>talking</b> shop and drinking. Muldoon, from my experience, did most of the talking. McLachlan, the listener, was the ultimate good mate. He was an invaluable sounding board for the relatively friendless Muldoon and his door was one route through which fellow parliamentarians might approach the prickly prime minister.|$|R

5000|$|The {{producers}} spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> with Malick {{about his}} vision of the film. Geisler said, [...] "Malick's Guadalcanal would be a Paradise Lost, an Eden, raped by the green poison, as Terry used to call it, of war. Much of the violence was to be portrayed indirectly. A soldier is shot, but rather than showing a Spielbergian bloody face we see a tree explode, the shredded vegetation, and a gorgeous bird with a broken wing flying out of a tree".|$|E

Soon after that his interest spread to native American cultures where he would spend a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> photographing and <b>talking</b> to Native American Indians at their reservations. He soon began to grace magazine covers such as The Cattleman and local newspapers with his stories and artwork. Renne also donated numbers of original works to charitable donations including the Annual Cowboys Charity at Texas Stadium and he painted the Leukemia Poster Child among others.|$|R

Peer review is extremely important-I want to acknowledge that right up front-but it threatens to become the axle around which all conversations about the future of publishing get wrapped, like Isadora Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s scarf, strangling any possible innovations in scholarly communication before they can get launched. In order to move forward with any kind of innovative publishing process, we must solve the peer review problem, but in order to do so, we first have to separate the structure of peer review from the purposes it serves-and we need to be a bit brutally honest with ourselves about those purposes, distinguishing between those purposes we 2 ̆ 7 d ideally like peer review to serve and those functions it actually winds up fulfilling...|$|R
5000|$|LuaLua joined Colchester United in September 1998. Initially, he {{struggled}} to adapt and he preferred going to nightclubs over playing for Colchester, Harrop says, [...] "It took a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hard work by the staff at Colchester. Micky Cook, the director of youth, had to spend endless hours with him and manager Steve Wignall and then next manager Steve Whitton had to spend a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> with him <b>talking</b> him through the tactical side {{of the game and}} what his role was within the team". LuaLua scored within four minutes of his debut where he appeared as a substitute in a 3-1 defeat to Chesterfield. In two seasons, he made 68 league and cup appearances for Colchester, 44 starts and 24 substitute appearances, scoring a total of 21 goals. His performances attracted the attention of several Premiership clubs and despite manager Steve Whitton's denial that LuaLua was for sale, LuaLua joined Newcastle United in September 2000 for a fee of £2.25 million. An earlier offer by Newcastle of £300,000 for LuaLua made by former manager, Ruud Gullit, had been rejected, but the much increased bid offered financial security and assistance towards a new ground and was one that Colchester felt they could not turn down.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, M83 frontman Anthony Gonzalez said, [...] "I started to write the soundtrack just reading the script, {{and then when you}} get the picture in, it's different, and you kind of switch to another vibe and change stuff and start experimenting a lot with the music." [...] Gonzalez added, [...] "I worked with Joseph a lot, and he's very particular about the music in his movies, so we spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> about music and working the arrangements together." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with Billboard, Hunt remarked on {{the position of}} women in his music, [...] "Respect for women {{was a very important}} part of my upbringing," [...] and added, [...] "The women in my life demanded that from me." [...] Hunt even named his album Montevallo, after the hometown of a former girlfriend and consulted her in the lyrical production: [...] "I spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> to her about the songs and asking, 'What do you think about this?' Her perspective was a powerful part of me being able to connect with a female audience, not just a male audience." ...|$|E

5000|$|Patrick Henry High School {{opened in}} 1968, {{and had a}} grant from the Danforth Foundation as an [...] "experimental" [...] public school. Principal Donald W. Giddings had his pick of any teacher in the San Diego Public School system for his start up campus. The student body in 1968 {{consisted}} of juniors and sophomores only, and it became a 3 year high school the following year. Classes were scheduled around a twenty-minute modular system with some [...] "classes" [...] consisting of two [...] "mods" [...] and others were three [...] "mods". In the beginning, most classes were [...] "independent study", and the campus was open, so that students could make use of any community resources to enhance learning. But, most students were in summer school those first 2 years, having spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> independent study <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> to friends in the [...] "quad". The school modified the program, offering learning objectives, learning packs, and the ability to complete coursework at one's own pace (with teachers always available). Independent study was still available, but the motivated student needed to petition the independent study [...] "teacher" [...] who then worked with students on curriculum and community resource development. Over time, Patrick Henry became a more and more traditional school. Nonetheless, the early experiment was successful in bringing unusual (for the time) courses and great flexibility in learning. In 1972, a peer counseling class was instituted. Students accelerated their studies in languages, literature, the sciences, and other areas. Some graduated early as a result, while others chose to become even better prepared for college. By 1973, Patrick Henry had numerous advanced placement classes, including English and Art History, the latter being rather rare at that time.|$|R

Of course, law professors - even those who would be reluctant, if not loathe, to think of themselves or their colleagues as moral philosophers - understand that, in their professional work, they must often struggle with moral issues (or, at least, with issues that are widely regarded to be moral issues).

The interview was conducted in 2014, and in this clip the interviewee is responding to the question 'Why {{do you think it}} is important that students in your classes engage with our place(s) through writing?'Brief excerpt from interview: A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> when people <b>talk</b> about being local [...] . they'll name stores and restaurants, shopping malls and theaters, schools, but they don't talk about land. I really asked [students] to pay close attention to land [...] . I think they gained a kind of deeper understanding of a history that is much longer than these kinds of man-made structures on the land [...] . For Hawaiian students it was more of this genealogical connectedness to places and for students who are not Hawaiian, a greater sense of their own kuleana or responsibility [...] . I think engagement goes hand in hand with kuleana. If you feel like you have some kind of commitment or responsibility, the writing comes through in a much more engaged way. I work in Waiʻanae and there's a place where Maui was born in Lualualei [...] . There are these mountains, and they say if you really look at the mountains, they look like thighs. And if you think about the river, it's like a birth canal. In different tours we've done, the land comes alive like that, where you see the moʻolelo being enacted and performed through the landscape. You see the moʻolelo taking place and unfolding as you're traveling geographically. Some of [these moʻolelo] can be read on a metaphorical level, but many of them are very literally about the stories that are unfolding along the landscape, and you have to pay attention to the land to understand those stories and for it to have that kind of special relevance for you. Passion comes into [one student's] writing in the way that she explores the moʻolelo from so many different angles, not just its textual relevance, but its geographical relevance. The land has its own ontology. Its writing its own story...|$|R

Ocasek said he could use it for the show, but Schwartzman took it back to LA and held onto to it for quite a while. The label liked the idea of Ocasek producing the album, but since he loved the demos so much, everyone thought that Keith Forsey and Brian Reeves, who recorded the demos, should be given the opportunity.|$|E
