Ed Chavez, {{editor of the}} American publisher Vertical, contacted the Japanese <b>licensor</b> of the series to request its publishing in North America. The Japanese <b>licensor</b> of the series refused {{to allow it to}} be published in North America, because it was thought that Americans might take offense to it.|$|E
5|$|The Tokyo Mew Mew manga {{series was}} well {{received}} by English-speaking audiences. In March and April 2003, {{the first volume}} sold an estimated 1,597 and 1,746 copies respectively. This put the volume {{at the low end}} of the top 50 sales for each month. By 2004, with most of the series released, it became a mild success for <b>licensor</b> Tokyopop. It was ranked number 16 on the list of Manga Top 50 for the first quarter of 2004 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga, based on sales from both mainstream bookstores and comic book shops. Sales of the sixth and seventh volumes dropped slightly; however, both were among the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in March and May 2004. The first volume of Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode debuted 63rd on the list of top 100 best-selling graphic novels of May 2005, with nearly double the sales figures of the last volume of the main series. On the Nielsen Bookscan charts, the volume debuted at rank 39 before quickly climbing to the 14th spot. The second volume of à la Mode saw similar success, debuting in the 69th slot before advancing to the 12th position, a result of the Mew Mew Power show appearing on 4Kids TV.|$|E
5|$|The remastered {{version was}} {{predicated}} on the transition of LucasArts from a developer and publisher into a <b>licensor</b> and publisher in 2013 shortly after its acquisition by Disney. Under new management, LucasArts licensed several of its intellectual properties (IP), including Grim Fandango, to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire {{the rights to the}} game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions. Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of The Secret of Monkey Island. Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from Lucasarts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress. When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and developer relations Adam Boyes, was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek Grim Fandango after seeing developers like Capcom and Midway Games revive older properties. Boyes' determination was supported by John Vignocchi, VP of Production for Disney Interactive, who also shared memories of the game, and was able to bring in contacts to track down the game's assets. After discovering they were vying for the same property, Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding, planning to make the re-release a remastered version. Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game, instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support, similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers.|$|E
40|$|Experiments of a {{bargaining}} game between <b>licensors</b> and licensees were conducted.

The experimental results reveal that the introduction of the “second-chance” negotiation for <b>licensors</b> has significant impacts on behaviors of the <b>licensors</b> and licensees. This “second-chance” negotiation for <b>licensors</b> essentially increases the average offers made by the licensees, expected willingness-to-accept of the <b>licensors,</b> and offers accepted by the <b>licensors.</b> The market efficiency of patent transaction is improved since the rates of acceptance are strikingly raised.

25|$|Rosa {{created a}} few more comics for Gladstone until 1989. He then stopped working for them, because the {{policies}} of their <b>licensor,</b> Disney, did not allow {{for the return of}} original art for a story to its creators.

25|$|One {{effect of}} modern patent usage {{is that a}} small-time inventor, who can afford both the {{patenting}} process and {{the defense of the}} patent, can use the exclusive right status to become a <b>licensor.</b> This allows the inventor to accumulate capital from licensing the invention and may allow innovation to occur because he or she may choose not to manage a manufacturing buildup for the invention. Thus the inventor's time and energy can be spent on pure innovation, allowing others to concentrate on manufacturability.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of incorporation, Ikarus’ {{business}} was in decline due to unusual political and economic changes following {{the fall of the}} Berlin Wall in 1989. Such decline continued after The Group’s formation, resulting in the shutdown of one of Ikarus’ plants in Budapest. This plant was purchased from Ikarus Hungary by NABI, Kft. which simultaneously entered a license agreement with Ikarus Hungary allowing NABI, Kft. to produce its own unfinished buses in Budapest and deliver them to its subsidiary in Alabama for final assembly and delivery to U.S. customers. In 1994 The Group began use of this manufacturing arrangement with no further involvement of Ikarus Hungary other than its role as <b>licensor</b> of the Model 416 and Model 436 standard-floor transit bus designs.|$|E
25|$|Pelmeni {{and other}} frozen foods were {{produced}} under {{the brand name}} Daria, named after the daughter of Oleg Tinkoff. A Greek called Athanasius, who distributed ravioli production equipment in Russia, gave Tinkoff this idea while in the sauna. Production was launched in early 1998 in Peterhof and in the beginning it made products under the trademark Smak under license from Andrey Makarevich company. After the conflict with the <b>licensor,</b> the brand name changed to Smak St. Petersburg. Economic crisis was the reason to create its own brand: the new brand helped increase the market share. The new plant, which opened in December 1998, {{at the site of}} a former Technoshock warehouse on Predportovaya street in St. Petersburg, originally produced only Daria. In addition, Tinkoff made products under the brands of Tolsty kok, Dobry product and Tsar-batyushka.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, the {{government}} set up TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) which reduced the interference of Government in deciding tariffs and policy making. The political powers changed in 1999 {{and the new}} government {{under the leadership of}} Atal Bihari Vajpayee was more pro-reforms and introduced better liberalisation policies. In 2000, the Vajpayee government constituted the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) through an amendment of the TRAI Act, 1997. The primary objective of TDSAT's establishment was to release TRAI from adjudicatory and dispute settlement functions in order to strengthen the regulatory framework. Any dispute involving parties like <b>licensor,</b> licensee, service provider and consumers are resolved by TDSAT. Moreover, any direction, order or decision of TRAI can be challenged by appealing in TDSAT. The government corporatised the operations wing of DoT on 1 October 2000 and named it as Department of Telecommunication Services (DTS) which was later named as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). The proposal of raising the stake of foreign investors from 49% to 74% was rejected by the opposite political parties and leftist thinkers. Domestic business groups wanted {{the government}} to privatise VSNL. Finally in April 2002, the government decided to cut its stake of 53% to 26% in VSNL and to throw it open for sale to private enterprises. TATA finally took 25% stake in VSNL.|$|E
2500|$|But this Federal Circuit test is {{contrary}} to many decisions of both the Supreme Court and other courts of appeals. For example, in Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., the Supreme Court addressed the legality of licenses under which royalties were paid on total sales of all products, irrespective of whether the licensor’s patents covered all products. The Court held that such licensing was permissible when the <b>licensor</b> and licensee adopted it for mutual convenience to simplify administration of the license, but it was impermissible for the <b>licensor</b> to insist upon it over the licensee’s opposition. Such conduct was misuse, the Court held, but not an antitrust violation unless the other elements of an antitrust violation were also shown, such as market power.|$|E
