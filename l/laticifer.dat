In order to augment the defense of the plant some non-articulated <b>laticifer</b> cells contain highly pressurized stores of latex. It has been noted that pressure may be produced by the osmotic uptake of water into the <b>laticifer</b> cell resulting in a turgid cell. When pierced the cell bursts and latex travels quickly through the canal system to stop the herbivore. A desert species, Bursera schlechtendalii, pressurizes the canals right where leaves attach to the stem so that when a grazer eats a leaf latex shoots out. This process is termed the “squirt gun” defense.|$|E

40|$|Nonarticulated laticifers are latex-containing {{cells that}} {{elongate}} indefinitely and grow intrusively between {{the walls of}} meristematic cells. To identify biochemical mechanisms involved {{in the growth of}} nonarticulated laticifers, we have analyzed the distribution of various polysaccharides and proteoglycans in walls of meristematic cells in contact with laticifers, nonadjacent to laticifers, and in <b>laticifer</b> walls. In the shoot apex of Asclepias speciosa, the levels of callose and a (1 M 4) -#-galactan epitope are lower in meristematic walls in contact with laticifers than in nonadjacent walls. In contrast, we did not detect a decline in xyloglucan, homogalacturonan, and arabinogalactan-protein epitopes upon contact of meristematic cells with laticifers. <b>Laticifer</b> elongation is also associated with the development of a homogalacturonan-rich middle lamella between laticifers and their neighboring cells. Furthermore, laticifers lay down walls that differ from those of their surrounding cells. This is particularly evident for epitopes in rhamnogalacturonan I. A (1 M 5) -!-arabinan epitope in this pectin is more abundant in laticifers than meristematic cells, while the opposite is observed for a (1 M 4) -#-galactan epitope. Also, different cell wall components exhibit distinct distribution patterns within <b>laticifer</b> walls. The (1 M 5) -!-arabinan epitope is distributed throughout the <b>laticifer</b> walls while certain homogalacturonan and arabinogalactan-protein epitopes are preferentially located in particular regions of <b>laticifer</b> walls. Taken together, our results indicate that <b>laticifer</b> penetration causes changes in the walls of meristematic cells and that there are differences in wall composition within <b>laticifer</b> walls and between laticifers and their surrounding cells...|$|E

Immunolocalization of pectic epitopes with the antihomogalacturonan antibodies JIM 5 and JIM 7 produced distinct labeling patterns. JIM 7 labeled all cells including laticifers, while JIM 5 only labeled mature epidermal cells and xylem elements. Two antibodies, LM 5 and LM 6, which recognize rhamnogalacturonan I epitopes distinctly labeled <b>laticifer</b> walls. LM 6, which binds to a (l→ 5) α-arabinan epitope, labeled <b>laticifer</b> walls more intensely than walls of other cells. LM 5, which recognizes a (1 → 4) β-D-galac-tan epitope, did not label <b>laticifer</b> segments at the shoot apex but labeled more mature portions of laticifers.

30|$|Furthermore, Groeneveld {{purified}} latex {{particles from}} <b>laticifers</b> {{of a number}} of Euphorbias species by using gel filtration chromatography and showed that the latex particles were composed of triterpenoids (Groeneveld 1976).

Moreover, some reports pointed out that the latex particles were synthesized in vacuoles originated from ER (Fineran 1983; Skrukrud 1987; Cai et al. 2009). Therefore, it can be say that the latex particles are the accumulation site of terpenoid end products in the <b>laticifers,</b> and the mevalonate to terpenoid converting activity is associated with the structure which was identified as a vacuole originated from ER. Based on stated above, we further speculated that as an initial enzyme in MVA pathway for terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, the EhAACT located in cytosol could be transported to small vacuoles originated from ER to synthesize terpenoid backbones. Lastly, the terpenoid was further synthesized into latex particles in these small vacuoles in E. helioscopia <b>laticifers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The cells (<b>laticifers)</b> {{in which}} latex is found {{make up the}} laticiferous system, which can form in two very {{different}} ways.

Acidic proteins with molecular masses between 12. 5 and 74. 5 kDa predominated in laticifers of P. rubra. This profile was not found in laticifers of C. grandiflora and E. tirucalli. The later was poor in respect of proteins. Strong anti-oxidative activity of superoxide dismutase (E.

In the present study, an experimental system of coronatine-induced <b>laticifer</b> differentiation was developed to perform SSH identification of genes with differential expression. A total of 528 positive clones were obtained by blue-white screening, of which 248 clones came from the forward SSH library while 280 clones came from the reverse SSH library. Approximately 215 of the 248 clones and 171 of the 280 clones contained cDNA inserts by colony PCR screening.

Approximately 147 unigenes with an average length of 497 bp from the forward and 109 unigenes with an average length of 514 bp from the reverse SSH libraries were assembled and annotated. The unigenes were associated with the stress/defense response, plant hormone signal transduction and structure development.

40|$|Abstract Background Proteomic {{analysis}} of <b>laticifer</b> latex in Hevea brasiliensis has been received more significant attentions. However, the sticky and viscous characteristic of rubber latex as cytoplasm of <b>laticifer</b> cells and the complication of <b>laticifer</b> latex membrane systems {{has made it}} challenge to isolate high-quality proteins for 2 -DE and MS. Results Based on the reported Borax/PVPP/Phenol (BPP) protocol, we developed an efficient method for protein preparation from different latex subcellular fractions and constructed high-resolution reference 2 -DE maps. The obtained proteins from both total latex and C-serum fraction with this protocol generate more than one thousand protein spots and several hundreds of protein spots from rubber particles as well as lutoid fraction and its membranes on the CBB stained 2 -DE gels. The identification of 13 representative proteins on 2 -DE gels by MALDI TOF/TOF MS/MS suggested that this method is compatible with MS.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The major {{economic}} product of Hevea brasiliensis is a rubber-containing cytoplasm (latex), which flows out of <b>laticifers</b> (latex cells) when the bark is tapped. The latex yield is stimulated by ethylene. Sucrose, the unique precursor of rubber synthesis, must cross the plasma membrane through specific sucrose transporters before being metabolized in the <b>laticifers.</b> The {{relative importance of}} sucrose transporters in determining latex yield is unknown. Here, the effects of ethylene (by application of Ethrel on sucrose transporter gene expression in the inner bark tissues and latex cells of H. brasiliensis are described. METHODS: Experiments, including cloning sucrose transporters, real time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, were carried out on virgin (untapped) trees, treated or untreated with the latex yield stimulant Ethrel. KEY RESULTS: Seven putative full-length cDNAs of sucrose transporters were cloned from a latex-specific cDNA library. These transporters belong to all SUT (sucrose transporter) groups and differ by their basal gene expression in latex and inner soft bark, with a predominance of HbSUT 1 A and HbSUT 1 B. Of these sucrose transporters, only HbSUT 1 A and HbSUT 2 A were distinctly increased by ethylene. Moreover, this increase was shown to be specific to <b>laticifers</b> and to ethylene application. CONCLUSION: The data and all previous information on sucrose transport show that HbSUT 1 A and HbSUT 2 A {{are related to the}} increase in sucrose import into <b>laticifers,</b> required for the stimulation of latex yield by ethylene in virgin trees...|$|R
40|$|Natural rubber is {{synthesized}} in <b>laticifers</b> in {{the inner}} liber of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Upon bark tapping, the latex is expelled due to fiber turgor pressure. The mature <b>laticifers</b> are devoid of plasmodesmata; therefore a corresponding decrease-in the total latex solid content is likely to occur due to water influx inside the <b>laticifers.</b> Auxins and ethylene used as efficient yield stimulants in mature untapped rubber trees, but, bark treatments with abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) could also induce a transient increase latex yield. We recently reported {{that there are three}} aquaporin genes, HbPIP 2; 1, HbT 1 P 1; 1 and HbPIP 1; 1, that are regulated differentially after ethylene bark treatment. HbPIP 2 : 1 was up-regulated in both the <b>laticifers</b> and the inner liber tissues, whereas HbT 1 P 1 : 1 was up-regulated in the latex cells, but very markedly down-regulated {{in the inner}} liber tissues. Conversely, HbPIP 1 : 1 was down-regulated in both tissues. In the present study, HbPIP 2; 1 and HbT 1 P 1 : 1 showed a similar expression in response to auxin, ABA and SA, as seen in ethylene stimulation, while HbPIP 1; 1 was slightly regulated by auxin, but neither by ABA nor SA. The analysis of the HbPIP 1 : 1 promoter region indicated the presence of only ethylene and auxin responsive elements. In addition, the poor efficiency of this HbPIP 1; 1 in increasing plasmalemma water conductance was confirmed in Xenopus oocytes. Thus, an increase in latex yield in response to all of these hormones was proposed to be the major function of aquaporins, HbPIP 2 : 1 and HbTIP 1; 1. This study emphasized that the circulation of water between the <b>laticifers</b> and their surrounding tissues that result in latex dilution, as well as the probable maintenance of the liber tissues turgor pressure, favor the prolongation of latex flow...|$|R

In the present study, the larvicidal potential of other <b>laticifer</b> fluids obtained from Cryptostegia grandiflora R. Br., Plumeria rubra L. and Euphorbia tirucalli L. was evaluated. We attempted to correlate larvicidal activity {{with the presence of}} endogenous proteolytic activity in the protein fraction of the fluids. After collection, the fluids were processed by centrifugation and dialysis to obtain the soluble <b>laticifer</b> protein (LP) fractions and eliminate water insoluble and low molecular mass molecules. LP did not visibly affect egg hatching at the doses assayed. LP from Cr. grandiflora exhibited the highest larval toxicity, while P. rubra was almost inactive. E. tirucalli was slightly active, but its activity could not be correlated to proteins since no protein was detected in the fluid. The larvicidal effects of LP from C. procera and Cr. grandiflora showed a significant relationship with the proteolytic activity of cysteine proteinases, which are present in both materials. A purified cysteine proteinase (papain) from the latex of Carica papaya (obtained from Sigma) was similarly effective, whereas trypsin and chymotrypsin (both serine proteinases) were ineffective. The results provide evidence for the involvement of cysteine proteinase activity in the larvicidal action of some <b>laticifer</b> fluids. C. procera is an invasive species found in areas infested with Ae. aegypti and thus could prove useful for combating mosquito proliferation.

Maturing <b>laticifer</b> cells of the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum L., have their common wails perforated in order to develop a continuous system of latex vessels throughout the plant. In poppy, this latex is alkaloid-rich and is valued as a source of pharmaceuticals. The continuous network allows large volumes of the latex to be released from the plant upon wounding, and is the preferred method for collecting the latex for the illegal drug trade. By studying the process of <b>laticifer</b> cell wall degradation, it is hoped that a line of poppies will be developed that will not bleed and thus prevent such collection. Gene homology for cell wall degrading enzymes were found during EST screening of a latex cDNA library from the opium poppy. Northern analysis of cellulose, polygalacturonase [] subunit, 1, 3 -[]-glucanase, and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase homology showed expression levels not limited to <b>laticifer</b> cells. However, poppy gene homology to pectin methylesterase (PME), pectin acetylesterase (PAE) and sedate lease (PL) had specific expression in latex. Enzyme assays confirmed the presence of PME, PAE, and PL activity in poppy latex serum. None of the homology for PME, PAE, or PL were induced by ethylene in poppy seedlings. One EST clone had high amino acid homology to several putative ACC oxidase homologs, however biochemical assays of expressed gene product failed to show ACC oxidase activity. As more gene sequences are placed in databases without biochemical characterization, this serves as an important caveat when unknown genes are assigned an identity based only on sequence comparison to other genes. The plant cell wall is a very complex structure. The roles of specific enzymes in <b>laticifer</b> wall degradation, the changing conditions of the apoplast during <b>laticifer</b> maturation, and the developmental signals given by molecules stored within the cell wall, all need further study in order to understand, and perhaps modify, this developmental process...|$|E

Analysis of the CPT-RNAi plants by nuclear magnetic resonance, size-exclusion chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry indi cated a significant reduction in rubber biosynthesis and a corresponding 50 % increase in the levels of triterpenes and the main storage carbohydrate, inulin. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the <b>laticifers</b> in CPT-RNAi plants contained fewer and smaller rubber particles than wild-type <b>laticifers.</b> We also observed lower activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, reflecting homeostatic control of the isopentenyl diphosphate pool. To our knowledge, this is the first in planta demonstration of latex-specific CPT activity in rubber biosynthesis...|$|R
