5|$|The {{synopsis}} is at {{odds with}} the reviewers of the film who state that the arrow which reveals the hidden cache is shot by the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> not the mother. The image still shows the woman with a large bow, but further details by the reviewers state that the boy used a toy bow and arrow to make the shot.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton Project {{developed}} {{techniques for}} extracting polonium-210 from the lead dioxide ore {{in which it}} occurs naturally, and from bismuth targets that had been bombarded by neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Ultimately, polonium-based neutron initiators were used in both the gun-type <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>and</b> the implosion-type Fat Man used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. The fact that polonium {{was used as an}} initiator was classified until the 1960s, but George Koval, a technician with the Manhattan Project's Special Engineer Detachment, penetrated the Dayton Project as a spy for the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The first {{nuclear device}} ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb at the Trinity test, {{conducted}} at New Mexico's Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range on 16 July 1945. <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>and</b> Fat Man bombs were used {{a month later}} in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at Bikini Atoll as part of Operation Crossroads, developed new weapons, promoted {{the development of the}} network of national laboratories, supported medical research into radiology and laid the foundations for the nuclear navy. It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in January 1947.|$|E
5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a Flight Test Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>and</b> Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film {{can be seen as}} having another loose aspect to labor issues. The film directly followed first Thanhouser film to address the subject: The Girl Strike Leader. The film loosely refers labor relations when Jack Hunt is killed in a riot while on strike duty and the young widow is struggles to make ends meet. Thanhouser subjects would deal with other pressing social issues in The Girls of the Ghetto, another July 1910 release. The plot of The Lucky Shot employed the deus ex machina technique to resolve the financial needs of the widow and her child. Another plot of a needy family suddenly finding a concealed fortune within their house would be reused in The Thunderbolt. The film director and the cameraman are unknown and the only credits known for the cast is that of Marie Eline as the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> Mrs. George W. Walters {{in the role of the}} miserly woman. Other members cast may have included the other leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond, Frank H. Crane and Violet Heming.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} a few fictionalized {{accounts}} of historical events relating to nuclear weapons as well. The Manhattan Project itself, for example, was depicted in both the 1989 theatrical film Fat Man and <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>and,</b> somewhat more in-depth, also released in 1989 the CBS television film Day One. Thirteen Days (2000) dramatizes the tensions of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis from the standpoint of Pres. Kennedy's Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to supervising the intensive training of his flight crews during July 1945, Sweeney was slated {{to command the}} second atomic bomb mission. He trained with the crew of Captain (Charles D.) Don Albury aboard their B-29 The Great Artiste, and was aircraft commander on the training mission of July 11. He and the crew flew five of the nine rehearsal test drops of inert <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>and</b> Fat Man bomb assemblies {{in preparation for the}} missions.|$|E

25|$|It is, however, {{unlikely}} that a well-funded belligerent {{with nuclear weapons}} would waste their weapons with fuzing to explode below or on the surface, as both test shot Baker, and Castle Bravo were respectively. Instead, to maximize the range of city blast destruction and immediate death, an air burst is preferred, as the ≈500 meter explosion heights of the only nuclear weapons used on cities, <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>and</b> Fat Man also attests to. Moreover, with air bursts {{the total amount of}} radiation contained in the fallout, in units of activity/Becquerel, is somewhat less than the total that would be released from a surface or subsurface burst, as in comparison, depending on the height of burst, little to no neutron activation or neutron induced gamma activity of soil occurs from air bursts.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by critics, who commended its simplicity. It was also successful commercially, reaching the top-ten {{of the charts}} in Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, {{and the top of}} the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, thus making it Madonna's fifth number-one single in the US. The music video for [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] features a story line completely {{different from that of the}} song. In it, Madonna plays an exotic dancer in a peep-show club who befriends a <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> subsequently escapes. It was critically acclaimed for subverting the male gaze, but the plot point of a child entering a strip club was criticized. The video is an homage to actresses Liza Minnelli and Marlene Dietrich.|$|E
