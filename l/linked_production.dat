40|$|SummaryThe {{mechanistic}} {{links between}} genetic variation and autoantibody production in autoimmune disease remain obscure. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) {{is caused by}} inactivating mutations in FAS or FASL, with autoantibodies thought to arise through failure of FAS-mediated removal of self-reactive germinal center (GC) B cells. Here we show that FAS is in fact not required for this process. Instead, FAS inactivation led to accumulation of a population of unconventional GC B cells that underwent somatic hypermutation, survived despite losing antigen reactivity, and differentiated into a large population of plasma cells that included autoantibody-secreting clones. IgE+ plasma cell numbers, in particular, increased after FAS inactivation and a major cohort of ALPS-affected patients {{were found to have}} hyper-IgE. We propose that these previously unidentified cells, designated “rogue GC B cells,” are a major driver of autoantibody production and provide a mechanistic explanation for the <b>linked</b> <b>production</b> of IgE and autoantibodies in autoimmune disease...|$|E

Metabolic profiling discriminated variants during the complete cultivation. Moreover, the densities and plant distribution of three classes of trichoma were reported and analyzed for their cannabinoid profile. Next an alternative enzyme for, the major cannabinoid precursor, cannabigerolic acid production was investigated. By providing a new hypothesis for the prenylation mechanism, evidence is provided for activity improvement on important substrates for cannabinoid production.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the considerations of Polish economists {{about the economic}} crises and the business cycle in the interwar period. According to E. Taylor, {{the causes of the}} then crisis of overproduction, accompanied by the phenomenon of price scissors, included varied elasticity of demand for agricultural products and industrial products, as well as monetary inflation and new technical inventions. E. Lipinski believed that the crisis was a result of overinvestment. State interventionism in the economies did not ease, but aggravated the crisis on a global scale. W. M. Zawadzki pointed {{to the nature of the}} crisis in Poland as being due to economic underdevelopment, low consumption, and a huge shortage of capital. J. W. Libicki took the view that an analysis of the crisis in agriculture should be combined with an analysis of profitability of agricultural production. A. Krzyzanowski <b>linked</b> <b>production</b> fluctuations with changes in investment demand, and the latter with the assessment of profitability, which depends on the interest rate. A. Heydel explained the business cycle with an incorrect interest rate policy. At the same time, he postulated that the state should refrain from interference in economic life. On the other hand, M. Kalecki pointed to the excessive optimism of businesses, causing an increase in investment, which leads to changes in global demand, as a cause of fluctuations.

40|$|Inactivating {{mutations}} {{in the death}} receptor FAS or its ligand (FASL) cause Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) and lupus-like autoimmune diseases. FAS is thought to safeguard against autoantibody production by delivering death signals to self-reactive B cells that arise in the germinal centre (GC). Nevertheless, studies performed {{over the past two}} decades to elucidate a role for FAS in the regulation of GC B cell selection, differentiation and self-tolerance have yielded conflicting results. In this thesis a high resolution in vivo mouse model, specifically the adoptive transfer and challenge of anti-hen egg lysozyme (SWHEL) B cells lacking expression of FAS, was used to definitively address the role of FAS in regulating GC B cell responses. The results indicated that FAS was in fact not required for the deletion of self-reactive B cells that arise in the GC reaction. Instead, it was discovered that FAS functions by preventing the development of a previously unrecognized lymphocyte population designated "rogue" GC B cells (GCr). GCr B cells somatically mutate and survive despite losing antigen reactivity and differentiate into large populations of plasma cells with unconventional specificities, including autoantibody-secreting clones. Significantly, lgE+ plasma cells were particularly increased, leading us to identify a major cohort of ALPS patients with hyper-lgE. Data presented in this thesis indicate that GCr B cells are a major driver of autoantibody production and provide a mechanistic explanation for the <b>linked</b> <b>production</b> of lgE and autoantibodies in autoimmune disease...|$|E

The large geographic scale of Brazil nut exploitation and the significant contributions to local livelihoods, national economies, and forest-based development over the last decades, merit {{a review of the}} “conservation-through-use” paradigm. We use Elinor Ostrom’s framework for assessing sustainability in socioecological systems: (1) resource unit, (2) users, (3) governance system, and (4) resource system, to determine how different contexts and external developments generate specific conservation and development outcomes. We find that the resource unit reacts robustly to the type and level of extraction currently practiced; that resource users have built on a self-organized system that had defined boundaries and access to the resource; that <b>linked</b> <b>production</b> chains, market networks and informal financing work to supply global markets; and that local harvesters have used supporting alliances with NGOs and conservationists to formalize and secure their endogenous governance system and make it more equitable. As a result, the Brazil nut model represents a socioecological system that may not require major changes to sustain productivity. Yet since long-term Brazil nut production seems inextricably tied to a continuous forest cover, and because planted Brazil nut trees currently provide a minimal contribution to total nut production basin-wide, we call to preserve, diversify and intensify production in Brazil nut-rich forests that will inevitably become ever more integrated within human-modified landscapes over time...|$|E
40|$|An unknown Saccharopolyspora species which {{displayed}} fungicidal {{activity was}} selected {{as a representative of}} the genus. The antifungal activity could not be repeated in liquid cultures after the initial screen despite several different approaches. A defined medium was developed. However, biomass yields were low (< lg/ 1) and antifungal activity was not detected. Good growth was observed in nutrient broth (NB) and on nutrient agar (NA). The maximum specific growth rate in NB was 0. 25 h- 1. Growth on NA (measured using image analysis) conformed to the linear growth law with a mean radial growth rate of 0. 0327 mm/h. Fungicidal activity was measured on solid media, this was presumably due to antibiotic production, although an active compound could not be isolated. A mutation program yielded only non producing mutants despite the mutants having a range of growth rates. A known Saccharopolyspora species, Saccharopolyspora erythraea, was then adopted {{as a representative of the}} genus for the remainder of the study. Defined media were developed to permit growth limitation by a range of nutrients. A comparison of several approaches to calculate the maximum specific growth rate was made (ranging from 0. 119 to 0. 148 h- 1 in carbon limited media, 0. 093 to 0. 130 h- 1 in nitrogen limited, and 0. 143 to 0. 165 h- 1 in phosphate limited). Curve fitting provided an accurate series of specific growth rate estimates. The control mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of erythromycin by Saccharopolyspora erythraea were investigated. By culturing this organism in a range of conditions, and analysing the effects on various growth parameters, nutrient specific patterns of control were observed. Increasing biomass and increasing antibiotic titres occurred concurrently in media when growth was carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphate (P) limited. Generally, when antibiotic titre parallels growth, it is assumed that the product is growth linked. However, further analysis contradicted this. The peaks of specific growth rates and specific erythromycin production rates, obtained by curve fitting, were clearly temporally separated in carbon and phosphate limited conditions indicating non-growth <b>linked</b> <b>production</b> of erythromycin. Growth associated production was confirmed in nitrogen limited conditions. Phosphate limitation supported higher antibiotic yields than the other limitations (Yp/x max mg/g = 6. 4 in CL 1, 18. 5 in NL 1, and 28. 8 in PL 1). Erythromycin production was sensitive to ammonium and to glucose during phosphate limitation. However, this sensitivity to glucose was not obvious in the nitrate limited medium, suggesting different control mechanisms may affect the growth linked and non-growth <b>linked</b> <b>production</b> of erythromycin. Investigations into the regulation of the initiation of erythromycin production indicated that energy charge was not obviously involved, as it appeared to be related to the specific growth rate rather than antibiotic production. The rate of protein synthesis appeared to be a strong candidate for the initiator of antibiotic biosynthesis. Chemostat culture confirmed that erythromycin production was growth linked in nitrate limited conditions. However, the kinetics were more complicated as both biomass and antibiotic decreased with increasing dilution rates. The data conformed to the model proposed by Pirt (1975) for non-competitive inhibition by a growth linked product. A modelling package generated estimates of parameters involved (ki = 1. 2 mg/ 1, ks = 0. 017 g/l, micro max = 0. 062 h- 1 and Yp/s = 0. 0019) ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{starts with}} the {{recognition}} that labour has received less than {{its fair share of}} empirical and analytical attention in scholarship on Global Production Networks (GPNs). Such scholarship often ends with a paragraph on labour, concluding that it is {{the tail end of the}} production network that needs further research. Little is known, however, about how jobs for export markets fit into workers wider livelihoods strategies, or how workers react to new employment opportunities available to them. Based on empirical research carried out in the Tiruppur garment cluster in Tamil Nadu, South India, the article takes labourers, their livelihoods and their social reproduction as its starting point. It first reviews relevant labour geographies and GPN literature, and suggests that labour agency has been almost solely researched and conceptualised in terms of collective forms of organised worker resistance. The article then draws on case material from South India to examine how people enter garment work, the multiple and everyday forms of agency that they engage in, and the effects that their agency has on themselves and the industry. We follow a ‘horizontal ’ approach that accounts for gender, age, caste and regional connections in the making and constraining of agency, Such an approach reveals how labour agency is not merely fashioned by vertically <b>linked</b> <b>production</b> networks but as much by social relations and livelihood strategies that are themselves embedded in a wider regional economy and cultural environment.

40|$|Cost {{efficient}} customization {{of goods}} {{is a very}} important field of interest {{in many areas of the}} manufacturing sector today. New research tries to extend the concept of customized products to the field of medical devices. In particular, the focus is set on the production of minimally invasive disposables. In this context, fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) do not only provide compatibility with all relevant medical imaging technologies but can also be used to realize mechanical customization. Currently, the physician has to choose from the available product range predefined by the manufacturers. However, to maximize the ease of use of the medical devices and, thus, to optimize the outcome of the intervention a customized product would be the perfect solution. The involved devices are disposable items and todays production technology is optimized to produce high amounts of these devices with low variability at low costs. Also an individualized version of these devices would be a disposable. Therefore a still cost efficient and at the same time adaptive production system would be needed to manufacture such individualized disposables. One solution to overcome this challenge would be to link the necessary adaptive production systems in a continuous production line. On the one hand, the product can be produced cost efficiently in an endless process with minimum handling operations, on the other hand the adaptiveness of the involved production systems allows for customized manufacturing. However, the complexity of such combined continuous production system calls for new ways to control and optimize the process using data mining technologies. In this context, this work presents the initial steps to create a model of a micro-pullwinding process. The micro-pullwinding process as part of the <b>linked</b> <b>production</b> system will be used to produce FRP wires with customized mechanical properties.

40|$|Workplaces in {{the present}} {{interconnected}} world {{face the challenge of}} increasingly multiethnic personnel. Managerial reactions to this situation have shifted from the anti-discrimination of the North American affirmative action campaigns of the 1960 s and 1970 s to diversity management initiatives promising profitability and a better fit to the economic megadiscourse prevailing so far. However, the realisation of the promised gains in terms of both profit and equality remains ambiguous. Furthermore, critical organisational studies have pointed out problems with the outcomes of diversity campaigns, ranging from the essentialising of identities and masking control, to displacing the goal from equality to economic profit. Although critical research has gained some visibility in recent years, it still remains scarce compared to the mainstream, and is often dismissed as a form of cynical complaint. Meanwhile, diversity campaigns have progressed from North America to all sites of globally <b>linked</b> <b>production,</b> and from the business to the public sector. Ethnography as cultural critique offers an escape from such impasses by allowing a reconceptualisation of the issue. By contrasting alternative/dissident notions and practices to the understandings that presently prevail, the latter can be re-instituted in their artificial, nonself- evident status, and opened up to dialogue so that practitioners can better resist them, and have better chances to create their own approaches. The study {{takes the form of a}} workplace ethnography in a Finnish organisation, where the members appeared to be remarkably content in their transnational environment and enjoy good relations with colleagues. Their notions of ethnicity were the first target of attention, to uncover why they treated each other with civility despite the fact that no diversity campaigns had taken place in their organisation. I conducted research among the full-heartedly cosmopolitan, but passionately anti-diversity-minded employees of a Finnish-based high-tech company in its Helsinki headquarters and the somewhat less easy-doing employees in a sales office in San Jose (CA), through a period of boom and downturn of 1999 - 2004. I found that the main alternative to diversity management was organisational democracy. An exceptionally participatory management style offered the employees avenues to defend their rights and develop a ‘voice’ in the organisation, rendering any specific diversity programmes mostly unnecessary. Yet there were issues to deal with. ‘Normal’ pragmatism and several uncritically upheld iconic ideas about Finnishness need to be reconsidered to avoid the possible marginalisation of non-Finnish staff. This probably also holds in other Finnish organisations. The cultural critique now produced suggests vocabulary and interpretations as material for such reconsideration...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of immune self-tolerance allows {{the immune system}} to mount responses against infectious agents, but not against self-molecular constitutes. Although self-tolerance is a robust phenomenon, in some individuals {{as well as in}} experimental models, the self-tolerance breaks down and as a result, a self-destructive autoimmune disease emerges. The underlying mechanisms for the development of autoimmune diseases are not known, but genetic, environmental and immunological factors are suggested to be involved. In this thesis, we used murine mercury-induced autoimmunity to test this suggestion. In susceptible mice mercuric chloride induces a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by increased serum levels of IgG 1 and IgE, production of anti-nucleolar autoantibodies (ANolA) and formation of renal IgG deposits. In contrast, in resistant DBA/ 2 (H- 2 d) mice, none of these characteristics develop after exposure to mercury. By crossing and backcrossing mercury-resistant DBA/ 2 mice to mercury susceptible strains, we found that the resistance was inherited as a dominant trait in F 1 hybrids and that one gene or a cluster of genes located in the H- 2 loci determined the resistance to ANolA production, whereas resistance to the other characteristics was found to be controlled by two or three non-H- 2 genes. We further put forward the “cryptic peptide hypothesis” to investigate whether mercury and another xenobiotic metal use similar pathway(s) to induce the H- 2 <b>linked</b> <b>production</b> of ANolA. We found that while mercury stimulated ANolA synthesis in all H- 2 susceptible (H- 2 s, H- 2 q and H- 2 f) mouse strains, silver induced only ANolA responses in H- 2 s and H- 2 q mice, but not in H- 2 f mice. Further studies showed that the resistance to silver-induced ANolA production in H- 2 f mice was inherited as a dominant trait. We next tested the proposition that mercury induces more adverse immunological effects in mouse strains, which are genetically prone to develop autoimmune diseases, using tight-skin 1 mice, an animal model for human Scleroderma. It was found that in this strain, mercury induced a strong immune activation with autoimmune characteristics, but did not accelerate the development of dermal fibrosis, a characteristic in Tsk/ 1 mice. Finally we addressed the Th 1 /Th 2 cross-regulation paradigm by examining if a Th 1 -type of response could interact with a Th 2 -type of response if simultaneous induced in susceptible mice. Our findings demonstrated that mercury-induced autoimmunity (Th 2 -type) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) (Th 1 -type) can interact in a synergistic, antagonistic or additive fashion, depending on at which stage of CIA mercury is administered...|$|E
