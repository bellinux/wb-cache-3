40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{empirical}} relation between market competition and innovation using Luxembourg's Structural Business Statistics. The competitive pressure in Luxembourg's markets is assessed by computing a prot elasticity measure, {{based on the}} idea of cost-efficiency. From this, the paper analyses the relation between competition and innovation performance by estimating an equation for the determinants of R&D expenditure. The results show that Luxembourg's industries are characterised by low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> <b>intensity,</b> especially in markets relevant to competition policy and regulation. The relation between competition and innovation is non-linear and depends crucially on the efficient use of inputs to production. The impact of the distribution of technological efficiency on innovation is assessed by measuring both average technology gap and technology spread. The innovation effort is increasing as industries are closer to the frontier, and decreasing in the technology spread. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{economic}} terminology, 'competition intensity' {{can be used}} {{to mirror}} to a certain degree the status of industrial competition in a specific market, while in the construction market, it particularly involves the part of project competition intensity (PCI). Based on a road project in China, two forms of PCI, overt and covert, are identified in this study. To lower project construction cost thus enabling better project tendering performance, clients can facilitate higher levels of overt PCI by tailoring their tendering procedures, whereas, through covert PCI project competitors can adopt anti-competitive behaviours to attain the expected works. The difference between overt PCI and covert PCI indicates various practitioners' perspectives and impact on the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> in construction. The findings suggest a way to promote PCI studies in the future, and offer new insights into other parts of competition intensity in construction.

I draw data from the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program which, as the longest-running and largest private school voucher program in the United States, contains substantial cross-sectional and longitudinal variation in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> faced by public schools, measured by the enrollment capacity and proximity of participating private schools. First, I find {{that the effect of}} competition is positive on average al-though these benefits are not well distributed with schools serving the lowest income students receiving the least benefit. Second, non-linearity in competition effects im-plies decreasing and nearly negative returns to scale of competition for lower-income schools. I conclude that market-based incentives can be beneficial for some schools, but are not sufficient to generate public school accountability for the lowest-achieving schools. ∗I am grateful for direction and support from Barbara Wolfe, Christopher Taber, Jane Cooley and Robert Meyer.

Using firm level panel data and an instrumental variable estimation it finds an inverted-U relationship between <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> and investment. The intermediate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> that maximizes investment stands at 62 percent, whereby <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> {{is measured by}} 1 -Lerner index at the firm level. This means that the maximal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> investment is reached, on average, when the operating pro t represents 38 percent of total revenue. This result is rationalized through a theoretical model that yields an inverted-U relationship between competition and investment. It shows that the potential technological progress, measured by the impact of investment on the reduction of marginal cost, is the main determinant of the investment maximizing intermediate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> The higher the potential technological progress, the lower the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> that maximizes investmen...|$|R

Using a large sample of European listed firms in the period from 2003 to 2011 and system GMM we find a significant compensation effect on corporate firm performance for the initial negative effect of horizontal multiple directorships by product market competition. In markets with effective competition, horizontal multiple directorships turn out to be an efficient mechanism to increase firm performance and thus assure competitive advantages. By contrast, linkages between up- and downstream firms have no significant influence on financial performance, irrespective <b>of</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> <b>intensity...</b>|$|R

The different arrangements for interchange fees and the nosurcharge rule lower the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> that would otherwise have occurred and push interchange fees up. In many countries, competition regulators carried out investigations on the lack <b>of</b> transparency and <b>competition</b> in these card-based payment systems, and took measurements for an optimal determination of interchange fees. To help understand and predict the evolution of payment markets, we use an agent-based model that simulates strategic behaviours for different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> interchange fee.

40|$|The late Early Pleistocene site Barranc de la Boella {{provides}} an unparalleled opportunity {{to assess the}} context of the activities of the hominin populations that inhabited the Iberian Peninsula at 1 Ma. Recently, strong evidence for access to mammoth meat has been described at the Pit 1 locality. At the la Mina and el Forn excavation areas, little evidence exists for the anthropogenic processing of macromammals. However, the presence of humans is recorded, and the available evidence suggests these populations had access to several interesting resources. By analysing and comparing ¿ve separate assemblages at Barranc de la Boella, we assess the ¿uctuating presence of hominins and carnivores and the levels of competition among predators in each assemblage. Our analysis re-veals different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> during the formation of assemblages when hominin groups were present, as evidenced by the abundance and diversity of stone artefacts. The analyses of skeletal component ratios indicate several competitive contexts, and the greatest presence of hominin groups is associated with the most c om pe ti t i ve sc e n a ri os.

40|$|In {{the context}} of a dynamic and hyper-competitive {{business}} environment, appropriate design of supply chains helps organisations to align resources for improved flow of products and services and satisfy customers&rsquo; diverse needs. Researchers have proposed several supply chain designs which are mutually exclusive such as efficient versus responsive, and lean versus agile. Quantitative testing of these designs revealed that many firms&rsquo; supply chain designs do not match with what was conceptually expected. In this research, a new approach to supply chain leagility is investigated, proposing all supply chains are leagile with different magnitudes of leanness and agility. In this regard, a new index, &lsquo;deviation from leagility&rsquo; (DFL), is introduced, and employed in this study to optimise supply chain design. DFL is the absolute distance of supply chain design from a balanced supply chain. Balanced supply chain is a position where the magnitude of leanness and agility is equal. A comprehensive model of uncertainty including demand, supply, and internal uncertainty is engaged to investigate the impact of uncertainty as a key design driver of supply chains. The partial least squares (PLS) was employed to analyse data collected from Australian firms. The results indicate that higher performance is achievable when the deviation from a balanced supply chain in which both aspects of leanness and agility are equally embedded, is minimised. Results also reveal that DFL is directly and positively influenced by the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty; while it is indirectly impacted by the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> and customers&rsquo; expectation. Analysis of market segment revealed that irrespective of the segment a firm is operating in or for, uncertainty is a significant determinant of designing a supply chain. However, there is higher magnitude of agility for companies active in the up-market segment of an industry compared to the down-market segment...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} dynamic model of price and quality {{competition}} {{in order to}} analyse the effects <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> on quality provision and to which extent an unregulated market is able to provide a socially optimal quality level. Using a differential-game approach with price and quality competition on a Hotelling line, we compare the benchmark open-loop solution against the feedback closed-loop solution, which implies strategic dynamic interaction over time. We find that steady-state quality in the closed-loop solution is (i) increasing in the degree <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> between firms, (ii) lower than in the open-loop solution, and (iii) lower than the socially optimal level.

However, males released more sperm when spawning in the presence of competing males (four-male and one-male treatments pooled) than when spawning in the absence of competing males (zero-male and one-female treatments pooled).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis {{is the study of}} ethological and morphological reproductive traits of the terrestrial gastropod Helix aspersa under the theoretical framework of sexual selection. More precisely, the aim of the thesis was the study of the population diversity of these traits and their correlation with microclimatic or social elements that influence or even determine the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> sperm <b>competition</b> <b>intensity.</b> In order to study the way snails adapt their mating behavior in populations in which they face different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> sperm <b>competition</b> <b>intensity,</b> five populations from two regions of Southern Greece (Nafpaktos and Nafplion) were selected, differing in population density and microclimatic conditions. Mating propensity, mating duration and frequency, duration between successive matings and courtship duration were recorded. Also, the duration of distinguishable reproductive phases was calculated and the number of ovipositions, the egg size, the hatching success and the viability of newly hatched snails were recorded both in wild animals that came from the field (P generation), as well as in their descendants that were raised in the laboratory (F 1 generation) in order to detect any relations of these characteristics with sperm <b>competition</b> <b>intensity,</b> as well as to examine their persistence in F 1 generation. The results from the observations lead {{to the conclusion that the}} population density influences the mating behaviour, since the snails that came from denser populations showed smaller intermating intervals and/or longer copulation durations. In F 1 snails, which were raised under uniform density regimes in the laboratory, no differentiation of the corresponding mating characteristics were observed. The microclimatic conditions of the habitat modify mating behaviour of snails. Snails from dry habitats tend to copulate more rapidly and more often, so as to benefit from the occasional favourable conditions prevailing in the field. On the contrary, snails from habitats of continuously high and predictable humidity regimes decreased mating frequency, as well as the speed of their response to environmental stimuli to initiate reproductive activity. This differentiation of mating activity was also observed in the descendants of the snails that were raised under laboratory conditions. Courtship duration does not differ among the populations studied, tends however to be longer in primary than in secondary courtship sequences. The durations of distinguishable reproductive phases do not appear to be differentiated among the populations studied. Nevertheless, the duration between oviposition and hatching and the duration of hatching decreased in the snails of F 1 generation, probably as a response to the favourable laboratory conditions. The number of eggs produced per snail appears to be influenced mainly by the size of the animals and the number of matings before oviposition and it is not related to the density or the microclimatic habitat characteristics of the populations, neither is differentiated in the F 1 generation. Respectively, the size of the eggs is negatively related to the number of eggs per clutch and does not appear to be influenced by other factors. ...|$|R

One way to measure the degree of integration in addition to cointegration techniques are already widely used is the correlation. The use of correlation is done not only to show different degree of integration but also intended to identify the determinant of market integration which starting from theory of stock market interdependence as proposed by Pretorius (2002). The first finding of this study is the different degree of integration at the country and industry levels in the ASEAN which reflects the difference in the benefits of international diversification among industries and countries as well as supporting the concept of time-varying integration of Bekaert and Harvey (1995).
