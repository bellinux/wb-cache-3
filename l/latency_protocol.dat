40|$|Part 1 : Distributed ProtocolsInternational audienceMany uniform {{total order}} {{broadcast}} protocols {{have been designed}} in the last 30 years. Unfortunately, none of them achieves both optimal throughput and low <b>latency.</b> Indeed, <b>protocols</b> achieving optimal throughput rely on a ring dissemination pattern, which induces high <b>latencies.</b> <b>Protocols</b> achieving low <b>latency</b> rely on IP multicast and fail to achieve good throughput because of message losses. In this paper, we describe FastCast, the first protocol that achieves both optimal throughput and low latency. To achieve low latency, FastCast relies on IP multicast. To achieve optimal throughput, FastCast defines a protocol responsible for dynamically computing the throughput at which processes can send IP multicast messages. Thanks to this dynamic bandwidth allocation protocol, FastCast allows multiple processes to simultaneously send messages, while avoiding message losses. An evaluation of FastCast on a cluster of 8 machines shows that it indeed achieves optimal throughput and a very low latency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have {{utilized}} {{a huge amount}} research interest for their omnipresent applications to gather information from their sensing terrain. The gathered information will undergo in-network process and send to the remote sink. In this densely distributed network high packet flow occur near the sink due to the convergent nature of upstream traffic. Congestion may occur in the network and cause packet loss. Therefore congestion has to be controlled to prolong the sensor nodes lifetime. This paper presents RETSINA-based upstream congestion control protocol named, Agent-based Congestion Control Protocol (ACCP) for wireless sensor networks. The rate traffic analysis on each node {{is based on the}} priority index and the congestion degree of the node. In addition, we comprehensively evaluated the performance of congestion control with multi agent platforms as technology choices and investigated its latency and protocol overhead in three different scenarios.

Public physical unclonable functions (PPUFs) have removed the main conceptual limitations of PUFs by enabling {{the creation of}} public key protocols. Traditional methods of constructing PPUFs leverage intrinsic process variation in submicron integrated circuits. However, these implementations impose high power usage and require long simulation times, producing high <b>latency</b> <b>protocols.</b> We propose to use next generation CMOScompatible technologies, such as memristors and nanowires, whose components exhibit non-linear circuit characteristics, {{for the creation of}} PPUFs. We utilize the bidirectional nature of these components and introduce a novel architecture of PPUF polyomino partitioning. Furthermore, we present new security protocols that authenticate orders of magnitude faster than their CMOS-based PPUF counterparts.

Distributed or virtual shared memory provides a high level of programming abstraction when it comes to build distributed or parallel applications. It is a promising technology and we think that this paradigm could be extended to general distributed systems. The challenge in this case is to overcome the problems of network <b>latencies,</b> <b>protocol</b> overhead and diversity of platforms. We addressed the first problem by using a UDP based asynchronous reliable message transfer protocol which faces the end-to-end argument of middleware layer applications.

40|$|An {{important}} future addition for a Space Based High Performance Computer System is {{a high-speed}} optical network for faster data transmission. The {{purpose of this}} project is to research and simulate next generation computing applications on high-speed optical networks. The research has been performed in the System Application context involving embedded high-performance computing applications and optical networking technology to guide future {{research and development of}} advanced optical devices. The research addresses advanced processing system issues in bandwidth, <b>latency,</b> <b>protocol,</b> topology, and fault tolerance in relation to high performance systems. The reference distributed computer, provided by BAE SYSTEMS in Nashua New Hampshire, consists of multiple processing nodes connected by a Myrinet copper network. The advanced embedded computing applications include Space-Based Radar Corner Turn processing, Synthetic Aperture Radar Back End processing, and Random Workload software models. Two Optical networks have been developed as part of this research to replace the reference Myrinet network, a Ring based network and a Star based network. Both networks employ redundancy to provide an alternate direct optical path between each pair of nodes. Of these networks the Ring design failed due to packet collisions and due to the need for a complex networking protocol. The Star Optical network design performed well in comparison to the reference network design. Overall, network latency was reduced and the internode data distribution speed was dramatically increased. Also, the memory usage {{for each of the three}} software models was analyzed and each has definite bound that will help future development. Although the results of this research are favorable, the eventual future design and implementation of a Space Based High Performance Computer System would benefit from additional research on a number of topics. by Eric J.

Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) have been the backbone of web transport for decades, thus {{received a lot of}} attention recently due to end-to-end performance degradation in mobile environments. Inefficiencies of HTTP and TCP strongly affect web response time mainly in resource limited devices. HTTP compression reduces some of the burden imposed by TCP slow start phase.
