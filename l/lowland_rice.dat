25|$|The {{lowland area}} of Cavite is {{generally}} composed of Guadalupe clay and clay loam. It is characterized as coarse and granular when dry but sticky and plastic when wet. Its substratum is solid volcanic tuff. These types of soils are suited to <b>lowland</b> <b>rice</b> and corn while {{those in the}} upland are suited for orchard and pasture. Guadalupe clay adobes are abundant {{in the southern part}} of Bacoor and Imus bordering Dasmariñas. The soil is hard and compact and difficult to cultivate that makes it generally unsuitable for diverse cropping. It is very sticky when wet and granular when dry. Forage grass is advised for this type of soil. Hydrosol and Obando sand are found along Bacoor Bay. The shoreline of Rosario, Tanza, Naic and Ternate are lined with Guadalupe sand.|$|E
2500|$|Pedologic surveys {{conducted}} by the Bureau of Soils Management of the Philippine Department of Agriculture have identified two major soil series or categories in Quezon. These road categories are the Bago Sandy Clay Loam and the San Juan Clay. The San Juan Clay is extensively distributed covering about 113.94km² or about 60 percent of the municipality. It offers excellent potential for such agricultural land use like onchards, commercial forest, woodland and pasture/ grazing lands. The Bago Sandy Clay Loam on the other hand, covers about [...] or bout 40% of the municipality. This particular type of soil is devoted to <b>lowland</b> <b>rice</b> farming.|$|E
5000|$|Oryza sativa {{contains}} two major subspecies: the sticky, short-grained japonica or sinica variety, and the nonsticky, long-grained indica variety. Japonica varieties are usually cultivated in dry fields, in temperate East Asia, upland areas of Southeast Asia, and high elevations in South Asia, while indica varieties are mainly <b>lowland</b> <b>rices,</b> grown mostly submerged, throughout tropical Asia. Rice {{occurs in a}} variety of colors, including: white, brown, black, purple, and red rices. [...] Black rice (also known as purple rice) is a range of rice types, some of which are glutinous rice. Varieties include Indonesian black rice and Thai jasmine black rice.|$|R
40|$|SINCE THE mid- 1960 s, rice {{farmers in}} the {{irrigated}} areas of Asia have rapidly adopted `Green Revolution` rices because of their responsiveness to nitrogen fertilizer and their higher yields, shorter crop duration, and shorter stature. Such cultivars were well suited to systems with good water control and moderate to high management inputs. Although modern rice cultivars have been adopted in less favourable environments, farmers also continue to rely on their traditional cultivars in the uplands and rainfed <b>lowlands.</b> <b>Rice</b> breeding strategies are now being developed that are more tailored to such unfavourable rice environments. Farmers` criteria for selecting or rejecting different rices in the unfavourable regions constitute a valuable resource for programmes interested in improving the productivity of such bypassed areas...|$|R

50|$|The Philippine Rice Research Institute has {{numerous}} interdisciplinary {{programs which}} develops and promotes {{technologies that are}} ecosystem-based, location- and problem-specific, and profitable to the Filipino farmers. The interdisciplinary programs were as follows: Direct-seeded irrigated <b>lowland</b> <b>rice,</b> Transplanted irrigated <b>lowland</b> <b>rice,</b> Hybrid rice, Rice for adverse environments, Rice-based farming systems, Rice and rice-based products, Policy research and advocacy, and Technology promotion.|$|E

A change to its R&D structure was implemented from 1998 to 2005. Each multidisciplinary R&D program was {{carried by the}} different discipline-based divisions and each division participated in each R&D programs, as follows: Policy Research and Advocacy, Technology Promotion, Rice and Rice-based Products, Rice-Based Farming systems for Fragile Environment, Hybrid Rice, Transplanted Irrigated <b>Lowland</b> <b>Rice,</b> Direct Seeded Irrigated <b>Lowland</b> <b>Rice,</b> and Environmental Sustainability & Management.|$|E
5000|$|In 1900, {{the annual}} {{production}} of rice in the US was approximately half the annual consumption. The two principal varieties of <b>lowland</b> <b>rice</b> which were cultivated in the Atlantic States were the [...] "gold seed rice" [...] and white rice, {{which were the}} original rice varieties introduced into the US. Gold seed rice was notable for the larger yield of the grain. It thus practically superseded white rice which was cultivated in the earlier years. Experiments with upland rice demonstrated that it could grow over {{large areas of the}} country but the crop's yield and quality are inferior to <b>lowland</b> <b>rice</b> produced by irrigation methods.|$|E
50|$|Rice {{accounted}} for about 80 percent of cultivated land during the 1989-90 growing season, including 422,000 hectares of <b>lowland</b> wet <b>rice</b> and 223,0 hectares of upland rice. This demonstrates that although there is interplanting of upland crops and fish are found in fields, irrigated rice agriculture remains basically a monoculture system despite government efforts to encourage crop diversification.|$|R

The interactions between nitrogen and variety were not significant for all measured traits. Grain yields of the NERICAs were higher than the yield of ITA 150 (check) by 0. 5 to 1. 0 mg ha- 1. When pooled across N rates and years, yield differences among the NERICAs were not significant. Grain yield response to nitrogen was linear. At 100 kg N ha- 1, grain yield was significantly increased by 3. 0 and 1. 5 mg ha- 1 over the yields at 0 and 30 kg N ha- 1 respectively. Since grain yield response to N application was linear, further studies are recommended to determine the optimum rate of N for rain-fed <b>lowland</b> NERICA <b>rice</b> production.

'Alternate wetting and drying' (AWD) is a water {{management}} technique, practiced to cultivate irrigated <b>lowland</b> <b>rice</b> with much less water {{than the usual}} system of maintaining continuous standing water in the crop field.

This method reduces water demand for irrigation and greenhouse gas emissions without reducing crop yields.|$|E

40|$|Conservation Agriculture (CA) was {{introduced}} {{at the lake}} Alaotra, in Madagascar, in the 2000 ’s {{in a context of}} traditionnal mining upland agriculture and silting-up of <b>lowlands</b> <b>rice</b> fields. Land tenure pressure linked to the attractiveness of the area lead to the progressive colonization of surrounding upland hills (Tanety), very sensitive to erosion. Conservation agriculture tackles with a double challenges: i) maintain and/or increase household income and ii) preserve natural resources through sustainable agricultural practices in the long term. This paper assesses the economic impact of CA adoption on farmers’s income trough modeling representative farms selected according to a local typology, based on the last 5 years with a prospective analysis for the next 5 years. The BV-lac Project Field database highlighted a light increase of yield according to the age of CA systems. A buffering effect on climate hazards has been as well identified trough production stability over the years leading to adoption as part of a risk limiting strategy. Elements of the CA techniques are adopted spontaneously within surrounding farming systems leading to improvment of conventionnal tillage based systems. Smallholders agricultural practices evolution displays a high capacity for innovation. Modeling with a dedidated tool (Olympe is a budget analysis oriented tool) has highlighted that CA systems improve significantly net farm income in the midterm (5 to 10 years) and gross margin at plot scale. For farm holdings with few irrigated rice fields, mainly relying on upland agriculture, CA systems increase farming systems resilience to climatic events and price volatility as well as sustainable agricultural practices maintaining local and fragile ressources.
