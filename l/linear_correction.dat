40|$|Recently, {{network error}} {{correction}} coding (NEC) {{has been studied}} extensively. Several bounds in classical coding theory have been extended to network error correction coding, especially the Singleton bound. In this paper, following the research line using the extended global encoding kernels proposed in zhang-correction, the refined Singleton bound of NEC can be proved more explicitly. Moreover, we give a constructive proof of the attainability of this bound and indicate that the required field size {{for the existence of}} network maximum distance separable (MDS) codes can become smaller further. By this proof, an algorithm is proposed to construct general <b>linear</b> network error <b>correction</b> codes including the <b>linear</b> network error <b>correction</b> MDS codes.

40|$|Mathematical {{models are}} often used to {{forecast}} interesting scientific phenomena. These models may provide a good approximation for the system being studied, but they are rarely perfect. Whether due to scientific misunderstandings or the necessity of numerically approximating {{the solution to the}} model, the mathematical models fail to exactly replicate the true dynamics of the system. This "model error" leads to forecast errors and degradation of forecast skill. The primary goal of this dissertation is to develop methods to correct a mathematical model with observed data, improving the accuracy of forecasts generated by the model. Correcting for model error is particularly difficult when the system is high-dimensional and when the state transition model is nonlinear. The methods developed in this dissertation are robust to both of these difficulties. The problem of estimating model error may be phrased as a parameter estimation problem within a filtering context. Many parameter estimation methods have been developed for the particle filter (PF), a filter with strong theoretical underpinnings and well understood large sample properties. Unfortunately, the PF fails when the state dimension is large. Instead, scientists who filter high-dimensional state-spaces typically use the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). This algorithm is effective in practice, but its large sample properties remain to be proven and methods for parameter estimation exist only in special cases. We make a newfound connection between these two algorithms: the EnKF is a regularized PF with additional approximations that have yet to be fully justified from a theoretical standpoint. Building on this connection, we introduce a novel algorithm that combines the best features of the EnKF and the PF. The EnKF is used to filter the high-dimensional state while an auxiliary PF is used to estimate the low-dimensional parameters; we call this filter the EnKF-APF. Using the Lorenz 2005 system, we demonstrate that the true parameter values are better captured with the EnKF-APF algorithm than with the EnKF. Having developed a robust method for parameter estimation within a filtering context, we return to the question of model error. Following previous work in the literature, we focus on a <b>linear</b> <b>correction</b> to the mathematical model. If the state has dimension d, the number of parameters in the <b>linear</b> <b>correction</b> is on the order of d^ 2. The EnKF-APF algorithm does not allow for the estimation of such high-dimensional parameters, and even if it did, an enormous amount of data would be required to provide good estimates. To make the problem tractable, we assume the problem of interest exhibits a large degree of spatial structure and exploit this special structure to reduce the dimensionality of the <b>linear</b> <b>correction.</b> We propose to correct the model error with a low-rank <b>linear</b> <b>correction,</b> inspired by methods used to model multivariate spatial processes in the geostatistics literature. We demonstrate our method on the Lorenz 2005 system by applying the EnKF-APF algorithm to estimate the parameters of the low-rank <b>linear</b> <b>correction</b> in both a batch and online manner. Although the model error in this test is nonlinear, we demonstrate that the proposed low-rank <b>linear</b> <b>correction</b> provides better forecasts...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the motion of}} classical spinning test particles in Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics and investigate innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO). The main goal of this work is to find analytically the small-spin corrections for the parameters of ISCO (radius, total angular momentum, energy, orbital angular frequency) of spinning test particles {{in the case of}} vectors of black hole spin, particle spin and orbital angular momentum being collinear to each other. We analytically derive the small-spin <b>linear</b> <b>corrections</b> for arbitrary Kerr parameter $a$. The cases of Schwarzschild, slowly rotating and extreme Kerr black hole are considered in details. For a slowly rotating black hole the ISCO parameters are obtained up to quadratic in $a$ and particle's spin $s$ terms. From the formulae obtained it is seen that the spin-orbital coupling has attractive character when spin and angular momentum are parallel and repulsive when they are antiparallel. For the case of the extreme Kerr black hole with co-rotating particle we succeed to find the exact analytical solution for the limiting ISCO parameters for arbitrary spin. It has been shown that the limiting values of ISCO radius and frequency do not depend on the particle's spin while values of energy and total angular momentum depend on it. We have also considered circular orbits of arbitrary radius and have found small-spin <b>linear</b> <b>corrections</b> for the total angular momentum and energy at given radius.

We first analyse the main statistical properties of the wavelet estimator and show the conditions to reach optimality. We include the <b>linear</b> term <b>correction</b> in our estimators and compare the estimates with the values already published using only the cubic term. The estimators are tested with realistic WMAP simulations with anisotropic noise and the WMAP KQ 75 sky cut. The inclusion of the <b>linear</b> term <b>correction</b> shows a negligible improvement (< 1 per cent) in the error-bar for any of the shapes considered. The results of this analysis show that, in the particular case of the wavelet estimator, the optimality for WMAP anisotropy levels is basically achieved with the mean subtraction and in practical terms there is no need of including a linear term once the mean has been subtracted. Our best estimates are now: local fnl = 39. 0 +/ 21. 4, equilateral fnl = - 62. 8 +/- 154. 0 and orthogonal fnl = - 159. 8 +/- 115. 1 (all cases 68 per cent CL).
