40|$|Shape {{information}} has been recognised as {{playing a role in}} intrinsic image estimation since its inception. However, it is only in recent years that hints of the importance of geometry have been found in decomposing surface appearance into albedo and shading estimates. This thesis establishes the central importance of shape in intrinsic surface property estimation for static and dynamic scenes, and introduces methods for the use of approximate shape {{in a wide range of}} related problems to provide high-level constraints on shading. A key contribution is intrinsic texture estimation. This is a generalisation of intrinsic image estimation, in which appearance is processed as a function of surface position rather than pixel position. This approach has numerous advantages, in that the shape can be used to resolve occlusion, inter-reflection and attached shading as a natural part of the method. Unlike previous bidirectional texture function estimation approaches, high-quality albedo and shading textures are produced without prior knowledge of materials or lighting. Many of the concepts in intrinsic texture estimation can be extended to single-viewpoint capture for which depth information is available. Depth information greatly reduces the ambiguity of the shading estimation problem, allowing online intrinsic video to be developed for the first time. The availability of a <b>lighting</b> <b>function</b> also allows high-level temporal constraints on shading to be applied over video sequences, which previously required per-pixel correspondence between frames to be established. A number of applications of intrinsic video are investigated, including augmented reality, video stylisation and relighting, all of which run at interactive framerates. The albedo distribution of the input video is preserved, even in the case of natural scenes with complex appearance, and a globally-consistent shading estimate is obtained which remains robust over dynamic sequences. Finally, an integrated framework bridging the gaps between intrinsic image, video and texture estimation is presented for the first time. Approximate scene geometry provides a convenient means of achieving this, and is used in establishing pixel constraints between adjacent cameras, reconstructing scene lighting, and removing cast shadows and inter-reflections. This introduces a unified geometry-based approach to intrinsic image estimation and related fields, which achieves high-quality results for complex natural scenes for a wide range of capture modalities...|$|E
40|$|Register is the {{language}} varieties used by people in particular setting and situations. Certain community prefers to use a particular variety of language {{because they want to}} share the information more easily. In this study, the writer investigated the register used by the cinematography community in UMM (University of Muhammadiyah Malang) and the meaning of those registers. The writer believed that the cinematography community of UMM often use the special term of language that were only understood among them. Therefore, the writer was interested in finding the register and knowing the meaning of those register used. The writer applied a descriptive qualitative research design to describe and interpret the register used by the cinematography community. To collect the data, the writer used interview, documentation and observation. In this study, interview was the primary instrument to get the data. In the interview, the writer got much information about the history of “Kine Club” and some cinematography registers from three informants. In the documentation, the writer read special reference always used by the community and by using it, the writer got a lot of cinematography registers needed. This reference helped the writer to verify the fixed meaning of each register not mentioned or explained clearly by the informants. Besides, the writer also used other documents outside that community to compare and add some meanings of registers which were not written in the reference in the “Kine Club”. To complete the data, the writer used observation to explore their activities in their base camp. To analyze the data, the writer applied several steps as follows: 1) identified, classified and analyzed the data of the cinematography registers, 2) showed the cinematography registers with that meaning, 3) arranged the data in the form of table, 4) drew conclusion based on the data.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to address employees’ satisfaction with indoor environment quality (IEQ) associated with alternative workspaces (AWSp) and primary workspaces (PWSp). Specific IEQ criteria of interest included acoustics, appearance (aesthetics), daylighting, electric <b>lighting,</b> <b>function,</b> furnishings, indoor air quality, thermal conditions, vibration and movement, and view. A post-occupancy evaluation (POE) was conducted with employees (faculty, staff and students) who had workspace in a facility designed and developed referencing sustainable design guidelines. Hanson Hall was selected for this study as it was developed referencing the B 3 Guidelines (formerly known as the Minnesota Sustainability Guidelines or MSBG). Hanson Hall is a five-level, classroom and office building located on the West Bank of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus and includes approximately 25, 400 square feet of space dedicated to primary workspaces (PWSp) and 23, 900 square feet of space allocated to alternative workspaces (AWSp). The Sustainable Post-Occupancy Evaluation Survey (SPOES) was used for this study and modified to include questions for an Alternative Workspace Module. Affordance theory served as the theoretical framework for this research, and a model was developed to illustrate employees’ (observing/perceiving) satisfaction with the IEQ criteria in the designed environment, natural environment, and social environment. Employees responded to an online survey to rate their satisfaction with the overall facility (site, building and interior) [F (SBI) ], their PWSp, and their AWSp. They also rated their satisfaction with IEQ criteria associated with their PWSp and self-identified AWSp. Satisfaction was rated on a 1 - 7 Likert-type scale, and data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. An IEQ satisfaction score was developed from the weighted means of the 11 IEQ criteria resulting in an overall composite IEQ score of 5. 32 for the PWSp and 5. 29 for the AWSp. The IEQ criterion affording the highest level of satisfaction with PWSp was function, and the lowest level of satisfaction was view. The IEQ criterion affording the highest level of satisfaction for the AWSp was function and the lowest level of satisfaction was view. ANOVA results of the overall satisfaction with the F (SBI), PWSp, and AWSp revealed statistically significant differences among the three IEQ scores. Previous research on employees’ satisfaction with IEQ criteria was associated only with the overall F (SBI) and the PWSp. This study addressed the increasing use of AWSp to accommodate employees’ work modes with the goal to develop a more comprehensive understanding of employees’ satisfaction with IEQ criteria across all workplace settings. This research served as a pilot study and is considered limited in scope and in sample size (N= 26). However, much was learned about AWSp and the process used to evaluate employees’ satisfaction with their AWSp...|$|E
