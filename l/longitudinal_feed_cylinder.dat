40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{theoretical}} approach to the calculation of the temperature of the blade cutting tool, taking into account the distribution of heat released during the cutting process, formed between the chip and the surface layer of the workpiece. On the basis of the received analytical dependences for determining the temperature of cutting when turning the basic conditions for its reduction have been defined. They mainly consist in reducing the cutting adequate stress (machining energy consumption) by reducing the intensity of the cutter friction against the cutting material in the cutting zone by applying a high-speed processing, but also by reducing the main cutting edge angle. It has been shown that if the cutting speed and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feed</b> continuously increase the cutting temperature continuously increases as well, asymptotically approaching a constant value equal to the temperature of the produced chips. This indicates that with increasing speed of cutting and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feed</b> all the heat generated during cutting is spent on heating the chip, and just {{a small part of the}} heat goes into the workpiece. As a result, it is possible to improve the quality of the treated surface as the probability of forming burns, cracks, and other temperature microscopic defects occurring on the treated surface decreases. Calculations revealed that neglecting the heat going into the resulting chips in turning leads to a significant increase in cutting temperature up to the values physically unrealizable in cutting. Consequently, it is possible to calculate maximum cutting temperature close to the experimental values only taking into account the heat balance going into the chips and the surface layer of the workpiece.

50|$|The use of straight-five petrol {{engines in}} mass {{production}} cars only became truly viable {{with the advent}} of reliable fuel injection. A five-cylinder engine using a carburetor fuel system has an unavoidable problem in that the length of the inlet manifold between the carburetor varies too greatly between cylinders at the ends of the engine and those nearer the carburetor for reliable and consistent fuel delivery. Using multiple carburetors (two or three) always results in one carburetor <b>feeding</b> more <b>cylinders</b> than the other, which also produces running and tuning problems. In theory individual carburetors could be used for each cylinder, but this approach is expensive and still brings with it the attendant difficulties in balancing the multiple carbs.

Specifically, we considered (i) energetic costs as a function of body size, water currents, swimming speed, and distance, (ii) time costs as a function of speed and distance, and (iii) energetic gain in terms of differences in food intake between areas. The model demonstrates how body size restricts large-scale horizontal migration patterns. Model and field results suggest that the extent of migration will increase with increasing body length. The model predicts that long-distance migration costs may exceed energy intake for fish < 20 cm, due to increased hydrodynamical drag with decreasing fish size. Field results suggest that migration distance is a function of length, weight, and age. Food abundance and distribution, current speed and direction, and differences in day length at boreal latitudes are believed to be the major driving forces influencing large-scale migration distance, direction, and timing in pelagic planktivores.

Furthermore, to examine the longitudinal breastfeeding duration patterns for women with more than one child. Methods: Breastfeeding duration data for 9773 children have been self-reported by a national sample of 5091 mothers aged 30 – 36 years in 2009, participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health. Results: Only 60 % of infants received the minimum recommended 6 months of breast milk, irrespective of breastfeeding exclusivity. Less than 30 % of infants received any breast milk at 12 months, and less than 3 % were breastfed to the international target of 24 months. Young, less educated, unmarried or low-income women were at an increased risk of premature breastfeeding cessation. For women with three or more children, nearly 75 % of women who breastfed their first child for at least six months reached this breastfeeding duration target for their next two children. Conclusion: While national breastfeeding rates are typically evaluated in relation to the infant, a novel component of our study is that we have assessed maternal adherence to breastfeeding duration targets and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feeding</b> practices of women with more than one child.
