50|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that the <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzard</b> is not closely related to Buteo buzzards but rather to Accipiter hawks. This extends to morphological associations, e.g. the <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzard</b> has pointed and fairly short wings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Kaupifalco monogrammicus) or lizard hawk is a {{bird of prey}} in {{the family}} Accipitridae. It is native to Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite its name, {{it may be more}} closely related to the Accipiter hawks than the Buteo buzzards.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzard</b> is a smallish stocky raptor with a {{total body}} length of 35-37 cm and a {{wingspan}} of about 79 cm. Males weigh 246 g, females 304 g on average. The upperparts, head and breast are grey. There is a vertical black line on the white throat, which distinguishes this species from all other raptors. The belly is white with fine dark barring. The underwings are white with dark tips. The tail is black with a white tip and a single white band.The eyes are dark reddish brown to black.The cere and legs are red to orange red. Sexes are similar. The flight pattern is undulating like a thrush. The juvenile <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzard</b> resembles the adult, the only variations are slight brown tinge to the wings with an orange yellow cere and legs.|$|E
50|$|Like other {{some other}} raptors, <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzards</b> are {{alternative}} nest users. Although {{they prefer to}} build nests in the subcanopy, when they occupy an existing nest this can occur in the canopy above. <b>Lizard</b> <b>buzzards</b> will also compete with Shikras for available nests, since these have a similar size, habitat preference and distribution.|$|R
50|$|The {{recorded}} predators {{of adult}} little sparrowhawks include the gabar goshawk (Micronisus gabar), while chicks have sometimes been predated by <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzards</b> (Kaupifalco monogrammicus).|$|R
50|$|<b>Lizard</b> <b>buzzards</b> are solitary {{and silent}} raptors, except for early in {{breeding}} season (September and October) when they produce a clear, distinct and melodious whistle klu-klu-klu. They remain locally resident and are dominant over intruders. There {{is very limited}} soaring flight, which only occurs during courtship displays or on rare non-breeding occasions in the late morning.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzard</b> {{occurs in}} Sub-Saharan Africa from Eritrea to north eastern South Africa. It remains common in West Africa,Zimbabwe,Mozambique and north eastern areas of Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. Its {{preferred}} habitat is moist dense savannah woodland especially miombo woodland, forest edges and wooded margins of rivers. It is also found, especially in winter, in arid thornbush in savannah areas of East and Central Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Feral {{populations in}} Australia are {{sometimes}} infected by {{a virus that}} causes symptoms similar to that produced in parrots by psittacine beak and feather disease. Several ectoparasitic bird lice have been found on the species and include those in the genera Coloceras, Columbicola, Bonomiella and Hohorstiella. A blood parasite Trypanosoma hannae has been recorded in the species. Southern grey shrike have been observed preying on an adult laughing dove in northwestern India while the <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzard</b> is a predator of the species in Africa. There is also a reported case of an Eurasian sparrowhawk killing and eating a Laughing dove while wintering in northern Jordan. [...] South African birds sometimes show a beak deformity in which the upper mandible overgrowth occurs.|$|E
50|$|The long-crested eagle is {{territorial}} and {{the male}} displays during courtship in which he performs steep dives and also uses a rocking, level display flight, they call frequently during these displays. Both sexes build the nest, constructing a stick platform with a bowl shaped depression in the centre which is lined with green leaves. The nest is normally situated in the mid canopy and {{very close to the}} trunk of a tree near the forest edge. If available, the long-crested eagle will often reuse the nest of another bird, for example the black sparrowhawk or <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzard.</b> It breeds all year but most eggs are laid in July-November. The female lays 1-2 eggs, and she take most of the burden of incubating them, incubation lasting 42 days, as she incubates the male provides her with food. As is normal in birds of prey the eggs are laid asynchronously, as much as two weeks apart,and the female begins incubation as soon as the first egg is laid which mans that hatching is also asynchronous. When the young hatch they are initially mainly fed by the male. The period from hatching to fledging is about 53 days, and the juveniles remain dependent on the adults for about a further 2-3 months. The nests have been recorded as being preyed upon by monkeys Cercopithecus spp and genets.|$|E
50|$|Breeding {{occurs during}} the months of September to November. <b>Lizard</b> <b>buzzards</b> are monogamous and form pair bonds that are {{protected}} or permanent. Both sexes are involved in nest building which is small and compact, composed of sticks and found in the sub canopy of trees both indigenous and alien, often near the main trunk of the tree. The stick nest is lined with dry grass,green leaves or lichen.|$|R

50|$|The {{range of}} lizard buzzards is {{extremely}} large {{and does not}} approach the threshold for vulnerable under range distribution.The population trend appears to be stable and does not approach thresholds for vulnerable.The population size is extremely large and for these reasons is evaluated as least concern.However, in Africa particularly West and Southern Africa there have been recorded dramatic declines in some raptors. The reasons for raptor decline in Africa are rapid human population growth driving overexploitation of the land causing biodiveristy loss and a decreased species richness. The raptor population declines in West Africa {{have been linked to}} loss of woodland and nest sites,increased pesticide use,intensive cultivation especially cotton and disturbance of nests. In Southern Africa raptor decline has been linked to use of poisons,powerline electrocutions, habitat destruction and raptor drowning in farm reservoirs. Despite high human population and activity in Africa, not all raptor species have declined sharply.Some raptors, especially opportunistic generalists and migrants have increased. In West Africa the grasshopper buzzard, black kite and hooded vulture have increased in number and range. Similarly in the Western Cape of South Africa, the steppe buzzard, lesser kestrel and yellow-billed kite have increased range and number. Currently there is insufficient data on the <b>Lizard</b> <b>Buzzard</b> to determine its adaptation to human land usage.It is unclear how it has adapted to loss of Woodland its preferred habitat and nesting site.Its preferred prey insects, lizards and rodents remain common in most human altered landscapes which could account for its current survival.|$|E
50|$|Few other accipitrids are as {{singularly}} specialized to hunt {{a single}} prey family as Verreaux's eagles, perhaps excluding the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) and the slender-billed kite (Helicolestes hamatus) with their specialization to hunt Pomacea snails. Not even accipitrids named after their staple food {{are known to}} be as specialized, i.e. the bat hawk (Macheiramphus alcinus), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), the <b>lizard</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Kaupifalco monogrammicus) and perhaps the rufous crab hawk (Buteogallus aequinoctialis). Certainly, the Verreaux's eagle has the most conservative diet of Aquila species, though the diet is more diverse in South Africa than in Zimbabwe. Two species comprise considerably more than half (often more than 90% of) the Verreaux's eagleâ€™s diet: the Cape hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the yellow-spotted rock hyrax (Heterohyrax brucei). In the Matobo Hills of Zimbabwe, these two hyraxes comprised 1,448 out of 1,550 eagle prey items recorded at eyries just after the breeding season from 1995 to 2003. In the same area, from 1957 to 1990, 98.1% of the diet was made up of rock hyrax. In a sample size of 224 from 102 nests in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, 99.1% of the remains were of hyrax. Elsewhere in Tanzania, the diet is more mixed, with 53.7% of the remains from 24 nests made up of hyrax. In a nest in South Africa, 89.1% of the remains from a sampling of 55 were of hyrax. No detailed statistics are known but the hyrax are likely to the main prey in every population and have been mentioned to dominate the diet in Mozambique, Malawi and Botswana Around 400 hyrax may be taken through the year by a pair with young. The entire distribution of the species neatly corresponds with that of the two species of rock hyrax. To date, there are no known instances of Verreaux's eagle hunting the two species of tree hyraxes.|$|E
