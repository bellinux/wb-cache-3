5000|$|Before {{performing}} any fret work, the fingerboard {{and body}} of the instrument are covered with low tack tape to prevent any damage from files and other tools. Leveling is achieved by running a leveling [...] file or <b>leveling</b> <b>bar</b> lengthwise {{up and down the}} neck. This process takes [...]002 to [...]005 inches of material off the frets, bringing them to a uniform height while creating flat tops on the frets.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{leveling}} systems: base leveling and TM leveling. Base leveling {{percentage is}} {{shown at the}} very top of the screen as a long yellow bar. When one levels up, they attain four points that they can allocate into 12 different stats (see below) in the [...] "MyView" [...] window. Base level is not only important for becoming more skilled in the 12 different stats but also in acquiring more powerful items. TM level percentage is displayed near the top of the [...] "Skills" [...] window and under the base <b>leveling</b> <b>bar</b> (as the green bar). When one levels up in this system, they get one point that they can allocate into a skill, learn a skill with, master a skill, or simply save for later.|$|E
30|$|The {{full-scale}} ICC test slabs {{were constructed}} over an existing two-inch thick asphalt surface of an accelerated pavement testing (APT) facility housed at the FDOT State Materials Research Park. The asphalt layer was placed over a 26.67  cm (10.5 in.) limerock base which {{acted as a}} leveling course and provided firm and consistent foundation for the concrete slabs. This test track consisted of three 3.7  m by 4.9  m (12 ft by 16 ft) and 23  cm (9 in.) in thickness test slabs with no dowel bar application. A vibrating <b>leveling</b> <b>bar</b> was used to level off the concrete surface of the test slab. A broom was passed over the concrete surface to produce a rough surface texture before it hardened and then a curing compound was applied {{over the top and}} sides of the slabs with manufacturer’s recommended application rate. The ICC- 1 slab was constructed on December 9, 2014 and tested after 87  days. The standard and the ICC- 2 slabs were both constructed on December 17, 2014 and HVS loading was applied after 86 and 82  days, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{commissioner}} of immigration at Ellis Island was William Williams, a former Wall Street lawyer. He was aggressively <b>leveling</b> the statutory <b>bar</b> on those aliens [...] "likely {{to become a}} public charge," [...] and he was strictly enforcing immigration laws. Williams directed inspectors to treat aliens as suspect if traveling with less than ten dollars. He also instructed his inspectors to attach the label of [...] "public charge" [...] to unmarried mothers and their children, {{even though most of}} them had jobs waiting for them. Ellis Island policy dictated that [...] "unmarried pregnant women were always detained for further investigation" [...] and that single women were released only if family members came to claim them.|$|R
