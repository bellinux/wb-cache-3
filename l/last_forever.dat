5|$|The {{domestic}} dwellings {{of elite}} and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable {{materials such as}} mud bricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, {{such as those in}} Malkata and Amarna, show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs. Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to <b>last</b> <b>forever</b> were constructed of stone instead of mud bricks. The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building, Djoser's mortuary complex, include post and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.|$|E

While the others are excited about going, Woody intends to return home to Andy. Jessie {{explains}} that the museum is only interested in the collection if it is complete, and without Woody, they will be returned to storage. When Woody's arm is torn off completely, Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape, but is foiled when Al's television set turns on, and blames Jessie when he finds the TV remote in front of her. The next morning, Woody's arm is fixed by a toy repair specialist, and Woody learns that Jessie once belonged to a child named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will <b>last</b> <b>forever</b> in the museum. Woody decides to stay, now believing that all toys will eventually get discarded by their owners.|$|E

5|$|Eorzea's history {{revolves}} around {{a series of}} Umbral and Astral Eras. Umbral Eras are periods of great calamity—the First Umbral Era {{marked the end of}} the age of gods. The guardian deities of Eorzea, known as the Twelve, retreated from direct involvement with mortals during this time. Umbral Eras are followed by periods of enlightenment and cultural growth called Astral Eras. The Third Astral Era was particularly noted for presiding over the Allagan Empire, an ancient civilization whose technology far exceeds the level of the modern age. Each Umbral and Astral Era pair corresponds to one of the six basic elements—wind, lightning, fire, earth, ice, and water. The Sixth Umbral Era was believed to be the last and the civilized races hoped the Sixth Astral Era would <b>last</b> <b>forever.</b> However, five years {{prior to the start of}} the game, the Garlean Empire catalyzed a series of events that would lead to the Seventh Umbral Era.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not <b>last</b> <b>forever,</b> and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E
5|$|The Pranotasani Tantra narrates {{that once}} Parvati longed {{to go back}} to her {{maternal}} house for some days and asked Shiva's permission to do so. The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days, he would come to fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya's place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller, when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and took her hand and kissed her. Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her) might <b>last</b> <b>forever</b> as Ucchishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.|$|E

25|$|As the {{national}} economy grew, more and more coal mines were developed along the BR routes. In fact, the new Indiana Branch soon yielded the greatest traffic volume as mines opened in the area south of Punxsutawney. By the 1920s, coal trains averaged 3,750 tons, requiring considerably better motive power than the archaic Consolidations of the earlier era. However, long coal drags {{with one or two}} Mallets at the head did not <b>last</b> <b>forever.</b> In {{the first quarter of the}} new century, the market share held by the comparatively costly union-made coal of Pennsylvania was driven down by the cheaper coal from the non-union mines of Kentucky and West Virginia. The companies of the Pittsburgh Coal District sought federal regulation of coal industry wages but lost. In a series of moves to protect themselves, the coal companies transferred to the BR not only the short-line railroads they'd built themselves but also the Genesee Coal Dock facility. This had the effect of improving the coal companies' fiscal performance, but it effectively hung an anchor on the railroad's neck as it swam in deeper and deeper waters.|$|E
25|$|Bendigo State Park {{is named}} for an Irish tavern keeper, who lived in England, named William Thompson. Thompson was also a prizefighter of some renown. Boxing for money was illegal {{at the time in}} England and Thompson was arrested 28 times for {{breaking}} the law. Legend holds that Thompson fled to America, to avoid prosecution, when an opponent died in the ring due to injuries sustained in the fight. He adopted the name Bendigo, a corruption of the Old Testament name Abed-nego and moved to the frontier of northwestern Pennsylvania. The newly named, Bendigo, began serving as a Methodist evangelist while also working on the railroads. He was a very tall and strong man and soon became a favorite of his Italian co-workers. No records exist to support the claim that Thompson ever left the British Isles let alone lived in the area. The lumber industry was beginning to boom in northwestern Pennsylvania as Bendigo was making his rounds as an evangelist and a mill town in Elk County was named Bendigo in his honor. The lumber era was not to <b>last</b> <b>forever.</b> The forests were largely chopped down by the early 20th century and many of the mill towns, like Bendigo, were abandoned.|$|E
