50|$|This {{practice}} {{enables the}} market center {{to try to}} keep the trade since the firm that is seeking to buy or sell shares or stock posts the information only on a specific stock exchange before sending the trade information out on the broader public markets, and making it available to all potential investors. If a deal can be struck between recipients of the flash trade, the result is a <b>locked</b> <b>market</b> with guaranteed pricing on the order. On some trades, it also results in better profits for the firms making the trades, as the firms often get rebates or lower fees for flash trades when the deal completes on the home exchange and doesn't get posted on rival stock exchanges. In 2009 in the United States under an exception to Rule 602 of Regulation NMS flash orders were allowed.|$|E
40|$|Chaque matin avant l'ouverture du Nasdaq il y a une session durant laquelle les faiseurs de marché font des cotations sans exécutions d'ordres. Malgré le fait qu'il n'y a pas de {{transactions}} pendant cette période, il s'y produit une activité importante de soumission et de révision des cotations. Nous étudions l'information révélée par les cotations de prix d'achat et de vente. Notre banque de données contient l'identification des participants, ce qui nous {{permet de}} tester plusieurs hypothèses sur la dynamique de la formation du prix d'ouverture. Nous trouvons notamment que certains faiseurs de marché prennent un role de leaders. One fundamental {{issue in the}} study of market microstructures is that of price discovery. While most existing studies focus on the trading period, little is known whether and how much the non-trading period contributes to the price discovery. This paper offers a new perspective on the price discovery process by studying market makers' posting and revising of non-binding prices on Nasdaq during the one-and-half hours pre-opening period. We examine a unique data set containing all the market maker quotes and identifications collected for 50 of the most active Nasdaq stocks. Our empirical investigation shows there is strong evidence that non-binding prices contain information, and there is significant price discovery during the pre-opening period. In the absence of trades, Nasdaq dealers use <b>locked</b> <b>market</b> notes (e. g., the situation where the best bid price among all market makers is greater than the best ask) as an important device to indicate to other market makers which direction the price should move and what the opening price should be. Furthermore, we find evidence that there exists a leadership pattern among market makers, particularly for the most active stocks...|$|E

By the early 1970s the canal trade had ceased and a northern urban motorway was planned that would cut through the site, making any major permanent redevelopment impossible, and in 1974 a temporary market was established. By 1976, when plans for the motorway were abandoned, the market had become a well known feature of Camden Town. Originally, the <b>Lock</b> was a <b>market</b> for crafts, occupying some outdoor areas by the canal and various existing buildings.|$|R

The redevelopment included a new pedestrian route through the rear of the Stables Market exposing 25 of the existing railway arches. Pedestrian walkways—in the style of the existing historic ramp and bridge system—has opened up the site and increased access for visitors.

Camden <b>Lock</b> <b>market</b> proper started in a former timber-yard in 1973, and is now surrounded by five more markets: Buck Street market, Stables <b>market,</b> Camden <b>Lock</b> village, and an indoor market in the Electric Ballroom.

5000|$|When Cramer-Krasselt {{took over}} as Master Lock's agency later in the year, the company {{decided to make the}} gun ads a tradition, and began to produce new ads themed around the concept (including one {{featuring}} skeptics of previous editions of the ad, and one showcasing the company's major corporate clients) for future Super Bowls during the subsequent decades (aside from a brief hiatus in 1986 and 1987), and the early 1990s. Allen went as far as describing the ads as an [...] "event" [...] that continued to attract media attention after the game. The Super Bowl ads helped improve Master <b>Lock's</b> <b>market</b> share; from 1973 through 1994, sales had increased from $35 million per year to $200 million per year. Master Lock's yearly Super Bowl commercials accounted for nearly all of the company's annual advertising budget.|$|R

50|$|Hewitt {{began his}} career in the {{northwest}} of England, playing with his brother Nick in Misadventure, before leaving in 1988 to join The Mystic Deckchairs. Hewitt joined fellow local musician Tim Burgess in Electric Crayons, prior to Burgess joining The Charlatans in 1989. Hewitt joined Breed at the age of 17, linking up with the band for a German tour after spying an advert placed by the band in Affleck's Palace. Following the completion of the tour, Hewitt joined The Boo Radleys on a temporary basis and played on the band's 1990 debut album, Ichabod and I. Hewitt rejoined Breed in 1991, releasing the albums Grin in 1991 and Violet Sentimental in 1993. Breed found commercial success elusive (despite a support slot on Nick Cave's Let Love In tour) and following a disastrous gig at the Bull & Gate in London in 1996, the band split. While in Breed, Hewitt also played for house act K-Klass. The need for money during these years saw Hewitt take on session work in London, recording jingles and appearing on releases by Baby June and Sharkboy. Breed reformed for a one-off gig at Lock 17 in Camden <b>Lock</b> <b>Market,</b> London on 6 December 2004.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explain the changes in the real estate prices as well as in the real estate stock market prices, using some {{macro-economic}} explanatory variables, such as the gross domestic product (GDP), the real interest rate and the unemployment rate. Several regressions have been carried out in order to express some types of incremental and absolute deflated real estate <b>lock</b> <b>market</b> indexes in terms of the macro-economic variables. The analyses are applied to the Swedish economy. The period under study is 1984 - 1994. Time series on monthly data are used. i. e. the number of data-points is 132. If time leads/lags are introduced in the e regressions, significant improvements in the already high correlations are achieved. The signs of the coefficients for IR, UE and GDP are all what one would expect to see from an economic point of view: those for GDP are all positive, those for both IR and UE are negative. All the regressions have high R 2 values. Both markets anticipate change in the unemployment rate by 6 to 9 months, which seems reasonable because such change can be forecast quite reliably. But, on the contrary, there is no reason why they should anticipate by 3 - 6 months changes in the interest rate that can hardly be reliably forecast so far in advance...|$|R
