5|$|The {{antelope}} is shy and elusive. When alarmed, {{it stands}} motionless and may nervously leap {{away from the}} danger or even sprint. It often conceals itself in tall grasses to escape predators. The use of alarm calls to alert others is not common because the antelope tries to avoid the attention of predators. However, in extreme cases, these calls {{may be used to}} warn predators that they have been identified. Adults mark vegetation in their territories with a colourless secretion of preorbital glands, that soon condenses to form a white film. They maintain multiple <b>latrine</b> sites where piles of their pellet droppings are formed by regular use. <b>Latrine</b> sites can be confused with those of the barking deer but the pellets are longer and larger in four-horned antelopes. Submissive display consists of shrinking the body, lowering the head and pulling the ears back. Predators of four-horned antelopes include tigers, leopards, and dholes.|$|E

40|$|Background] Studies {{have shown}} that {{households}} using sludge from human excreta for agriculture are at {{an increased risk of}} soil transmitted helminths. However, while use of ecological sanitation (EcoSan) <b>latrines</b> is increasing in most African countries including Malawi, few studies have been done to check whether use of such sludge could potentially increase the prevalence of helminthic infections among household members as a results of exposure to faecal sludge/compared to use of traditional <b>latrines.</b>  [Methods] A cross sectional study was done targeting households using EcoSan and traditional pit <b>latrines.</b> Samples were collected from both types of <b>latrines</b> in Chikwawa (rural) and Blantyre (urban) districts. These two districts have a high number of EcoSan <b>latrines</b> in southern region of Malawi. 156 <b>latrines</b> were sampled (n= 95 traditional; n= 61 EcoSan), and processed following standard guidelines using modified triple floatation method. Identification of helminth ova (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworms, Trichuris trichiura, Taenia spp and Diphyllobothrium latum) was done using standard microscopy methods. The difference between the prevalence and mean concentration of helminths between the two types of <b>latrines</b> was tested using Chi-Square and t-test respectively. [Results] Of the total <b>latrines</b> tested, 85. 9 % (n= 134) had at least one species of helminth while 84. 6 % (n= 132) had at least a STH, with 82. 0 % (n= 50) in EcoSan and 86. 3 % (n= 82) in traditional pit <b>latrines.</b> There {{was no significant difference between}} the prevalence of helminths in EcoSan and traditional pit <b>latrines</b> [χ 2 = 0. 43 (1), P= 0. 5]. The prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides was significantly higher in EcoSan than in traditional pit <b>latrines</b> [χ 2 = 5. 44 (1) p= 0. 02] while prevalence of hookworms was significantly higher in traditional pit <b>latrines</b> than in EcoSan <b>latrines</b> [χ 2 = 13. 98 (1) p< 0. 001]. The highest concentration of helminths per gram of faecal sludge was in traditional pit <b>latrines</b> [31. 2 (95 %CI: 19. 1 to 43. 2) ] than in EcoSan <b>latrines</b> [26. 4 (95 %CI: 16. 5 to 36. 3) ]. [Conclusion] There was no significant difference between overall prevalence of helminths between households using EcoSan and those using traditional pit <b>latrines.</b> However, Ascaris lumbricoides was significantly higher in households using EcoSan <b>latrines.</b> EcoSan users need awareness on safe ways of handling faecal sludge in order to reduce chances of reinfection from Ascaris lumbricoides. Further research should be undertaken on household members to identify those infected and potential routes of infection to enable preventive targeting...|$|R

5|$|Dietary {{regimes of}} lemurs include folivory, frugivory, and omnivory, with some being highly {{adaptable}} while others specialize on {{foods such as}} plant exudates (tree gum) and bamboo. In some cases, lemur feeding patterns directly benefit the native plant life. When lemurs exploit nectar, they may act as pollinators {{as long as the}} functional parts of the flower are not damaged. In fact, several unrelated Malagasy flowering plants demonstrate lemur-specific pollination traits, and studies indicate that some diurnal species, such as the red-bellied lemur and the ruffed lemurs, act as major pollinators. Two examples of plant species that rely on lemurs for pollination include traveller's palm (Ravenala madagascariensis) and a species of legume-like liana, Strongylodon cravieniae. Seed dispersal is another service lemurs provide. After passing through the lemur gut, tree and vine seeds exhibit lower mortality and germinate faster. <b>Latrine</b> behavior exhibited by some lemurs may help improve soil quality and facilitate seed dispersal. Because of their importance in maintaining a healthy forest, frugivorous lemurs may qualify as keystone mutualists.|$|E

He converted the nave of the church into his great hall, kitchens and service buildings, the transepts and crossing became a series of luxurious apartments for his personal use, the presbytery was retained as the chapel of the mansion. The monks' dormitory became the long gallery of the mansion and the <b>latrine</b> block became several grand chambers. He demolished the south range and refectory and built a new one with a central turreted gatehouse to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. He likewise demolished the cloister walks to make a central courtyard for his house and placed a large fountain in the centre.

5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for <b>latrine</b> sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|E

5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail clippings, women's pubic hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal and throw the contents down a <b>latrine.</b>|$|E

A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission.

He was chained to a <b>latrine,</b> and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be deBeauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the noose placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had {{the presence of mind to}} recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.)

5|$|The French gained {{access to}} the {{outermost}} ward by undermining its advanced main tower. Following this, Philip ordered a group of his men {{to look for a}} weak point in the castle. They {{gained access to}} the next ward when a soldier named Ralph found a <b>latrine</b> chute in use through which the French could clamber into the chapel. After ambushing several unsuspecting guards, and setting fire to the buildings, Philip's men then lowered the movable bridge and allowed the rest of their army into the castle. The Anglo-Norman troops retreated to the inner ward. After a short time the French successfully breached the gate of the inner ward, and the garrison retreated finally to the keep. With supplies running low Roger de Lacy and his garrison of 20knights and 120other soldiers surrendered to the French army, bringing the siege to an end on 6March 1204. In drawn-out medieval sieges, contemporary writers often emphasised the importance of dwindling supplies in the capitulation of the garrison, {{as was the case with}} the Siege of Château Gaillard. With the castle under French control, the main obstacle to the French entering the Seine valley was removed; they were able to enter the valley unmolested and take Normandy. Thus, for the first time since it had been given as a duchy to Rollo in 911, Normandy was directly ruled by the French king. The city of Rouen surrendered to Philip II on 23June 1204. After that, the rest of Normandy was easily conquered by the French.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Janzen-Connell escape {{hypothesis}} pre-dicts {{that the}} success of tree propagules increases with distance from the parent tree. Fleshy fruits that are trans-ported in the guts of frugivores are believed to have evolved to facilitate the wide dispersal of seeds. Howev-er, some frugivores deposit seeds in <b>latrines,</b> thus creat-ing aggregations of seeds that are large enough to attract seed predators and negate the advantages of dispersal. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) often produce large seed de-posits since they habitually defecate in <b>latrines.</b> The sur-vival of wild black cherry (Prunus serotina) seeds in simulated raccoon <b>latrines</b> was monitored in areas with natural levels of food availability and in areas to which supplemental food had been supplied to the primary seed predators. Dispersal of seeds by raccoons did not neces-sarily provide effective protection from post-dispersal seed predation at natural food levels. Once the resident seed predators had located the <b>latrines,</b> the majority of the seeds were quickly removed. However, seed removal from raccoon <b>latrines</b> was reduced significantly and dra-matically by the addition of alternative food. This im-plies that raccoon <b>latrines</b> may represent safe sites for tree recruitment during periods of high food availability such as during masting events, thus providing condition-al support for the escape hypothesis...|$|R
