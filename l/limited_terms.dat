5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Australian {{government}} {{announced that the}} national service scheme would be implemented once again, however, instead of focusing upon expanding the CMF, the scheme was set up so that national servicemen would serve <b>limited</b> <b>terms</b> of service in Australian Regular Army (ARA) units {{with a view to}} service overseas in Vietnam and Malaysia. This highlighted the changing focus of Australia's military planning towards Regular forces, however, it had a negative impact upon the division as essentially it was forced to compete with the ARA for manpower and although some gains were made from men that chose to serve longer national service terms in the CMF in order to defer their service in ARA units, these were negligible and arguably of limited quality. The government's decision not to deploy CMF units to these conflicts meant that many of the division's experienced personnel chose to transfer to ARA units in order to gain operational experience, although some attempts were made to rectify this situation by offering CMF officers the opportunity to undertake a short attachment to an ARA unit serving in Vietnam and a number of 3rd Division officers took up this opportunity, a few even saw combat.|$|E
25|$|The Reformed Churches (Liberated) have a {{structure}} which combines congregational and presbyterian polity, with {{strong emphasis on}} the authority vested in each congregation. Local congregations are ruled by a church council or consistory, {{made up of the}} pastor(s) and the elders. The church council rules and organises the congregation. Most meetings of the church council are open to the members, except when matters of church discipline are discussed. All congregations also have a number of deacons who assist the church council with more practical matters. Elders and deacons are elected for <b>limited</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E

Due to this and also as a result of this, the Planners live as modestly as {{the other members of the}} community; ostentatious displays of wealth and status simply have no opportunity to arise from Walden Two's egalitarian cultural structure.|$|E

25|$|The Nyasaland {{government}} had imprisoned Banda, not realising {{that he was}} the only African politician they could negotiate with on a credible constitution for the protectorate. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda, unlike other Congress leaders, was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government to deal with him. Had Devlin found there was a murder plot and that Banda had encouraged violence, this would have been very difficult. Despite Lennox-Boyd's rejection of the Devlin Report, once Iain Macleod replaced him at the Colonial Office late in 1959, Devlin was approached by Macleod for advice. The Royal Commission {{on the future of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (the Monckton Commission) toured the Federation in February 1960. It had been given <b>limited</b> <b>terms</b> of reference and was boycotted by the opposition Labour Party and the African nationalists in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. As the Commission's composition seemed weighted towards a continuation of the Federation, its report disappointed the British government. The Monckton Commission reported widespread and sincere opposition to the Federation in the two northern territories. It considered Federation could not survive without at least a major devolution of powers to Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, giving more voting rights to Africans and lessening racial discrimination. Most importantly, it also recommended that Britain should retain the right to allow the secession of either northern territory, recognising that African nationalists would not accept even a modified Federation.|$|E

However, in March 1931, Ramsay MacDonald asked Trenchard to take the post of Metropolitan Police Commissioner, which after initially declining, Trenchard eventually accepted in October 1931. [...] Trenchard served as head of the Metropolitan Police until 1935 and during his tenure he instigated several changes.

[...] Perhaps Trenchard's most well known achievement during his time as Commissioner was the establishment of the Hendon Police College which originally was the institution from which Trenchard's junior inspectors graduated before following a career in the higher ranks. Trenchard retired in November 1935 and in his final few months as Police Commissioner, he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E

According to Entertainment Weekly Karen Valby, the show's fundamental problem is that [...] "The Underwoods have no worthy opponents." [...] According to Variety Brian Lowry, as conniving as Underwood is, it is unfathomable that [...] "nobody else in a town built on power seems particularly adept at recognizing this or combating him". Valby notes that neither Tusk nor Goodwin is an effective foe, leaving the audience longing for a comeuppance in the first four episodes that served as a preview for critics and his hopeful that Sharp provides a good foil as the season progresses. He also wrote that House of Cards overplays its depiction of the edginess of [...] "Washington being venal and corrupt". He describes the show as a [...] "mixed bag".|$|E

2500|$|Francia's {{greatest}} accomplishment, {{the preservation}} of Paraguayan independence, resulted directly from a non-interventionist foreign policy. Regarding Argentina as a potential threat to Paraguay, he shifted his foreign policy toward Brazil by quickly recognizing Brazilian independence in 1822. This move, however, resulted in no special favors for the Brazilians from Francia, who was also on good, if <b>limited,</b> <b>terms</b> with Juan Manuel Rosas, the Argentine governor. Francia prevented civil war and secured his role as dictator when he cut off his internal enemies from their friends in Buenos Aires.

2500|$|In addition, {{it seems}} {{certain that the}} kings were overthrown in c. 500 BC, {{probably}} {{as a result of}} a much more complex and bloody revolution than the simple drama of the rape of Lucretia related by Livy, and that they were replaced by some form of collegiate rule. It is likely that the revolution that overthrew the Roman monarchy was engineered by the patrician caste and that its aim was not, as rationalised later by ancient authors, the establishment of a democracy, but of a patrician-dominated oligarchy. The proverbial [...] "arrogance" [...] and [...] "tyranny" [...] of the Tarquins, epitomised by the Lucretia incident, is probably a reflection of the patricians' fear of the Tarquins' growing power and their erosion of patrician privilege, most likely by drawing support from the plebeians (commoners). To ensure patrician supremacy, the autocratic power of the kings had to be fragmented and permanently curtailed. Thus, the replacement of a single ruler by a collegiate administration, which soon evolved into two Praetors, later called Consuls, with equal powers and <b>limited</b> <b>terms</b> of office (one year, instead of the life tenancy of the kings). In addition, power was further fragmented by the establishment of further collegiate offices, known to history as Roman magistrates: (three Aediles and four Quaestors). Patrician supremacy was assured by limiting eligibility to hold the republican offices to patricians only.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{association}} between self reported <b>limiting</b> long <b>term</b> illness and other dimensions of self reported health. DESIGN [...] Stratified random sample of general population. SETTING [...] Lothian region, Scotland, in 1993. SUBJECTS [...] 6212 men and women aged 16 and over. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] <b>Limiting</b> long <b>term</b> illness was assessed by the same question as used in the 1991 United Kingdom census. The short form 36 health survey {{was used to assess}} other dimensions of health. RESULTS [...] Rates of <b>limiting</b> long <b>term</b> illness were much higher than reported in the census. Scores on general and physical health scales had strong associations with <b>limiting</b> long <b>term</b> illness, but after adjustment for these associations psychosocial health measures had little influence on <b>limiting</b> long <b>term</b> illness. Being at the lower rather than the upper quartile on the physical functioning scale more than doubled the odds of having <b>limiting</b> long <b>term</b> illness. Reported prevalence of many common illnesses was between two and three times higher among those with <b>limiting</b> long <b>term</b> illness. CONCLUSIONS [...] A positive response to the question used by the census to define <b>limiting</b> long <b>term</b> illness was strongly associated with physical limitations on activity and less strongly influenced by scores on scales of mental and social wellbeing. Socioeconomic effects on <b>limiting</b> long <b>term</b> illness seem largely mediated through measures of general health and physical limitations on health...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the competitiveness of}} contests, {{and the quality of}} candidates, in local contests with <b>term</b> <b>limits.</b> Previous literature is divided on the subject of <b>term</b> <b>limits,</b> with research finding either negative effects of <b>term</b> <b>limits,</b> or limited positive effects. This paper hypothesizes that the quality of challengers will not increase in <b>term</b> <b>limited</b> contests, and that the competitiveness of contests will decrease for <b>term</b> <b>limited</b> offices. Using data from California, Colorado, Florida, Virginia, and Washington local contests, this paper examines approximately four hundred-fifty candidates through survey, and approximately one thousand contests. The quality of challengers does not appear to change in the presence of <b>term</b> <b>limits,</b> and incumbents do not seem more or less susceptible to defeat in <b>term</b> <b>limited</b> offices. However, this analysis finds that the vote margin of <b>term</b> <b>limited</b> contests increases in the context of incumbency and partisan contests. The implications of these findings suggest that <b>term</b> <b>limits</b> may not be worth the trouble of implementing, and may be having the opposite effect of what many <b>term</b> <b>limit</b> proponents claim. Constituent representation is possibly negatively affected by less competitive contests...|$|R
