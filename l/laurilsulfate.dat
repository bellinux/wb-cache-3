Metronidazole can be assigned to Biopharmaceutics Classifica-tion System Class I. Most BE studies that were identified reported the investigated formu-lations to be bioequivalent, indicating the risk of bioinequivalence to be low. Formulations showing differences in bioavailability showed dissimilarities in in vitro dissolution profiles. Furthermore, metronidazole has a wide therapeutic index. It is concluded that a biowaiver for solid IR formulations is justified, provided: (a) the test product and its comparator are both rapidly dissolving; (b) meet similarity of the dissolution profiles at pH 1. 2, 4. 5, and 6. 8; (c) the test product contains only excipients present in IR drug products approved in Interna-tional Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) or associated countries in the same dosage form; and (d) if the test product contains sorbitol, sodium <b>laurilsulfate,</b> or propylene glycol. The test product needs to be qualitatively and quantitatively identical to its comparator with re...|$|E
