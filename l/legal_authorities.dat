5|$|On 8 September 1994 the DoD {{announced}} the actions {{it would take}} {{in response to the}} investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military <b>legal</b> <b>authorities.</b> Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an Article 32 hearing in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that he was sure of his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he was not sure of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.|$|E
5|$|The term in Athens {{seems to}} have always been {{somewhat}} loosely used in legal proceedings. Apollodorus, an Athenian politician and litigant from the 4th century BCE, {{in one of his}} speeches attempted to use an Athenian law about betrothal to make his mother an epikleros. He claimed that the law defined an epikleros as a female without father, a brother who shared a father with her, or a paternal grandfather. His opponent, however, {{seems to have}} disputed this interpretation of the law. A speech by Isaeus, a 4th-century BCE speechwriter, rests on the claim that the speaker's mother only became an epikleros after her young brother died following their father's death. Whether the <b>legal</b> <b>authorities</b> recognized the speaker's claim as valid is unknown. It appears, at least according to some plays, that a woman with a brother who died after their father was considered the epikleros of her brother, not her father.|$|E
5|$|After {{shooting}} Magruder {{and killing}} Arnaud, Logan then fled {{the scene with}} Kromah in a silver-painted Dodge Charger with Maryland license plates, with Kromah driving the vehicle. After leaving the house, Kromah took the weapon from Logan and attempted to wipe off any residual evidence, such as fingerprints, from it. The two then disposed of the murder weapon by burying it at a nearby forested cemetery and abandoned the getaway vehicle. Kromah was captured and charged as an accomplice to the murder; he pleaded guilty on April 24, 2003 to being an accessory after the fact to a murder. In the meantime, Logan stayed briefly at the residence of Twyla James, a woman who lived in Largo, Maryland. James would later be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder as she transported Logan, whom she had known was a murder suspect and fugitive sought by <b>legal</b> <b>authorities,</b> to her residence and allowed him to stay there. Logan was apprehended {{two days after the}} murder, on August 31, 2002, at a shed near the Quebec Arms Apartments in Hyattsville, Maryland, on the 8200 block of 14th Avenue. He was spotted there by undercover policemen, who had received information that it had been an area that Logan was known to frequent in the past. Logan was found hiding in the shed by policemen, who then used a police canine and a taser to subdue and apprehend him.|$|E

50|$|The {{second issue}} {{presented}} with a mixed initiative {{is the need for}} <b>legal</b> <b>authority</b> independent of Proposition 218 to pursue a local initiative containing one or more provisions that are outside the scope of the Proposition 218 local initiative power. If such independent <b>legal</b> <b>authority</b> does not exist, the entire initiative measure can be invalidated. As a result, if a local initiative measure contains one or more provisions outside the scope of the local initiative power under Proposition 218, there must exist independent <b>legal</b> <b>authority</b> for those outside provisions.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Kansas Anderson {{continued}} horse trafficking, but ranchers in the area soon became aware of his operations. In May 1862 Baker issued an arrest warrant for Griffith, whom Anderson helped hide. Some local citizens suspected that the Anderson family was assisting Griffith and traveled to their house to confront William C. Anderson. After hearing their accusations against his sons, he was incensed—he found Baker's involvement particularly infuriating. The next day he traveled to the Council Grove courthouse with a gun, intending to force Baker to withdraw the warrant. As he entered the building he was restrained by a constable and fatally shot by Baker. William Anderson buried his father, and was subsequently arrested for assisting Griffith. However, he was quickly released owing to {{a problem with the}} warrant, and fled to Agnes City, fearing that he would be lynched. There he met Baker, who temporarily placated him by providing a lawyer. Anderson remained in Agnes City until he learned that Baker would not be charged, as the judge's claim of self-defense had been accepted by <b>legal</b> <b>authorities.</b> Anderson was outraged and went to Missouri with his siblings. William and Jim Anderson then traveled southwest of Kansas City, robbing travelers to support themselves.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>legal</b> <b>authority</b> of non-state rules in international commercial contracts and their application in state courts. Non-state rules {{can be divided}} in uncodified rules and codified rules. Uncodified non-state rules are general principles of law, practices, trade usages, and custom. They have a customary origin. Codified non-state rules are model laws, restatements of law, standard terms and conditions, and guidelines. They are created by international organisations and trade associations. Non-state rules have <b>legal</b> <b>authority</b> in the national and the international sphere. Their <b>legal</b> <b>authority</b> can be established by looking at different factors: promulgator, substance, support, and application. It is especially the last factor which plays a deciding role in measuring their <b>legal</b> <b>authority.</b> This thesis uses three main case studies: France, England, and the US to understand the <b>legal</b> <b>authority</b> of non-state rules. After having established what non-state rules are and how their <b>legal</b> <b>authority</b> can be measured this thesis concentrates on their application in courts. It asks three important questions: when can non-state rules be applied? When are they applied? And how are they applied? There are four scenarios in which non-state rules are applied in descending degrees of legal authority: first of all, they are applied as the applicable law to the contract, secondly they are applied as sources of domestic law, thirdly {{they are used to}} interpret the applicable law, and fourthly they are applied as contractual rules. Legislations have a preference for uncodified non-state rules such as trade usages and general principles. These are often sources of domestic law. To apply these uncodified non-state rules judiciary resorts to codified non-state rules to go from the general principle to the practical application. After studying the application of non-state rules in depth, this thesis concludes with a framework and classification that leads to understanding the <b>legal</b> <b>authority</b> of non-state rules...|$|R

He observed that although the <b>legal</b> <b>authorities</b> claimed that sovereignty over Australia was acquired by occupation, the country was not vacant, but already occupied; nor had it been conquered or ceded under a treaty. Rather, Judge Willis said, sovereignty was actually acquired under the principle expounded by Vattel in his The Law of Nations, referred to by both the prosecution and the defence, that a 'civilised' people may take possession of territory occupied by 'uncivilised' people, provided they leave for them sufficient land for their sustenance.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fostering conversation, KMG Ethiopia {{has taken an}} active role in pressing police to prosecute crimes such as bridal abduction. The practice has been illegal in Ethiopia since 2005, but in 2010 The Independent wrote that <b>legal</b> <b>authorities</b> outside the capital were loose in their application of law, with the first person to challenge her bridal abduction—a 13-year-old who could not prove she had been a virgin {{at the time of her}} kidnapping—being accused by her own defense attorney of inciting the rape. KMG has fostered support among women and men for victims, including persuading some to proactively intervene to prevent the act. According to The Independent, as of 2010 the rate of bridal abductions in the region had diminished by 90%.|$|E

25|$|Among LGBT-identifying individuals, {{transgender}} individuals face especially significant {{barriers to}} treatment. Many countries {{still do not}} have legal recognition of transgender or non-binary gender individuals leading to placement in mis-gendered hospital wards and medical discrimination. Seventeen European states mandate sterilization of individuals who seek recognition of a gender identity that diverges from their birth gender. In addition {{to many of the}} same barriers {{as the rest of the}} LGBT community, a WHO bulletin points out that globally, transgender individuals often also face a higher disease burden. A 2010 survey of transgender and gender-variant people in the United States revealed that transgender individuals faced a significant level of discrimination. The survey indicated that 19% of individuals experienced a healthcare worker refusing care because of their gender, 28% faced harassment from a healthcare worker, 2% encountered violence, and 50% saw a doctor who was not able or qualified to provide transgender-sensitive care. In Kuwait, there have been reports of transgender individuals being reported to <b>legal</b> <b>authorities</b> by medical professionals, preventing safe access to care. An updated version of the U.S. survey from 2015 showed little change in terms of healthcare experiences for transgender and gender variant individuals. The updated survey revealed that 23% of individuals reported not seeking necessary medical care out of fear of discrimination, and 33% of individuals who had been to a doctor within a year of taking the survey reported negative encounters with medical professionals related to their transgender status.|$|E
