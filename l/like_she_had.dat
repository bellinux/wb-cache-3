5|$|Jaquio tells Ryu {{his master}} plan of using Ashtar as a pawn, used to awaken the true evil. He {{plans to use}} the Dark Sword of Chaos to use Irene's life force to open the Gate of Darkness and call up all the demons, while Ryu awakens them from their sleep. Jaquio then {{challenges}} Ryu to a showdown in which Ryu defeats him. Before Ryu and Irene can destroy the evil altar though, Jaquio's blood awakens the Dark Sword, which opens up the Gate of Darkness, shocks Irene and Ryu with its energy. The Demon Jashin arrives through the Gate of Darkness and reanimates the corpse of Jaquio. He then turns into a demonic wall, which Ryu, after borrowing strength from his Dragon Sword, defeats. Jashin is once again sealed away, the Dark Sword then breaks apart, the Gate of Darkness closes and disappears, and Ryu flees with Irene out of the temple just as it collapses. He then begins to mourn for Irene, who is presumed to be dead, when the power of the Dragon Sword revives her. Irene tells Ryu that she felt <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been dreaming for a long time. Ryu tells her that the incident is over, and the game ends as the two watch the sun set.|$|E

25|$|On 15 December 1918, {{only two}} days from New York, Yellowstone sighted a {{derelict}} three-masted schooner and altered course to close. She discovered the water-logged Joseph P. Cooper of Mobile, Alabama, abandoned with her decks and cabin awash and with her forerigging gone and her forecastle smashed in. Joseph P. Cooper looked <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been adrift from six to eight weeks. After leaving the derelict, Yellowstone continued her passage and arrived at Pier 5, Bush Terminal, in Brooklyn on 17 December 1918. Shifting to Pier 1 {{at the end of}} December, she spent a week at anchor off the Statue of Liberty before returning to Bush Terminal and, later, shifting to the U.S. Army docks at Brooklyn. There, from 17 to 25 January 1919, Yellowstone took on board 5,150 tons of supplies and, on 25 January 1919, got underway for France.|$|E
25|$|Yuma is {{the main}} protagonist of the story, and is in her second {{year of high school}} along with her best friend Hotaru. When she finds her first boyfriend (Takeda) she is not sure how to react so she asks Hotaru for advice. Yuma is {{surprised}} though when it appears as if her friend is flirting with her. She cannot explain the good feeling she gets when she French kisses Hotaru or when she gets fondled, and worries that Takeda will catch her in the act. In the second volume he decides that the two should take some space apart, and Yuma comes to terms that she is in fact cheating with Hotaru. Her feelings still remain conflicted though as she does not want to hurt him so she remains as a friend. Yuma finally confesses to Hotaru in the fifth manga volume that she has feelings towards her but is rejected. She then turns to Takeda after feeling <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been used the entire time by her.|$|E
25|$|Midna has {{received}} mostly positive reception {{from both the}} video game press and the public {{for her role in}} Twilight Princess. Game Informer editor Andrew Reiner stated that she, along with Link's wolf transformation, had incredible effects on Twilight Princess gameplay. Fellow Game Informer editor Billy Berghammer stated that he loved Midna, describing her as a cool character due to how she messed with Link throughout the game. 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that the supporting characters of Twilight Princess make up for Link's laconic nature, Midna more so than others. He described her as being acerbic and thoughtful, as well as an intricate character who moves the plot forward for her own means. While America's Intelligence Wire editor Dave Arey described her as intriguing, he felt that she could have been more so if Nintendo had developed her further. GamesRadar listed her as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that before Midna, the only characters they could relate to were Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon. RPGamer editor Matthew Rickert stated that he found nothing intriguing or likable about her, complaining about how much more plot time she receives in spite of this, arguing that she offers little help to Link and that it felt <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> replaced Zelda in Twilight Princess.|$|E

[...] She enjoyed portraying this dynamic, and assessed that Rae [...] "always felt <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> the upper hand" [...] as she knew the truth about Brendan's sexuality.|$|E
500|$|In My Life So Far, Fonda {{stated that}} she {{considers}} patriarchy to {{be harmful to}} men as well as women.

But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she [...] "still loves men", adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, she felt <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.|$|E

500|$|Aki Ross's voice actor, Ming-Na Wen, was {{selected}} for a perceived fit between her personality and Aki's. Ming-Na, who found the role via her publicist, said she felt <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> given birth with her voice to the character. She gradually accustomed herself {{to the difficulty of}} working without the presence and spontaneity of real actors, and commented that the voice-acting work did not take much time, as she would just go into the studio [...] "once or twice a month for about four months" [...] with no need for make-up and costuming sessions. The workload was so light it did not interfere with her acting commitments in the television series ER.|$|E

Lhermitte attacked Yasmin from behind as she entered the office, but Yasmin was able to dodge the knife by diving to the ground. After a struggle in which Yasmin suffered multiple stab wounds, Lhermitte stabbed her in the back and slashed her throat. With her children dead, Lhermitte then attempted to kill herself by falling on her knife. When she realized that the wound would not be fatal, she wrote [...] "call the police" [...] in red marker on her door and called emergency services to the house. Investigators found the four children tucked in their beds, some with stuffed toys in their arms.|$|E
500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going to see me in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'" [...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E

500|$|Mader {{subsequently}} {{began to}} watch the first three seasons of Lost on DVD and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news {{that she had been}} chosen for the role. She watched all the previous episodes of Lost in the few weeks before she started working on the show. She found it [...] "a really amazing moment" [...] and felt <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> just stepped into the show. When she was cast, Mader was unaware of whether she would be a guest star, or would develop into a regular, and was planned to feature in eight episodes of season four. Mader helped develop Charlotte's outfit and was pleased to be wearing comfortable jeans and boots for the role. She only required a small amount of hair and makeup done, and stated [...] "I just wanted to rough it. I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun". This was a welcome change to her usual roles which required [...] "full-on hair, makeup and heels".|$|E
500|$|On January 22, 2011, Spears tweeted {{from the}} video shoot, {{saying it was}} [...] "an {{incredible}} experience" [...] and would [...] "be {{one of the best}} videos I have ever done." [...] On February 2, 2011, accusations came from TMZ.com that Åkerlund had decided to use a dance double for Spears when it seemed <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not rehearsed her moves enough. Both her representatives and the director denied the rumors, and Åkerlund commenting, [...] " [...] been great throughout the entire process. [...] I've been around long enough to know when an artist gives it their all, and to me it doesn't get better than this. This video is gonna be fucking awesome! It's all Britney." [...] Her manager Larry Rudolph later confirmed that a body double was actually used, but only for the scenes in which Spears fights herself. The fight scene was choreographed by Steven Ho. He commented that Spears incorporated the moves learned during rehearsals, but also incorporated [...] "her own flavor", by adding a small shuffle of steps in her heels. The length of the dresses also presented a problem, and there were discussions about shortening the trains for safety issues. They were later added as 'weapons', as Ho explained, [...] "as if they were sharp blades, giving Britney reason to jump and evade around them." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga is {{bailed out}} and exits to find Beyoncé {{waiting for her}} in the [...] "". Beyoncé is nicknamed Honey Bee, a {{reference}} to the character Honey Bunny in Tarantino's 1994 crime film Pulp Fiction. After an exchange of dialogues, Gaga and Beyoncé travel through the desert and pull over at a diner. Beyoncé sits opposite to her boyfriend, Gibson, but becomes tired of his stupidity and poisons him, but it does not kill him <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> hoped. The video later shifts to an intermediate sequence called [...] "Let's Make a Sandwich", where Gaga stands in a kitchen, wearing a folded-up telephone on her head, while dancers cavort behind her, holding salad tongs and assorted cutlery. Ultimately, Gaga prepares a sandwich and eats it, after a dance sequence. In the meantime, Gaga mixes poison into all of the dishes she is preparing for the unsuspecting customers causing Gibson and everybody else, including characters played by Semi Precious Weapons and her Great Dane, Lava, to die. Gaga and Beyoncé perform another dance sequence, wearing American flag inspired garments and shredded denims, while strutting around the dead bodies. Gaga and Beyoncé leave the diner in the [...] "Pussy Wagon" [...] and travel on a highway as a news reporter (played by Jai Rodriguez) reports the murders at the diner. The final shots shows Gaga and Beyoncé travelling through the desert with police sirens wailing in the background. The video ends with the line [...] "To Be Continued..."

500|$|Gard was keen to animate the {{character}} realistically, an aspect {{he felt the}} industry at the time had disregarded. He sacrificed quick animations in favour of more fluid movement, believing that players would empathise with {{the character}} more easily. Lara's dual-wielding of pistols {{was inspired by the}} film Hard Boiled and an Æon Flux short. In the first Tomb Raider, Croft's three-dimensional (3D) character model is made of around 230polygons. The character's braid was removed from the model, but added back for subsequent iterations. Gavin Rummery, programmer on the first two Tomb Raider games, explained, [...] "It had been dropped from the original because it just didn't work properly with all the acrobatic moves – it was more <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> an electric eel attached to her head that had a life of its own. But on TRII I came {{up with a way to}} get it working and was really pleased how natural it looked." [...] There is a misconception that, while adjusting the character model, Gard accidentally increased the breasts' dimensions by 150 percent and the rest of the creative team argued to keep the change. Gard, however, has stated thasich notion [...] "came out of a silly remark made in an interview". Core Design hired Shelley Blond to voice Croft after the game entered the beta phase of development. Gard left Core Design after completing Tomb Raider, citing a lack of creative freedom and control over marketing decisions related to the ideas he developed (especially Lara Croft).|$|E
500|$|The deluxe {{version of}} Rebel Heart {{begins with the}} track [...] "Best Night", an 80s electro {{composition}} reminiscent of Sade's songs with drums and Indian flute instrumentation. Madonna begins the song with the line, [...] "You can call me M tonight" [...] but her voice is not discernible in the chorus, only in the harmonies. There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile / And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell me what you know about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely made it sound <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E
500|$|Jim Harrington of The Oakland Tribune {{described}} {{the show as}} a human embodiment of Britney Spears' [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] (2002). He presumed [...] that the tour was a conscious transition for fans {{who did not want}} Cyrus to separate herself from the Hannah Montana franchise. Kirsty Cameron of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Despite her relatively young age, Cyrus showed her unfailing capability as performer. With the help of her back-up dancers, Cyrus provided her audience with choreographed set pieces and a different spectacle for each song." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted that the Wonder World Tour presented Cyrus as both a [...] "PG-rated tween pop star and an edgy rocker eager". He stated that although she played both roles well, it was apparent that she was more at ease with the latter. Reed also felt the concert did little to display Cyrus' personality and ability to engage with the audience. [...] "We know she's got impressive vocal chops, but now we need to feel what she's trying to put across in her songs, something beyond the standard 'You guys are awesome!' banter." [...] Scott Iwasaki of Deseret News reviewed a concert in which Cyrus was ill. He mentioned that because of her illness, her voice went flat. Iwasaki also expressed his viewpoint that [...] "if there [...] any worries that Miley Cyrus would become another Britney Spears train wreck, those worries were quelled during Tuesday night's show. She kept the show family-friendly and, although obviously sick, looked <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a good time." [...] Marlin Levison of The Star Tribune believed the concert lacked much profundity until the last performance.|$|E
