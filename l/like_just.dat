The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of the early 1990s saw a major shift in trading {{patterns}} for many Canadian companies. Other innovations <b>like</b> <b>just</b> in time delivery and pressure to produce ever cheaper goods impacted some of the large multi-nationals in the 1970s and 1980s. GE operations in Peterborough consists of GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada and GE Power Conversion. Despite this, today GE, PepsiCo Quaker, Siemens and numerous smaller manufacturing companies are experiencing significant growth. Minute Maid (Coca-Cola) recently invested $CDN20 million in a new warehouse and product line while auto parts supplier Ventra has doubled in size. United Canadian Malt Ltd. is a manufacturer {{of a wide variety of}} extracts of malted barley, and other grains. Manufacturing job creation kept pace with the provincial average from 1991–2001. Lower costs, reliable labour and high quality post-secondary institutions are a competitive advantage for Peterborough. Peterborough was ranked number one location for business in Ontario by Canadian Business magazine in late 2004.|$|E

500|$|The {{material}} on Bleed American was more accessible and aggressive than its predecessor, {{which had a}} more [...] "layered, sprawling sound." [...] In regard to the stylistic approach of the album, frontman Jim Adkins said, “Things still got pretty gnarly in the studio as far as experimentation, {{but it was always}} to an end that was complimentary to the song. We wanted to really make sure that we weren’t doing things, <b>like,</b> <b>just</b> to put a wacky keyboard sound in. It had to be doing something constructive for the song.” Critics have described the genres of the album as alternative rock, emo, emo pop, pop punk, and power pop.|$|E

500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, did {{not think}} the episode {{developed}} Lisa's and Homer's relationship, but it [...] "tosses in some good pokes at the NFL and the culture that surrounds the sport."

[...] It's not a classic, but it remains an above average program." [...] The San Jose Mercury Newss Daniel Brown said NFL gambling [...] "seems to be a crew-wide addiction, which is why 'Lisa the Greek' is filled with sophisticated gags about point spreads and bookies." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette named it seventh best episode of the show with a sports theme.|$|E

And we instantly, before we got off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.' We turned their request into what felt like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking it".|$|E

I feel <b>like</b> <b>just</b> going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate." [...] Ghent discusses the history and reasoning behind rationing mechanisms and economic efficiency, which are the bases behind how tables are seated at restaurants, rationales which are perhaps invisible to hungry or impatient customers. Elaine's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost: the trio are willing to pay more than usual to get a table, if it means Elaine can eat sooner and Jerry makes it to the movie on time. Ghent also gives Jerry's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost: [...] "Did I do a bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn't go to dinner?

500|$|... "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] {{is a power}} ballad {{that was}} written by Clarkson, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke and {{produced}} by the latter two. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F sharp minor with Clarkson's vocal range spanning over two octaves from F#3 to F#5. The bridge was {{the only part of}} the song that was written by Dr. Luke and Martin together with Clarkson face to face. The song begins with Clarkson wailing [...] "oh oh oh" [...] over a restless percussion. In the first verse, the music becomes quiet to focus on Clarkson's vocal as she wails [...] "Seems <b>like</b> <b>just</b> yesterday/You were a part of me/I used to stand so tall/I used to be so strong/Your arms around me tight/Everything it felt so right/Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong." [...] During the chorus, the sound of electronic guitar is dominant as she vocalizes [...] "Here I am/Once again/I’m torn into pieces/Can’t deny it/Can’t pretend/Just thought you were the one/Broken up deep inside/But you won’t get to see the tears I cry/Behind these hazel eyes." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV noticed that the song [...] "soared on crunchy guitars, driving beats and anthemic, agitated choruses." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Los Angeles Times, Chris Willman {{wrote that}} Carey [...] "attempts {{her share of}} girl-group pop amid the quasi-gospel melisma, though still not evidencing as much {{personality}} as talent in either style". New York Times journalist Jon Pareles was more critical in his review. [...] "Regardless of backup, Ms. Carey oversings, glutting songs with her vocal tics—like sliding down from the note above the melody note—and turning expressions of devotion into narcissistic displays." [...] Chris Dickinson from the Chicago Tribune called the singer a [...] "trilling songbird" [...] and [...] "over-the-top irritant" [...] throughout the album, particularly on [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", where she [...] "sounds like a bush-league Petula Clark". The newspaper later named it the seventh worst Christmas album ever. J. D. Considine was more enthusiastic in The Baltimore Sun. In his opinion, Merry Christmas [...] "may look <b>like</b> <b>just</b> another attempt {{to cash in on}} Christmas cheer, but is actually the work of someone who genuinely loves this music". Considine said while Carey's gospel and soul-inflected vocal exercises worked well with the traditional songs, [...] "the album's real strength is the conviction she brings to otherwise corny fare like 'Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town', while the way she augments 'Joy to the World' with a bit of the Three Dog Night hit is pure genius." [...] Steve Morse from The Boston Globe argued that it was perhaps Carey's best record, on which she abandoned the overly polished sound of her previous albums and [...] "cut loose with unbridled soul".|$|E
500|$|A {{recurring}} {{source of}} lyrical subject matter in Let the Blind Lead is Cox's best friend, Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt, whom {{the album is}} dedicated to. [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] concerns {{the first time the}} two met. Seeing him at a bus stop while vacationing in Savannah, Georgia, Cox was [...] "attracted to him, but not in some kind of <b>like,</b> <b>just</b> physical way." [...] Seeing [...] "his melancholy, his sitting alone, staring at the ground", he [...] "fell in love" [...] with him. Cox and his family later drove to a beach; [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] relates to Cox’s memory of the beach, being [...] "infected with that new love" [...] found after meeting Pundt. The words of [...] "Scraping Past" [...] are about [...] "moving on…And wondering if somebody is going to come with you or…stay behind." [...] This uncertainty is characterized by several lines Cox considers [...] "pop song clichés", referencing [...] "rain that comes and goes." [...] In the song, Cox asks Pundt, [...] "Are you going to come with me, or are you staying here?" [...] In [...] "Ativan" [...] Cox examines his addiction to the drug of the same name, as well as his relationship with Pundt. [...] "It talks a lot about how things have changed between me and Lockett's relationship and how he's met a girl and…our friendship is never gonna change, but it's difficult sometimes." [...] Cox asserts that he would [...] "rather just take whatever drugs it takes to go to sleep and sleep through it…I'm not prepared to face it yet." ...|$|E

500|$|When Lisa {{develops}} stomach aches, she visits Dr. Hibbert, who {{suggests he}} could prescribe 'harsh Antacids' but says herbal tea could also work. Lisa wants the tea but Homer, scoffs at the tea and demands the antacids. While leaving the office Lisa {{has had enough}} and snaps at her father for belittling everything she believes in. When Lisa sees how she upset him, she says that they are just too different and will eventually drift apart. To make things up to her, Homer takes her to a local New Age store which introduces Homer and Lisa to water-filled sensory deprivation tanks, where they experience their own spiritual journey. On her journey, Lisa sees herself from Homer's perspective, reprimanding him for snoring during a ballet recital. Lisa realizes that despite his boorish personality, Homer loves Lisa enough {{to take her to}} events and places that he does not personally <b>like</b> <b>just</b> so she can be happy. Meanwhile, a pair of repo men start to clean out the store despite the lease not being up for months, taking the tank that Homer is in. Homer's [...] "journey" [...] becomes a real one, as his tank falls {{out of the back of}} the van. Mistaken by the Flanders' as a coffin, they bury him, only for the tank to fall through the soil and into a pipe where it is washed up onto the beach. Chief Wiggum finds it and returns it to the store. Lisa decides to go and do something they both enjoy. But they end up at a demolition derby together, even though Homer is the only fan.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews echoed {{complaints}} about the similarity of Blue Shift to previous games. GameSpy's reviewer Jamie Madigan stated that [...] "what really pulls the game down is the 'more of the same' factor". Although writing that the game [...] "feels <b>like</b> <b>just</b> a few more levels for the original game", he noted {{that this is what}} Blue Shift was designed to be, given its origins as an add-on for a Dreamcast version of Half-Life. Madigan described the single-player campaign as [...] "decent" [...] and commented that the High Definition pack made the game [...] "worthy of consideration". Eurogamer echoed criticism on the game's length; reviewer Tom Bradwell commented that [...] "although I'm hard pressed to criticize what you get, the complete absence of everything we've learnt from the likes of Counter-Strike and everything since is frankly bizarre". Bradwell did, however, criticize the game's artificial intelligence and the occasional bug that caused a player to get stuck on a wall. PC Zones Mark Hill was more lenient in his comments, praising the game's artificial intelligence as [...] "intelligent as you could hope an AI enemy to be". In addition, Hill praised the game for showing more activity in the base, noting that [...] "a whole world goes on around you, with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry. The complex is more alive than ever before". Hill also praised the focus [...] "on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than the two or three models that were cloned throughout the facility who kept repeating the same phrases", describing this as Blue Shifts [...] "greatest achievement". PC Zones review closed by commenting that [...] "as a Dreamcast extra it works perfectly, but as a standalone PC title there's not nearly enough to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ciaran {{has stated}} that the Super Furry Animals were [...] "very hands-on" [...] during {{the making of the}} DVD. Initially the band were mainly {{concerned}} with the sound quality, describing the presentation of the album's tracks in surround sound as [...] "radical, like the change from mono to stereo". The group directed the surround sound mix themselves, instructing audio engineers to move instruments and vocal parts between speakers: [...] "We want that one bit of sound to travel from the centre, over our heads and finish on my right shoulder ... Let's have the main vocal in the middle, then each harmony in its own speaker." [...] They soon became equally as interested in the remixes, visuals and interactive elements however. Ciaran has described this process as [...] "not always a nice position to be in" [...] when, for example, they had to reject music videos they weren't happy with. The band asked different directors to make music videos for each song having tried unsuccessfully to make a film to accompany their 1999 album Guerrilla themselves. According to singer Gruff Rhys the band [...] "tended to go for illustrators who could [...] cheaply using Flash ... and artists who like to work". The directors were asked to make the visuals as [...] "extreme as possible" [...] in an effort to avoid making videos that looked <b>like</b> <b>just</b> [...] "another pop promo ... like MTV" [...] and, according to Ciaran, had to [...] "work even harder at creating something interesting" [...] due to the limited budget available. Many of those who made videos for the DVD release had no previous experience of making films resulting in a [...] "really fresh ... kind of scruffy" [...] end product. According to Rhys the band made separate music videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional videos that were more like adverts for the songs. Rhys {{has stated that}} the Super Furry Animals felt that fans placed too much emphasis on the videos on Rings Around the World rather than concentrating on the music, as a result of which the band used [...] "really bland images" [...] on the DVD release of their next album Phantom Power.|$|E
