He composed a few settings of liturgical material, including one of the 91st Psalm (1853); and also choral works for the synagogue at Paris.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February, 20,000 spectators, a huge {{crowd for}} French rugby, {{turned out to}} watch the game against Wales. Although the Welsh {{went on to win}} 0–15, with three {{converted}} tries, they were prevented from scoring in the first half. They were clearly the better team, but the French played with greater passion. Once again, while Neumeyer praised the French forwards, he singled out Guillemin for criticism, creating an imbalance in the French scrum. The Chronique de <b>la</b> <b>Jeunesse,</b> however, highlights Guillemin's dribbling with the ball. Nevertheless, for the final international match of the season against Ireland, Guillemin was dropped from the team, with approval from Reichel, although he nevertheless travelled to Cork as a replacement.|$|E

According to his own testimony, he became active in supporting the Anti-Ottoman upsurge in Crete and Macedonia, as well as Dashnak revolutionary activities. In 1896, he was the Bulgarian representative to the Second International's London Congress (part of his speech was published in Karl Kautsky's Die Neue Zeit).|$|E

500|$|The National Front fared {{poorly in}} the 1973 {{legislative}} elections, receiving 0.5% {{of the national}} vote (although Le Pen won 5% in his Paris constituency). In 1973 the party created a youth movement, the Front national de <b>la</b> <b>jeunesse</b> (National Front of the Youth, FNJ). The rhetoric used in the campaign stressed old far-right themes and was largely uninspiring to the electorate at the time. Otherwise, its official program at this point was relatively moderate, differing little from the mainstream right. Le Pen sought the [...] "total fusion" [...] of the currents in the party, and warned against crude activism. The more radical elements of the ON were not persuaded, and reverted to hard activism. They were banned from the party later that year. Le Pen soon became the undisputed leader of the party, although this cost it many leading members and much of its militant base.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Saëns's four symphonic poems {{follow the}} model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the [...] "vulgar blatancy" [...] to which the earlier {{composer}} was prone. The most popular of the four is Danse macabre (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight. Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation, but in this piece he featured the xylophone prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers. Le Rouet d'Omphale (1870) was composed soon after {{the horrors of the}} Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies. Rees rates Phaëton (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody, and inspired in its depiction of the mythical hero and his fate. A critic {{at the time of the}} premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece [...] "the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre" [...] rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece. The last of the four symphonic poems, <b>La</b> <b>jeunesse</b> d'Hercule ("Hercules's Youth", 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful. In the judgment of the critic Roger Nichols these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration [...] "set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel".|$|E
