5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have loudspeakers at ground level aimed up at the seating areas—Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled reverberation from sound waves bouncing off the ceiling. Instead, he configured two rings of loudspeakers {{hung from the ceiling}} 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 <b>line</b> <b>array</b> <b>speakers</b> and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 <b>line</b> <b>array</b> <b>speakers,</b> augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also hung from the ceiling, and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as main and backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled main and backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake Processors, and time code generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|R

50|$|Other {{than the}} {{narrowing}} vertical coverage, {{the length of}} the array also plays a role in what wavelengths will be affected by this narrowing of dispersion. The longer the array, the lower frequency the pattern will control. At frequencies below 100 Hz (wavelength of 11.3 ft) the <b>line</b> <b>array</b> which is less than approximately 3 meter long will start to become omnidirectional, so the system will not conform to <b>line</b> <b>array</b> theory across all frequencies. Above about 400 Hz the driver cones themselves become directional, again violating the theory’s assumptions, and at high frequencies, many practical systems use directional waveguides whose behavior cannot be described using classical <b>line</b> <b>array</b> theory. In short, the geometry of real-world audio <b>line</b> <b>arrays</b> as used in public address systems can only be modeled approximately by <b>line</b> <b>array</b> theory, and only in the 100-400 Hz range.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of amplifiers {{used to drive}} large <b>speaker</b> <b>arrays,</b> such as those used for rock concerts, are amplifiers with 26-36dB voltage gain capable of high amounts of current into low impedance <b>speaker</b> <b>arrays</b> where the <b>speakers</b> are wired in parallel.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} that followed, K-array has {{continued}} to develop <b>line</b> <b>array</b> solutions, including the flat-panel <b>line</b> <b>array</b> modules, alongside slim line column loudspeakers, micro loudspeakers with integrated LED lighting, a flexible rope-like loudspeaker, and a moving head loudspeaker with integrated camera.|$|R
50|$|A {{multi-band}} <b>line</b> <b>array</b> {{elements in}} a horizontally oriented enclosure was suggested by Joseph D'Appolito in 1983. However, it was L-Acoustics' V-DOSC <b>line</b> <b>array</b> in the mid-1990s that would show the concert world that a more level and smoother frequency response can come from fewer boxes in a <b>line</b> <b>array.</b> As soon as people {{realized that there was}} no destructive interference in the horizontal plane and waves combine mostly in phase in the vertical plane, the race was on for loudspeaker manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers {{typically}} {{provide a}} spreadsheet or custom program to design arrays. Examples include L-Acoustics SOUNDVISION, Adamson Shooter, Electro-Voice LAPS (<b>Line</b> <b>Array</b> Prediction Software), D&B Audiotechnik ArrayCalc, and JBL Vertec <b>Line</b> <b>Array</b> Calculator. Renkus Heinz offers {{a program called}} EaseFocus. It is similar to EASE but has only features and calculations specific to <b>Line</b> <b>arrays.</b> EaseFocus has data for {{a large number of}} manufacturers allowing comparison of several loudspeaker systems. Meyer Sound offers a different solution by providing an online system called MAPP Online Pro. Nexo offer their 3D modelling software, NS1.|$|R
50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>arrays</b> can be {{oriented}} in any direction, {{but their}} primary use in public address is in vertical arrays which provide {{a very narrow}} vertical output pattern useful for focusing sound at audiences without wasting output energy on ceilings or empty air above the audience. A vertical <b>line</b> <b>array</b> displays a normally wide horizontal pattern useful for supplying sound {{to the majority of}} a concert audience. Horizontal <b>line</b> <b>arrays,</b> by contrast, have a very narrow horizontal output pattern and a tall vertical pattern. A row of subwoofers along the front edge of a concert stage can behave as a horizontal <b>line</b> <b>array</b> unless the signal supplied to them is adjusted (delayed, polarized, equalized) to shape the pattern otherwise. Loudspeakers can be designed to be arrayed horizontally without behaving as a horizontal line source.|$|R

50|$|The <b>line</b> <b>array</b> {{effect of}} the {{narrowing}} of the beam with increasing frequency was first demonstrated by acoustical pioneer Harry Olson. He published his findings in his 1957 text, Acoustical Engineering. Olson used <b>line</b> <b>array</b> concepts to develop the column speaker in which vertically aligned drivers in a single enclosure produced mid-range output in a wide horizontal and narrow vertical pattern. <b>Line</b> <b>arrays</b> {{have been around for}} over half a century but until recently most were voice range only. The application for these were for highly reverberant spaces where a narrow vertical design kept from exciting the reverberant field.|$|R

50|$|The large format <b>line</b> <b>array</b> {{has become}} the {{standard}} for large concert venues and outdoor festivals, where such systems can be flown (rigged, suspended) from a structural beam, ground support tower or off a tall A-frame truss tower. Since the enclosures rig together and hang from a single point, they are more convenient to assemble and cable than other methods of arraying loudspeakers. The lower portion of the <b>line</b> <b>array</b> is generally curved backward to increase dispersion {{at the bottom of}} the array and allow sound to reach more audience members. Typically, cabinets used in <b>line</b> <b>arrays</b> are trapezoidal, connected by specialized rigging hardware.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a set of}} mathematical expressions to analyze the performance of loudspeaker <b>line</b> <b>arrays.</b> It begins by developing a set of expressions for straight-line arrays including the directivity function, polar response, quarter-power angle, on-axis and off-axis pressure response and two-dimensional pressure field. Since in practice many loudspeaker <b>line</b> <b>arrays</b> are not actually straight, the paper then provides expressions for curved (arc), “J ” and “progressive ” <b>line</b> <b>arrays.</b> In addition, since loudspeaker systems are often not perfect sources, the paper analyzes the effects of spherical radiating sources and gaps between sources. The paper closes with several examples of how to apply the models and compares modeled performance to measured polar data. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{compound}} imager {{consists of}} two or more individual chips, each with at least one <b>line</b> <b>array</b> of sensors thereupon. Each chip has a glass support plate attached to the side from which light reaches the <b>line</b> <b>arrays.</b> The chips are butted together end-to-end to make large <b>line</b> <b>arrays</b> of sensors. Because of imperfections in cutting, the butted surfaces define a gap. Light entering in the region of the gap is either lost or falls on an individual imager other than the one for which it is intended. This results in vignetting and/or crosstalk near the butted region. The gap is filled with an epoxy resin or other similar material which, when hardened, has an index of referaction near that of the glass support plate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} a novel microplasma device with coplanar electrodes (Coplanar Eletrode Microplasma Devices, CEMPD). The microcavities {{of the proposed}} device compose of two coplanar electrodes instead of dielectric or single cathode, which can enhance the density of microcavities. The devices are fabricated by only one wet lithography process, which can simplify the fabrication processes and develop the fabrication uniformity.
