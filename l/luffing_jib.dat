2500|$|The second tallest crane, TC2, was {{initially}} assembled to [...] under the hook. This {{will allow the}} hotel tower to be constructed to level 12. It will then be extended in height to [...] under the hook with a tie to the hotel tower at [...] (level 11). This will allow the hotel tower to be constructed to full height. The tallest of the cranes, TC1, {{was expected to be}} initially be built to [...] under the hook and to allow the residential tower to be built to level 14. However, it was constructed to a lower height. It will be extended to [...] with a tie to the residential tower at [...] up. This will allow the residential tower to be built to level 26. After this, it will be extended up to [...] with an additional tie to the tower at [...] (level 21). This will allow the tower to be built up to level 36. It will be extended again once more to [...] with a third tie [...] up (level 31), which will allow the tower to go to full height. It is expected that TC1 and TC2 will be dismantled at around the same time. TC3 and TC2 are Wolff 180B <b>luffing</b> <b>jib</b> tower cranes whilst TC1 has a fixed jib.|$|E
50|$|Usually the {{description}} is only applied {{to those with}} a <b>luffing</b> <b>jib</b> that have some additional mechanism applied to keep the hook level when luffing.|$|E
5000|$|An early form of level-luffing gear was the [...] "Toplis" [...] design, {{invented by}} a Stothert & Pitt {{engineer}} in 1914. The crane <b>jibs</b> <b>luffs</b> {{as for a}} conventional crane, {{with the end of}} the jib rising and falling. The crane's hook is kept level by automatically paying out enough extra cable to compensate for this. This is also a purely mechanical linkage, arranged by the reeving of the hoist cables to the jib over a number of pulleys at the crane's apex above the cab, so that <b>luffing</b> the <b>jib</b> upwards allows more free cable and lowers the hook to compensate.|$|R
50|$|Mainsail {{controls}} {{permitted by}} the class are downhaul (Cunningham), outhaul and kicking strap (Vang). The Jib tack fixing {{may also be}} adjustable while sailing allowing changes in <b>jib</b> <b>luff</b> tension and tack height.|$|R
5000|$|A correct {{explanation}} {{of the interaction between}} jib and mainsail was published by aerodynamicist and yachtsman Arvel Gentry in 1981, and [...] "is much more complicated than the old theories imply". This states that the widely believed {{explanation of}} the slot effect is [...] "completely wrong" [...] and shows that this is not due to the venturi effect (or [...] "valve effect" [...] to use Curry's term) accelerating the air in the slot. Instead it is shown that the air in the slot is slowed down and its pressure increased reducing the tendency of the mainsail to stall, that the mainsail reduces the air pressure on the lee side of the jib accelerating that airflow, and that the mainsail increases the angle at which the air meets the <b>luff</b> of the <b>jib,</b> allowing the boat to point higher. Gentry points out that proper understanding of sail interaction allows better sail trimming.|$|R
5000|$|Hook: {{the hook}} (or hooks) {{is used to}} connect the {{material}} to the crane. It is suspended from the hoist rope either at the tip, for <b>luffing</b> <b>jib</b> cranes, or in the hoist rope belly underneath the trolley for hammerhead cranes.|$|E
5000|$|... •Concrete were pumped to a 300m height level using Putzmeister pump (the pump {{previously}} set {{world record}} in high-rise conveying of concrete to a height of 532 metre during {{the construction of the}} Riva del Garda dam in Italy). And from the 300m level the concrete were lifted by a Favelle 310D <b>luffing</b> <b>jib</b> tower crane.|$|E
50|$|For {{the work}} at {{basement}} level at Phase 4, Bachy Soletanche used two 50 t support cranes and two Bauer BG 22 piling rigs. Construction of Phase 3 is being assisted by three tower cranes.

It is a free standing crane and will allow podium level construction. Once construction at podium level is completed, it will be dismantled and replaced by two number gantry joists.|$|E
50|$|The second tallest crane, TC2, was {{initially}} assembled to 68.5 m under the hook. This {{will allow the}} hotel tower to be constructed to level 12. It will then be extended in height to 99.8 m under the hook with a tie to the hotel tower at 53.4 m (level 11). This will allow the hotel tower to be constructed to full height. The tallest of the cranes, TC1, {{was expected to be}} initially be built to 82 m under the hook and to allow the residential tower to be built to level 14. However, it was constructed to a lower height. It will be extended to 113.4 m with a tie to the residential tower at 57.7 m up. This will allow the residential tower to be built to level 26. After this, it will be extended up to 130 m with an additional tie to the tower at 84.7 m (level 21). This will allow the tower to be built up to level 36. It will be extended again once more to 154 m with a third tie 114.7 m up (level 31), which will allow the tower to go to full height. It is expected that TC1 and TC2 will be dismantled at around the same time. TC3 and TC2 are Wolff 180B <b>luffing</b> <b>jib</b> tower cranes whilst TC1 has a fixed jib.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tower cranes {{are made}} of steel structure, which {{account for more than}} half of their weights. Therefore, steel structre {{optimization}} of tower cranes is important for the development of design technology of tower cranes. This paper develops a systemic optimization method for tower cranes based on Ansys OPT, combined with finite element analysis (FEA) and stability theory. This mathod is firstly used in the optimization of the boom of <b>luffing</b> <b>jib</b> tower cranes. New optimization model of the boom of <b>luffing</b> <b>jib</b> tower cranes is introduced and the corresponding optimization program is developed. The integration of the calibrating of overall stability and single-limb stability of <b>luffing</b> <b>jib</b> tower cranes, FEA and OPT is realized by extracting some parametes from FEA results, such as weight and axial force. Rapid optimization of the boom of <b>luffing</b> <b>jib</b> tower cranes is realized by the parametrization of non-design variables. Direct reading of optimization results is realized by the discretization of design variables. Finally, the boom of a tower crane with movable arm is optimized with the optimization program to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the optimization method...|$|E
