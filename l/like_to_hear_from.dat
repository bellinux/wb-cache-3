25|$|The code {{of ethics}} that is {{affiliated}} with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is {{to be honest with}} the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.|$|E

[...] The Journalism & Mass Communication Educator wrote a predominantly positive review where they praised the film for its attention to personal details while also noting [...] "The film’s interviews are striking, but lack a sense of coherence." [...] The Capital Times was slightly more mixed in their review, stating [...] "Myers is a folksy and poetic narrator, although the tone of the film gets needlessly preachy toward the end.

[...] "The British Government wants to have the support of personalities and leaders like you in this task, what is your response?" [...] Mahmud Pasha replied: [...] "my answer is full rejection for the following reasons: firstly, I do not think your intentions towards the Kurdish people are sincere, if your goal is to serve the Kurds and save them from the cruelties as stated, you can be sure that, even without my support, there will be hundreds who will be willing to help you and certainly will succeed." [...] The second reason is that I am a Muslim, my religion prevents me from cooperating against my brothers in religion. The third reason is my old age, disability, and inability to take action".After this meeting, the British began pressuring Mahmud Pasha Jaff, imposing heavy taxes on the Kurds, for his physical condition. Finally, he died in 1921 and was buried in the mosque of the city of Saedeia.|$|R

I do not mind a game of cards in a saw-pit or waggon, but if ever you catch me on a stage-coach in the winter full against the wind, bring me down with a brace of bullets, and I promise not to 'peach.

[...] Or if it is the Discovery of America they are commemorating, he may call to his feet some representatively venerable citizen, with a well-earned compliment to his antiquity, and the humorous suggestion that he was personally knowing to the landing of Columbus. Then General Jones, or the venerable citizen, will treat at his pleasure of any subject under heaven, after having made his manners to that given him by the chairman and professed his unfitness to handle it.|$|E
60|$|Dec. 16th.--I {{have just}} {{received}} your letter;--I feel your kindness very deeply. The foregoing {{part of my}} letter, written yesterday, will, I hope, account for {{the tone of the}} former, though it cannot excuse it.

But you have other duties, and greater pleasures, and I should regret to take a moment from either. H * * was to call to-day, but I have not seen him. The circumstances you mention at the close of your letter is another proof in favour of my opinion of mankind. Such you will always find them--selfish and distrustful. I except none. The cause of this is the state of society. In the world, every one is to stir for himself--it is useless, perhaps selfish, to expect any thing from his neighbour. But I do not think we are born of this disposition; for you find friendship as a schoolboy, and love enough before twenty.|$|E
40|$|We {{are pleased}} that our article has stimulated debate. This was our intention. We are {{disappointed}} that some correspondents dismiss our argument by attacking a stereotype {{of who they}} think we are or a caricature of what they think we might have said, rather than addressing what we actually did say. Such correspondents have missed, or ignored, {{the point of the}} article – namely, to ask whether the de-medicalisation that has taken place over recent years in British psychiatry is bad for the health of patients and the specialty. We believe this is a question that is worth taking seriously. It is clear from the substantial eletter correspondence and other feedback that many psychiatrists share our concerns and wish for constructive debate. This primary concern with the decline in medical standards of care and the deliberate politicization of debates about service delivery does not imply that we cannot (a) embrace the importance of the full range of biological, psychological and social interventions for psychiatric illness and (b) value our non-psychiatric fellow professionals, and their integral contributions to mental health care. We also believe to be self-evident that services should be informed by the experiences of patients, their relatives and carers and that multidisciplinary team work is crucial for optimal management of psychiatric illness. We are not terribly interested in what is past. We are much more interested to look ahead. Of the wide range of views expressed by respondents, we believe the voice of trainees and those contemplating a career in psychiatry should carry particular weight and we should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more <b>from</b> them. They are the future of British psychiatry...|$|R
