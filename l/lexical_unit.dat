25|$|Based on the {{interaction}} between lexical properties, locality, and {{the properties of the}} EPP (where a phrasal head selects another phrasal element locally), Hale and Keyser make the claim that the Specifier position or a complement are the only two semantic relations that project a predicate's argument. In 2003, Hale and Keyser put forward this hypothesis and argued that a <b>lexical</b> <b>unit</b> must have one or the other, Specifier or Complement, but cannot have both.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, the moraic obstruent [...] {{corresponds}} to a reduced stop syllable. Contrary to the standard language, the moraic obstruent may occur word medially before any other sound except the moraic nasal. It may also occur in word-final position, which means that its phonetic realization cannot be immediately determined within the <b>lexical</b> <b>unit.</b> Like the moraic nasal, its place of articulation is mostly determined by the following consonant. Before other stops and fricatives, it assimilates, creating an effect of gemination. Before nasal syllables, the moraic obstruent may be realized, depending on the regional dialect, as a glottal stop , so that [...] "fox" [...] is pronounced [...] Other dialects exhibit gemination in this position, so that the latter is pronounced [...] instead. At the end of utterances and in isolation, the moraic obstruent is predictably realized as a glottal stop , which may also suggest that a parallelism exists between the glottal stop in interjections and the moraic obstruent in standard Japanese itself.|$|E

25|$|Lexical {{semantics}} (also {{known as}} lexicosemantics), is a subfield of linguistic semantics. The {{units of analysis}} in lexical semantics are <b>lexical</b> <b>units</b> which include not only words but also sub-words or sub-units such as affixes and even compound words and phrases. <b>Lexical</b> <b>units</b> make up the catalogue of words in a language, the lexicon.

2500|$|The {{accessibility}} hypothesis {{suggests that}} memory will be accurate when {{the ease of}} processing (accessibility) is correlated with memory behaviour; however, if the ease of processing is not correlated with memory in a given task, then the judgments will not be accurate.Proposed by Koriat, the theory suggests that participants base their judgments on retrieved information rather than basing them on the sheer familiarity of the cues. [...] Along with the <b>lexical</b> <b>unit,</b> people may use partial information that could be correct or incorrect. According to Koriat, the participants themselves {{do not know whether}} the information they are retrieving is correct or incorrect most of the time. [...] The quality of information retrieved depends on individual elements of that information. The individual elements of information differ in strength and speed of access to the information. Research by Vigliocco, Antonini, and Garrett (1997) and Miozzo and Caramazza (1997) showed that individuals in a tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) state were able to retrieve partial knowledge (gender) about the unrecalled words, providing strong evidence for the accessibility heuristic.|$|E

50|$|Lexical units (LU) are lemmas, {{with their}} part of speech, that evoke a {{specific}} frame.

The aim of the study is to compare the reaction time (RT) of SUR in Arabic language with the RT of SUR in English language experiments. Two experiments have been conducted in this study. One for SUR in Arabic language into English language, and the other one is from English language into Arabic language. 30 Arabic native subjects have been participated in the present study. 200 <b>lexical</b> <b>units</b> were elicited for Arabic language experiment and 200 <b>lexical</b> <b>units</b> were also elicited for English language experiment.

5000|$|A root, or a root word, is a {{word that}} does not have a prefix in front of the word or a suffix {{at the end of the}} word. The root word is the primary <b>lexical</b> <b>unit</b> of a word, and of a word family (root is then called base word), which carries the most {{significant}} aspects of semantic content and cannot be reduced into smaller constituents.Content words in nearly all languages contain, and may consist only of root morphemes. However, sometimes the term [...] "root" [...] is also used to describe the word minus its inflectional endings, but with its lexical endings in place. For example, chatters has the inflectional root or lemma chatter, but the lexical root chat. Inflectional roots are often called stems, and a root in the stricter sense may be thought of as a monomorphemic stem.|$|E
5000|$|If an {{ambiguous}} speech sound is spoken {{that is exactly}} in between [...] and , the hearer may have difficulty deciding what it is. But, if that same ambiguous sound is heard {{at the end of}} a word like woo/?/ (where ? is the ambiguous sound), then the hearer will more likely perceive the sound as a [...] This probably occurs because wood is a word but woot is not. An ambiguous phoneme presented in a lexical context will be perceived as consistent with the surrounding lexical context. This perceptual effect is known as the Ganong effect. TRACE reliably simulates this, and can explain it in relatively simple terms. Essentially, the <b>lexical</b> <b>unit</b> which has become activated by the input (i.e. wood) feeds back activation to the phoneme layer, boosting the activation of its constituent phonemes (i.e. [...] ), thus resolving the ambiguity.|$|E
50|$|Metaphor {{identification}} procedure (MIP) {{is a method}} for identifying metaphorically used words in discourse. It {{can be used to}} recognize metaphors in spoken and written language. Mainly intended for scholars, it can be helpful in empirical research. The procedure aims to determine the relationship of a particular <b>lexical</b> <b>unit</b> in the discourse and recognize its use in a particular context as possibly metaphorical. Since many words can be considered metaphorical in different contexts, MIP requires a clear distinction between words that convey metaphorical meaning and those that do not, despite the fact that language generally differs in the degrees of metaphoricity.A group of scholars called Pragglejaz started the Pragglejaz procedure in 2007, and elaborated on a detailed method of identifying metaphors. Note that this method does not deal with an author's possible intention to express metaphorical meanings, and does not identify metaphorical utterances and conventional linguistic metaphors. It also does not indicate ordinary procedures people use to determine metaphors or exclude other possible non-literalness.|$|E
