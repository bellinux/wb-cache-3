Hydrothermal alteration and mineralisation at Falun are constrained to a short interval of several million years between a 207 Pb/ 206 Pb weighted average age of 1894 ± 3 Ma for a rhyolitic sub-volcanic rock in the felsic volcanic to sub-volcanic host rock suite, and a 207 Pb/ 206 Pb weighted average age of 1891 ± 3 Ma for a post-sulphide, porphyritic dacite dyke. Magmatism also included the emplacement of granite plutons with igneous crystallization ages of 1894 ± 3, 1894 ± 2 Ma and 1893 ± 3 Ma. The felsicsub-volcanic to volcanic activity and the emplacement of dacite dykes and granite plutons overlap in age within their respective analytical uncertainties, indicating hydrothermal alteration and sulphide mineralisation inside a narrow time span of intense magmatic activity, and burial of the supracrustal rocks. Two distinct patchy and homogeneous metamorphic monazite types in a felsic volcanic rock around and hydrothermally altered rocks at the Falun deposit yield 207 Pb/ 206 Pb weighted average ages of 1831 ± 8 Ma and 1822 ± 5 Ma, respectively. These ages fall well within the temporal range of a younger 1. 84 – 1. 81 Ga (M 2) metamorphic episode during the 2. 0 – 1. 8 Ga Svecokarelian orogeny, with the older episode (M 1) inside the Bergslagen <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>unit</b> at around 1. 86 Ga. This shows the major influence of the M 2 event in the north-western part of this unit, leading to a complete resetting of the U–Th–Pb isotopesystem in monazite.

40|$|Geodynamic {{models for}} the Antarctic sector of the active Early Palaeozoic Palaeo-Pacific margin of Gondwana {{are based on the}} nature and age of the deep crust of the Robertson Bay terrane, the {{outermost}} <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>unit</b> of the margin. As this crustal block is covered with thick turbidite deposits, the only way to probe the deep crust is through the analysis of granulite xenoliths from Cenozoic scoria cones. Low-K felsic xenoliths yield the oldest (Middle Cambrian) laser-probe U–Pb ages on zircon areas with igneous growth zoning. This finding, along with the positive whole-rock eNd(500 Ma), suggests that these felsic rocks derived from a juvenile magma formed during the Early Palaeozoic Ross orogenic cycle.

The Rio Baio Thrust Sheet is formed by two volcanosedimentary series, the Loiba and the Queiroga Series. The Loiba Series contains calc-alkaline dacite and rhyolite, while the overlying Queiroga Series has alkaline rhyolite.

40|$|The Paleoproterozoic (1. 9 Ga), volcanic-hosted Zn-Pb-Cu-(Au-Ag) sulfide deposit at Falun {{is located}} in the Bergslagen <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>unit,</b> central Sweden, which {{includes}} one of the major ore districts in the Fennoscandian Shield, northern Europe. The Falun deposit is known mainly as one of the world’s leading copper suppliers over many centuries. During the 20 th century, the mine was a major base (Zn, Pb, Cu) and precious (Ag, Au) metal producer until it closed during 1992. This study has the following four aims: (i) Identify the style and spatial distribution of hydrothermal alteration; (ii) determine the geometry of the different types of ore bodies; (iii) provide a mechanism for the structure of the deposit; and (iv) address broader implications for the Bergslagen ore district. Petrographic and structural data were collected during surface mapping and microscope work; modeling of the different ore bodies in 3 D space was completed using available mine level maps and data collected during new logging of available drill cores. The Falun deposit is affected by polyphase ductile deformation and metamorphism under amphibolite facies conditions. The metamorphosed alteration rocks are dominated by distal quartz-mica-cordierite-(anthophyllite) and proximal quartz-anthophyllite assemblages, interpreted to represent Si-, Fe-, Mg-metasomatism of felsic volcanic rocks. Dolomite and calc-silicate (tremolite, actinolite, diopside) -skarn assemblages are interpreted as the equivalent alteration of carbonate rocks. Surface mapping in the open pit indicates that the ore bodies are completely enveloped by these altered rocks. Structural data suggest the presence of a reclined F 2 fold that plunges steeply to the southeast, with a stretching component defined by a linear grain-shape fabric sub-parallel to the fold axis. Modeling in 3 D space reveals the presence of several rod-shaped ore bodies that also plunge steeply to the southeast and thicken and merge upwards into a single ore body that is up to 270 m in diameter at the ground surface. The ore body close to this surface is zoned in a concentric pattern, from a massive, pyritic Zn-Pb-Cu-sulfide core in the inner part to a more Cu-rich sulfide zone and then a semi-massive to disseminated Cu-Au mineralization in the outer part. The cone-shaped and zoned ore bodies are interpreted as steeply-plunging megascopic sheath folds, formed in a ductile, high-strain tectonic regime. The viscosity contrast between competent, strongly silicified and metamorphosed felsic volcanic host rock and softer massive sulfide ore is suggested to have enhanced the development of these sheath folds. Steeply plunging, rod-shape geometries have commonly been reported for several volcanic-hosted sulfide and Fe oxide ore deposits in the Bergslagen <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>unit</b> and megascopic sheath folds have been identified in a high-strain belt {{in the northern part of}} this unit. If sheath fold formation can be confirmed as a key deformation mechanism for ore bodies in this mineral district, in contrast to the classical model of dome and basin fold interference structure, this will influence near-mine exploration strategies. Previous structural concepts and models for footwall/hanging wall relationships will need radical revision and areas previously considered as barren hanging wall lithologies may have a higher exploration potential.

40|$|AbstractThe Poya Terrane of New Caledonia is a {{composite}} <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>unit</b> made of i) Campanian-Paleocene E-MORB and BABB-type basalts and abyssal argillite (Poya Terrane Basalts); and ii) Coniacian-Santonian sandstone, turbidites and abyssal argillite (Kone Facies) intruded by Early Eocene E-MORB sills. Remapping reveals that the Kone Facies is more extensive than previously thought. Petrography and detrital zircons provenance show that Kone Facies sediments have the same provenance as coeval autochthonous sediments, albeit with more abundant contemporaneous zircons. They accumulated on the eastern continental slope of the Norfolk Ridge, and eventually mixed with abyssal argillite. Temporally, sill emplacement is related to subduction inception at ca. 56 Ma. We postulate that either: i) E-MORB intrusion was related to transcurrent thinning of the down going plate; or, ii) the “enriched” (off axis?) partial melt zone of the ancient ridge swept the lower plate, generating E-MORBs in the upper crust, and sills in passive margin sediments before it became extinct. Sliced marginal basin upper crust, and thereafter passive margin sediments and associated dolerites were obliquely accreted to the fore-arc, and partially subducted and recrystallized into the blueschist facies. The Poya Terrane was eventually thrust onto the Norfolk Ridge and its debris fed mid- to Late Eocene syntectonic basins. Meanwhile, mafic portions of the Poya Terrane were subducted and recrystallized into the eclogite facies, mixed with serpentinite to form the Pouebo mélange, and were exhumed in the fore-arc region.

The Lathore and Turekela Groups are nappes. With this structural configuration the NW part is described as a fold thrust belt. However, the thrusting postdates folding and granulite metamorphism that occurred in the Eastern Ghats, as in the Caledonide type of fold thrust belt of NW Scotland.

40|$|The Limousin {{ophiolite}} (French Massif Central) {{occurs as}} elongate bodies forming a (nearly) continuous suture zone between two major <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> of the French Variscan belt. The mantle {{section of the}} ophiolite is made of diopside-bearing harzburgite, harzburgite and dunite characteristic of a lherzolite-harzburgite ophiolite type (LHOT). The plutonic section is essentially composed of troctolites, wehrlites and gabbros locally intruded by ilmenite-rich mafic dykes. All the rocks were strongly affected by an ocean-floor hydrothermal metamorphism. The composition and evolution of primary magmatic phases (olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and spinel) throughout the lowermost magmatic sequence correspond to those described in oceanic cumulates (ODP data). The Limousin ophiolite is thus of MOR type instead of SSZ type. The whole lithological section, the mineral chemistry, the extensive hydrothermal oceanic alteration and the relatively thin crustal section are typical of a slow-spreading ridge ocean (i. e. Mid-Atlantic ridge). Comparison of the Limousin ophiolite with other ophiolites from European Variscides suggests that the oceanic domain was actively spreading during the Late Palaeozoic and extended from the Armorican massif to the Polish Sudetes. © 2006 The Mineralogical Society.

Altered rocks and ore types at Falun have been metamorphosed and deformed in a heterogeneous ductile manner, strongly modifying mineral assemblages in the original hydrothermal alteration system and the geometry of the deposit. Using a combined methodological approach, including surface mapping of lithologies and structures, drill core logging and microstructural investigation, the polyphase character (D 1 and D 2) of the ductile deformation is demonstrated and a 3 D model for the deposit created. F 2 sheath folding along axes that plunge steeply to the south-south-east, parallel to a mineral stretching lineation and the dip direction of the S 2 foliation, is suggested as a key deformation mechanism forming steeply plunging, rod-shaped ore bodies. This is in contrast to previous structural models involving fold interference and, in turn, has implications for near-mine exploration, the occurrence of hanging-wall components to the ore body being questioned. Typical rock-forming minerals in the Falun alteration aureole include quartz, biotite/phlogopite, cordierite, anthophyllite and minor almandine, andalusite and chlorite, as well as dolomite, tremolite and actinolite. Where observable, the silicate minerals in the alteration rocks show growth patterns during different phases of the tectonothermal evolution, considerable static grain growth occurring between D 1 and D 2 and even after D 2. A major high-strain zone, characterized by the mineral assemblage talc-chlorite-(quartz-biotite/phlogopite) defines a boundary between northern and southern structural domains at the deposit, and is closely spatially associated with the polymetallic massive sulphide ores.

40|$|The St. Cyr klippe hosts well {{preserved}} to variably retrogressed eclogites {{found as}} sub-meter {{to hundreds of}} meter scale lenses within quartzofeldspathic schists in the Yukon-Tanana terrane, Canadian Cordillera. The St. Cyr area consists of structurally imbricated, polydeformed, and polymetamorphosed units of continental arc and oceanic crust. The eclogite-bearing quartzofeldspathic schists form a 30 by 6 kilometer thick, northwest-striking, coherent package. The schists consist of metasediments and felsic intrusives that are intercalated on the tens of meter scale. The presence of phengite and Permian age zircon crystallized under eclogite facies metamorphic conditions indicates that the eclogite was metamorphosed in situ with its quartzofeldspathic host. I investigated the metamorphic evolution of the eclogite-facies rocks in the St. Cyr klippe using isochemical phase equilibrium thermodynamic (pseudosection) modeling. I constructed P-T pseudosections in the system Na 2 O-K 2 O-CaO-FeO-O 2 -MnO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -TiO 2 -H 2 O for the bulk-rock composition of an eclogite and a host metatonalite. In combination with petrology and mineral compositions, St. Cyr eclogites followed a five-stage clockwise P-T path. Peak pressure conditions for the eclogites and metatonalites reached up to 3. 2 GPa, well within the coesite stability field, indicating the eclogites reached ultrahigh-pressure conditions. Decompression during exhumation occurred with a corresponding temperature increase. SHRIMP-RG zircon dating shows that the protolith of the eclogites formed within the Yukon-Tanana terrane during early, continental arc activity, between 364 and 380 Ma, while the metatonalite protolith formed at approximately 334 Ma, during the Little Salmon Cycle of the Klinkit phase of Yukon-Tanana arc activity. Both the eclogites and the metatonalites were then subducted to mantle depths and metamorphosed to ultrahigh-pressure conditions during the late Permian, between 266 and 271 Ma. The results of our study suggest portions of the Yukon-Tanana terrane were subducted to high-pressure and ultrahigh-pressure conditions. This is the first report of ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism in the accreted terranes of the North American Cordillera.

40|$|Paleozoic {{sequences}} exposed {{along the}} Transantarctic Mountains in Antarctica and in southeastern Australia are segments of a formerly contiguous accretionary orogen that developed {{along the eastern}} margin of Gondwana. The margin underwent amalgamation and eastward accretion in the early Cambrian to Early Ordovician Ross-Delamerian orogen and in the Ordovician to Carboniferous Lachlan orogen. Northern Victoria Land {{plays a key role}} in many geodynamic reconstructions because it has long been considered the along-strike continuation of Australia in Antarctica; however, the correlation between lithotectonic units in Antarctica (Wilson, Bowers, and Robertson Bay terranes) and those in southeastern Australia (Glenelg, Grampians-Stavely, and Stawell zones), as well as the presence of Lachlan-aged tectono-metamorphic events in northern Victoria Land, are still uncertain. 40 Ar- 39 Ar laser experiments on detrital and syndeformational white micas from low-grade siliciclastic rocks of northern Victoria Land, in conjunction with mineral-textural analysis and whole-rock geochemical and Nd isotope data, are used to constrain provenance and the timing of deformation, and to assess analogies with correlative structural zones in southeastern Australia. Detrital white micas of the western <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>unit</b> (Wilson terrane) yielded an age pattern dominated by late Cryogenian to Ediacaran ages (650 – 550 Ma), closely matching those of turbidites from the Australian Kanmantoo Group. Detrital white micas from the easternmost lithotectonic units (Bowers terrane and Robertson Bay terrane) yield indistinguishable age patterns, strikingly in agreement with those available for the western subprovince of the Lachlan orogen in Australia, which are dominated instead by younger ages with a dominant Ross orogen fingerprint (550 – 480 Ma). Deposition of siliciclastic detritus in the three lithotectonic units most likely occurred synchronously in the early–middle Cambrian, and the different signatures suggest that detritus was supplied from different source areas, with sediment supply from the west-southwest (East African orogen or ice-covered regions of East Antarctica) in the Wilson terrane and from the south (Ross orogen) in the Bowers and Robertson Bay terranes. Results also provide evidence for post-Ross orogen (ca. 462 Ma) contractional tectonics at the boundary between the Bowers and the Robertson Bay terranes, suggesting that available Ar data from the literature are variably affected by the presence of detrital micas. This finding establishes a cause-effect relationship between compressional tectonics at the plate margin and Middle–Late Ordovician intraplate reactivation processes in the western Wilson terrane. The accretion of northern Victoria Land was polyphase; it began with the amalgamation of the Bowers and Wilson terranes in the middle–late Cambrian and was followed by the docking of the Robertson Bay and Bowers terranes in the Middle–Late Ordovician. Results further support the link between northern Victoria Land and southeastern Australia. Together with a careful examination of data from the literature, they also suggest that the Bowers terrane and the across-strike contiguous Robertson Bay terrane are correlatives of the whole Stawell zone...|$|E

New Pb- 207 /Pb- 206 zircon evaporation ages for granite plutons and dykes that intrude the ophiolite and its neighbouring <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> suggest that the ophiolite was obducted at c. 540 Ma {{at the beginning of a}} collisional event that lasted until c. 450 Ma. The new data, combined with that of previous studies, indicate regional correlation of isotopic ages north-westward from Bayankhongor to southern Tuva. These data record oceanic crust formation at c. 570 Ma, followed by approximately 30 million years of subduction-accretion that culminated in obduction of ophiolites, collision related metamorphism, and magmatism in the period c. 540 - 450 Ma. Correlation of isotopic-age data for the ophiolites of western Mongolia and southern Tuva suggests that the ophiolites define a major collisional suture in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) that defines the southern and western margins of the Hangai continental block.

40|$|Polyphase {{deformation}} and the interrelationship between chert diagenesis, rheology, {{and structural}} fabric in the Schoonover sequence, Independence Mountains, Nevada {{has contributed to}} resolving the controversy concerning {{the closure of the}} Havallah/Schoonover oceanic basin during the Late Permian to Early Triassic (?) Sonoma orogeny. The Schoonover sequence is an allochthonous upper Paleozoic assemblage of complexly deformed chert, argillite, siliciclastic, calcareous, and volcaniclastic turbidites, and mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks. The Schoonover sequence is lithologically similar to and has a deformational history paralIeIing that of the Havallah sequence, and both are considered pieces of the Late Devonian to Permian Golconda allochthon. The Late Permian to Early Triassic (?) emplacement of the Golconda allochthon onto North America is generally referred to as the Sonoma orogeny. Back-arc thrusting and prolonged stacking in an accretionary prism are alternative tectonic models proposed for closure of the Havallah/Schoonover ocean basin. The structural chronology of the Schoonover sequence suggests a deformational history with six possible events. These events include: (D 0) original ceposttion and formation of mound features; (D 1) bedding-paralleI pressure solution and boudin formation; (D 2) NW - SE directed shortening and boudin formation; (D 3) NE - SW directed shortening and boudin formation; (D 4) SE - NW directed shortening and formation of the Golconda thrust; and (D 4 +) post-Sonoma deformation. A portion of Miller and others (1984) geologic map has been revised. The revisions include: addition of two map scale folds, reinterpretation of inverted <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> separated by a depositional contact as upright younger-over-older <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> separated by a thrust fault contact, reinterpretation of depositional contacts which are possibly thrust faults, and the relocation of a depositional contact based on biostratigraphy. New radiolarian age determinations have confirmed and strengthened the biostratigraphy. The existence of an undescribed piece of the Golconda allochthon in the Bull Run Mountains, in northern Nevada has been established. Eleven faunal groups were determined from 42 samples, and range in age from Late Devonian to Late Permian. Both older and younger chert units on map and microscopic scales display similar structural fabrics. Pressure solution found in the hinge regions of folds and in boudins, and fold hinge thickening suggests that deformation occurred while the siliceous sediment was still in an immature stage of opal-A or opal-CT. Conodont color indices and mineralogy support deformation occurring at low temperatures. Since older (Late Devonian and Mississippian) cherts units should show ductile fabrics if deformed prior to complete lithification in an accrectionary prism, and more brittle fabrics if deformed during back-arc thrusting, the data suggest the tectonic closure mechanism for the Havallah/Schoonover ocean basin was probably prolonged subduction with simultaneous stacking of diagenetically immature siliceous sediment in an accretionary prism. This accretionary assemblage was later thrust onto continental North America during the Late Permian to Early Triassic (?) Sonoma orogeny...|$|R

40|$|D. ScNeumayerskarvet forms a {{continuous}} outcrop of high-grade gneiss within the northern Kirwanveggen in western Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. A detailed geological study {{was carried out}} to obtain an evolutionary history for Neumayerskarvet. The work involved field mapping to provide a structural framework for further metamorphic and isotopic investigations. U-Pb zircon SHRIMP analysis, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and Ar-Ar mineral analysis were used to provide absolute time constraints on different tectono-metamorphic periods and cooling histories. Petrographic investigations, coupled with mineral chemistry on kyanite-bearing leucogneisses, provided information on the P-T conditions. An understanding of the crustal evolution of the high-grade gneisses was obtained through whole-rock geochemistry and isotope analysis. The dominant <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>unit</b> preserved at Neumayerskarvet is biotite-garnet migmatite gneiss, which is inter-fingered with quartzofeldspathic gneisses and banded quartz-feldspar gneisses. Several magmatic phases have intruded these sequences. Three tectonometamorphic cycles have been established for the region. The first two cycles are assigned to a period between 1390 Ma and 970 Ma while the third cycle is constrained between 650 Ma and 450 Ma. An age of ca. 1390 Ma for the biotite-gamet migmatite gneiss provides a maximum age for the first tectono-metamorphic cycle. Zircon growth and magmatism during this tectonometamorphic cycle constrains deformation (D 1 a) between ca. 1160 Ma and ca. 1110 Ma. Deformation is marked {{by the development of}} a penetrative planar foliation and isoclinal recumbent folding. High-pressure metamorphic conditions during this cycle have been suggested from previous investigations but are not confirmed in this investigation as the kyanite-bearing leucogneisses intruded during the second tectono-metamorphic cycle. It is possible that the first and second tectono-metamorphic cycles are part of a progressive deformational cycle. The second tectono-thermal cycle represents a major period of magmatism and tectonism constrained between ca. 1110 Ma and ca. 970 Ma. Major folding occurred during this tectonic episode, represented by isoclinal recumbent folds, sheath folds and re-folded fold interference patterns (D 1 b). The structural fabric elements produced a complicated relationship of transposed coplanar and colinear composite fabrics. Fabric geometries suggest NNW-SSE tectonic transport directions. Garnet-kyanite-muscovite-biotite-quartz assemblages (Mn+ 1 (nkv)) provide P-T estimates of 710 - 760 °C and 7. 8 - 8. 5 kb. Later metamorphic assemblages of sillimanite-muscovite-high Ca-garnet-biotite-quartz (Mn+ 2 (nkv)) provide P-T estimates of 630 - 690 °C and 6. 0 - 7. 4 kb. The whole-rock isotope data indicate that material accreted during the second tectono-metamorphic cycle experienced a short crustal residence time. The third tectono-metamorphic cycle is constrained by isotopic ages between 650 Ma and 450 Ma. Deformation (D 2) that re-works earlier tectonic fabrics may represent signatures of this cycle, but the exact nature of the deformation remains enigmatic. Tectonic fabric styles and geometries are similar to the more dominant D 1 tectonic episode, making recognition of temporal relationships difficult. Diffusional P-T data from garnet-biotite rims (Mn+ 3 (nkv)) provide P-T cooling estimates of 560 - 570 °C and 4. 4 - 4. 6 kb. Re-working of the high-grade gneisses during the third tectono-metamorphic cycle, with no addition or accretion of new crustal material is indicated by the isotopic data. A final tectonic episode (D 3) comprising late brittle deformation and uplift is equated to Gondwana break-up...|$|E

Host rocks to the deposit as well as the ores and altered rocks were metamorphosed and affected by heterogeneous ductile strain during the Svecokarelian orogeny the total duration of which was 2. 0 – 1. 8 Ga. These processes both reworked the mineral assemblages of the original hydrothermal alteration system and reshaped the structural geometry of the deposit, following formation of the ores and the associated hydrothermal alteration. In order to study primary geological and ore-forming processes at Falun, it is necessary firstly to investigate the nature of the tectonothermal modification. In this licentiate thesis, a three-dimensional modelling approach is used in order to evaluate geometric relationships between lithologies at the deposit. This study demonstrates the polyphase character (D 1 and D 2) of the strong ductile deformation at Falun. The major rock-forming minerals in the silicate alteration rocks are quartz, biotite/phlogopite, cordierite, anthophyllite, chlorite, and minor almandine and andalusite. On the basis of microstructural investigations, it is evident that these minerals grew during distinct periods in the course of the tectonic evolution, with major static grain growth between D 1 and D 2, and also after D 2. Furthermore, the occurrence of F 2 sheath folds along steeply south-south-east plunging axes is suggested as a key deformation mechanism, forming cylindrical, rod-shaped ore bodies which pinch out at depth. The sheath folding also accounts for the same stratigraphic level (footwall) on both the eastern and western sides of the massive sulphide ores. A major, sulphide-bearing high-strain zone defines a tectonic boundary at the deposit and bounds the massive sulphide ores to the north. The geological evolution in the Falun area involved emplacement of felsic sub-volcanic intrusive and volcanic rocks and some carbonate sedimentation; followed by hydrothermal alteration, ore formation and the intrusion of dykes and plutons of variable composition after burial of the supracrustal rocks. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) U-Pb (zircon) geochronology of key lithologies in and around the Falun base metal sulphide deposit indicates a rapid sequence of development of different magmatic pulses with individual age determinations overlapping within their uncertainties. The intense igneous activity, as well as the feldspar-destructive hydrothermal alteration and ore formation are constrained by two 207 Pb- 206 Pb weighted average (zircon) ages of 1894 ± 3 Ma for a sub-volcanic host rock not affected by this type of alteration and 1891 ± 3 Ma for a felsic dyke, which cross-cuts the hydrothermally altered zone and is also unaffected by this alteration. All other ages, including the granitic plutonic rocks, fall in the interval between these ages. The lithological, structural and geochronological observations have implications for the environment and the conditions of ore formation at the Falun deposit. Several aspects argue for an ore system resembling a classic volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) system in terms of type of alteration, metal zonation, the pyritic character of massive sulphides and an inferred vent-proximal location in relation to the convection-driving magmatic system. The bowl-shaped, sub-seafloor feeder part of such a system might have served as an initial inhomogeneity in the strata for the later development of strong stretching along steep axes and sheath fold formation during ductile strain. Possible discordant relationships along the margins of the massive sulphide ores, coupled with the syn-magmatic, pre-tectonic timing of ore formation are in accordance with a general VMS-type model for the Falun base metal sulphide deposit. These results provide a compromise solution to the previous debate around two opposing models of strictly syn-genetic vs. epigenetic, post-deformational carbonate-replacement processes for ore formation at the deposit.

The sheath folding also accounts for the same stratigraphic level on both the eastern and western sides of the massive sulphide ores. A major, sulphide-bearing high-strain zone defines a tectonic boundary inside the deposit and bounds the massive sulphide ores to the north. A precursor to this zone can have played a central role as a metal-bearing fluid conduit during ore genesis, prior to reactivation of the zone in the ductile regime. The geological evolution in the Falun area involved emplacement of felsic volcanic and sub-volcanic rocks and some carbonate sedimentation, followed by ore formation and hydrothermal alteration as well as the intrusion of dykes and plutons of variable composition. U-Pb zircon geochronology of key lithologies in and around the Falun base metal sulphide deposit indicates a rapid sequence of development of different magmatic phases with individual age determinations overlapping within their uncertainties. The igneous activity is constrained between a zircon U-Pb concordia age of 1899 ± 7 Ma for a sub-volcanic host rock and a zircon 207 Pb- 206 Pb weighted average age of 1891 ± 3 Ma for a felsic dyke, with all other reliable ages, including the quartz-rich plutonic rocks, falling in the interval between them. This interval also included the hydrothermal alteration and ore formation at Falun. It is suggested that the bowl-shaped, sub-seafloor feeder part of a high-sulphidation and Au-bearing volcanogenic massive sulphide ore system, with replacement of carbonates and (sub) -volcanic rocks, served as an initial inhomogeneity in the strata for the later development of strong stretching along steep axes and sheath fold formation during ductile strain. The observation of discordant relationships along the margins of the massive sulphide ores, coupled with the syn-magmatic, pre-tectonic timing of ore formation, corroborate this hypothesis, providing a compromise solution to the previous debate around two opposing models of strictly syn-genetic vs. epigenetic, post-deformational carbonate-replacement processes of ore formation at the Falun base metal sulphide deposit.

40|$|The Falun pyritic Zn-Pb-Cu-(Au-Ag) {{sulphide}} deposit, {{situated in}} the Palaeoproterozoic (1. 9 – 1. 8 Ga) Bergslagen <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>unit</b> in the south-western part of the Fennoscandian Shield, {{is one of the}} major base and precious metal sulphide deposits in Sweden. Felsic volcanic rocks and limestone hosting the deposit, as well as their hydrothermally altered equivalents and the mineralization, were affected by heterogeneous ductile strain and metamorphism under low-pressure, lower amphibolite-facies conditions during the Svecokarelian orogeny (2. 0 – 1. 8 Ga). These processes reworked the mineral assemblages of the original hydrothermal system and the mineralization, and also reshaped the structural geometry of the deposit. A three-dimensional modelling approach has been used in order to evaluate geometric relationships between lithologies at the deposit. The polyphase character (D 1 and D 2) of the strong ductile deformation at Falun is apparent. The main rock-forming minerals in the altered silicate-rich rocks are quartz, biotite and anthophyllite with porphyroblasts of cordierite and garnet, as well as retrogressive chlorite. Major static grain growth occurred between D 1 and D 2, inferred to represent the peak of metamorphism, as well as after D 2 with growth (or recrystallization) of anthophyllite. A major shear zone with chlorite, talc and disseminated sulphides bounds the pyritic Zn-Pb-Cu-rich massive sulphide mineralization to the north, the latter being surrounded elsewhere by disseminated to semi-massive Cu-Au mineralization. F 2 sheath folding along axes plunging steeply to the south-south-east is suggested as a key deformation mechanism, accounting for the cone-shaped mineralized bodies, which pinch out at depth, and explaining the similar character of intensely altered rocks on all sides of the massive sulphide mineralization. Immobile-element lithogeochemistry suggests that they share a common volcanic precursor. These relationships are consistent with a model in which the pyritic massive sulphide mineralization is located in the core of a sheath fold structure, surrounded by the same altered stratigraphic footwall rocks with Cu-Au mineralization. The geological evolution in the metavolcanic inlier that hosts the Falun deposit, constrained by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) U–Pb (zircon) geochronology, involved emplacement of a felsic volcanic and sub-volcanic rock suite at 1894 ± 3 Ma, followed by hydrothermal alteration and mineralization. Subsequent burial and intrusion of late- to post-mineralization dykes occurred between 1896 ± 3 Ma and 1891 ± 3 Ma, followed by further burial and emplacement of plutons with variable composition during the time span 1894 ± 3 Ma to 1893 ± 3 Ma. The age determinations for all these magmatic suites overlap within their uncertainties, indicating a rapid sequence of continuous burial and different magmatic pulses. A metamorphic event, herein dated at 1831 ± 8 Ma and 1822 ± 5 Ma (SIMS U–Pb monazite), falls in the age range of a younger Svecokarelian metamorphic episode (M 2). U-Th-Pb isotope systematics in monazite was completely reset during this event. During hydrothermal alteration and mineralization, a hot, reducing and acidic fluid carrying metals and sulphur together flowed upward along syn-volcanic faults, leading to intense chloritization, sericitization and silicification of calc-alkaline volcanic rocks in the stratigraphic footwall to the deposit. This resulted in proximal siliceous associations including Fe-rich chlorite, and dominant Mg-rich chlorite and sericite in more peripheral parts. Cu-Au stockwork mineralization formed in the siliceous core of the hydrothermal system as result of fluid cooling. Neutralization of the metal-bearing fluids upon carbonate interaction stratigraphically higher in the sub-seafloor regime led to formation of Zn-Pb-Cu-rich massive sulphide mineralization, the space for which was created by a combination of carbonate dissolution, primary porosity in the overlying volcanic rocks and secondary porosity produced during syn-volcanic faulting. A hybrid model for mineralization is suggested by alteration styles, metal zoning and textures indicating replacement of carbonate rock or highly porous pumice breccia by pyritic massive sulphide. Aspects of a sub-seafloor volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) system and carbonate replacement are both present. Partly Zn-Pb-(Ag) mineralized skarns comprise a separate and subordinate type of mineralization, probably formed after burial of the hydrothermal system to the contact-metasomatic regime. Textures and microstructures in the massive sulphide mineralization indicate that the ductile deformation and metamorphism resulted in internal mechanical and chemical remobilization of sulphide minerals. Laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis of the main sulphide minerals suggests, for example, that trace elements (including Au) were liberated from pyrite during metamorphism. A system of auriferous quartz veins, affected by D 2 ductile strain, occurs in intensely altered and mineralized rocks on the eastern side of the deposit. It is suggested that they formed after the peak of metamorphism and prior to the completion of the D 2 tectonic event, as a result of fluid-assisted remobilization of sulphides and Au in the disseminated to semi-massive Cu-Au mineralization and possibly also the massive sulphide mineralization.

The lithostratigraphic succession established from field mapping records {{a long history}} of sedimentation in different portions of the central Tethyan domain from Late Triassic to mid-Cretaceous time. These rocks are preserved within a south-verging imbricate thrust stack of thin (≪ 1 km thick) northward younging tectonic slices. Five <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> were mapped in the terrane and these units are assigned to two distinct tracts. The northern tract, which accumulated {{on the north side of}} Neotethys, was probably separated from its southern counterpart by a mid-ocean ridge. Detailed radiolarian biostratigraphy is used to constrain the timing of depositional events within each tract. Oceanic plate stratigraphy of the northern tract records its northward travel and mid-Cretaceous (late Aptian) approach towards a south-facing intra-oceanic subduction zone. Rocks in the southern tract developed closer to the Indian subcontinent and experienced thermotectonic subsidence and Mid-Jurassic basic alkaline intraplate magmatism. They were probably accreted late in the Cretaceous. Variations in structural style across the terrane indicate deformation at different depths and vertical growth of the wedge rather than lateral accretion.

40|$|The {{contact zone}} between two major {{allochthonous}} <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> in the French Massif Central (FMC) {{is characterized by}} the presence of corundum-bearing amphibolites associated with serpentinites, flaser-gabbros, eclogites and granulites. These unusual amphibolites are best preserved in the Western FMC, where they are found within the lower oceanic crust of the Limousin ophiolite. Mineralogical observations and thermodynamic modelling of the spinel-corundum-sapphirine-kyanite amphibolites in the CMASH system show that they were formed at peak P-T conditions around 800 °C/ 10 kbar in response to near isothermal burial followed by a retrogressive anticlockwise path. Metamorphic reactions are controlled both by modification of P-T conditions and by local chemical changes linked to fluid infiltration. Pargasite growth has been enhanced by infiltration of Ca- and Al-rich fluids whereas kyanite- and sapphirine-forming reactions are partly controlled by local inputs of MgO-SiO 2 components, most probably during infiltration metasomatism. By analogy with worldwide ophiolites (Oman, Tethyan, Appalachian) and published numerical models, subduction of a still-hot oceanic ridge is proposed to form these Al-rich amphibolites from plagioclase-rich troctolites. The trace-element composition of high-Ti, fine-grained amphibolites (former fine-grained Fe-Ti gabbros) adjacent to the corundum-bearing ones, further indicates that the oceanic crust was initially created at a mid-ocean ridge (rather than within a back-arc basin), followed by the emplacement of supra-subduction zone-type magmas, probably due to intraoceanic subduction close to the ridge. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In the field, granodiorite of Yili are intrudes in greenschist facies metamorphic rocks cutting foliations of greenschists. Zircon U-Pb LA-ICPMS dating yields 341 +/- 6 Ma and 338 +/- 8 Ma for K-granite from Kekesu River, and 313 +/- 4 Ma for biotite-bearing granodiorite from Qiongkushitai, respectively. Biotite from granodiorite yields a Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 plateau age at 263. 4 +/- 0. 6 Ma, revealing an important thermal overprint in Permian. Geochemistry of granodiorite indicates that it belongs to calc-alkaline series, with significant low compositions in Nb and Ta, and enrichment in Rb, Ba and Th. These features are consitent with the geochemical components of are-type magmatic rocks. Taking into account the previous results on HP metamorphic and magmatic rocks in west Tianshan areas, this paper proposes that the subduction-collision events in southwestern Chinese Tianshan occurred before Late Carboniferous, post-collisional ductile strike-slip faulting confirms that the collisional orogenic processes ended in Permian for the southwestern Chinese Tianshan belts...|$|R

The structurally lowest unit, immediately in the hanging wall of the Main Central Thrust (MCT) records an inverted metamorphic sequence with kyanite-grade rocks overlain by rocks containing sillimanite. Pressure-temperature-deformation histories of the different units since Himalayan collision 50 Ma ago, in combination with geochemical data, indicates that the 'apparent' metamorphic inversion {{is a result of the}} tectonic juxtaposition along high-temperature shear zones that accommodated top-to-southwest thrusting. It is also argued that the contacts between different sillimanite-grade units are also tectonic in origin and that the HHCS in the Langtang Valley does not represent a structurally undisturbed section through the crust. Internally the different units contain minor extensional and thrust faults which at the same structural level developed at similar metamorphic conditions. Deformation along the high temperature shear zones of the HHCS are coeval with the earliest of these minor fault zones at the lowest structural levels. With time, this deformation migrated upwards and minor faulting within the upper levels of the HHCS took place at chlorite-grade. These minor fault zones are interpreted to be the result of dynamic spreading of the developing orogenic wedge associated with changes in the geometry of this wedge due to underplating and accretion of material to the base of the metamorphic pile. © 1993 The Geological Society...|$|R

A pluridisciplinary approach, using geochronological, geochemical, structural and palaeomagnetictools was carried out to unravel the architecture {{and the evolution of}} West Junggar (Northwestern China), a segmentof the Altaid Collage. A polycyclic geodynamic evolution is inferred and includes: (1) an Early Palaeozoic cycle, characterizedby the closure of two oceanic basins bounded by island-arc systems; (2) an Early Devonian subduction jamming resulting in aminor-scale collision documented by thrusting, syntectonic sedimentation and subsequent crutal thinning associated with alkalinemagmatism; (3) a Late Palaeozoic cycle, driven by the evolution of two opposite subduction zones developed upon theEarly Palaeozoic basement. Detailed structural analysis and paleomagnetic data provide constraints for the late evolution ofJunggar in the frame of the development of the Late Palaeozoic Kazakh orocline, which led to oblique subduction and transpressionin the West Junggar accretionary complex. Progressive buckling of the Kazakh orocline further resulted in Late Carboniferousto Permian wrench tectonics, and lateral displacement of <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units.</b> Block rotations that continued after theLate Triassic are due to diachronous intraplate reactivation.

Six <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> are distinguished: 1) the Variscan granitic rocks and migmatites. 2) the Palaeozoic supracrustal rocks and dismembered meta-ophiolites, 3) the blastomylonitic graben between Malpica and Tuy, 4) the Lalin and Forcarey Units, 5) the Ordenes basin and its mesocatazonal peripheral belt, 6) the predominantly mafic-ultramafic catazonal complex at Cabo Ortegal. The supracrustal history of western Galicia in late Precambrian and early Palaeozoic times, as inferred from neighbouring areas, is briefly outlined and is compared with the igneous, tectonic and metamorphic evolution of the upper mantle and lower crustal rocks contained in the polymetamorphic basement complexes (1 — 4), which have sustained high-pressure and high-temperature metamorphism under a flow-folding regime prior to the Variscan orogeny. Several models proposed {{for the development of the}} basement complexes in the northern Hesperian Massif are briefly discussed. It is considered most likely that an early Palaeozoic rift system caused by mantle plume diapirism, and accompanied by deepseated thermal metamorphism, lower crustal recycling, updoming of the crust and incipient sea floor spreading, was closely followed by Variscan low-pressure metamorphism, migmatization and granite emplacement under an intermittently compressive and dilatational tectonic regime. Finally, the probability of a Precambrian orogenic crust in western Galicia is briefly explored...|$|R

Monazite grains in biotite–sillimanite gneiss in the hanging wall yield LA-ICP-MS U–Pb ages of 16 ± 0. 2 to 12. 7 ± 0. 4 Ma. A schistose gneiss within the high strain zone yields overlapping-to-younger monazite ages of 14. 9 ± 0. 3 to 11. 5 ± 0. 3 Ma. Garnet–staurolite–mica schists in the immediate footwall yield older monazite ages of 27. 3 ± 0. 6 to 17. 1 ± 0. 2 Ma. Temperature estimates from Ti-in-biotite and garnet–biotite thermometry suggest similar peak temperatures were achieved in the hanging and footwalls (~ 525 – 650 °C).

The Lushan massif consists of two main <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> separated by a major tectonic contact: a Neoproterozoic (upper Sinian) -Paleozoic unit comprising primarily unmetamorphosed sandstones overlies a Paleoproterozoic unit mainly composed of low-pressure, high-temperature gneisses and micaschists. Both units are cut by Cretaceous granitic intrusions. Three primary tectono-metamorphic and magmatic events are recognized. The {{eastern part of the}} Lushan massif is cut by a NNE-SSW trending ductile normal fault (D 3 deformation) coeval to the emplacement of a 100 - 110 Ma leucogranite dated by 40 Ar/ 39 Ar laserprobe on biotite and muscovite. D 2 deformation is responsible for the formation of a decakilometer-scale NE-SW trending upright anticline characterized by NE-SW stretching and NW-SE shortening. The age of this folding event is defined by a 127 ± 1 (2 σ) Ma U/Pb titanite date obtained for a syntectonic granodiorite and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of 133 Ma for amphibole. This Cretaceous age also corresponds to the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of 126 Ma found on syntectonic muscovites {{at the base of the}} Sinian unit. An older deformation event, D 1, characterized by a top-to-the-NW extensional decollement of the Sinian-Paleozoic series above Proterozoic metamorphic rocks is related to the Triassic tectonics of the Dabieshan. Lastly, in the lower part of Sinian rocks, the occurrence of kyanite cataclased during D 1 documents an older, poorly preserved, late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic tectonometamorphic event (Dx) related to a blind thrust in the continental crust of the South China Block in the southern foreland of the Dabieshan...|$|R

The structures in the SMZ {{are the result of}} progressive deformation, inferred to have initiated under low-grade metamorphic conditions (D₁) and evolved through prograde to peak metamorphism (D₂), ending in relatively low-temperature retrograde conditions (D₃). Each of the deformation phases is characterised by a foliation. D₁ is associated With pure shear dominated layer-parallel extension characterised by disrupted lithological layering and hedding-parallel foliation S₀+₁. D₃ is deﬁned as deformation related to the formation of an axial-planar S₂ caused by folding of S₀+₁ around F₂ hinge lines. Widespread isoclinal recumbent folding resulted in transposition of these fahrics and the general foliation is thus termed S₀+₁+₂. This composite foliation contains a down-dip stretching lineation L₂. Folding was contemporaneous With top-to-the-SE directed thrusting in D₂ faults and shear zones that are seen to displace D₁ fabric. Fold hinge lines parallel to L₂ suggest D₂ is characterised by non-ideal simple shear. D₃ is deﬁned by a crenulation cleavage S₃, at near right angles to S₀+₁+₂ foliation resulting from NW-SE pure shear shortening. This phase of deformation is also associated with retrograde, reverse faulting that is localised along some of the D₂ shear zones...|$|R
40|$|The Bayankhongor {{ophiolite}} {{marks the}} closure of an ocean separating two microcontinents: the Baidrag complex with the Burd Gol accretionary complex to the south, and a northern continent which forms the basement for the Hangai region. Subduction was towards the SW with NE-directed ophiolite obduction onto a passive margin represented by the Dzag zone. Geochemical and Nd isotope studies of the ophiolitic rocks suggest that they were derived from a heterogeneous mantle source composed of a depleted N-MORB and enriched E-MORB component. A model for the tectonic setting of the ophiolitic rocks is presented in which the N-MORB rocks represent melts produced at a mid-ocean ridge, whilst the E-MORB rocks represent off-axis flows or melts produced at transform ridge intersections. Basalts from the Delb Khairkhan melange have island arc-like chemistry and provide evidence that the ophiolite may have been trapped within a supra-subduction setting prior to obduction. New 207 Pb/ 206 Pb zircon evaporation ages for granites and rhyolite dykes that intrude the ophiolite and its neighbouring <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units,</b> suggest that the ophiolite was obducted at c. 540 Ma {{at the beginning of}} a collisional event that lasted until c. 450 Ma.

These data record oceanic crust formation at c. 570 Ma, followed by approximately 30 million years of subduction-accretion that culminated in obduction of ophiolites, collision related metamorphism, and magmatism in the period c. 540 - 450 Ma. Correlation of isotopic-age data for the ophiolites of western Mongolia and southern Tuva suggest that the ophiolites define a major collisional suture in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt which helps define the southern and western margins of the Hangai continental block...|$|R

The Shuangxiwu Group is composed mainly of basalt, andesite and flysch, whereas the Chencai Complex contains magmatic and sedimentary rocks that experienced amphibolite facies metamorphism. Zircons from quartz diorite and gabbro from the fault zone at Shijiao yield ages of 854 ± 6 Ma, 857 ± 5 Ma and 860 ± 5 Ma, with positive ɛHf(t) values of 7. 81 ∼ 11. 8 and 4. 57 ∼ 10. 39. The quartz diorite and mafic-ultramafic rock samples display minor LREE enriched pattern with obvious depletion of Nb, Ta, Rb, Ba and Ti, compared to their neighboring elements and plot in the volcanic arc field on geochemical diagrams, similar to that of volcanic rocks from Shuangxiwu Group. Overall relationships within the Jiangshan-Shaoxing fault zone at Shijiao suggest the ca. 860 - 850 Ma rock suites were generated in a convergent plate margin and are part of the Jiangnan belt, and not the Cathaysia Block, thus constraining the location of the suture between the two <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> in NE Zhejiang area during Neoproterozoic.

40|$|The Grenville Province {{of eastern}} Canada {{consists}} {{of a variety of}} <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> (terranes) which formed a large mountain chain along the margin of Laurentia at 1190 - 1000 Ma. The deepest crustal levels of the Grenvillian orogen are best exposed along a belt of high-PT terranes which form part of the parautochthonous belt. The best exposed section is the Manicouagan Imbricate Zone which contains rocks metamorphosed at conditions up to eclogite facies. The Tshenukutish terrane is the highest structural division of the Manicouagan Imbricate Zone and contains mafic and ultramafic rocks which characterise two distinct <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units.</b> The structurally lower unit, the Baie du Nord segment, comprises granitic and dioritic country rocks intruded by Fe-Ti gabbro and anorthosite. The highest structural units in the Tshenukutish terrane belong to the Boundary zone, a complex series of tectonic slices, which include lenses of mafic and ultramafic rocks known as the Lac Espadon suite. Cumulate textures suggest that the Lac Espadon suite represents a layered, mafic and ultramafic complex. Geochemical analysis of the gabbroic end-members from both the Lac Espadon suite and the Baie du Nord segment indicate a within-plate tholeiite petrotectonic signature. REE-patterns of the gabbroic rocks and associated cumulates further suggest fractionation from a tholeiitic source and high-crustal level emplacement U-Pb dating of igneous baddcleyite gives an age of 1170 +/- 5 Ma for emplacement of Fe-Ti gabbro in the Baie du Nord segment. In the Lac Espadon suite, U-Pb ages of igneous zircon and baddeleyite (ca. 1650 - 1630 Ma) suggest a Labradorian age of emplacement The ages of zircon formed during anatexis (1046 +/- 3 Ma) and other metamorphic zircon ages (1042 + 22 /- 28 Ma, 1030 + 10 /- 7 Ma, 1030 +/- 12 Ma, 1012 +/- 12 Ma) show the timing of high-PT metamorphic overprint to be Grenvillian in age. The timing of retrogression and cooling is constrained by the ages of titanite (1006 - 997 Ma) and rutile (960 - 929 Ma). The Fe-Ti gabbroic rocks from the Baie du Nord segment display mineral assemblages which represent progressive stages of metamorphic transformation resulting in the formation of coronas, granoblastic pseudomorphs (transitional) and eclogites. In addition, the transitional and eclogitic samples exhibit coronas developed locally around igneous xenocrysts. Maximum T-conditions recorded in the Baie du Nord segment are in the range 720 - 820 °C with recorded P-conditions reflecting increasing eclogitization (14 kbar in coronitic rocks and up to 17 kbar in eclogitic rocks). Estimates of peak PT-conditions recorded by massive corona-bearing rocks in the Lac Espadon suite are in die range 780 - 930 °C at 16 - 19 kbar. Reequilibration during the early stages of exhumation at high T-conditions (> 700 °C) variably affected all samples in the Tshenukutish terrane. The PT-conditions recorded during retrogression (ca. 700 - 800 °C and 8 - 12 kbar) define segments of steep PT-paths and isothermal metamorphic (field) gradients, suggesting high heat flow through the lower crust. The presence of syn-metamorphic mafic dykes and granites further suggest heat input (including from the mantle) during exhumation. The rates of cooling and exhumation in the Manicouagan Imbricate Zone were modelled using all the available PT-data and U-Pb ages for zircon, monazite, titanite and rutile. The results indicate that the early stages of exhumation were charecterized by near isothermal conditions. Uplift rates were relatively fast (> 1 mm/yr) consistent with tectonic exhumation. Rates subsequently slowed, probably during thrust emplacement of the highest structural levels (the Boundary zone) over the rest of the Tshenukutish terrane. Differences between titanite and rutile cooling ages suggest that late-stage cooling and exhumation was slow, consistent with other high-P terranes. The PTt-evolution of the Tshenukutish terrane is compatible with models for tectonic exhumation by extrusion during northwest thrusting, with extension on top of the pile. Evidence for high heat flow and rapid uplift during the initial exhumation in the Manicouagan Imbricate Zone supports current models which suggest that asthenospheric upwelling immediately followed extensional collapse of the Grenville orogen...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{structural}} and petrochronological study {{was carried out}} {{in the southern part of}} the Belledonne crystalline massif. A first tectonometamorphic event, Dx, corresponds to the eastward thrusting of the Chamrousse ophiolitic complex characterized by a low-temperature–moderate-pressure metamorphism reaching 0. 535  ±  0. 045  GPa and 427. 5  ±  17. 5  °C. A subsequent D 1 deformation is defined by a penetrative S 1 foliation that mostly dips toward the west and displays an E–W- to NE–SW-trending mineral and stretching lineation L 1. D 1 is associated with a top-to-the east shearing and is responsible for the crustal thickening accommodated by the eastward nappe stacking and the emplacement of the Chamrousse ophiolitic complex upon the Rioupéroux-Livet unit. This event is characterized by an amphibolite facies metamorphism (0. 58  GPa ±  0. 06; 608  ±  14  °C) that attains partial melting at the base of the nappe pile (0. 78  ±  0. 07  GPa; 680. 5  ±  11. 5  °C). LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of monazite grains from the mica schists of the Rioupéroux-Livet unit constrain the age of D 1 to 337  ±  7  Ma. The D 2 tectono-metamorphic event is characterized by NE–SW trending, upright to NE-verging synfolial folding. Folding associated with D 2 is pervasively developed in all <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> with the development of a steeply-dipping S 2 foliation. In particular, D 2 involves the uppermost weakly metamorphosed Taillefer unit. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating performed on detrital zircon grains shows that the Taillefer conglomerates was deposited during the Visean. A zircon SIMS U-Pb age of 352  ±  1  Ma from a plagioglase-rich leucocratic sill of the Rioupéroux-Livet unit is interpreted as the age of magmatic emplacement. Our results suggest that the D 2 event took place between 330  Ma and 310  Ma. We propose a new interpretation of the tectonometamorphic evolution of the southern part of the Belledonne massif, focusing on the Middle Carboniferous stages of the Variscan orogeny...|$|R
40|$|In {{northern}} British Columbia, the Sylvester Allochthon of the Slide Mountain terrane is {{the most}} inboard of Cordilleran suspect terranes, resting as a vast klippe upon miogeoclinal strata of the Cassiar Platform. The Sylvester is oceanic; it comprises gabbro, pillowed and massive basalt, banded chert, carbonate, argillite, ultramafics and minor arenite, which {{range in age from}} Late Devonian to Late Triassic. Internal structure in the Sylvester Allochthon is characterized as a stack of innumerable interleaved tectonic slices, bounded by subhorizontal, layer-parallel faults. These <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units</b> are an order of magnitude smaller than the terrane itself and may consist of only a single or a few repeated rock types. The internal structure of the Sylvester is complex but not chaotic; small numbers of slices occur together in larger second-order packages which are also fault-bounded and lensoidal. However, tectonic juxtaposition of unrelated lithologies and older-over-younger faults are common. The "stratigraphy" of the Sylvester assemblage is thus tectonic. Sliver-bounding faulting within the Sylvester is known to have, at least in part, predated its post-Triassic, pre-mid Cretaceous emplacement. The Sylvester was emplaced onto North America as the roof thrust to a foreland-style duplex within underlying North American strata. vii viii The Sylvester Allochthon {{is the most}} inboard of accreted terranes, however it does not represent a simple marginal basin. New microfossil dating demonstrates that most rock types occur through the complete range of Sylvester ages. Coeval but depositionally incompatable lithologies must have accumulated in separate ocean floor paleoenvironments. Lithologies of the allochthon derive almost exclusively from layer 1, only the surface of oceanic crust. Thus, Sylvester slices are telescoped remnants detached from a vast area of ocean crust which ranged in age and width through the upper Paleozoic but which is now otherwise entirely consumed. Similarities of rock type, internal structure, age range, and regional tectonic setting have identified the Sylvester Allochthon as broadly correlative with a discontinuous series of terranes extending the length of the Cordillera. Together, these terranes may represent the remnants of what was once the late Paleozoic proto-Pacific ocean floor...|$|R
40|$|The western Jurassic belt of the Klamath Mountains {{represents}} one of the Earth's best-preserved exposures of ancient marginal ocean basin lithosphere and chiefly consists of the coeval Rogue–Chetco volcanic-plutonic oceanic arc and Josephine ophiolite. This Late Jurassic ocean basin is hypothesized to have formed in response to rifting that initiated at ca. 165 Ma along the western margin of North America, disrupting a Middle Jurassic arc that had been constructed on older Klamath terranes and forming a marginal ocean basin with an active arc, inter-arc basin, and remnant arc. Previous workers characterized a “rift-edge” facies in the remnant-arc region. This chapter describes field, age, and geochemical data that suggest that a similar rift-edge facies exists {{in the vicinity of the}} active arc, on the opposite side of the marginal basin. The rift-edge facies in the active arc setting consists of two main <b>lithotectonic</b> <b>units,</b> herein named informally as the Onion Camp complex and Fiddler Mountain olistostrome. The Onion Camp complex is partly composed of a characteristic metabasalt and red chert association. Red chert yielded scarce radiolarians of Triassic(?) and Early Jurassic age. A distinct chert-pebble conglomerate occurs at scarce localities within metasedimentary rocks. Concordant, composite bodies of amphibolite and serpentinized peridotite represent another distinctive feature of the Onion Camp complex. The metamorphic and lithologic features of the Onion Camp complex are similar to the lower mélange unit of the Rattlesnake Creek terrane, and the units are interpreted to be correlative. The Fiddler Mountain olistostrome is composed of Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian?) pelagic and hemipelagic rocks interlayered with ophiolite-clast breccia and megabreccia, similar in character to olistostromal deposits associated with the rift-edge facies of the remnant arc. The occurrence of the Rattlesnake Creek terrane and an associated olistostromal deposit within the western Jurassic belt of southwestern Oregon may therefore represent the rift-edge facies in the active arc setting, at the transition between the Rogue–Chetco arc and Josephine ophiolite, further corroborating previous models for the Late Jurassic tectonic evolution of the Klamath Mountains...|$|R
