Avoidance of confounding influences required exclusion of individuals with osteoporotic compression fractures. Specimens with sacralization of the fifth lumbar vertebra or <b>lumbalization</b> of the first sacral vertebra were also excluded.|$|E
40|$|We present {{here the}} case of a 12 -year-old boy who had Klippel-Feil {{syndrome}} with renal, cardiac and multiple skeletal anomalies, and we show the relevent three-dimensional computed tomography images. Our patient had a triple renal pelvis, mitral valve prolapsus, multiple cervical vertebrae fusions, cervical ribs, hypoplasia of the right thumb, spina bifida of L 5, <b>lumbalization</b> at the right side of S 1 and a sacral curved defect. In this study, we discuss the atypical clinical features and the diagnostic value of three-dimensional CT for evaluating the skeletal anomalies of the Klippel-Feil syndrome cases...|$|E

In this study, we discuss the atypical clinical fea-tures and the diagnostic value of three-dimensional CT for evaluating the skeletal anomalies of the Klippel-Feil syndrome cases. lippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) was first reported by Klippel and Feil in 1912 (1, 2), This is a complex disorder that is mainly characterized by congeni-tal fusion of the cervical vertebrae with a short neck, limitation of the movement of the head or neck and a low posterior hairline in less than 50 % of such patients. Its incidence is estimated as 1 : 40, 000 42, 000 (2). Klippel-Feil syndrome includes multiple system anomalies such as scoliosis, renal anomalies, Sprengelâ€™s deformity, deafness and congenital heart disease (1, 2). In th...|$|E
