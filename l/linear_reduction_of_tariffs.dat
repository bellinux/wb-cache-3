30|$|Trade {{liberalization}} is {{in general}} terms the elimination or <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> barriers to free trade in goods between nations.

40|$|Trade {{liberalisation}} by <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> or {{the removal}} of non-tariff barriers including Quantitative Restrictions will have impact on the economy mainly through the influence on commodity prices. Imposition or <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> will affect the relative commodity prices ie, price {{of each of the}} commodity in terms of other commodities. This relative change in prices can be for commodities belonging to the same sector like industry or agriculture or fisheries or between categories of commodities, for e. g., agricultural in terms of non-agricultural. The changes in relative prices will in turn have its influence on the relative profitability of taking up different enterprises, which will result in changes in enterprise combinations. Different enterprises will have different input use intensities or factor combinations and at times, the increased profitability of taking up some of these enterprises would make the entrepreneurs to overuse inputs like pesticides and fertilizers, or even over exploit the resources which in turn will have environmental as well as sustainability implications...|$|R
