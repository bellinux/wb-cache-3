On 28 February 1954, the XF-104 made a planned hop of about five ft off the ground during a {{high-speed}} taxi, but its first official flight took place on 4 March. During that flight, the landing gear did not retract, and <b>LeVier</b> landed after a low-speed flight of about 20 minutes. Adjustments and further flights discovered that the problem was low pressure in the hydraulic system. Bad weather kept the XF-104 on the ground until 26 March, when further flights were carried out with the landing gear retracting normally.|$|E
5|$|XF-104 53-7786 {{was lost}} in a crash on 11July1957 when it {{developed}} an uncontrollable fin flutter while flying chase for F-104A flight tests. The entire tail group was ripped from the airframe, and Lockheed test pilot Bill Park was forced to eject. Fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds {{of no more than}} Mach0.95 {{at the time of the}} accident. Tony <b>LeVier</b> had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status and placed in a museum, arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties.|$|E
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony <b>LeVier</b> immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lévy</b> {{processes}} and infinitely divisible distributions are increasingly {{defined in terms}} of their <b>Lévy</b> measure. In order to describe the dependence structure of a multivariate <b>Lévy</b> measure, Tankov (2003) introduced <b>Lévy</b> copulas on. (For an extension to R -super- ""m"", see Kallsen & Tankov, 2006.) Together with the marginal <b>Lévy</b> measures they completely describe multivariate <b>Lévy</b> measures on. In this article we show that any such <b>Lévy</b> copula defines itself a <b>Lévy</b> measure with one-stable margins, in a canonical way. A limit theorem is obtained, characterizing convergence of <b>Lévy</b> measures with the aid of <b>Lévy</b> copulas. Homogeneous <b>Lévy</b> copulas are considered in detail. They correspond to <b>Lévy</b> processes which have a time-constant <b>Lévy</b> copula, and a complete description of homogeneous <b>Lévy</b> copulas is obtained. A general scheme to construct multivariate distributions having special properties is outlined, for distributions with prescribed margins having the same properties. This makes use of <b>Lévy</b> copulas and of certain mappings of Upsilon type. The construction is then exemplified for distributions in the Goldie-Steutel-Bondesson class, the Thorin class and for self-decomposable distributions.
