The company is {{currently}} seeking out foreign partners either from Russia or Europe's Airbus Helicopters, {{with which the}} company has ambitions of developing the MLH and for producing around 350 medium lift helicopters.

50|$|Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures, or ATIRCM, is {{the most}} recent attempt at an {{infrared}} countermeasures capability. The Army began fielding the ATIRCM Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) system on 83 CH-47s supporting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2009. The USD(AT&L) limited the ATIRCM QRC program to these specific aircraft, due to the current combined weight of the ATIRCM/CMWS suite. DoD planners set the CIRCM target weight at 85 pounds for the jamming B-kit with two turrets, while the supporting A-kit is capped at 70 pounds for <b>large</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> like the Chinook and V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, or 35 pounds for smaller helicopters like the Black Hawk.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Army Heavy Lift Helicopter (HLH) {{represents}} a <b>large</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> which {{was developed by}} an American aerospace company. In the early 1970 's with the HLH Advanced Technology Components (ATC) program, the development of <b>large</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> transmission and drive systems was started. Failures in the spiral bevel gearing were experienced in tests because the employed method of analysis had not considered the effect of rim bending. Consequently, new gears with strengthened rims were designed and fabricated. For a more accurate prediction of the load capacity of the gears, an extensive Finite Element Method (FEM) system was developed. The U. S. Army's XCH- 62 HLH aft rotor transmission was finally successfully tested at full design torque and speed. A description of the test program is provided, and the analytical program is discussed. The analytical phase includes {{the development of a}} preprocessing program which aids in the review of calculated FEM stresses...|$|E

Only some of these <b>larger</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> have provisions for carrying ground crews, therefore may not always considered [...] "helitack" [...] aircraft in the true sense of the word. Some Type I rotorcraft, such as the Boeing 234, can carry up to 44 passengers in proper configuration.|$|R
50|$|The XR-10 {{resembled a}} scaled-up XR-8, {{although}} its twin engines were carried in nacelles at the fuselage sides, driving the rotors via long driveshafts, and the aircraft was skinned entirely in metal. The {{first of two}} prototypes flew on 24 April 1947, and at the time, was the <b>largest</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> to fly in the United States. During test-flights, however, the same problem that had been encountered with the XR-8's rotor system emerged when blades from the two rotors collided in flight. With fixes in place, flight testing continued, but on 3 October 1949, the first prototype crashed due to a control system failure and killed Kellett's chief test pilot, Dave Driskill. The project was abandoned shortly thereafter, and a 16-seat civil variant, the KH-2, never left the drawing board.|$|R
40|$|Looking at {{performance}} {{prediction of}} small coaxial rotorcraft, {{it was found}} that there are no fast methods available for designers. This research was aimed at using a blade element method in combination with the momentum theory to quickly predict the performance at small coaxial rotorcraft. These methods are successfully applied in <b>larger</b> <b>rotorcraft.</b> It will therefore be of interest to see how these methods perform when the aerodynamics changes due to scaling. Especially the Reynolds number effects are expected to influence and potentially limit the application of the modelling methods. The new developed model was tested on the full-scale Kamov 32 helicopter as well as two small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. These are the commercial available Walkera Lama and the Guardian Angle, which was developed by undergraduate students during a design synthesis exercise. The results show a successful implementation of the calculation methods, with some interesting insight in the limits imposed by them...|$|R

40|$|According to {{a number}} of system studies, large {{capacity}} advanced rotorcraft with a capability of high cruise speeds (approx. 350 mph) as well as vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) flight could alleviate anticipated air transportation capacity issues by making use of non-primary runways, taxiways, and aprons. These advanced aircraft pose a number of design challenges, as well as unknown issues in the flight control and handling qualities domains. A series of piloted simulation experiments have been conducted on the NASA Ames Research Center Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) in recent years to systematically investigate the fundamental flight control and handling qualities issues associated with the characteristics of <b>large</b> <b>rotorcraft,</b> including tiltrotors, in hover and low-speed maneuvering...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} using the comprehensive analysis CAMRAD II to explore performance enhancements to <b>large</b> <b>rotorcraft.</b> The aircraft considered were a 125 foot diameter six-bladed rotor helicopter and an 85 foot diameter four-bladed rotor tilt rotor. The objectives were to reduce power required and increase maximum lift. The effects of improved airfoils and active controls were investigated. Airfoils with higher maximum lift and with reduced drag were investigated. Results showed a moderate improvement in the maximum lift capability for the helicopter and a large improvement for the tilt rotor. For the helicopter, 2 /rev individual blade control resulted in modest power savings in cruise flight, which increased with control amplitude and forward speed. The optimum phase for the individual blade control was relatively insensitive to both amplitude and forward speed. The influences of active twist, increased chord, increments in airfoil properties, and tilt rotor tip extensions were also investigated...|$|E

According to Wood, it held {{the distinction of being}} [...] "the largest transport helicopter of its day".

50|$|During the 1980s, Bruno Guimbal, {{while working}} at Eurocopter upon the Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin and Eurocopter EC120 Colibri helicopters, decided to {{independently}} pursue {{the development of a}} two-seat piston engine helicopter. This rotorcraft would incorporate numerous safety-related and general technological advances commonly applied to <b>larger</b> turbine-powered <b>rotorcraft,</b> but typically absent from piston-engine helicopters. These technologies included Eurocopter's Fenestron anti-torque shrouded tail rotor and Spheriflex main rotor, in addition to a composite fuselage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Successful {{operation}} of a miniature rotorcraft re-lies on capabilities including automated guidance, trajectory following, and teleoperation; all of which require accurate estimates of the vehicle’s body velocities and Euler angles. For <b>larger</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> that operate outdoors, the traditional approach is to combine a highly accurate IMU with GPS measurements. However, for small scale rotorcraft that op-erate indoors, lower quality MEMS IMUs are used because of limited payload. In indoor applications GPS is usually not available, and state estimates based on IMU measurements drift over time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for state estimation that combines a dynamic flight model, IMU measurements, and 3 D velocity estimates computed from an onboard monocular camera using computer vision. Our work differs from existing approaches in that, rather than using a single vision algorithm to update the vehicle’s state, we capitalize on the strengths of multiple vision al-gorithms by integrating them into a meta-algorithm for 3 D motion estimation. Experiments are conducted on two real helicopter platforms in a laboratory environment for differ-ent motion types to demonstrate and evaluate the effective-ness of our approach...|$|R
40|$|Foil gas {{bearings}} {{under development}} for rotorcraft-sized, hot core engine applications have been susceptible to {{damage from the}} slow acceleration and rates typically encountered during the pre-ignition stage in conventional engines. Recent laboratory failures have been assumed to be directly linked to operating foil bearings below their lift-off speed while following conventional startup procedures for the engines. In each instance, the continuous sliding contact between the foils and shaft was believed to thermally overload the bearing and cause the engines to fail. These failures highlight the need to characterize required acceleration rates and minimum operating speeds for these applications. In this report, startup experiments were conducted with a <b>large,</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> engine sized foil bearing under moderate load and acceleration rates to identify the proper start procedures needed to avoid bearing failure. The results showed that a bearing under a 39. 4 kPa static load can withstand a modest acceleration rate of 500 rpm/s and excessive loitering below the bearing lift-off speed provided an adequate solid lubricant is present...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{rotorcraft}} configurations {{are being}} investigated with {{the objectives of}} identifying vehicles that are larger, quieter, and faster than current-generation rotorcraft. A <b>large</b> <b>rotorcraft,</b> carrying perhaps 150 passengers, could do much to alleviate airport capacity limitations, and a quiet rotorcraft is essential for community acceptance {{of the benefits of}} VTOL operations. A fast, long-range, long-endurance rotorcraft, notably the tilt-rotor configuration, will improve rotorcraft economics through productivity increases. A major part of the investigation of advanced rotorcraft configurations consists of conducting comprehensive analyses of vehicle behavior for the purpose of assessing vehicle potential and feasibility, as well as to establish the analytical models required to support the vehicle development. The analytical work of FY 99 included applications to tilt-rotor aircraft. Tilt Rotor Aeroacoustic Model (TRAM) wind tunnel measurements are being compared with calculations performed by using the comprehensive analysis tool (Comprehensive Analytical Model of Rotorcraft Aerodynamics and Dynamics (CAMRAD 11)). The objective is to establish the wing and wake aerodynamic models that are required for tilt-rotor analysis and design. The TRAM test in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW) produced extensive measurements. This is the first test to encompass air loads, performance, and structural load measurements on tilt rotors, as well as acoustic and flow visualization data. The correlation of measurements and calculations includes helicopter-mode operation (performance, air loads, and blade structural loads), hover (performance and air loads), and airplane-mode operation (performance) ...|$|E
40|$|Summaries of rotor {{performance}} are presented for a 124, 000 -lb Large Civil Tilt Rotor (LCTR) design, along with isolated-rotor and fully-coupled wing/rotor aeroelastic stability. A major motivation {{of the present}} research {{is the effect of}} size on rotor dynamics. Simply scaling up existing rotor designs to the vehicle size under study would result in unacceptable rotor weight. The LCTR was the most promising of several <b>large</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> concepts produced by the NASA Heavy Lift Rotorcraft Systems Investigation. It was designed to carry 120 passengers for 1200 nm, with performance of 350 knots at 30, 000 ft altitude. Design features included a low-mounted wing and hingeless rotors, with a very low cruise tip speed of 350 ft/sec. The LCTR was sized by the RC code developed by the U. S. Army Aeroflightdynamics Directorate. The rotor was then optimized using the CAMRAD II comprehensive analysis code. The blade and wing structures were designed by Pennsylvania State University to meet the rotor loads calculated by CAMRAD II and wing loads required for certification. Aeroelastic stability was confirmed by further CAMRAD II analysis, based on the optimized rotor and wing designs.

Specifically, prediction methods have been applied to the vibration pattern of rotorcraft drivetrains. This analysis is part or a <b>larger</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) that can diagnose immediate failures of the subsystems, as indicated by abrupt change in the vibration signature, and prognosticate future health, by examining the vibration patterns against long-term trends.

40|$|The {{blades of}} {{helicopters}} are heavily loaded and are critical components. Failure {{of any one}} blade will lead to loss of the aircraft. Currently, the technical lifespan of helicopter blades is calculated using a worst-case operation scenario. The consequence is that a blade that may be suitable for, for example, ten thousand flight hours is discarded after only three thousand hours. The costs associated with this practice are enormous. For heavily loaded military aircraft this practice may be a reasonable approach. On the other hand, light duty aircraft in civil aviation may only use the blades for half or {{one third of the}} total technical lifespan, incurring unnecessarily high costs. Although the blade life could be extended through more advanced materials, extensive inspection regimes and better design, the uncertainty concerning the blade loads and fatigue issues remains. These options are all very costly. Measuring systems are required within the blade in order to more accurately follow the actual loads that it is subjected to. In this manner it is possible to monitor the loads, calculate the actual fatigue within the blade and, finally, the end of life can be predicted far more accurately. This will result in blades being used longer, reducing maintenance costs for the operator and lowering the environmental impact of blade manufacturing. The main challenge is supplying the sensors with electric power. <b>Large</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> have slip rings within the rotor head, supplying power for de-icing systems on {{the leading edge of the}} blade. This power is unsuitable for sensing and data processing because it is high voltage, and is not a stable source of power. Additionally, slip rings are maintenance intensive. The idea proposed in this thesis is to generate the power needed for sensing within the blade itself. Many generation methods are available varying from traditional electromagnetic generators to solid state conversion mechanisms. In this work, piezoelectrics are considered as a candidate to harvest power. Piezoelectric material is a material which develops an electrical charge as it is mechanically stressed. It is shown in this thesis that a useful amount of power can be recovered from the blade when combined with the right electric circuit...|$|E

40|$|A vehicle concept {{study has}} been made to meet the {{requirements}} of the <b>Large</b> Civil Tilt <b>Rotorcraft</b> vehicle mission. A vehicle concept was determined, and a notional turboshaft engine system study was conducted. The engine study defined requirements for the major engine components, including the compressor. The compressor design-point goal was to deliver a pressure ratio of 31 : 1 at an inlet weight flow of 28. 4 lbm/sec. To perform a conceptual design of two potential compressor configurations to meet the design requirement, a mean-line compressor flow analysis and design code were used. The first configuration is an eight-stage axial compressor. Some challenges of the all-axial compressor are the small blade spans of the rear-block stages being 0. 28 in., resulting in the last-stage blade tip clearance-to-span ratio of 2. 4 %. The second configuration is a seven-stage axial compressor, with a centrifugal stage having a 0. 28 -in. impeller-exit blade span. The compressors conceptual designs helped estimate the flow path dimensions, rotor leading and trailing edge blade angles, flow conditions, and velocity triangles for each stage...|$|R
