5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

25|$|According to Catskill forest {{historian}} Michael Kudish, the Slide wilderness {{contains the}} most extensive tract of first-growth forest in the Catskills. Much of the area remained out of reach during the peak years of logging and barkpeeling from eastern hemlock trees, to make tannin for leather production in the mid-19th century and thus remained largely untouched. Indeed, the upper valley of the East Branch of the Neversink, located centrally within the SMWA, is the only completely wild valley in the Catskills. It is possible to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> it from several points on the surrounding mountains and see no evidence of civilization.|$|E

25|$|The Agapemonites, {{who held}} decidedly {{unconventional}} views on {{marriage and the}} role of women, relocated to Upper Clapton from their spiritual community in Spaxton, Somerset, and had clearly prospered by this time. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, the outside of the church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple.

500|$|The Whitebrook is a {{restaurant}} with rooms located [...] south-south-east of Monmouth in Monmouthshire, Wales. It is near the River Wye and the border with England. It is located on a minor road running between Lydart and the A466 road at Bigsweir. The restaurant can seat up to 34 customers, and the kitchen is run by four staff plus Harrod. In addition to the restaurant itself, there are eight double rooms; as of 2016, four had been recently renovated. They each <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> either the adjoining garden or the valley. It had previously operated with a further bedroom under the previous owner. There is also a apartment onsite for {{the manager of the}} premises. The building has an adjoined garden of [...]|$|E
500|$|The New Orleans house {{occupied}} by Delphine LaLaurie {{at the time}} of the 1834 fires stands today at 1140 Royal Street, on the corner of Royal Street and Governor Nicholls Street (formerly known as Hospital Street). At three stories high, it was described in 1928 as [...] "the highest building for squares around", with the result that [...] "from the cupola on the roof one may <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the Vieux Carré and see the Mississippi in its crescent before Jackson Square". [...] The entrance to the building bears iron grillwork, and the door is carved with an image of [...] "Phoebus in his chariot, and with wreaths of flowers and depending garlands in bas-relief". [...] Inside, the vestibule is floored in black and white marble, and a curved mahogany-railed staircase runs the full three stories of the building. [...] The second floor holds three large drawing rooms connected by ornamented sliding doors, whose walls are decorated with plaster rosettes, carved woodwork, black marble mantle pieces and fluted pilasters.|$|E

2500|$|Farren {{continued}} at the Gaiety {{for the next}} 25 years, playing in comedies of all kinds and in Shakespearean dramas, first under Hollingshead and then under George Edwardes, performing the lead in dozens of shows, many also starring Edward Terry, Kate Vaughan, Fred Leslie and E. W. Royce. [...] She was most acclaimed in the [...] "principal boy" [...] roles. These roles permitted the actress to show her legs in tights, and Farren became very popular with the young men of the Gaiety audience, who would wear a coloured scarf to show support for their favourite actress. Farren's colours were dark blue, light blue and white, and she could <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the audience to compare the number of fans displaying her colours {{as compared to the}} colours of the other actresses. According to Hollingshead, Farren developed a [...] "spinal complaint, which troubled her in her early Gaiety career [...] developed into locomotor ataxy" [...] later.|$|E
2500|$|The Gest makes a {{specific}} {{reference to the}} Saylis at Wentbridge. Credit {{is due to the}} nineteenth century antiquarian Joseph Hunter, who correctly identified the site of the Saylis. From this location it was once possible to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the Went Valley and observe the traffic that passed along the Great North Road. The Saylis is recorded as having contributed towards the aid that was granted to Edward III in 1346–47 for the knighting of the Black Prince. An acre of landholding is listed within a glebe terrier of 1688 relating to Kirk Smeaton, which later came to be called [...] "Sailes Close". Professor Dobson and Mr. Taylor indicate that such evidence of continuity makes it virtually certain that the Saylis that was so well known to Robin Hood is preserved today as [...] "Sayles Plantation". It is this location that provides a vital clue to Robin Hood's Yorkshire heritage. One final locality in the forest of Barnsdale that is associated with Robin Hood is the village of Campsall.|$|E

60|$|He {{followed}} them out, {{and they came}} to a large pond outside the farm-house.

60|$|I {{was dressed}} within the ten minutes, and came out.

And sitting thus, the sun rose slowly up and suffused the picture with a world of rich coloring.|$|E
60|$|Virginia drew away, {{and the one}} searching glance {{she gave}} him he did not see.

The day itself was dark and damp. She thought of the supper cooking at home. It would not be eaten now.|$|E

Then he turned, with a shrug of his shoulders and a grunt.|$|E
