50|$|Although it is {{assessed}} as a least concern species by IUCN, the eutrophication of {{the lakes}} in the Subalpine region, {{which began in}} the 1950s and peaked in 1979, badly affected Salvelinus umbla populations, which crashed during that period. The <b>lake</b> <b>char</b> became locally extinct in lakes such as Mondsee and other char species, such as Salvelinus profundus, were driven to extinction in the same period. Currently, however, most <b>lake</b> <b>char</b> populations are gradually recovering.|$|E
50|$|Salvelinus umbla, {{also known}} as <b>lake</b> <b>char,</b> is a species of char found in certain lakes of {{the region of the}} Alps in Europe.|$|E

50|$|The lake {{is home to}} {{numerous}} native species of trout, and other game fish. Catchable species include, {{but are not limited}} to - westslope cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, bull trout (<b>char),</b> <b>lake</b> trout (<b>char),</b> <b>Lake</b> Superior whitefish, mountain whitefish, kokanee salmon (landlocked sockeye), and suckers. However, the lake is nutrient-poor and is not considered a prime fishing destination. Grizzly bears, black bear, moose, and mule deer are found in many places near the lake but are most common on the north shore. The lake is surrounded by a dense coniferous forest dominated by various species of spruce, fir, and larch.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of fish species, {{including}} Rainbow Trout, Sockeye Salmon (Kokanee), <b>Lake</b> Trout (<b>Char),</b> Ptychocheilus (Pikeminnows or Squawfish), Freshwater Whitefish (Whitefish), and Burbot.|$|R
50|$|Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) is a {{freshwater}} char living {{mainly in}} lakes in northern North America. Other names for it include mackinaw, <b>lake</b> <b>char</b> (or charr), touladi, togue, and grey trout. In Lake Superior, {{it can also}} be variously known as siscowet, paperbelly and lean. The lake trout is prized both as a game fish and as a food fish.|$|E
50|$|Being largely {{wild and}} remote, this ecozone {{is rich in}} wildlife, {{including}} woodland caribou, moose, wolf, black bear, raccoon, marten, fisher, striped skunk, lynx, bobcat and eastern chipmunk. Common birds include boreal owl, great horned owl, blue jay, white-throated sparrow and evening grosbeak. <b>Lakes</b> contain brook <b>char,</b> <b>lake</b> trout, northern pike, perch, and walleye.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Lake</b> Neuchâtel {{deepwater}} <b>char</b> (Salvelinus neocomensis) is {{a similar}} fish species that became extinct earlier in another European lake.|$|R
50|$|Lake Yessey (Ессей) {{is a large}} {{freshwater}} lake in Krasnoyarsk Krai, north-central part of Russia. It has an area of 238 km². Many rivers empty to the lake. Lake Yessey is rich in fish. Salvelinus tolmachoffi, {{the endangered}} <b>Lake</b> Yessey <b>Char,</b> {{is found in the}} waters of this lake.|$|R
50|$|Fish in the <b>lake</b> include Arctic <b>char</b> (Seesaibling), <b>lake</b> trout (Kanadische Seeforelle), {{rainbow trout}} (Regenbogenforelle). From January to March, ice fishing is popular.|$|R
50|$|The term is {{also used}} to refer to fish species in the wild (such as <b>lake</b> trout, Arctic <b>char,</b> and Arctic grayling), that prefer colder waters.|$|R
50|$|The four most {{dominant}} fish species within the Montmorency basin are the rainbow trout, <b>lake</b> trout, Arctic <b>char,</b> and especially brook trout. Other species include the longnose sucker, white sucker, slimy sculpin, and pearl dace.|$|R
50|$|Arctic char {{are also}} found in Lake Pingualuit in the Ungava Peninsula, Quebec, a lake {{situated}} in an impact crater formed roughly 1.4 million years ago. Since the last glaciation, changing water levels {{are believed to have}} connected the lake with glacial runoff and surrounding streams and rivers, allowing char to swim upstream into the <b>lake.</b> Arctic <b>char</b> are the only fish found in the lake, and signs of fish cannibalism have been found.|$|R
50|$|There are 33 {{naturally}} occurring fish species in Vårbysfjärden, {{making it the}} richest in fish species in Sweden. Common species include northern pike, perch, roach, rudd, silver bream, carp bream, bleak, European smelt, zander, burbot, tench, and crucian carp. Additionally, there a range of introduced species such as <b>lake</b> trout, <b>char,</b> salmon, and spined loach. The presence of fourhorn sculpins is a reminder from the time when lake Mälaren was a still bay forming part of the Baltic Sea.|$|R
50|$|Surveys {{undertaken}} {{in the last ten}} years failed to find any evidence of the survival of the Lake Constance whitefish, as well as of the <b>Lake</b> Constance Deepwater <b>char</b> (Salvelinus profundus), another similarly endemic fish species driven recently to extinction in that lake.|$|R
25|$|The Lakes of Killarney contain many {{brown trout}} {{and an annual}} run of salmon. Rare species found in the <b>lakes</b> are Arctic <b>char</b> and Killarney shad. The lakes have natural stocks of brown trout and salmon that can be fished, subject only to usual Irish salmon license regulations.|$|R
50|$|A high {{percentage}} (29.4%) of the lake's drainage area is under cultivation. The lake has {{a relatively low}} percentage of lake bed above 9 m in depth which is rocky (28%). This makes Windermere a rich habitat. The main fish in the <b>lake</b> are trout, <b>char,</b> pike, and perch.|$|R

50|$|Black Canyon Lake has 78 acre, with {{a maximum}} depth of 60 ft and an average depth of 35 ft. Like other Rim lakes, Black Canyon is deep, and {{historically}} has been low in nutrients. Because of nutrients from the fire and ash, Black Canyon Lake is now managed as a put-and-grow fishery. The Department stocks fingerlings, sub-catchable and catchable-sized rainbow trout {{in the spring and}} early summer, with additional catchables stocked in the fall. Although some trees around the <b>lake</b> are <b>charred,</b> the perimeter of the lake is forested and scenic.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} a {{traditional}} {{hunting and fishing}} location and archaeological sites are often found. barren-ground caribou, muskox, Arctic <b>char,</b> <b>lake</b> trout and ringed seal were the primary, and remain important food sources. Situated east of Cambridge Bay is Ovayok Territorial Park, which includes the large esker known as Ovayok (Mount Pelly).|$|R
50|$|The most {{well known}} {{islands of the}} lake are Hautuumaasaari ("Graveyard Island"), which served as a {{cemetery}} for ancient Sami people and Ukonkivi ("Ukko's Stone"), a historical sacrifice place of the ancient inhabitants of the area. There are over 3,000 islands in total. Trout, <b>lake</b> salmon, Arctic <b>char,</b> white fish, grayling, perch and pike are found in Lake Inari.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} of Naustdal {{is ideal for}} freshwater fishing. Over 30 lakes and connecting streams contain trout. Many of the <b>lakes</b> also contain <b>char.</b> Most of your catch will be small fish, but will taste delicious when fried in a pan. In the right places you can also catch really big fish - 6 kg trout have been caught in this area.|$|R
50|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{preserve}} is the Noatak River, and is {{a breeding ground for}} a variety of commercially important fish. The most widespread salmon species is chum, and pink, chinook and sockeye salmon are found as well. Several kinds of trout are found in deep <b>lakes,</b> with Arctic <b>char</b> and Arctic grayling the most common salmonids in the preserve. Burbot are also found, as are nelma or sheefish, an important species for subsistence fisheries.|$|R
40|$|Permafrost thaw ponds of {{the warming}} Eastern Canadian Arctic are major {{landscape}} constituents and often display {{high levels of}} methylmercury (MeHg). We examined photodegradation potentials in high-dissolved organic matter (DOC) thaw ponds on Bylot Island (BYL) and a low-DOC oligotrophic lake on Cornwallis Island (<b>Char</b> <b>Lake).</b> In BYL, the ambient MeHg photodemethylation (PD) rate over 48 h of solar exposure was 6. 1 × 10 – 3 m 2 E– 1, and the rate in MeHg amended samples was 9. 3 × 10 – 3 m 2 E– 1. In contrast, in low-DOC <b>Char</b> <b>Lake,</b> PD was only observed in the first 12 h, which suggests that PD {{may not be an}} important loss process in polar desert lakes. Thioglycolic acid addition slowed PD, while glutathione and chlorides did not impact northern PD rates. During an ecosystem-wide experiment conducted in a covered BYL pond, there was neither net MeHg increase in the dark nor loss attributable to PD following re-exposure to sunlight. We propose that high-DOC Arctic thaw ponds are more prone to MeHg PD than nearby oligotrophic lakes, likely through photoproduction of reactive species rather than via thiol complexation. However, at the ecosystem level, these ponds, which are widespread through the Arctic, remain likely sources of MeHg for neighboring systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} structure, life cycle, {{and abundance}} of the copepod Linznocalanus macw YUS, {{one of the}} two multicellular zooplanktonic species in <b>Char</b> <b>Lake,</b> Northwest Territories, has been studied for 18 months. The population is univoltine, taking about 9 months to develop from egg to adult. Total population density was lower in 1970 than in 1969, whereas the phytoplankton biomass and productivity was virtually identical in both years. The lift cycle of L. macrurus was very similar in both years of study and also showed close similarity to that of a southern Ontario population...|$|R
50|$|On 12 December 1985 Arrow Air Flight 1285 {{crashed on}} {{take-off}} from the then runway 22. The disaster claimed {{the lives of}} 8 crew and 248 soldiers from the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division who were returning home for Christmas from a peacekeeping deployment in the Middle East. The impact {{on the south side of}} the Trans-Canada Highway on the shore of Gander <b>Lake</b> left a <b>charred</b> clearing in the forest where a memorial now stands to those who lost their lives in Canada's most deadly air crash.|$|R
25|$|The <b>lakes</b> contain Arctic <b>char</b> (Salvelinus alpinus L.), {{which is}} usually found much further north in sub-Arctic lakes. It's a relict species {{left behind in the}} area after the last Ice Age, and are {{consequently}} indicative of pristine environmental conditions. Although they were once widespread, they now are confined to isolated populations in inland freshwater lakes that have a suitable habitat. They are isolated in their respective lakes since the last Ice age. They are extremely sensitive to environmental changes when they are as far south as Ireland, where they are at the southern edge of their species range. The greatest threats to their survival in Ireland are introduced fish species, eutrophication, acidification and climate change. The rate of extinction of entire populations in Ireland has increased in recent decades.|$|R
5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in the park, {{and some of these}} are lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a <b>lake</b> with Arctic <b>char,</b> there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|R
40|$|Comparison {{was made}} of the zinc, iron, {{manganese}} and copper content of five tissues of brown trout Salmo trutta L. and char Salvelinus alpinus L. from two oligotrophic lakes in North Wales. Tissue metal concentrations were not related to fish growth parameters ineither species. None of the metals were evenly distributed throughout the tissues of trout or char and, with the exception of manganese being concentrated in the skeletal tissues, liver and kidney were found to contain the highest metal concentrations. Significantly different concentrations of zinc, iron and copper were found in the liver and kidney of trout compared with char. Despite the similar environmental metal evels of the two <b>lakes,</b> Llyn Peris <b>char</b> were found to contain significantly higher concentrations of iron in their livers than Padarn char. The possibility that environmentally distinct char populations exist in the lakes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Pingualuk Lake fills a deep crater in the Parc National des Pingualuit on the Ungava Peninsula (Nunavik, Canada) and is {{isolated}} from nearby surface waters. The main objectives {{of this study}} were to determine and compare the concentrations of two atmospherically derived contaminants, mercury and perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), in the lake water column and fish of Pingualuk Lake and to assess the physical and biological factors influencing contaminant concentrations. Mercury concentrations in arctic char muscle tissue were comparable to those of char in other Arctic lakes, while the total amount of PFCs was below reported levels for remote lakes in the Arctic and elsewhere. Stable isotope and stomach content analyses were made to investigate the feeding ecology of the Pingualuk <b>Lake</b> arctic <b>char</b> population and indicated the possibility of multiple feeding groups. Genetics characteristics (MH and mtDNA) of fish from Pingualuk Lake revealed that this population is likely distinct from that of nearby Laflamme Lake. However, both arctic char populations exhibit differential variation of their allele families. Physical characteristics determined for Lake Pingualuk revealed that the water column was inversely stratified beneath the ice and extremely transparent to visible and ultraviolet radiation. The highest mercury concentrations (3 - 6 pg/mL THg) occurred just beneath the ice surface in each lake. Pingualuk Lake, given its near pristine state and exceptional limnological features, may serve as a most valuable reference ecosystem for monitoring environmental stressors, such as contaminants, in the Arctic...|$|R
40|$|The site lies at 68 o N in the {{northern}} foothills of the Brooks Range, Alaska, in tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows. The tundra, streams, and lakes at the site have been undisturbed and unchanged for more than 5, 000 years; caribou and moose move freely over this region pursued by wolves and grizzly bears. Populations of <b>lake</b> trout, <b>char,</b> and arctic grayling are in a pristine state, often dominated by very large and very old individuals. This allows the analysis of relationships in plants and animal communities in an ecosystem unaffected by an ecological legacy of human use. The climate of northern Alaska has changed remarkably over the past 30 years; the 0. 7 o C per decade increase in temperature could result in {{much more than the}} 3 - 5 o total change predicted by GCM models for a doubling of CO 2 Based on several types of observations, {{there appears to be a}} biotic response to this regional warming. For example, the NDVI (a satellite-based indicator of plant biomass) has increased in northern Alaska, and vegetation communities at Toolik Lake show a reduction in moss cover and an increase in shrubs. The goal of this LTER project is to predict the future ecological characteristics of the site based upon our knowledge of the controls of ecosystem structure and function as exerted by physical setting and geologic factors, climatic factors...|$|R
50|$|The {{fish and}} {{wildlife}} in the park are typical of arctic and subarctic fauna. The major economic species are caribou, moose, and fish species such as salmon and sheefish. The most visible animals are the 400,000 caribou of the Western Arctic herd. The herd migrates annually between their winter breeding grounds, south of the Waring Mountains, and their summer calving grounds, north of the Baird Mountains. The herd's annual crossing of the Kobuk River {{is central to the}} Inupiaq people's subsistence hunting. Large mammals in the park include wolves, red foxes, caribou and Alaskan moose. Black bears, brown bears, beavers, river otters, Canadian lynxes, and Dall's sheep exist in the park as well. Smaller mammals include wolverines, martens, minks, porcupines, muskrats, snowshoe hares and a variety of voles. Fish species include chinook, chum, pink and sockeye salmon, with other salmonids including Dolly Varden, Arctic <b>char,</b> <b>lake</b> trout and Arctic grayling. Other species include burbot, Arctic lamprey, round, broad and humpback whitefish, and pond and rainbow smelt.|$|R
40|$|Photosynthesis vs. {{irradiance}} {{relationships were}} determined for phytoplankton communities from seven lakes in the Canadian high Arctic, including ultraoligotrophic <b>Char</b> <b>Lake,</b> nutrient-enriched Meretta Lake, and two meromictic lakes. The derived photosynthetic parameters were low for all samples, {{with a mean}} (�SD) light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P) of 0. 46 (� 0. 28) g C g� 1 chlorophyll a (Chl a) h� 1 and a mean �B B (light-limitation parameter) m of 1. 23 (� 0. 56) g C g� 1 Chl a m 2 mol� 1. The saturation irradiance (Ek) ranged from 50 to 196 �mol quanta m� 2 s� 1 and {{was positively correlated with}} mean irradiance for the water column. Quantum yields for photosynthesis in the Arctic lake phytoplankton were also low (mostly � 10 mmol C mol� 1 quanta). An intersystem comparison of �B B and Pm values with literature data for algae from other cold environments showed that the photosynthetic parameters for phytoplankton in Arctic and Antarctic lakes are three- to sixfold lower than for marine algae, ice algae, and cultures over the same low-temperature range. This {{may be the result of}} more severe nutrient stress in high-latitude lakes relative to polar marine environments and to the persistence of nonactive pigments in col...|$|R
40|$|Here I {{test for}} climate driven {{seasonal}} {{effects on competition}} in lakes using brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus L.) as model organisms. Winter and summer brown trout consumption rates were estimated by 1374 Cs tracer methodology using brown trout sampled in  allopatric (brown trout) and 10 sympatric (brown trout/Arctic <b>char)</b> <b>lakes,</b> located along an altitudinal gradient in central Scandinavia. Lake catchment area  vegetation properties ranged from southern boreal to alpine. All brown trout populations  showed decreased energy intake during winter compared to summer and there was a  significant impact {{of the presence of}} Arctic char on overall food consumption. Variation in food consumption between lakes was best described by a model including a three way  interaction between season, secchi disk transparency and presence/absence of Arctic char. Despite the large environmental gradient no effect of water temperature was found on the impact of Arctic char on brown trout food consumption. Length of ice-covered period and export of allochthonous material from the catchment, affecting light regime in the lakes, are  likely drivers of the seasonal and climatic variation in competitive impact. The study 16 emphasizes the importance of adding indirect effects from alterations in catchment area  properties to the direct effects of rising temperature when modelling future effects of climate change on freshwater biodiversity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{profiled}} five ice-covered {{lakes and}} two ice-covered fiords of Ellesmere Island {{at the northern}} limit of High Arctic Canada to examine their environmental characteristics, and to evaluate the long-term limnological consequences of changes in their surrounding landscape through time (landscape evolution). All of the ecosystems showed strong patterns of thermal, chemical, and biological stratification with subsurface temperature maxima from 0. 75 to 12. 15 °C; conductivities up to 98. 1 mS cm– 1 (twice that of seawater) in some bottom waters; pronounced gradients in nitrogen, phosphorus, pH, dissolved inorganic and organic carbon, manganese, iron, and oxygen; and stratified photo-synthetic communities. These ecosystems form an inferred chronosequence that reflects different steps of landscape evolution including marine embayments open to the sea, inlets blocked by thick sea ice (Disraeli Fiord, Taconite Inlet), perennially ice-capped, saline lakes isolated from the sea by isostatic uplift (Lakes A, C 1, C 2), and isolated lakes that lose their ice cover in summer. The latter are subject to entrainment of saline water into their upper water column by wind-induced mixing (Lake Romulus; Lake A in 2000), or complete flushing of their basins by dilute snowmelt (Lake C 3 and <b>Char</b> <b>Lake,</b> which lies 650 km {{to the south of}} the Ellesmere lakes region). This chronosequence illustrates how changes in geomorphology and other landscape properties may influence the limnology of coastal, high-latitude lakes, and it provides a framework to explore the potential impacts of climate change.
