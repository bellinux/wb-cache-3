5000|$|Kenmore Air Harbor, Inc., doing {{business}} as Kenmore Air, is an American airline with its headquarters {{on the grounds}} of Kenmore Air Harbor in Kenmore, Washington, USA, north of Seattle. It operates scheduled and charter seaplane and <b>land</b> <b>plane</b> service to destinations throughout western Washington and southwestern British Columbia, as well as seaplane [...] "flightseeing" [...] flights around Seattle. In addition to its corporate headquarters, seaplane maintenance facility and terminal in Kenmore, the airline has hub operations for seaplanes at its terminal on Seattle's Lake Union and for land planes at Seattle's Boeing Field/King County International Airport. It also operates a maintenance facility for its <b>land</b> <b>plane</b> fleet at Renton Municipal Airport/Clayton Scott Field in Renton, Washington, just south of Seattle.|$|E
50|$|The year 1934 {{was also}} another {{historic}} {{period for the}} nation's aviation industry when Dr. Albert Forsythe and Charles C.

50|$|As the war progressed, Great Britain {{found that}} it needed more trained aircrew and more {{training}} facilities.

50|$|The Tailhook Association is a U.S.-based, {{non-profit}} fraternal organization, {{supporting the}} interests of sea-based aviation, with emphasis on aircraft carriers. The word tailhook refers to the hook underneath {{the tail of the}} aircraft that catches the arresting wire suspended across the flight deck in order to stop the <b>landing</b> <b>plane</b> quickly.|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s Oslo had a split airport model. <b>Land</b> <b>planes</b> {{operated}} out of Kjeller, while seaplanes operated out of Gressholmen. This was by many {{regarded as a}} suboptimal solution, largely because both airports had poor ground transport. The Norwegian Aero Club proposed several new locations in 1930, including Ulven and Ekeberg. Also the 1932 committee appointed by the Ministry of Defense was critical to Gressholmen, {{in part because the}} ferrying of passengers would become impractical with increased traffic, and in part because it interfered with the ship traffic in the port. It estimated that <b>land</b> <b>planes</b> would be dominant in the future, and looked into eight possible locations. It concluded that Fornebu, located in the neighboring municipality of Bærum was the most suitable. It also felt that Ulven and Ekeberg could be suitable sites.|$|R
50|$|The airline was {{established}} on 4 November 1933 {{by the state}} government of São Paulo and started operations in 1933. VASP was the first airline to serve {{the interior of the}} state of São Paulo (São Paulo-São Carlos-São José do Rio Preto and São Paulo-Ribeirão Preto-Uberaba), with two Monospar ST-4. At the start of the 1930s, it was the only carrier to operate with <b>land</b> <b>planes</b> in their service area. At the time this was a real exploit {{due to the lack of}} adequate non-coastal airports. Many landing strips were improvised in flat pastures. This insistence on using only <b>land</b> <b>planes</b> led to the building in 1936 of one of the country’s most important airports, Congonhas, located in the city of São Paulo, far from the coast. During its early years, Congonhas Airport was popularly known as Campo da VASP ("VASP's airfield").|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s, Hugo Junkers {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to produce a}} large scale commercial transport. His initial attempt, the four-engined JG1, was developed during 1921-1922; but Junkers was forced to destroy the incomplete airplane based on post-WWI Allied demands citing the Treaty of Versailles. Later in the decade, in 1925, he published design specifications for a proposed eighty passenger trans-Atlantic aircraft - the J.1000 project. Then again, {{towards the end of}} the decade, the G.40 project was started by the Junkers design team as a trans-Atlantic mail plane. From the G.40 design, which was a seaplane configuration, Junkers also developed a <b>land</b> <b>plane</b> design, designated the G.38. Despite interest from the German armed forces in the G.40 variant, Junkers pushed forward with the <b>land</b> <b>plane</b> design which, having received financing from the Reich Air Ministry (Reichsluftfahrtministry), was taken forward to the construction stage.|$|E
50|$|The Model B was {{constructed}} in large numbers during the late 1930s and early 1940s and was available for delivery from the factory as a <b>land</b> <b>plane</b> and a floatplane. Like many light aircraft of its day, the fuselage is constructed of welded steel tubing and covered with doped aircraft fabric. The wings are braced using steel-tube struts.|$|E

50|$|Shorts work on {{seaplanes}} eventually {{culminated in}} the Short Sandringham and Short Seaford, both based on the Empire/Sunderland boats. These flying boats had enough range to operate as a transatlantic airliner, but largely served the post-war Empire (Commonwealth) market, in competition with 4-engined <b>land</b> <b>planes</b> such as modified Avro Lancasters, Avro Lancastrian and Avro York.|$|R

50|$|Hill {{appears to}} have had some {{experience}} of flying before he enrolled in autumn 1912 in the Glenn Curtiss Flying School, in order to study flying thoroughly. He was issued <b>land</b> <b>plane</b> certificate No. 234 by the Aero Club of America. Between 1915 and 1924, Hill pursued a career as an aircraft instructor, test pilot and aircraft sales representative in several different locations in the central and eastern United States.|$|E

He won second place in marksmanship from an airplane and stayed months longer studying aviation engineering.|$|E
