30|$|The gas {{purification}} {{can be achieved}} by different ways. Solid sorbents, as traps containing particles of gold, platinum, or active carbon, usually are used by the analyst due to their operational facility (Liang et al. 1996). Solutions also can be used to remove mercury from gaseous streams. The mercury can be oxidized by <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solutions,</b> producing Hg 2 + (Sizeneva et al. 2005), but the importance of the physical states during the reaction must be remembered. Thus, the dissolution of one drop of metallic mercury in a <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> is a heterogeneous reaction which takes place on the surface, depending on the area and the surface state. Sizeneva et al. (2005) established that the reaction of mercury dissolution in <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> is first order. If mercury is considered to be in the gaseous state reacting with the <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution,</b> then the reaction is second order (Zhao and Rochelle 1999).|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} socially marketed faucet fitted to earthen vessel / sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> on diarrhea prevention at rural household level as a social intervention for diarrhea prevention under ‘Community Led Initiatives for Child Survival (CLICS) program. Methods: Unmatched case-control study {{was carried out in}} 10 villages of Primary Health Centre, Anji, located in rural central India. During the study period, 144 households used either faucet fitted earthen vessel to store drinking water or used sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> (SH) for keeping drinking water safe. These served as case households for the present study. 213 neighborhood control households from same locality who used neither of the methods were also selected. Results: Odds ratio for households who used faucets fitted to earthen vessel was 0. 49 (95 % CI= 0. 25 – 0. 95). Odds ratio for households who used sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> was 0. 55 (95 % CI= 0. 31 – 0. 98).

40|$|Background. This {{in vitro}} study aimed {{to compare the}} {{antibacterial}} effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite on elimination of Enterococcus faecalis from root canal systems of primary teeth {{with or without a}} passive sonic irrigation system (EndoActivator). Methods. The root canals of 120 extracted single-rooted primary incisors were prepared using the crown-down technique. The teeth were autoclaved and inoculated with E. faecalis. The infected samples were then randomly divided into 6 experimental groups of 15 and positive and negative control groups as follows: group 1 : 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite solution; group 2 : 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite solution; group 3 : 5 % sodium hypochlorite solution; group 4 : 0. 5 % sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> + sonic activation; group 5 : 2. 5 % sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> + sonic activation; and group 6 : 5 % sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> + sonic activation. Microbiological samples were collected before and after disinfection procedures and the colony-forming units were counted. Statistical analyses were performed using the two-way ANOVA and post hoc Duncan's tests in cases of significant difference. Results. There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups in any of the variables (concentration of antiseptic or use of sonic irrigation system). Conclusion. Use of passive sonic irrigation systems in endodontic treatment of single-rooted primary teeth is of no benefit compared to regular needle irrigation. The results of this study also recommends use of lower concentrations of sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> (0. 5 %) for irrigation of the root canal system rather than higher concentrations given approximately equal efficacy...|$|R
30|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a buffered 0.5  % sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> in eradicating Enterococcus faecalis from the root canal system and to see if activation by PIPS further increases its antimicrobial properties. Since the cytotoxicity of sodium hypochlorite is directly proportional to the concentration of the solution, the authors felt it was necessary to investigate if a lower concentration of sodium hypochlorite would be effective in eradicating bacteria from the root canal system. Furthermore, it is of interest to see if activation of buffered 0.5 % sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> by PIPS would further enhance its antimicrobial properties. It would be beneficial to use an irrigating solution that is effective in eliminating bacteria from the root canal system while reducing its cytotoxic effect.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{phagocytic}} cells {{through the}} production of hydrogen peroxide which together with Cl− ions serve as substrates for the enzyme myeloperoxidase can generate the release of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) which plays {{a vital role in}} the ability of phagocytic cells to kill bacteria. Even at low concentrations, hypochlorous acid has shown the ability for a rapid and selective inhibition of bacterial growth and cell division (Mckenna and Davies 1988). To maintain a more stable solution of hypochlorus acid and to potentially increase its antibacterial activity, the pH of a sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> can be lowered by adding a buffering solution. Therefore, altering the pH of a lower strength sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution</b> may increase its antibacterial properties by facilitating the release of hypochlorus acid.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The goal of {{this study}} was to compare the {{dissolving}} potential of Dakin's solution with that of equivalent buffered and unbuffered sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solutions</b> on fresh and decayed tissues. In addition, the antimicrobial effect of Dakin's solution and equivalent unbuffered hypochlorite was tested. STUDY DESIGN: Tissue specimens were obtained from freshly dissected pig palates. Unbuffered 2. 5 % and 0. 5 % sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solutions</b> and 0. 5 % solutions buffered at a pH of 12 and a pH of 9 (Dakin's solution) were tested on fresh and decayed tissue. Tissue decay was assessed histologically. Antimicrobial testing was performed with Enterococcus faecalis in dentin blocks and on filter papers. RESULTS: The 2. 5 % NaOCl solution was substantially more effective than the three 0. 5 % solutions in dissolving the test tissues. Buffering had little effect on tissue dissolution, and Dakin's solution was equally effective on decayed and fresh tissues. No differences were recorded for the antibacterial properties of Dakin's solution and an equivalent unbuffered <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to earlier statements, the results of this study do not demonstrate any benefit from buffering sodium hypochlorite with sodium bicarbonate according to Dakin's method.
