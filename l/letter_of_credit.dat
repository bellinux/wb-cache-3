Meanwhile, Reedman's military attaché, Wing Commander John Mussell, travelled to Belgium to buy starter cartridges for the Rolls-Royce Avon 109 jet engines used by the Royal Rhodesian Air Force's English Electric Canberra bombers, as well as engines for Rhodesia's Hawker Hunter jet fighters, which were produced in Belgium under licence from Britain.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbeek was {{a strong}} proponent of the {{proposed}} arena in Newark, which first received funding from the city council during Puck Holdings' ownership in 2002. After legal battles over both eminent domain and the city's financial participation in the arena project, the final deal was approved by council in October 2004, during {{the early months of}} the lockout, and the groundbreaking occurred almost exactly a year later. Nonetheless, in January 2006, financial issues threatened to halt the deal, as the Devils did not provide the city with a required <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> until the last possible day.|$|E
5|$|Reedman carried {{instructions}} from Salisbury to {{spend up to}} £3million on European weapons, aircraft and equipment {{as soon as he}} could. The Rhodesian government now believed that it would almost certainly declare independence unilaterally and, knowing the purchase of materiel would be more difficult following this, wished to have the Rhodesian Security Forces' necessary ammunition, weapons, spare parts and other equipment in place beforehand. Soon after arriving in Portugal, Reedman contacted the Lisbon-based Zoio brothers, José, Luiz and Jean, who had recently supplied the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola with British-made weapons in direct contravention of NATO's embargo against arming Portugal's African-based troops. The Zoios were interested in stocking Rhodesia's arsenal, and promptly agreed to arrange an order of weapons from a third party on Reedman's behalf in exchange for a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> from the Rhodesian government.|$|E

5|$|During her pre-war New York – Antwerp sailings, Kroonland carried {{some notable}} and {{interesting}} passengers. On 1 August 1904, {{one of the}} ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or luggage, she was barred from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, Kroonlands crew took all the dogs back to the kennel.

40|$|This thesis puts forward two {{principal}} arguments. First, it argues that commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> {{should not be}} treated on an equal footing. They are, and should be, treated as two separate undertakings {{with respect to the}} application of the fraud exception. Secondly, the thesis argues {{that there should be a}} 'wider' fraud exception for standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit; however, the need is to explore how wide that fraud exception should be. To support the arguments of this thesis, the study examines the application of the fraud exception in four major jurisdictions: the US, England, Canada and Australia. Out of these four jurisdictions, two - the US and Canada - have been expressly applying the wider fraud test to standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and the other two have traditionally applied the more stringent fraud test to standby credits. The research will compare and critically examine these four jurisdictions' approaches to their different tests of the fraud rule to standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> and argue that the fraud rule for standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> should neither be too narrow ('fraud in documents') nor should it be too wide (fraud in the inducement or unconscionable conduct or bad faith). It is argued that standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> are more abstract than commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit; therefore, protecting the principle of the autonomy of these independent undertakings is of paramount importance. The study argues that even the wider fraud exception (the 'fraud in the transaction' defence) should be given a narrow meaning: in order to protect the independence <b>of</b> standby <b>credits,</b> it should be confined to cases in which the beneficiary had 'no bona fide belief in the validity of its claim. The thesis clearly shows that the wider 'fraud as no bona fide claim' is an appropriate fraud defence for standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> whereas for commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> the fraud exception should be narrowly confined to 'fraud in documents', which is arguably an appropriate test for these undertakings.

Privately financed, the total investment costs at 1985 prices were £2.6billion. At the 1994 completion actual costs were, in 1985 prices, £4.65billion: an 80% cost overrun. The cost overrun was partly due to enhanced safety, security, and environmental demands. Financing costs were 140% higher than forecast.|$|E

25|$|Copeau chose {{rather an}} older theatre, the Garrick Theatre on West 35th Street which housed the Théâtre Français, {{because he felt}} that with the proper renovations, among other considerations, it would better suit the unit set he had {{conceived}} with Jouvet.

From March through April he delivered some dozen lectures {{on topics such as}} Dramatic Art and the theatre Industry, The Renewal of Stagecraft, and The Spirit in the Little Theatres. When the inauguration of the Théâtre Français de New York took place at the Metropolitan Opera on 17 May 1917, Copeau had negotiated a generous contract with Otto Kahn and the board of directors and was ready to return to Paris with a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> for $18,000 to cover the costs of preparation for the season in New York City.|$|E
