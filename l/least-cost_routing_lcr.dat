Although all other countries and territories recognised the +350 dialling code, not all networks blocked calls to Gibraltar from being made using Spain's +34 9567 code, which allowed subscribers to call Gibraltar for the cost of a call to Spain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Upon the {{occurrence}} of a phenomenon of interest in a wireless sensor network, multiple sensors may be activated, leading to data implosion and redundancy. Data aggregation and/or fusion techniques exploit spatio-temporal correlation among sensory data to reduce traffic load and mitigate congestion. However, this is often {{at the expense of}} loss in Information Quality (IQ) of data that is collected at the fusion center. In this work, we address the problem of finding the leastcost routing tree that satisfies a given IQ constraint. We note that the optimal <b>least-cost</b> <b>routing</b> solution is a variation of the classical NP-hard Steiner tree problem in graphs, which incurs high overheads as it requires knowledge of the entire network topology and individual IQ contributions of each activated sensor node. We tackle these issues by proposing: (i) a topology-aware histogram-based aggregation structure that encapsulates the cost of including the IQ contribution of each activated node in a compact and efficient way; and (ii) a greedy heuristic to approximate and prune a <b>least-cost</b> aggregation <b>routing</b> path. We show that the performance of our IQ-aware routing protocol is: (i) bounded by a distance-based aggregation tree that collects data from all the activated nodes; and (ii) comparable to another IQ-aware routing protocol that uses an exhaustive brute-force search to approximate and prune the least-cost aggregation tree.

This rating is subject to some debate given the complexity of call routing created by number portability.

The CDCR algorithm dealt an approach for delay constrained routing that captures the trade-off between cost minimization and risk level regarding the delay constraint.

40|$|The Delay-constrained <b>least-cost</b> <b>routing</b> {{problem is}} to find the least cost path which {{satisfies}} a given delay constraint. There are two major difficulties to solve this problem. The first difficulty is the NP-Completeness of this routing problem. The second difficulty is that the networking information used for routing may be imprecise. The ticket-based routing (TBR) algorithm[1], aiming to find a sub-optimal solution, provides a heuristic approach to overcome the above difficulties and solve the routing problem. Although TBR proposes a detailed ticket forwarding method based on imprecise end-to-end information, it does not optimize the ticket probing process so as to find better paths. This paper proposes an Enhanced Ticket-based Routing (ETBR) algorithm. The ETBR improves the effectiveness of ticket probing by two techniques. The first technique uses colorbased ticket distribution for tickets of different colors. The tracing information of green tickets and yellow tickets is kept separately to avoid unnecessary ticket dropping. The second technique uses historical probing results to optimize ticket probing, so that redundant probing paths are eliminated. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the ETBR can find paths which have much lower cost than TBR, without decreasing the success ratio or increasing the message overhead...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A Directional Virtual Coordinate System (DVCS) is {{proposed}} {{based on a}} novel transformation that restores the lost directionality information in a Virtual Coordinate System (VCS). VCS is an attractive option to characterize the node locations in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), instead of using geographical coordinates, which is expensive or difficult to obtain. A VCS characterizes each node in a network with the minimum hop distances {{to a set of}} anchor nodes as its coordinates. The proposed transformation supplements the virtual coordinates, thus preserving all the inheriting properties such as embedded information of geodesic distances in the coordinates. The virtual directionality introduced, alleviates the local minima issue present in original VCS. Properties of this virtual directional domain are discussed. With these directional properties, it is possible, for the first time, to consider deterministic algorithms in the virtual domain, as illustrated with a constrained tree network example.

40|$|Abstract — Geo-Logical Routing (GLR) {{is a novel}} {{technique}} that combines the advantages of geographic and logical routing to achieve higher routability at a lower cost. It uses topology domain coordinates, derived solely from virtual coordinates (VCs), as a better alternative for physical location information. In logical domain, a node {{is characterized by a}} VC vector consisting of minimum number of hops to a set of anchors. VCs contain information derived from connectivity of the network, but lack physical layout information such as directionality and geographic voids. Disadvantages of geographic routing, which relies on physical location information, include cost of node localization or/and use of GPS, as well as misrouting due to physical voids. With the ability to generate topological maps from virtual coordinates via a Singular Value Decomposition based technique, it is now possible to characterize a network with topological coordinates, which we demonstrate to be more effective than physical coordinates for making routing decisions. By switching between geographic routing and logical routing, GLR overcomes local minima in the respective domains.

AT&T's monopoly on U.S. toll-free number routing ended in 1986, encouraging flexibility {{in order to}} match rivals Sprint and MCI. By 1989, fixed [...] "bands" [...] of coverage area had been largely replaced by distance-based billing, {{a growing number of}} 1-800 numbers were being terminated at standard local business or residence lines and one number could be sent to multiple locations based on call origin, <b>least-cost</b> <b>routing</b> or time of day routing.

Calls from Canada and the U.S., intrastate and interstate, could terminate at the same 1-800 number, even via different carriers. Vanity numbers became easier to obtain as a toll-free exchange prefix was no longer tied to a geographic location.

We extend BGP to advertise bandwidth information, but, instead of using link capacities or instantaneous available bandwidth values, a novel QoS metric, available bandwidth index (ABI), is defined and used to perform bandwidth advertising and routing. The two major contributions of ABI are: (1) ABI dynamically abstracts available bandwidth into a probability interval, therefore, it is very flexible to represent heterogenous and dynamic bandwidth values; (2) by capturing the statistical property of the detailed available bandwidth distribution, ABI is so efficient that it can highly decrease the message overhead in routing, thereby making the QoS advertising and routing very scalable.

From January 1991 to June 1993, the project provided direct assistance to the Ministry of Food and the Directorate General of Food for reviewing and negotiating the organizational restructuring of the DGF, including the revision of the staffing structure. This ultimately led to the official endorsement of the reorganization structure which inter alia will reduce the total staff for the DGF by 3 000 from the existing level. Revised supply management and finance and accounts recording and reporting procedures were introduced throughout all installations and offices of the DGF and data collection and processing were computerized within the DGF management information system at headquarters, regional and port offices. The project also assisted with the design and development of a computerized <b>least-cost</b> <b>routing</b> model to minimize the costs of foodgrain movement and undertook {{a detailed analysis of}} the port handling operations of foodgrains in Chittagong and Khulna/Mongla. In addition, support was provided in the area of pest management and quality control. Although the project assisted with strengthening the overall managerial and operational performance of the DGF, considerable work remains to be carried out if the changes introduced are to be continued on a sustainable basis. Restructuring the DGF not only concerns the organizational changes themselves, but also requires a substantial amount of training and monitoring of managers at all levels who will have to adopt a different style and attitude to administer the affairs of the DGF. There has been wide recognition by MOF, DGF and the donor community that further support will be required to consolidate the reorganization process along these lines. A Technical Assistance Project Proforma (TAPP) has been prepared. It should be approved as a matter of urgency if the present momentum of the reorganization process is not to be lost. There is an immediate need to establish the DGF Implementation Team, comprising 5 DGF trainers previously working with the project, which will assume the overall responsibility for implementing the reorganization structure and monitoring the continued implementation of the revised systems and procedures introduced by the project until the requested follow-up technical assistance may become operational. While the implementation process will be ongoing, senior management will have to start paying special attention to ensuring that required changes in management style, working practices and attitude, including the delegation of authority to field managers and the adherence to a strict reporting discipline, are installed and sustained correctly. In this regard, it is extremely important that the DGF/MOF urgently provide official approval for the revised financial accounting system to ensure that the trial balance and related double entry bookkeeping system, which was introduced {{with the assistance of the}} project, is effectively sustained. In addition, approval is required for the introduction of the proposed budget and petty cash accounting systems to complete the full financial accounting system and enhance the accountability and financial monitoring capability of the DGF. Important is also that the DGF make appropriate budgetary allocations to sustain the overall development, operation and maintenance of the computerized MIS system, including the computerized finance and accounts system, the <b>least-cost</b> <b>routing</b> model, and the personnel data bank. In addition, attention is required to implement a number of the suggested improvements in the port handling operations of foodgrains, notably the adaptation of the tender documents for tendering Discharge Rates stipulated in Charter Parties, and the improvement of the utilization of Chittagong Silo. The privatization of the maintenance of vacuvators and pneumatic unloading equipment at Chittagong Silo jetty and the introduction of a bonus system for staff operating this equipment should also be considered. The eight technical officers trained as trainers in overall aspects of quality control and pest management should effectively be posted as Technical Officers at the regional offices and DGF headquarters in accordance with the revised staffing structure. ...|$|R
