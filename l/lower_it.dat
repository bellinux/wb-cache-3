5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also <b>lower</b> <b>it,</b> such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had lost}} its UK title, Razer still reigned as {{champion}} of the Extreme All-Stars tournament. Its first battle to defend this title was against twice UK champion Chaos 2 and dual-spinner 13 Black. Razer and 13 Black joined forces to eliminate Chaos 2, in what was its last ever fight on Robot Wars. Razer's next battle against Spawn Again was a rematch from the series five semi-finals. Razer was again the aggressor: it repeatedly punctured Spawn Again's body panels, prompting its constructors to seek safety by driving themselves into the pit. Razer's next battle was one-on-one versus 13 Black. Following an impact with the arena wall, 13 Black stopped spinning for long enough that Razer could lift it with the arm and <b>lower</b> <b>it</b> into the pit. In the All-Stars grand final, Razer faced Firestorm4. Razer manoeuvred its wedge underneath Firestorm4, lowered the arm and immobilised its opponent. Razer was All-Stars champion {{for a second time}} running.|$|E
5|$|Coppola {{originally}} intended to write the screenplay himself, but due to {{his commitment to the}} filming of Gardens of Stone (1987), engaged Arnold Schulman who scripted Capra's A Hole in the Head (1959). Schulman eventually collaborated with David Seidler on the Tucker project. Subsequently, Coppola rewrote the Schulman and Seidler scripts, but an attempt to get a co-writing credit on the film was overruled by the Writers Guild of America, as an arbitration committee determined Coppola did not contribute enough to the script to warrant an on-screen writing credit. The filmmakers devised a $24 million production budget, but Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, TriStar Pictures and Paramount Pictures wanted Coppola and Lucas to <b>lower</b> <b>it</b> to $15 million. Distributors were also dubious about working with Lucas after the 1986 commercial and critical failures of both Labyrinth and Howard the Duck. Lucas decided to cover the $24 million budget himself, and pre-production proceeded.|$|E

25|$|A basic {{means of}} {{controlling}} an aircraft with disabled flight controls, discovered through crew experience, is by {{making use of}} the position of the engines. If the engines are mounted under the centre of gravity, {{as is the case in}} most passenger jets, then increasing the thrust will raise the nose, while decreasing the thrust will <b>lower</b> <b>it.</b> This control method may call for control inputs that go against the pilot's instinct: when the aircraft is in a dive, adding thrust will raise the nose and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Since many {{of these}} existed only for short periods, the number of camp administrations at any given point was <b>lower.</b> <b>It</b> peaked in the early 1950s, when {{there were more than}} 100 camp administrations across the Soviet Union. Most camp administrations oversaw several single camp units, some as many as dozens or even hundreds. The infamous {{complexes}} were those at Kolyma, Norilsk, and Vorkuta, all in arctic or subarctic regions. However, prisoner mortality in Norilsk in most periods was actually lower than across the camp system as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Silica glass can be doped {{with various}} materials.

Doping is also possible with laser-active ions (for example, rare-earth-doped fibers) {{in order to obtain}} active fibers to be used, for example, in fiber amplifiers or laser applications. Both the fiber core and cladding are typically doped, so that the entire assembly (core and cladding) is effectively the same compound (e.g. an aluminosilicate, germanosilicate, phosphosilicate or borosilicate glass).|$|E

This time also broke Joscelin Yeo's seven-year-old meet record of 1:12.36, and was achieved a mere 30 minutes after her silver medal in the 400 metre individual medley. The following week at the SSA Grand Prix short course event, Yeo set a further two national open records.

25|$|On {{his return}} to the US, Spitzer {{calculated}} that something was wrong with the ZETA results. He noticed that the apparent temperature, 5 million K, would not have time to develop during the short firing times. ZETA did not discharge enough energy into the plasma to heat it to those temperatures so quickly. If the temperature was increasing at the relatively slow rate his calculations suggested, fusion would not be taking place early in the reaction, and could not be adding energy that might make up the difference. Spitzer suspected the temperature reading was not accurate. Since it was the temperature reading that suggested the neutrons were from fusion, if the temperature was <b>lower,</b> <b>it</b> implied the neutrons were non-fusion in origin.|$|E
25|$|Getting {{a higher}} credit limit {{can help a}} credit score. The higher the credit limit on the credit card, the lower the {{utilization}} ratio average for all of a borrower's credit card accounts. The utilization ratio is the amount owed divided by the amount extended by the creditor and the <b>lower</b> <b>it</b> is the better a FICO rating, in general. So if a person has one credit card with a used balance of $500 and a limit of $1,000 as well as another with a used balance of $700 and $2,000 limit, the average ratio is 40 percent ($1,200 total used divided by $3,000 total limits). If the first credit card company raises the limit to $2,000, the ratio lowers to 30 percent, which could boost the FICO rating.|$|E
