40|$|Extraction of {{information}} from remotely sensed images would greatly benefit from increased use of spatial data. However, the utility of spatial data has been undermined {{by a lack of}} understanding of the nature and causes oI observed spatial variation in images. One approach to this problem is to model the spatial vaiiation in images as a function of ground scene and sensor parameters. Variograms are the tool used to link models of ground scenes to spatial variation in images. Explicit vaxiograms are calculated for simple models oI ground scenes consisting of randomly <b>located</b> <b>discs</b> on a continuous background. By incorporating the effect oI the IFOV of the sensor through a process called regulaxization, explicit variograms for images of these scene models are derived. Verification of the explicit variograms i accomplished by simulating images that match the assumed scene model and sensor parameters and calculating empirical vaxiograms |or these images. For a simple scene model oI randomly <b>located</b> <b>discs</b> on a continuous background, explicit and empirical variograms match, verifying the convergence of these two dissimilar approaches. The sensitivity o [vaxiograms i studied through varying parameters of scene models both in calculating explicit variograms and in simulating images.

40|$|The authors report {{two cases}} of nodular calcium {{pyrophosphate}} dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition {{close to the}} thoracic neural foramen, which caused chronic radiculopathy. Preoperatively, the lesions were interpreted as calcified disc herniations. Both patients underwent surgery in which an extended transfacet pedicle-sparing approach was used. Incision of the posterior longitudinal ligament released soft degenerated material. In both cases, histological examination showed abundant degenerative debris along with CPPD crystals. Spinal CPPD deposition is a comparatively rare disease that almost invariably involves the posterior aspect of the spinal canal, typically the ligamentum flavum. The exceptional foraminal location of the lesions reported here, combined with the surgical findings, indicated that the CPPD crystals were deposited on a laterally herniated disc fragment. A distinctive feature in both cases was the soft consistency of the resected tissue. The consistency of the disc material {{and the location of}} the lesion in the axial plane (that is, median compared with lateral) are key factors in determining the optimal surgical approach to thoracic disc herniations. In describing consistency, terms such as "calcified" and "hard" have been used interchangeably in the literature. The authors' experience underscores that not all densely calcified herniated discs are hard. Although detection of this discrepancy would have left surgical planning for the lateral disc herniations unchanged, it could have altered planning for centrally or centrolaterally <b>located</b> <b>disc</b> herniations...|$|R

40|$|Objective We used lumbar {{magnetic}} resonance image (MRI) findings to determine possible outcome predictors of a caudal epidural steroid injection (CESI) for radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc (HLD). Methods Ninety-one patients with radicular pain whose MRI indicated a HLD were enrolled between September 2010 and July 2013. The CESIs were performed using ultrasound (US). A responder was defined as having complete relief {{or at least a}} 50 % reduction of pain as assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS) and functional status on the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ); responder (VAS n= 61, RMDQ n= 51), and non-responder (VAS n= 30, RMDQ n= 40). MRI findings were analyzed and compared between the two groups with regard to HLD level, HLD type (protrusion or exclusion), HLD zone (central, subarticular, foraminal, and extraforaminal), HLD volume (mild, moderate, or severe), relationship between HLD and nerve root (no contact, contact, displaced, or compressed), disc height loss (none, less than half, or more than half), and disc degeneration grade (homogeneous disc structure or inhomogeneous disc structure–clear nucleus and height of intervertebral disc). Results A centrally <b>located</b> herniated <b>disc</b> was more common in the responder group than that in the non-responder group.

Methods: A retrospective radiological analysis was performed in 50 patients who had undergone single level total disc replacement surgery. Records were reviewed to obtain demographic data. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were assessed to determine C 2 - 7 Cobb’s angle and segmental angle and to investigate postoperative kyphotic deformity. A for-mula was introduced to calculate insertion depth of Prodisc-C artificial disc. Statistical analysis was performed to search the correlation between insertion depth of Prodisc-C artificial disc and postoperative kyphotic deformity, and to estimate insertion depth ofProdisc-C artificial disc to prevent postoperative kyphotic deformity. Results: In this study no significant statistical correlation was observed between insertion depth of Prodisc-C artificial disc and postoperative kyphotic deformity regarding C 2 - 7 Cobb’s angle. Statistical correlation between insertion depth of Prodisc-C artificial disc and postoperative kyphotic deformity was observed regarding segmental angle (p< 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The optimal {{surgical}} {{approach for}} thoracic disc herniation remains {{a matter of}} debate, especially for central disc herniation. In this paper, we present a new technique to remove central thoracic disc herniation, the posterior transdural approach, and report a series of 13 cases operated on in this way at our institute. METHODS: Between September 2004 and October 2010, 13 patients with symptomatic central thoracic disc herniation were operated on, utilising this posterior transdural approach. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine before surgery. All patients were followed at our outpatient department for at least 3 months. In addition, all patients were interviewed in April 2009 and February 2011 to evaluate the final results. A seven-point Likert scale was applied and the Frankel score was determined preoperatively and postoperatively. Additionally, a postoperative MRI was obtained for all but two patients. RESULTS: The most frequently involved levels were T 10 - 11 and T 12 -L 1. Median operative time was 210 min (range 140 - 360). Three patients experienced reversible complications. No patient required spinal fixation. The median duration of hospitalisation was 6 days (range 4 - 20 days). With a median follow-up of 18 months, symptoms improved in 12 patients (92 %), including the three patients with complications. One patient was unchanged (8 %), while none of the patients experienced worsening of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The posterior transdural approach is well tolerated by the patient and has a relatively high success rate. It is a relatively simple and safe procedure, suitable for the operative treatment of almost all types of thoracic disc herniation, but especially the centrally <b>located</b> <b>disc</b> herniation...|$|R

40|$|Concrete {{hydration}} {{process is}} an action between {{the mixing of}} cement and water. The process produces heat release which can turn into a harmful reaction if {{the rate of heat}} released is higher than the concrete bleeding. The heat released will lead to shrinkage which every single concrete structure will be experiencing. The initial concrete shrinkage occurred can be classified as plastic shrinkage which is the most vital shrinkage that needs to be preserved. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the methods to control shrinkage in concrete slabs using common curing techniques used in the construction industries. This study focused on using different curing methods on concrete slabs. Five different slabs were used as the testing samples for three common curing techniques; air dry, wet burlap she and water spray curing. For wet burlap sheeting and water spraying techniques, two types of curing durations had been applied; one day and three days of curing had been practiced. All of the slabs were stored and tested at an open space which considers being the same environment in the construction. The test involved using mechanical strain gauge that indicated shrinkage readings through the movement of <b>locating</b> <b>discs</b> placed on the slabs. The testing of each of the slabs has been done after one day of concrete setting and continued tested until the fourth day after the concrete was set.

40|$|Abstract Background Vertebral {{endplate}} signal changes (VESC) {{are more}} common among patients with low back pain (LBP) and/or sciatica than in {{people who are not}} seeking care for back pain. The distribution and characteristics of VESC have been described in people from clinical and non-clinical populations. However, while the clinical course of VESC has been studied in patients, the natural course in the general population has not been reported. The objectives of this prospective observational study were to describe: 1) the distribution and characteristics of VESC in the lumbar spine, 2) its association with disc degeneration, and 3) its natural course from 40 to 44 years of age. Methods Three-hundred-and-forty-four individuals (161 men and 183 women) sampled from the Danish general population had MRI at the age of 40 and again at the age of 44. The following MRI findings were evaluated using standardised evaluation protocols: type, location, and size of VESC, disc signal, and disc height. Characteristics and distribution of VESC were analysed by frequency tables. The association between VESC and disc degeneration was analysed by logistic regression analysis. The change in type and size of VESC was analysed by cross-tabulations of variables obtained at age 40 and 44 and tested using McNemar's test of symmetry. Results Two-thirds (67 %) of VESC found in this study were located in {{the lower part of the}} spine (L 4 -S 1). VESC <b>located</b> at <b>disc</b> levels L 1 -L 3 were generally small and located only in the anterior part of the vertebra, whereas those <b>located</b> at <b>disc</b> levels L 4 -S 1 were more likely to extend further into the vertebra and along the endplate. Moreover, the more the VESC extended into the vertebra, the more likely it was that the adjacent disc was degenerated. The prevalence of endplate levels with VESC increased significantly from 6 % to 9 % from age 40 to 44. Again, VESC that was only observed in the endplate was more likely to come and go over the four-year period compared with those which extended further into the vertebra, where it generally persisted. Conclusion The prevalence of VESC increased significantly over the four-year period. Furthermore, the results from this study indicate that the distribution of VESC, its association with disc degeneration and its natural course, is dependent on the size of the signal changes. </p...|$|R
