40|$|Specimens of the <b>larger</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> (Scyliorhinus stellaris) were {{electrically}} stimulated to exhaustion in {{a closed}} seawater recirculation sys-tem. The production of large quantities of lactic acid by anaerobic metabol-ism and the resultant efflux of the dissociation products, H+ and lactate, from the white musculature resulted in severe acid-base disturbances and in increases in plasma lactate concentration, the two effects having extremely different time courses. Plasma pH and bicarbonate were maximally depressed 15 - 30 min after exercise, whereas peak lactate concentrations of up to 30 mM were not attained before 4 - 8 h after exercise. The acid-base status was restored to normal 10 — 14 h after exercise, long before the aerobic processing of surplus lactic acid was complete 22 — 30 h after exercise. This behaviour can be explained {{on the basis of}} an interaction of transfer rates, buffer values and equilibria between intracellular and extracellular compartments with the transient net transfer of surplus H+ ions to the environmental water. About half of the original quantity of H+ was trans-ferred net to the environment via the branchial epithelium during the first 8 - 10 h, and it was later taken up again at the rate of aerobic lactic acid processing in the metabolism of the fish, whereas a transfer of lactate was not observed {{at any time during the}} experiment. As a result, the distribution patterns of H+ and lactate differed from each other and varied with time elapsed after anaerobic exercise, leading to the apparent 'H+ ion deficit' which has been observed in the blood of several fish species during lactacidosis. Net transfer of H+ ions to the environment facilitates rapid normalization of the acid-base status long before the original stress, lactic acid, is removed from the organism and thus represents an effective regulatory mechanism for the defence of the internal milieu in fish...|$|E
