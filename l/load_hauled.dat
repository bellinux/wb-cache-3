30|$|This paper {{presents}} a system-wide cost optimization approach {{to minimize the}} operational cost of open-cast mining operations by analyzing the relationship among the mining subsystems including drilling, blasting, <b>loading,</b> <b>hauling</b> and crushing. The particle size of the blasted muck pile is the common cost parameter for all activities. Thus, the cost calculations {{are based on the}} mean fragmentation size which is decided by the blast design parameters such as burden, spacing, sub-drill, the explosive charge, etc. Lowering the particle size causes an increase in the drilling and blasting costs. On the other hand, it provides more efficient <b>loading,</b> <b>hauling</b> and crushing till a certain size. Mean particle size affects the <b>loading</b> and <b>hauling</b> by the fill factor. Moreover, the energy requirement of the crushers {{is directly related to the}} crusher feed size. When these relations between the mean fragmentation size and the cost of mining activities are considered, optimizing the mean fragmentation size can provide substantial cost savings in mining operations.|$|R

50|$|The Red Devil's rated freight loads are 700 t on 2% grades, 1080 t on 1¼% {{grades and}} 1320 t on 1% grades.

50|$|The {{modified}} locomotive {{became the}} only Class 26. Compared to an unmodified Class 25NC, the Red Devil achieved a 28% measured saving on coal and a 30% measured saving on water, measured during freight service, and a 43% increase in drawbar power based on the maximum recorded drawbar power. Its approximate maximum range in full load freight service on 1% to 1¼% grades was 700 km based on its coal capacity, and 230 km based on its water capacity. The maximum recorded freight <b>load</b> <b>hauled</b> relative to gradient was 900 t on 2% grades, and it could haul a 650 t passenger train at a constant speed of 100 km/h on 1% grades. The Red Devil’s great power, however, also {{turned out to be}} its one weakness. The Class 25NC had already proven to be on the slippery side and the much more powerful Class 26, with essentially still the same dimensions as the Class 25NC, was even worse. It was a poor performer at starting or at low speeds on steep gradients.|$|E

Therefore, the truck's maximum exploitation requires a partially filled pass, which inevitably prevents the loader from achieving its maximum performance.

40|$|<b>Load</b> <b>Haul</b> Dump (LHD) {{vehicles}} {{are used in}} underground mines to load and transport ore and minerals. They can be manually or automatically operated. With an automatic system, the operator can {{be taken out of}} the mine and simultaneously control up to three LHDs, thus increasing both productivity and security for the personnel. There are a number of operation modes available for <b>Load</b> <b>Haul</b> Dump (LHD) vehicles and there are many criteria to consider when choosing the best one. This report fills a gap in the literature by mapping and describing the experiences and present status of the operation and maintenance of both automatic and manual LHDs as well as the existing navigation systems and techniques associated with underground automated loading and transportation. The commercially systems available today for automation of LHDs are supplied by Sandvik, Caterpillar and Atlas Copco. Automation focus have over the years gradually shifted from having fully automated fleets of vehicles to more flexible solutions with semi-automatic LHDs gaining safety as one of the main goals. Several issues must be resolved to maximize the benefits of automation. One is to improve maintenance, as this is crucial for an operation to work smoothly without the waste incurred by unplanned breakdowns. Godkänd; 2011; 20110913 (anngus...|$|R

40|$|The {{logging system}} {{consists}} of five subsystems; namely, felling, bucking, skidding, <b>loading,</b> and <b>hauling.</b> Productivity of the felling and bucking subsystems depends largely upon {{the skill of}} the men doing the work and can be subjected to a minimum amount of analysis. Skidding represents a materials handling system that is being subjected to {{a great deal of}} technical analysis. <b>Loading</b> and <b>hauling,</b> however, stand in need of investigation. Both are materials handling systems that need analysis of the best equipment for a particular situation. This thesis presents a simulation model that investigates the many variable combinations existing in the <b>loading</b> and <b>hauling</b> subsystems. Development of the model required two steps: (1) identi- fication of the events and activities common to <b>loading</b> and <b>hauling</b> subsystems and (2) definition of owning and operating costs relevant to the two sub-systems. Calculation of relevant costs resulted in the criteria used to compare the numerous variable combinations. The criteria is a ratio of investment to output expressed in dollars per thousand board feet of merchantable timber. Identification of appropriate events and activities allowed use of the simulation language, GASP II, in testing various alternatives. The result of this investigation is a fully developed model capable of testing alternatives of the many logging situations in existence.

A linear, state-space, mathematical model of the vehicle is derived purely from geometric consideration of the vehicle and its desired path.

Long hole stoping is a highly selective and productive method of mining and can cater for varying ore thicknesses and dips (0 - 90 degree). It differs from manual methods such as timbered and shrinkage as once the stope has begun blasting phase it cannot be accessed by personnel. For this reason the blasted rock is designed to fall into a supported drawpoint or removed with remote control LHD (<b>load,</b> <b>haul,</b> dump machine).|$|R

30|$|The {{production}} cycle of open-cast coal mines generally includes drilling, blasting, <b>loading,</b> <b>hauling</b> and coal preparation activities. Individual optimization {{of these activities}} {{does not mean that}} the whole system is optimized. This paper proposes a cost model considering all activities in mining cycle and system-wide approach to minimize the total mining cost of bench production. Since the fragmentation size and blast-hole diameter are linked to all activities of mining system, they are considered as decision variables in the problem formulation. The operation costs are then minimized by using the evolutionary algorithm. Moreover, the impact of the change in the explosive price, and the hourly unit cost of equipment on total mining cost is quantified by sensitivity analysis. A case study is implemented to demonstrate the developed model.|$|R
