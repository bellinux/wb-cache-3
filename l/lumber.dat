5|$|The Beaver Mill <b>Lumber</b> Company {{became one}} of the largest single <b>lumber</b> {{operations}} in all of Pennsylvania, and four <b>lumber</b> boomtowns, Beaver Mills, Star Mill, Underwood Mills, and Antes, altered the landscape in the Black Moshannon area. A dam was built at the site of an old beaver dam, and the mill ponds for the <b>lumber</b> mills flooded the old beaver ponds. The communities featured general stores, blacksmith shops, liveries, taverns, schools, and even a ten-pin bowling alley. The area helped to meet the nation's need for timber in mining operations, construction, and railroads.|$|E

5|$|<b>Lumber</b> mills, {{originally}} {{built to}} provide construction-grade materials for homes and business but then expanded to entice and then {{meet the demands}} of the railroad, profited from an increase in demand from railroad expansion and the nation at large. The Bonner mill, owned the NorthernPacific and CopperKing MarcusDaly, became the largest producer of <b>lumber</b> in the northwest. In 1908, Missoula's location as both a major <b>lumber</b> producer and a regional commercial center helped land the city the regional office for the newly establish U.S. Forest Service created to help manage the nation's timber supply. Over the next century, Missoula's various <b>lumber</b> industries was consolidated under various entities such as the Anaconda Company in the 1970s and Champion International Paper through the 1980s until most were under control of Plum Creek Timber, all the while demand in timber dropped. In 2007, a downward spiral of Missoula's <b>lumber</b> industry began with the closure of a plywood plant in Bonner, the closure of Bonner's sawmill in 2008, and the closing of the Smurfit-Stone Container pulp mill in 2010.|$|E

However, the financial difficulty has been deteriorated because of economic slump and export limitation of countries with wood resources and therefore total output of <b>lumbering</b> industry was reduced by 7 % to 2500 billion KRW in 2008 than that in 2007 {{and the number of}} general <b>lumbering</b> companies was also reduced by 10 % from 674 in 2007 to 609 in 2008. Although researches on <b>lumbering</b> companies and wood industry include research on development measures of wood industry and analysis of environmental factors affecting wood supply, recently these researches are not active so much and there is few study on management cases for <b>lumbering</b> companies by regions. Thus in this study investigation in order to seek problems on management and future developmental direction was conducted against <b>lumbering</b> enterprises located in Gapyeong–gun and Pocheon–si that have larger areas of artificial forest with Korean white pine and larch compared with other regions in Gyeonggi Province. As a result, it was found that there were some factors making management of <b>lumbering</b> enterprises more difficult, including increase of items substituting wood, outworn <b>lumbering</b> facility, decrease of demand for <b>lumbering</b> product from economic slump as well as raise of wood price and labor costs. Therefore, it was identified that for enhancement of public beneficial function of forest through fostering of <b>lumbering</b> enterprises and expansion of domestic material consumption, and production of large diameter log with good quality, it was needed to prepare various support plans such as tax reduction and exemption and financial support for <b>lumbering</b> enterprise...|$|R

The first known road that reached the settlement was established in 1804, when land along a highway from St. Lawrence County {{to the town of}} Chester in Warren County was populated by the West family. Minerva was mainly limited to the vicinity of the old highway, but as more people settled along the road, the town began to grow. For a time, the town boasted several water-powered sawmills, and the highway was used to transport <b>lumber.</b> However, the <b>lumber</b> industry began to fail, and by 1840, the logging and <b>lumber</b> system had been replaced by crops. The town initiated river drives, which continued until 1950.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the timber}} was too remote {{to be transported}} via the streams, and logging railroads were the next {{development}} in the Quehanna <b>lumber</b> era. In or around 1880, these railroads allowed the clearcutting of the remaining forests. The Quehanna plateau was unusual in using standard gauge track for its logging railroads: most such railways were narrow gauge. The logging railroads used special geared steam locomotives, such as the Shay, Climax and Heisler. Nine companies operated logging railroads in what became Moshannon State Forest; the Goodyear <b>Lumber</b> Company was the largest and cut much of what became Quehanna Wild Area between 1902 and 1912.

5|$|The {{boom in the}} oil {{industry}} also helped promote other industries {{in other areas of the}} state. <b>Lumber</b> production thrived as demand climbed for construction of railroads, refineries, and oil derricks, and, in 1907, Texas was the third largest <b>lumber</b> producer in the United States. Growing cities required many new homes and buildings, thus benefiting the construction industry.

New saw mills appeared in Marine and Stillwater. <b>Lumber</b> was typically cut during winter and sent downstream in the spring. In 1848, businessman Franklin Steele built the first private sawmill on the Saint Anthony Falls (which would later become the town of Saint Anthony) opening commercial lumbering on the Mississippi River.
