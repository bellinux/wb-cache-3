50|$|AMIC {{is based}} on microfracturing which relies on the body’s own healing potential. Blood and bone marrow which are {{released}} through tiny holes in the subchondral bone plate, fill the damaged cartilage area with a so-called super-clot. This blood clot contains all the elements (e.g. progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), cytokines and growth factors) necessary to form new cartilage repair tissue as response to the encountered injury. Adding a collagen membrane to the forming super clot secures it and improves overall clot stability. It also enhances the primary defect fill which is an important parameter for good outcome. Furthermore, {{the application of a}} collagen membrane provides an environment where cells can adhere, proliferate and produce repair tissue in a protected setting.

By any measure, output considerations do {{play a significant role}} in the ECB’s policy rule. If anything, the ECB has been on the <b>loose</b> <b>side,</b> especially since 2001, when taking economic development in the euro area as a whole as the starting point. Actual interest rates have been consistent with German (and to a lesser extent French) preferences, however. It suggests the ECB puts a dominant weight on German economic developments. Small peripheral countries receive too low weight rather than too high. In case the ECB actually focuses on euro area wide developments, its looseness is comparable to that of the Fed. In case ECB policy actually is geared towards Germany’s preferences – or perhaps the average German-French preferences [...] the ECB has been much closer to a standard Taylor-rule interest rate setting than the Fed. In that scenario, the Fed indeed has been much more aggressive in the lowering of its interest rates in the face of adverse economic shocks...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 A {{changing}} {{raw material}} supply and smaller, generally lower quality peeler logs, are causing surface characteristics in veneer that can adversely affect glue-bond performance. When lower quality logs are peeled, rougher veneer is usually produced. The typical response by plywood manufacturers {{is to increase}} adhesive spread when using rough veneer. The effectiveness of increasing adhesive spread rates has not been quantified. To do so, a method to quantify roughness is needed {{so that it can}} be correlated with percent wood failure, the standard for defining glue-bond quality. The objectives of this research were to define the relationships between seven traditional 2 - dimensional measures of surface roughness and glue-bond performance in order to determine if a measure or combination of measures could be used to develop a glue-bond performance prediction model. Rotary peeled, 1 / 8 inch thick Douglas-fir veneer was visually categorized as being smooth, intermediate, or rough. Samples on each sheet were selected at random and their locations tracked throughout the study. The surface roughness of each sample was measured on the tight and loose sides using a modified laser scatter/optical imaging system. The scanning data were used to calculate seven roughness measures. Three-ply plywood panels were manufactured using the measured samples as core material and smooth veneer as face and back plys. Each panel was cut into standard shear specimens according to U. S. Product Standard 1 - 95. The test area for each shear specimen was the measured sample selected prior to panel assembly. The shear specimens were tested and evaluated for load at failure and percent wood failure. Each of the roughness measures and visual categories were compared to load at failure and percent wood failure data. Each shear specimen was also examined to determine the nature of the failure and with the failure being categorized into one of seven types. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression tests indicated no statistically significant relationship between any of the seven roughness measures or combination of measures and load at failure or percent wood failure. There was also no significant difference in roughness between the tight and <b>loose</b> <b>side</b> of the veneer, except for the skewness, kurtosis, and 3 rd highest peak measures. Analysis of the visual categories showed there was strong evidence that an increase in surface roughness was associated with a decrease in load at failure and percent wood failure. This indicates that a 3 - dimensional measure of surface roughness may be more effective for modeling glue-bond performance. Analysis of the nature of failure data indicated that the samples tended to fail on the <b>loose</b> <b>side</b> of the veneer. This trend was noted across all roughness categories. It is believed that this may be associated with lathe check depth and that an interaction between lathe check depth and veneer roughness may determine glue-bond performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{frictional}} {{behavior on}} the relief face of a veneer cutting tool that takes part in the mechanism of veneer formation and the veneer quality becomes a serious problem of utmost importance. Few fundamental studies have dealt with this problem, and so, the main objective {{of this paper is}} to obtain information on them. In this study, the frictional stress (τ) and the normal stress (σ) over a rake face were measured in the veneer cutting without a pressure bar, using a composite tool with the restricted contact length (γ_c) between the relief face and the machined surface, as shown in Fig. 1. The results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) Two components of the cutting force are affected by γ_c, for instance, the horizontal component increases and the vertical component decreases, with increase in γ_c. (2) The distributions of τ and σ over the rake face can be expressed by Eq. (5). From the values of the coefficients and the exponents in Eq. (5), the effect of γ_c upon τ and σ is made clear (Figs. 2 and 3, and Table 1). (3) The frictional coefficient (μ) on the rake face increases with increase in γ_c, but μ can be considered to be constant under the various cutting conditions (Fig. 4 and Table 3). (4) The degree of knife checks in chip increases, but the <b>loose</b> <b>side</b> surface of the chip produced becomes relatively good, with increase in γ_c. These cutting phenomena are discussed qualitatively on the basis of the above-mentioned results...|$|E

40|$|Weathered {{soils are}} used {{extensively}} as fill materials for constructing slopes in tropical regions such as Hong Kong. Safe and successful implementations of many slope stabilising measures often require {{the understanding of}} the fundamental mechanical behaviour of soils that are to be strengthened. Behaviour of loose weathered fill materials especially at unsaturated state is not often investigated and far from fully understood. The objective {{of this study was to}} understand the mechanical behaviour of loosely compacted unsaturated weathered fill materials through first studying the stress-strain relationship, the effects of suction and stress path, in particular the wetting path, on shear strength and volumetric behaviour; and second interpreting the behaviour by the critical state framework and the elasto-plastic constitutive model. Three series of triaxial tests were conducted on loose decomposed volcanic and granitic soils. The tests included consolidated undrained tests on saturated specimens, constant water content tests and wetting tests at constant deviator stress on unsaturated specimens. The last series of tests was designed to simulate the effect of rainfall infiltration in initially unsaturated slopes. During undrained shearing, the saturated loose decomposed volcanic soil shows a tendency to dilate and possesses ductile stress-strain behaviour. However, the saturated loose decomposed granitic soil shows a tendency to contract and possesses brittle stress-strain behaviour if the initial state lies on the <b>loose</b> <b>side</b> of the critical state. Hence, static liquefaction is very unlikely to occur for saturated volcanic soil but is possible for saturated granitic soil. On the other hand, the observed volumetric behaviour of the unsaturated loose weathered soils is influenced by the imposed stress paths and the stress conditions. For unsaturated specimens sheared at constant water content, both soils exhibit volumetric contraction for the range of net mean stress considered. This seems to imply that static liquefaction is possible if the rate of air escaped from the voids is slower than the rate of volumetric collapse of the soil structure, from which excessive pore-air pressure will be generated. Regarding wetting tests at constant deviator stress, both unsaturated soils behave differently. Decomposed volcanic soil contracts at low net mean stress but decomposed granitic soil contracts at high net mean stress. Since the behaviour of the unsaturated loose decomposed soils is stress and path dependent, only results from relevant stress paths and stress conditions should be adopted for the design of stabilising measures. An elasto-plastic constitutive model for unsaturated soils was proposed in this study. The proposed model is formulated using independent stress state variables and state-dependent dilatancy. Predictions from the model are in good agreement with experimental results, in particular stress-strain and axial-volumetric strain relationships, from undrained tests and constant water content tests on saturated and unsaturated loose decomposed soils, respectively. Regarding wetting tests at constant deviator stress on unsaturated specimens, the predictions underestimate suction and volumetric strain at failure. Despite this, the model is able to capture the stress and path dependent volumetric behaviour of the saturated and unsaturated loose decomposed soils...|$|E

In {{order to provide}} better {{information}} on veneer production and utilization, in this {{study the effects of}} wood juvenility and veneer thickness on lathe checks of rotary-cut sengon veneers were evaluated. Before veneer manufacturing, sengon logs were boiled at 50 oC and 75 oC for 4 and 8 hours respectively. The boiled logs were peeled to produce veneer of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, 2 mm in thickness. Lathe checks of veneers were measured on the <b>loosed</b> <b>side</b> at every 5 mm veneer length under an optical video microscope and their frequency, depth, and length were characterized. Twenty sampling points of 5 mm veneer length were prepared from each segmented ring of 1 cm width from pith to bark. Isocyanate resin adhesive were used to produce laminated veneer lumber (LVL) of 20 mm thick, which consisted of 24 -ply of 1 mm veneer thick, 14 -ply of 1. 5 mm veneer thick, and 11 -ply of 2 mm veneer thick, for glue bond and bending strength test. Results showed that wood juvenility and veneer thickness determined the frequency, depth and length of lathe checks for the sengon rotary-cut veneers. In general, the frequency of lathe checks of the veneer increases with increasing veneer thickness, and also increases from pith to bark. Boiling of logs before rotary-cutting could decreases the frequency of lathe check of the veneer. The results indicated that boiling of logs at 50 oC for 8 h and at 75 oC at least 4 h before peeling the logs could minimize the frequency of lathe check in manufacturing rotary cut veneer thickness of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, and 2 mm from juvenile wood of fast growing sengon. The frequency of lathe check affect significantly the glue bond and bending strength, in which the glue bond, Modulus of Elasticity (MOE), and Modulus of Rupture (MOR) decrease as the frequency of lathe checks increases.
