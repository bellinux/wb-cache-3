40|$|Yeast culture. We {{started with}} the USY 6 strain bearing HHF 2 and Myc-HHT 2 driven by the pHHT 2 promoter, and an {{integrated}} copy of HHF 1 and Flag-HHT 1 driven by the GAL 1 - 10 promoter (1). BAR 1 was deleted using the Kanamycin marker to create strain MDY 510, which {{was used for the}} majority of experiments described in this manuscript. MDY 513 was further modified by deletion of HTZ 1 with the Hygromycin marker. For time courses of induction in unsynchronized yeast, batches of 400 mL of MDY 510 cells were grown in YP + 2 % raffinose medium to an A 600 OD of 0. 6 - 0. 9 in 2 L flasks shaking at 200 rpm in a 28 °C water bath. Cells were collected by filtration and resuspended in YP + 2 % galactose. At varying times after galactose induction, 100 mL of cells were removed to another flask and 37 % formaldehyde was added to a 1 % final concentration. Cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 28 °C, shaking, at 200 rpm. 2. 5 M glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mM to quench the formaldehyde. The cells were inverted and then <b>let</b> <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> 25 °C for 5 minutes.

40|$|Antisera {{produced}} in rabbits by injection of pneumococcus in the R phase, or S phase {{as it has}} been termed by Dawson (1), have been examined mainly for their protective power (2). Since this proved to be low against the virulent S phase (Dawson M) little more has been recorded. However, in a study of an absolute, quantitative method for the estimation of agglutinins (3) it was found that accurate results could be obtained with pneumococcus R (Dawson S) {{as well as with the}} M phase (3, 4). The behavior of a number of anti-R (S) sera was studied with suspensions of acid-killed, heat-killed, and formalinized R (S) pneumococci, and quantitative precipitin estimations were also made with pneumococcus C substance (5). Relationships brought to light by this study are recorded in the present paper. EXPEI ~ IME.

30|$|Fractured {{reservoirs}} {{contain a}} large {{fraction of the}} world supply of oil and imbibition {{is one of the}} dominant recovery mechanisms. For fractured reservoirs containing heavy oils or tars, oil viscosity is high and it is hard to get a good development effect at reservoir temperature. However, if thermal methods are adopted, the oil viscosity will decrease sharply as temperature goes on and the oil recovery will increase on the contrary due to capillary imbibition. In this paper, fracture is created by wrapping the core with a steel wire mesh. Before flooding, cores are <b>let</b> to <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> the experimental temperature to eliminate the effect of thermal expansion on oil recovery. Considering that oil volume recovered is very small, a high precision electronic balance is used to weigh the oil and then calculate the oil volume. Different factors including contact area, matrix permeability, oil viscosity, water injection rate, temperature of the injected fluid and wettability of the core are all investigated. Results of this work should be helpful for the better understanding of the capillary imbibition in the development of fractured heavy oil reservoir.|$|R
6000|$|The {{standing}} of Joshua here is as men used to stand that were arraigned before a judge. 'Joshua {{stood before the}} angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him' (v 1). The same posture as Judas stood in when {{he was to be}} condemned. 'Set thou,' said David, 'a wicked man over him; and <b>let</b> Satan <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> his right hand' (Psa 109:6). Thus, therefore, Joshua stood. Now Joshua was clothed, not with righteousness, but with filthy rags! Sin upon him, and Satan by him, and this before the angel! What must he do now? Go away? No; there he must stand! Can he speak for himself? Not a word; guilt had made him dumb! (Isa 53:12). Had he no place clean? No; he was clothed with filthy garments! But his lot was to stand before Jesus Christ, that maketh intercession for transgressors. 'And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee' (Zech 3:2). Thus Christ saveth from present condemnation those that be still in their sin and blood.[17] ...|$|R

40|$|Thermo-reversible gels are solvent-filled 3 D {{networks}} of polymer chains interconnected by physical (transient) crosslinks. On applying a high shear stress, the crosslinks are broken and these gels show a typical stress-strain behavior due to cohesive fracture of the gel. When heated above a critical temperature and cooled back to room temperature, all the crosslinks are re-formed. Interestingly, partial to full recovery of broken crosslinks is also observed by simply <b>letting</b> the gel <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> room temperature. In this study, the fracture and healing {{behavior of a}} model acrylic triblock copolymer gel has been characterized by shear rheometry. A mathematical model has also been proposed {{to better understand the}} mechanics at the molecular level and predict the healing time of a system. A rheo-PIV system was built as part of the project, to observe and confirm the bulk healing process in situ. Spontaneous self-healing behavior has immense potential in controlled drug delivery systems, coatings, food and various other applications. ...|$|R
