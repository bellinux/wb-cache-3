After {{standing}} perfectly still with his neck stretched to its full height until {{he was sure that}} no danger was near, Longlegs waded into the water a few steps, folded his neck back on his shoulders until his long bill seemed to rest on his breast, and then remained as motionless as if there were no life in him. Peter also sat perfectly still. By and by he began to wonder if Longlegs had gone to sleep. His own patience was reaching an end and he was just about to go on in search of Rattles the Kingfisher when like a flash the dagger-like bill of Longlegs shot out and down into the water. When he withdrew it Peter saw that Longlegs had caught a little fish which he at once proceeded to swallow head-first.

50|$|In cotinga species {{where only}} the females {{care for the}} eggs and young, the males have {{striking}} courtship displays, often grouped together in leks.

Other lekking cotingids like the bellbirds and screaming piha, have distinctive and far-carrying calls. In such canopy-dwelling genera as Carpodectes, Cotinga, and Xipholena, males gather high in a single tree or in adjacent trees, but male cocks-of-the-rock, as befits their more terrestrial lives, give their elaborate displays in leks on the ground.|$|E

40|$|We use mergers of {{microstate}}s {{to obtain}} the first smooth horizonless microstate solutions corresponding to a BPS three-charge black hole with a classically large horizon area. These microstates have very <b>long</b> <b>throats,</b> that become infinite in the classical limit; never the less, their curvature is everywhere small. Having a classically-infinite throat makes these microstates {{very similar to the}} typical microstates of this black hole. A rough CFT analysis confirms this intuition, and indicates a possible class of dual CFT microstates. We also analyze the properties and the merging of microstates corresponding to zero-entropy BPS black holes and black rings. We find that these solutions have {{the same size as the}} horizon size of their classical counterparts, and we examine the changes of internal structure of these microstates during mergers...|$|R

40|$|The {{geometry}} of the D 1 -D 5 system with a small angular momentum j has a <b>long</b> <b>throat</b> ending in a conical defect.

The length of the throat for j= 1 / 2 equals n_ 1 n_ 5 R, the length of the effective string in the CFT; we also find that at this distance the incident wave becomes nonlinear.

40|$|We derive the {{equations}} for the nonsupersymmetric vacua of D 3 -branes {{in the presence}} of nonperturbative moduli stabilization in type IIB flux compactifications, and solve and analyze them in the case of two particular 7 -brane embeddings {{at the bottom of the}} warped deformed conifold. In the limit of large volume and <b>long</b> <b>throat,</b> we obtain vacua by imposing a constraint on the 7 -brane embedding. These vacua fill out continuous spaces of higher dimension than the corresponding supersymmetric vacua, and have negative effective cosmological constant. Perturbative stability of these vacua is possible but not generic. Finally, we argue that anti-D 3 -branes at the tip of the conifold share the same vacua as D 3 -branes.

40|$|Generic {{classes of}} string compactifications include ``brane throats'' {{emanating from the}} compact {{dimensions}} and separated by effective potential barriers raised by the background gravitational fields. The interaction of observers inside different throats occurs via tunnelling and is consequently weak. This provides a new mechanism for generating small numbers in Nature. We apply it to the hierarchy problem, where supersymmetry breaking near the unification scale causes TeV sparticle masses inside the standard model throat. We also design naturally long-lived cold dark matter which decays within a Hubble time to the approximate conformal matter of a <b>long</b> <b>throat.</b> This may soften structure formation at galactic scales and {{raises the possibility that}} much of the dark matter of the universe is conformal matter. Finally, the tunnelling rate shows that the coupling between throats, mediated by bulk modes, is stronger than a naive application of holography suggests. Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures.

40|$|We {{construct}} explicit {{examples of}} globally regular static, spherically symmetric solutions {{of general relativity}} with a phantom scalar field {{as the source of}} gravity, describing traversable wormholes with flat asymptotic regions {{on both sides of the}} throat as well as regular black holes, in particular, those called black universes. To explain why such phantom fields are not observed under usual conditions, we invoke the concept of "invisible ghosts," which means that the phantom field decays quickly enough at infinity and is there too weak to be observed. This approach leads to wormhole models in which the spherical radius is almost constant in some range of the radial coordinate near the throat, forming a "long throat". We discuss the peculiar features and difficulties of the stability problem for such configurations. It is shown that the limiting case of a "maximally long throat" has the form of an unstable model with the Nariai metric. This allows us to conjecture that a <b>long</b> <b>throat</b> does not stabilize wormholes with a scalar source. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures. 2 references and a comment adde...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} 10 D {{equation}} of motion of dilaton-axion fluctuations in type IIB string compactifications with three-form flux, taking warping into account. Using simplified models with physics comparable to actual compactifications, we argue that the lightest mode localizes in long warped throats and takes a mass of order the warped string scale. Also, Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential is valid for the lightest mass mode; however, the mass {{is similar to the}} Kaluza-Klein scale, so the dilaton-axion should be integrated out of the effective theory in this <b>long</b> <b>throat</b> regime (leaving a constant superpotential). On the other hand, there is a large hierarchy between flux-induced and KK mass scales for moderate or weak warping. This hierarchy agrees with arguments given for trivial warping. Along the way, we also estimate the effect of the other 10 D supergravity equations of motion on the dilaton-axion fluctuation, since these equations act as constraints. We argue that they give negligible corrections to the simplest approximation.
