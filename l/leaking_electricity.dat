5000|$|Standby power, {{also called}} vampire power, vampire draw, phantom load, ghost load or <b>leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> ("phantom load" [...] and [...] "leaking electricity" [...] are defined {{technical}} terms with other meanings, adopted for this different purpose), {{refers to the}} way electric power consumed by electronic and electrical appliances while they are switched off (but are designed to draw some power) or in a standby mode. This only occurs because some devices claimed to be [...] "switched off" [...] on the electronic interface, but are in a different state from switching off at the plug, or disconnecting from the power point, which can {{solve the problem of}} standby power completely. In fact, switching off at the power point is effective enough, {{there is no need to}} disconnect all devices from the power point. Some such devices offer remote controls and digital clock features to the user, while other devices, such as power adapters for disconnected electronic devices, consume power without offering any features (sometimes called no-load power). All of the above examples, such as the remote control, digital clock functions and—in the case of adapters, no-load power—are switched off just by switching off at the power point. However, for some devices with built-in internal battery, such as a phone, the standby functions can be stopped by removing the battery instead.|$|E
40|$|Standby {{electricity}} use or <b>leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> is the energy consumed by appliances {{when they are}} switched off or not performing their principal function. The combination of field measurements and estimates of appliance saturation suggests that the average U. S. house leaks constantly about 50 Watts. This is approximately {{five percent of the}} residential {{electricity use}} in the U. S. <b>Leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> falls into three major categories: video, audio and communication. Video equipment such as TVs, VCRs, cable boxes and satellite earth stations account for the largest share of residential <b>leaking</b> <b>electricity,</b> approximately 35 percent. Audio equipment accounts for 25 percent of standby consumption, and communication devices (answering machines, cordless phones and fax machines) are responsible for an additional 10 percent. We present detailed field measurements for TVs, VCRs, Compact Audio Systems, Cable Boxes and Digital Satellite Earth Stations. There are several different approaches to reduce <b>leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> including: redesigning appliance circuits, replacing linear transformer with more efficient switched mode power supplies, adding an energy saving circuit to the appliance, or simply raising consumer and manufacturer awareness. Redesigning appliance circuits can reduce standby consumption up to 90 percent. <b>Leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> is likely to increase as a new generation of consumer electronics penetrates the market. To reduce <b>leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> in the future all the possible policies have to be taken into account. This is a global problem and therefore close international cooperation is important...|$|E
40|$|<b>Leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> is {{the energy}} {{consumed}} by appliances {{when they are}} switched off or not performing their principal functions. Field measurements in Florida, California, and Japan show that <b>leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> represents 50 to 100 Watts in typical homes, corresponding to about 5 GW of total electricity demand in the United States. There are three strategies to reduce leaking electricity: eliminate leakage entirely, eliminate constant leakage and replace with intermittent charge plus storage, and improve efficiency of conversion. These options are constrained by the low value of energy savings-less than $ 5 per saved Watt. Some technical and lifestyle solutions are proposed. 13 refs., 1 fig., 2 tabs...|$|E
6000|$|The surgeon--a probationer--performed an {{amputation}} single-handed in {{the wreckage}} by the bridge, and by his [...] "wonderful skill, resource, and unceasing care and devotion undoubtedly saved {{the lives of the}} many seriously wounded men." [...] That no horror might be lacking, there was [...] "a short circuit among the bridge wreckage for a considerable time." [...] The searchlight and wireless were tangled up together, and the <b>electricity</b> <b>leaked</b> into everything.|$|R
50|$|Chillicothe Municipal Utilities (CMU) in Chillicothe, Missouri {{implemented}} the Mi.Net AMI system {{as part of}} its initiative to replace over 4,000 water and electricity meters in its system, with the goals of improving customer service, automating meter reading and billing, and preparing to meet future service demands. The Mi.Net AMI system has improved conservation of both water and electricity by providing both CMU and customers with a nearly real-time monitoring capability of usage, which improves consumer awareness of consumption and more immediate notice of potential water <b>leaks</b> and <b>electricity</b> outages to the utility provider. CMU's system upgrade also increased its revenues by reducing the lag time between the beginning of meter reading and the issuance of bills from 15 days to three.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the local}} fire crew {{arrived on the}} scene five minutes after the derailment, fireballs were {{exploding}} up to 300 feet (90 m) high that were visible for nearly 13 miles (21 km). Fire spread to a nearby feed mill and storage building that were both difficult to access by the fire crew because the derailed train was blocking the grade crossing. High tension power lines were also torn down by the derailment, which caused secondary electrical fires. In total, seven of the tank cars of LPG and propane leaked, and the two sodium hydroxide tank cars <b>leaked</b> their contents. <b>Electricity</b> and natural gas service to 25% of the city of Weyauwega was disrupted, and city water services had to be shut off because of a rupture in a water main.|$|R
40|$|Many {{types of}} home {{electronic}} equipment draw electric power when switched off or not performing their principal functions. Standby power use (or ''leaking electricity'') for most appliances ranges from 1 - 20 watts. Even though standby use of each device is small, the combined standby power {{use of all}} appliances in a home can easily exceed 50 watts. <b>Leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> is already responsible for 5 to 10 percent of residential electricity use in the United States and over 10 percent in Japan. An increasing number of white goods also have standby power requirements. There is a growing international effort to limit standby power to around one watt per device. New and existing technologies are available to meet this target at little or no extra cost...|$|E
40|$|Electronics play an {{increasingly}} pervasive role in home appliances and office equipment. This is generally {{a good thing}} because the electronics help provide new features and amenities. Electronic controls can also reduce energy use by providing the services only when consumers actually need them. On the other hand, these electronic features often continue to consume energy even while switched off or not performing their principal service. The technical term for this phenomenon is ''standby power consumption'' but it has acquired several common names, including ''leaking electricity,'' ''waiting electricity,'' ''free-running power,'' ''off-mode power,'' and ''phantom loads. '' The <b>leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> found in our televisions, VCRs, garage door openers, cordless phones and many other appliances has a surprisingly large impact on the global environment...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the work performed at Berkeley Lab most recently. One of the Labs accomplishments is {{the publication of}} Scenarios of US Carbon Reductions, {{an analysis of the}} potential of energy technologies to reduce carbon emissions in the US. This analysis is described and {{played a key role in}} shaping the US position on climate change in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations. The Labs participation in the fundamental characterization of the climate change issue by the IPCC is described. Described also is a study of <b>leaking</b> <b>electricity,</b> which is stimulating an international campaign for a one-watt ceiling for standby electricity losses from appliances. This ceiling has the potential to save two-thirds of the 5 % of US residential electricity currently expended on standby losses. The 54 vignettes contained in the report summarize results of research activities ranging in scale from calculating the efficacy of individual lamp ballasts to estimating the cost-effectiveness of the national Energy Star{reg_sign} labeling program, and ranging in location from a scoping study of energy-efficiency market transformation in California to development of an energy-efficiency project in the auto parts industry in Shandong Province, China...|$|E

[...] {{interrupted}} the marine; [...] "that is all simple enough; you can store electricity {{and send it}} all over the world, if you like; in places like Calcutta, I think it must be cheaper to buy it than to make it.

Minimally invasive techniques have come into play to reduce these concerns and smooth the evolution of abdominal surgery to a scarless process where nearly all surgeries can be performed without a skin incision. Technology continually advances the frontier of development of novel surgical devices to implement less invasive surgical techniques. ^ Fusion of robotics and Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has created new opportunities to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

However, with miniaturization of surgical robots there comes a trade-off between {{the size of the}} robot and its capability. Miniature electric motors have been mostly used in many in-vivo robots as the main means of actuation. Slow actuation, low load capacity, sterilization difficulty, <b>leaking</b> <b>electricity</b> and transferring produced heat to tissues, and high cost are the key limitations of use of electric motors in in-vivo applications. ^ The research described here presents an alternative actuation scheme to overcome these limitations by taking advantage of the inherent high power density of fluidic actuators to develop two different types of in-vivo robotic systems: a robot arm with a multifunctional manipulator for Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), and a fluidic disposable self-propelling self-steering robot for colonoscopy. ^ To create a fully hydraulically-driven surgical robot, it was first necessary to build new fluidic actuators according to design requirements.
