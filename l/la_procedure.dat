40|$|Objective. Despite {{the use of}} anticoagulation during left atrial (<b>LA)</b> {{ablation}} <b>procedures,</b> ischemic {{cerebrovascular accidents}} (CVAs) are recognized as a serious complication.

40|$|Purpose of Impact Assessments The {{purpose of}} Impact Assessments (lAs) is to {{reconcile}} society's needs for development with its need to conserve the environment. lA aims to assist planners to devise solutions that are sustainable and equitable, but still efficient. lA falls short In practice, {{the influence of}} lA on the planning process has been called into question: its recommendations are not always implemented, {{and some of its}} mitigatory measures have been narrow and naive. The gap between lA principles and lA praxis needs to be bridged by more effective procedures. Faulty problem formulation In this dissertation it is mooted that conventional <b>lA,</b> <b>procedures,</b> including the 1992 Integrated Environmental Management procedure, pay inadequate attention to the formulation of problems. There is a danger that lAs may focus on the wrong problem, or may misconstrue the right problem. Weak problem conception may then give birth to less than optimal solutions. Flawed solutions Following the lA for Contract 1000 (access roads to the Mohale Dam), only two alternative solutions were presented to the decision-maker for consideration. Of these, the LCAR is likely to be rejected because it is associated with high risks to the integrity of the biophysical environment, and because it costs M 47 million (Malotis) more to construct than does the WAR. By default, the WAR is likely to become the preferred alternative; however it is unable to address some of the fundamental problems in the project area. Selection of the WAR as the access route for transporting materials to the Mohale Dam site "creates" groups of winners and losers in the affected society. In addition, failure to build the LCAR is equivalent to a lost opportunity (ie it represents an opportunity cost) for certain other groups of "losers" [see Table Sl]. The WAR, the best solution that conventional lA could generate, is manifestly a less-than-optimal solution. A problem-solving approach Analyses of the actual procedure followed during the lA for Contract 1000, and of the conventional approach to lA (according to the literature) point to the failure of <b>lA</b> <b>procedures</b> to recognise certain crucial features of environmental problems. <b>lA</b> <b>procedures</b> are not adapted to the dynamism or the complexity of environmental problems, and are not adequately designed to take into account interrrelationships (linkages) among either affected environments or among particular problems. lA is also in danger of becoming divorced from its political ("real world") context. In an attempt to address these failings of lA, a problem-solving approach to lA is developed. The new approach to lA is based on the 1992 IEM procedure, but is supplemented by elements of the natural human problem-solving process [after Miller 1985], and is also informed by Hill and Fuggle's [1990] classification of types and levels of alternatives...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: {{to examine}} the effects of type of {{anaesthesia}} on cerebral blood flow during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Design: prospective randomised study. Methods: thirty-four CEA procedures under local anaesthesia (LA) are compared to 33 procedures under general anaesthesia (GA). Mean middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAVmean) was monitored using Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) assessed by continuous intra-arterial blood pressure transducer. Results: pre-op MCAVmean and MAP were similar in both groups. Pre-clamp MCAVmean was similar in both groups and did not differ from pre-op values. With carotid clamping the MCAVmean significantly dropped in both groups. The post-clamp MCAVmean was significantly less in the GA group (p < 0. 05), and the percentage reduction in MCAVmean significantly more for GA procedures (p < 0. 05). Pre-clamp MAP was significantly elevated in <b>LA</b> <b>procedures</b> and significantly lowered in GA procedures. Pre-clamp MAP was significant less for GA procedures (p < 0. 001). Post clamp MAP did not differ from pre-clamp levels in either group. There was no correlation between MCAVmean and MAP. Complication rate, combined death/stroke rates were similar in each group. Conclusion: LA CEA is associated with better preservation of the ipsilateral cerebral circulation and increased tolerance of the effects of carotid clamping. Changes in MCAVmean cannot be explained by variations in blood pressure between the two techniques...|$|R

Lorsque le scrutin risque d'être serré, ces quarante-huit heures peuvent être mise à profit par le gouvernement pour convaincre quelques indécis de ne pas la voter. La {{constitution}} empêche ainsi le système de l'interpellation qui avait cours sous la IIIe République, lorsqu'un seul député pouvait « interpeller » le gouvernement, et la Chambre voter après débat un texte qui, lorsqu'il était défavorable au gouvernement, entraînait son départ. La [...] République prévoyait déjà un jour franc entre le dépôt de la motion et son vote.Ensuite, en imposant un vote en faveur de la motion par la majorité des membres de l'Assemblée.

Le système ne laisse pas la place à l'abstention : un député peut voter la motion, ou ne pas la voter, auquel cas il est réputé ne pas souhaiter le renversement du gouvernement. On dit d'ailleurs qu'une motion qu'elle n'est pas adoptée, signifiant par là qu'elle n'a pas atteint la majorité, et non qu'elle est rejetée, ce qui voudrait dire qu'une majorité s'est déclarée contre or, seuls votent les partisans de la motion.

To contribute to this topic, we examined 300 data log files from patients treated with the Spectra Optia from November 2015 until October 2016. Of these 300 procedures, 149 secondary plasma treatments were conducted in 13 patients (76 immunoadsorption [IA] and 73 lipoprotein apheresis [LA]). Nine patients had IA due to transplantation and autoimmune diseases. Four patients were treated with LA after heart transplantation. Of the procedures, 62 % were performed using peripheral venous access, even in patients with a low inlet blood flow. A central catheter was required only in 15 % cases, and an arteriovenous fistula in 23 % of the procedures. Anticoagulation management differed in both <b>procedures.</b> The <b>LA</b> <b>procedures</b> required a higher amount of citrate as they were performed using only citrate. The IA procedures required less citrate because a mixture of citrate and heparin was used. We did not observe clotting or bleeding, regardless of heparin use. Due to strict calcium management, no patient showed signs of hypocalcemia. Despite our apheresis management, four procedures had to be canceled preliminarily due to patient complications. The targeted substances could be reduced significantly: lipoprotein (a) (Lpa) level by 68 % (76 %– 45 %), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol by 57 % (64 %– 37 %), and IgG from 6. 6 (1. 09 – 21. 0) to 2. 61 (0. 33 – 14. 7) g/l.

BackgroundThrombus formation is a risk associated with <b>LA</b> ablation <b>procedures.</b> MethodsIntracardiac echocardiography imaging was performed in 232 patients (184 men, average age 55 ± 11 years) with AF undergoing pulmonary vein ostial ablation. ResultsAnticoagulation (activated clotting time > 250 s) was maintained after dual transseptal catheterization. Left atrial thrombus (n = 30) was observed in 24 of 232 patients (10. 3 %). Thrombi measured 12. 9 ± 11. 1 mm (length) and 2. 2 ± 1. 3 mm (width) and were attached to a sheath or mapping catheter. Most thrombi (27 of 30, 90 %) were eliminated from the LA by withdrawal of the sheath and catheter into the right atrium (RA). Two thrombi became wedged in the interatrial septum and incompletely withdrawn into the RA, and one was recognized only on post-procedure review of ICE images. Patients with LA thrombus had an increased LA diameter (4. 8 ± 0. 5 vs. 4. 5 ± 0. 6 cm, p < 0. 02), spontaneous echo contrast (67 % vs. 3 %, p < 0. 0001) {{and a history of}} persistent AF (29 % vs. 6 %, p < 0. 0002). Multivariate discriminant analysis showed that spontaneous echo contrast (f = 97. 9, p < 0. 0001) was the most important determinant of LA thrombus formation. No patient with LA thrombus suffered a clinical thromboembolic complication.

40|$|Cette {{introduction}} au numéro Droit et Cultures présente les travaux d’une recherche pluridisciplinaire en sciences sociales, humaines et juridiques, à partir d’une affaire criminelle, l’affaire dite d’Outreau, et plus précisément à partir d’un corpus singulier : les auditions de la commission d’enquête parlementaire créée pour rechercher « les causes des dysfonctionnements de la justice ». Après avoir présenté le dispositif des auditions nous proposons une lecture transversale de l’affaire : de l’examen de <b>la</b> <b>procédure</b> aux réformes issues des travaux parlementaires. Cette lecture s’inscrit au sein d’une temporalité qui englobe l’affaire et sa réappropriation parlementaire : le Phénomène Outreau. Cette qualification met en valeur les formes d’oralité qui caractérisent l’affaire : la parole transcrite de l’instruction, la parole contradictoire de l’audience et la parole publique des auditions. La loi du 5 mars 2007 reprend cette distinction pour réaffirmer le rôle de la parole publique et contradictoire dans la phase d’instruction et généraliser l’enregistrement audiovisuel. La réforme va dans le sens d’une protection des droits de l’accusé en insufflant à <b>la</b> <b>procédure</b> les caractères du système accusatoire : l’oralité et la publicité. Sa réalisation semble néanmoins se heurter à un lourd héritage inquisitoire. The {{article presents}} the results of a pluridisciplinary research study – in the field of social and legal sciences – concerning a criminal case, the so-called Outreau case, and more precisely about a specific corpus: the hearings before the parliamentary investigation committee created in order to investigate “the reasons for the dysfunction of the judiciary”. After presenting the organisation of hearings, we propose a transversal reading of the case: from the analysis of proceedings to the reforms resulting from parliamentary discussions. This reading is inscribed in a temporality which includes both the case and its parliamentary re-appropriation: what we denominate the Outreau phenomenon. This qualification highlights the oral forms characterising the case: the transcribed words of the instruction phase, the contradictory words of the hearings before the courts and the public words of the hearings before the parliamentary committee. The statute-law from March 5, 2007 takes over this distinction in order to reaffirm the role of the public and contradictory words in the instruction phase and to generalise the audiovisual recording. The reform tends {{to protect the rights of}} the accused by giving the procedure the characteristics of the accusatory system: the oral character and the public character. Nevertheless its implementation seems to be difficult because of the weight of the “inquisitory” procedure’s inheritance...|$|E
40|$|Appendectomies {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} practiced surgical procedures in the field of General Surgery. In Germany, around 200, 000 to 300, 000 appendectomies are carried out every year. The spotlight is increasingly being turned to laparoscopic surgeries as time progresses. It may be assumed that over one half of all appendectomies are carried out with minimal invasive procedures. Despite the large number of these operations and a large range of studies available in this regard, it is still not completely clear whether laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) enjoys greater advantages over open appendectomy (OA) which has been practiced as the standard surgical procedure for over several decades. The aim of this study was to compare the two laparoscopic procedures (endo-GIA and endo-loop) on one hand and to compare these with OA on the other hand. For this purpose, the data of 1639 patients was retrospectively assessed who underwent appendectomy between 1996 and 2005. In 930 patients, (56. 8 %), Endo-GIA was made use of whereas in 577 patients (35. 2 %) endo-loop was made use of. In 41 patients (2. 5 %), a conversion was required. In 90 cases (5. 5 %), an OA was carried out. It could be shown that LA could be carried out very efficiently with respect to the OP and inpatient stay duration. The shortest OP duration on average was noted for LA with endo-GIA (26. 6 min), followed by OA (30. 6 min.) and LA with endo-loop (33. 3 Min.). The shortest average inpatient stay period was noted for the operation with endo-loop (5. 0 days), followed by endo-GIA (6. 3 days) and OA (7. 1 days). Only in a very small number of cases, negative appendectomies were recorded (3 percent). The perforation rate was also very low (7 to 9 percent). Conversions were required only in a few cases (2. 5 %). Also in respect to the postoperative complications, the <b>LA</b> <b>procedure</b> showed some good results. Wound infections, in particular, were very rare (0. 4 % with endo-loop; 0. 6 % with endo-GIA; 2. 2 % in case of OA). Cases of intra-abdominal abscesses were observed as frequently for the <b>LA</b> <b>procedure</b> as for OA (1. 2 % with endo-loop; 0. 9 % with endo-GIA; 1. 1 % with OA). Most of the appendectomies were carried out by senior physicians (79. 9 %). However, 152 patients (9. 3 %) were operated by assistant doctors. This factor had no undesirable influence on the outcome of the OP. The OP duration was, however, longer for patients operated by assistant doctors (12. 1 minutes longer on average) than for patients operated by the experienced senior physicians. No negative effect was noted on the inpatient stay duration however. The rate of postoperative complications was slightly lower in patients operated by the assistant doctors (1. 3 % lower) than in the other group of patients (4. 9 % to 5. 6 %). When the results of the intra-operative macroscopic diagnosis were compared with the histological findings, it was noted that in over one half of the cases with macroscopically bland appendix, the patient was suffering from appendicitis. The frequently expressed hypothesis that the perforation risk rises with increasing latency could not be confirmed. The interval between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation did not exhibit a clear trend. On the whole, it could be shown that laparoscopic appendectomy can also be carried out efficiently and safely. This also applies to the cost-efficient <b>LA</b> <b>procedure</b> involving endo-loop. The laparoscopic surgical procedure shall be considered at least on par with OA. With respect to the cosmetic results and differential diagnosis however, LA is indeed a more preferable surgical procedure. Given the fact that laparoscopic operations are becoming more common with time, we recommend the LA which is also suitable as a low-risk beginner’s operation...|$|E

This method, performed in homogeneous phase, affords optimal sizes and high quantum yields for each application desired. It is an a <b>la</b> carte <b>procedure</b> for the synthesis of nanoparticles aimed at their later application. By controlling the experimental conditions, CdSe QDs of sizes ranging between 2 and 6 [*]nm can be obtained. The best results were achieved in an ice-bath thermostated at 4 °C, using mercaptoacetic acid as dispersant. Under these conditions, a slow growth of quantum nanocrystals was generated and this was controlled kinetically by the hydrolysis of SeSO 32 - to generate Se 2 - [*][*]in situ, one of the forming species of the nanocrystal. The organic dispersant mercaptoacetate covalently binds to the Cd 2 + ion, modifying the diffusion rate of the cation, and {{plays a key role}} in the stabilization of CdSe QDs. In optimum conditions, when kept in their own solution CdSe QDs remain dispersed over 4 months. The NPs obtained under optimal conditions show high fluorescence, which is a great advantage as regards their applications. The quantum efficiency is also high, owing to the formation under certain conditions of a nanoshell of Cd(OH) 2, values of 60 % being reached...|$|R
40|$|Homing endonucleases {{recognize}} long target DNA sequences generating {{an accurate}} double-strand break that promotes gene targeting through homologous recombination. We have modified the homodimeric I-CreI endonuclease through protein engineering to target a specific DNA sequence within the human RAG 1 gene. Mutations in RAG 1 produce {{severe combined immunodeficiency}} (SCID), a monogenic disease leading to defective immune response in the individuals, leaving them vulnerable to infectious diseases. The structures of two engineered heterodimeric variants and one single-chain variant of I-CreI, in complex with a 24 -bp oligonucleotide of the human RAG 1 gene sequence, show how the DNA binding is achieved through interactions in the major groove. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} G 19 S mutation in the neighborhood of the catalytic site lowers the reaction energy barrier for DNA cleavage without compromising DNA recognition. Gene-targeting experiments in human cell lines show that the designed single-chain molecule preserves its in vivo activity with higher specificity, further enhanced by the G 19 S mutation. This {{is the first time that}} an engineered meganuclease variant targets the human RAG 1 locus by stimulating homologous recombination in human cell lines up to 265 [*]bp away from the cleavage site. Our analysis illustrates the key features for à <b>la</b> carte <b>procedure</b> in protein–DNA recognition design, opening new possibilities for SCID patients whose illness can be treated ex vivo...|$|R

This text resumes the main basic principles affecting {{the composition of the}} fish body. Contrary to normal thinking, nutritional factors have a limited influence over the final composition of fish. Besides this, new alternatives on fish feed formulations are arising due to the present global situation of its raw materials, such as fish oil and fishmeal. New feed composition has to be adapted with efficiency but paying attention to its influence on the organoleptic parameters of the fish flesh.
