5000|$|There {{have been}} {{persistent}} {{reports of a}} belief among {{some members of the}} United States Armed Forces that the use of [...]50 BMG in a direct antipersonnel role is somehow prohibited by the laws of war. This is incorrect and has been characterized as a myth; writing for the Marine Corps Gazette, Maj. Hays Parks states that [...] "No treaty language exists (either generally or specifically) to support a <b>limitation</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> of [...]50 BMG against personnel, and its widespread, longstanding use in this role suggests that such antipersonnel employment is the customary practice of nations." [...] Parks theorizes that the myth originated in historical doctrine discouraging the use of the M8C spotting rifle—an integral [...]50-caliber aiming aid for the M40 recoilless rifle—in the antipersonnel role. This limitation was entirely tactical in nature, having been intended to help conceal the vulnerable M40 and its crew from the enemy before the main anti-tank gun could be fired, but some personnel may have erroneously assumed the existence of a legal limitation on the use of [...]50-caliber projectiles more generally.|$|E

It is used by many armies around the world both in regular forces and in special forces units.
