Smooth toadfish (Tetractenos glaber), commonly found in estuaries in south-eastern Australia, were separately exposed to radio-labelled seawater (14 kBq L- 1 of 109 Cd and 24 kBq g- 1 75 Se) and food (ghost shrimps; Trypaea australiensis: 875 Bq g- 1 109 Cd and 1130 Bq g- 1 75 Se) for 25 days (uptake phase), followed by exposure to radionuclide-free water or food for 30 days (<b>loss</b> <b>phase).</b> Toadfish accumulated 109 Cd predominantly from water (85 %) and 75 Se predominantly from food (62 %), although the latter was lower than expected. For both the water and food exposures, 109 Cd was predominantly located in the gut lining (60 e 75 %) {{at the end of the}} uptake phase, suggesting that the gut may be the primary pathway of 109 Cd uptake. This may be attributed to toadfish drinking large volumes of water to maintain osmoregulation.

40|$|Background: Up to a {{third of}} {{children}} and adolescents in Europe are overweight. Metabolic processes and bodyweight are influenced by chronobiology – the adaptation of organisms to rhythmic processes. Chronobiology discriminates between different sleep-wake-rhythms, known as chronotypes. During adolescence chronotypes become delayed and thus the discrepancy between the chronotype and the socially forced sleep-awake-time increases with age. This misalignment between social time (sleep time during the week) and biological time (sleep time during the weekend), also called “social jetlag”, can be a risk factor for obesity. Our two studies investigated the influence of chronobiology on the body weight of children and adolescents. Methods: The chronotype was defined by the mid-sleep-time (time point), a cardinal variable that can be compared by the terms “earlier” and “later”. The chronotypes vary from very early (“larks”) to very late (“owls”). The Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) was used to examine children and adolescents aged between 10 to 18 years. In the cross-sectional study overweight or obese patients (n= 83) and a normal weight control group (n= 128) were questioned. The longitudinal study included 97 obese patients, who were questioned before, immediately after and one year after a structured weight loss period. Results: In both the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies the age of the subjects positively correlated with later chronotypes and increased social jetlag. In the cross-sectional study male subjects had a later chronotype than female subjects. Within the longitudinal study patients with earlier chronotypes prior to the weight <b>loss</b> <b>phase</b> lost more weight during the structured weight <b>loss</b> <b>phase</b> than patients with later chronotypes. Besides initial bodyweight, chronotype had the largest influence on weight reduction. Subjects with earlier chronotypes had more exposure to light after the weight reduction phase. Patients showed increased sleep duration and less social jetlag during the weight <b>loss</b> <b>phase</b> in comparison to pre- and post-therapeutic phases. Conclusion: Chronotype has a significant effect on weight reduction in children and adolescents. Patients with a sleep-wake-rhythm in accordance with their individual chronotype showed greater weight reduction. We conclude that the adaptation of sleep-wake-rhythms towards individual chronotypes should play a greater role in obtaining more effective weight reduction. Desynchronization should be avoided, especially in adolescents with a relatively late chronotype. Attention should be paid to sufficient natural light exposure and avoidance of blue light (LED-screens of TVs, computers, smartphones) in the evening...|$|E

The sample of practices represents approximately 15 % of those following the common protocol at the time of assessment. Setting: 25 general practices and 2 hospital clinics in the UK. Subjects: 818 obese patients registered with the practices or under medical referral to the hospital clinics The medical conditions ranged from apparently uncomplicated obesity to severely medically compromised patients, all treated under closely monitored conditions. Initial BMIs ranged from 24. 4 to 78. 7. Interventions: Three, phased protocols, for weight loss, transitional refeeding and weight maintenance.

40|$|Central compact objects (CCOs) {{are thought}} to be young {{thermally}} emitting isolated neutron stars that were born during the preceding core-collapse supernova explosion. Here we present evidence that at least in one case the CCO could have been formed within a binary system. We show that the highly reddened optical source IRAS 17287 - 3443, located 25 ^" away from the CCO candidate XMMUJ 173203. 3 - 344518 and classified previously as a post asymptotic giant branch star, is indeed surrounded by a dust shell. This shell is heated by the central star to temperatures of ∼ 90 K and observed as extended infrared emission in 8 - 160 μm band. The dust temperature also increases {{in the vicinity of the}} CCO which implies that it likely resides within the shell. We estimate the total dust mass to be ∼ 0. 4 - 1. 5 M_ which significantly exceeds expected dust yields by normal stars and thus likely condensed from supernova ejecta. Taking into account that both the age of the supernova remnant and the duration of active mass <b>loss</b> <b>phase</b> by the optical star are much shorter than the total lifetime of either object, the supernova and the onset of the active mass <b>loss</b> <b>phase</b> of the companion have likely occurred approximately simultaneously.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of entangled states of light over long distances {{is a major}} challenge {{in the field of}} quantum information.

We evaluated the colonization time required for the developmental phase to change, as well as related limnological variables. Methods Samplings were carried out weekly, totaling 98 days of substrates exposure. We analyzed the limnological and periphyton variables (chlorophyll a, ash free dry mass, net and gross accrual rate). Results Maximum biomass occurred on the 42 nd day in rainy season and on the 98 th day in dry season. In the rainy season, the exponential phase of biomass accrual continued until the 28 th day of colonization, followed by a fluctuation phase (35 th to 77 th day) and then a <b>loss</b> <b>phase</b> (84 th to 98 th days). In the dry season, the exponential phase continued until the 35 th day, followed by a <b>loss</b> <b>phase</b> (42 th to 63 rd day) and then a fluctuation phase (70 th and 77 th day). In the same season, we observed {{the beginning of a}} new exponential phase (84 th to 98 th day). The biomass peak was recorded on the 42 nd colonization day in the rainy season and on the 98 th day in the dry season. Biomass and gross and net accrual were higher in the dry season than in the rainy season. Conclusions Periphyton biomass and net and gross accrual rates were higher during the dry season, which was characterized by high total nitrogen concentration, water transparency and low rainfall. We concluded that periphyton biomass accrual and the duration of the developmental phases (exponential, loss and fluctuation) changed with variations in limnological conditions in each climatic period in the tropical shallow reservoir studied...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{contains the}} crucial {{data for the}} Lose, Restore and Maintain (LRM) concept, a practical approach for reversing existing osteoporosis. The LRM concept uses ovariectomy (ox) to lose bone, an anabolic agent to restore bone mass and then switches to an anti-resorptive agent to maintain bone mass. We ox'd or sham-ox'd rats for 150 days (<b>Loss</b> <b>Phase),</b> treated them with 6 mg PGE 2 /kg/d for 75 days to restore lost cancellous bone mass (Restore Phase) and then stopped PGE 2 treatment and began treatment with 1 or 5 micro-g/kg Risedronate, a bisphosphonate twice a week for 60 days (Maintain Phase). During the <b>Loss</b> <b>Phase,</b> cancellous bone volumes of the proximal tibial metaphysis (PTM) in the ox'd rat fell to 19 % of initial controls. During the Restore Phase, the PTM bone volume in ox'd rats doubled. However, when PGE 2 treatment was stopped, the PGE 2 -induced cancellous bone disappeared. In contrast, 5 micro-g of Risedronate inhibited the bone loss and maintained it at the PGE 2 treatment level. The key dynamic histomorphometry value for the restore (R) and maintenance (M) phases was the ratio of bone formation to resorption rates. The ratio was elevated to 5. 8 in the R phase and depressed to 0. 4 for no and 1 micro-g Risedronate treated M phase and to a ratio of near unity of 1. 1 for the 5 micro-g Risedronate treatment. These findings indicate that we were successful in maintaining the new PTM bone induced by PGE 2 after discontinuing PGE 2 by administering enough Risedronate, a resorption inhibitor. We concluded that the LRM concept is correct and such an approach should be considered when employing anabolic agents or growth factors {{in the treatment of}} osteoporosis. Continued use of an anabolic agent may not be appropriate because of cost, potential adverse side effects and a loss of efficacy...|$|E
