5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to <b>like</b> <b>their</b> name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to <b>like</b> <b>their</b> name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>their</b> modern counterparts, the Han-era Chinese used chopsticks as eating utensils. For {{drinking}} beverages, {{wealthy people}} during Han often used cups with golden handles and inlaid with silver.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people should}} <b>like</b> <b>their</b> name. Those {{that do not}} should not <b>like</b> <b>their</b> name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name {{relatively}} highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.|$|E
50|$|Ligurian people, {{with their}} independentistic and republican traditions, never <b>liked</b> <b>their</b> new {{political}} status, and riots sometimes exploded in Genoa.|$|R

60|$|The boys <b>liked</b> <b>their</b> new duties much. The {{work was}} hard, but pleasant. Their fellow {{officers}} were pleasant companions, and their general most kind, and genial.|$|R
5|$|During the 14th century, the tengu {{began to}} trouble {{the world outside}} of the Buddhist clergy, and <b>like</b> <b>their</b> ominous {{ancestors}} the tiāngǒu, the tengu became creatures associated with war. Legends eventually ascribed to them great knowledge {{in the art of}} skilled combat.|$|E
5|$|For use, the stamps were {{cancelled}} with a heavy, circular {{black ink}} stamp. The cancellations, <b>like</b> <b>their</b> British equivalent, {{had a number}} in the centre (between one and 135) which was different for each post office around the country.|$|E
5|$|In {{another version}} of the script, the film was to have {{concluded}} with the Maitlands, Deetzes, and Otho conducting an exorcism ritual that destroys Betelgeuse, and the Maitlands transforming into miniature versions of themselves and moving into Adam's model of their home, which they refurbish to look <b>like</b> <b>their</b> house before the Deetzes moved in.|$|E

50|$|Participants in {{one study}} were asked to imagine that {{they were at the}} beach and in the mood for ice cream. One set of {{participants}} was asked to evaluate the value of 8 ounces of ice cream sold in a 10-ounce cup; another, to evaluate 7 ounces in a 5-ounce cup; a third, to compare the two. The second group <b>liked</b> <b>their</b> overfilled cups more than the first group <b>liked</b> <b>their</b> underfilled cups; but the third group, when presented with both options, recognized that the larger portion was more valuable than the smaller one.|$|R
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>their</b> English counterparts, Welsh {{universities}} {{are able to}} charge up to £9,000 a year in tuition fees. However, Welsh students can apply for fee grants of up to £5,190, {{in addition to a}} £3,810 loan to cover these costs. This system also applies to Welsh students who study elsewhere in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead {{worked on}} The King of Limbs with {{longtime}} producer Nigel Godrich intermittently from May 2009 to January 2011. <b>Like</b> <b>their</b> sixth album, Hail to the Thief (2003), it {{was recorded in}} Los Angeles, possibly {{at the home of}} actress Drew Barrymore, who is thanked in the album's liner notes.|$|E
5|$|The SS-Frauenkops was an {{auxiliary}} reporting and clerical unit, {{which included the}} SS-Helferinnenkorps (Women Helper Corps), made up of female volunteers. Members were assigned as administrative staff and supply personnel, and served in command positions and as guards at women's concentration camps. <b>Like</b> <b>their</b> male equivalents in the SS, females participated in atrocities against Jews, Poles, and others.|$|E

5|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes. <b>Like</b> <b>their</b> amphibious tetrapod predecessors, {{they had}} lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes {{that allow the}} developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} proved successful, {{according to}} Alberts, when the released head-started iguanas reacted to predators, foraged for food, and behaved <b>like</b> <b>their</b> wild-born counterparts. This {{strategy has been}} implemented with great success with other critically endangered species of Cyclura and Ctenosaura throughout the West Indies and Central America, notably the Jamaican iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana, Ricord's iguana, Allen Cays iguana, Acklins ground iguana, and Anegada iguana.|$|E
5|$|Tim Duncan has {{two older}} sisters, Cheryl and Tricia. <b>Like</b> <b>their</b> younger brother, they were talented athletes: Cheryl was a {{champion}} swimmer before {{she became a}} nurse, and Tricia swam for the U.S. Virgin Islands at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.|$|E
50|$|Reasons for loss: At $7.99 for {{one piece}} and $8.99 for two pieces, Gold Rush overpriced the product. Although Carolyn <b>liked</b> <b>their</b> promotional scheme, their price point {{ultimately}} cost them a victory.|$|R
60|$|They <b>liked</b> <b>their</b> supper very much, and ate {{and drank}} and chatted pleasantly till all were done; then they sat round {{the fire and}} smoked sweet fern in Indian pipes till Bud had cleared away.|$|R
60|$|My {{decision}} {{gave the}} final touch to the children's happiness. They <b>liked</b> <b>their</b> shaggy father--I don't know why, but they did--and {{during the days}} of preparation their voices were filled with bird-like music. They were palpitant with joy.|$|R
5|$|After Marge leaves Bart with Nelson, Bart discovers two {{eggs in a}} bird's nest. Since he {{does not}} want the babies to die <b>like</b> <b>their</b> mother, he decides to hatch the eggs, and {{secretly}} keeps the eggs warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is proud of him. With Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from the eggs, whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.|$|E
5|$|Although early {{assertions of}} a {{distinct}} Mangalorean Catholic identity {{date from the}} migration period, a developed Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity only emerged following the captivity. The culture of Mangalorean Catholics {{is a blend of}} Mangalorean and Goan cultures. After migration, they adopted some aspects of the local Mangalorean culture, but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions, and <b>like</b> <b>their</b> Goan ancestors, modern Mangalorean Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture. The Mangalorean Catholic diaspora is mostly concentrated in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and the English-speaking world.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Imperial Japanese Navy was finally gaining {{authorization}} for its 'eight-eight battlefleet'. The , authorized in 1916, carried eight 16-inch guns <b>like</b> <b>their</b> American counterparts. The next year's naval bill authorized two more battleships {{and two more}} battlecruisers. The battleships, which became the , were to carry ten 16-inch guns. The battlecruisers, the , also carried ten 16-inch guns and were designed {{to be capable of}} 30 knots, capable of beating both the British Admiral- and the USNavy's Lexington-class battlecruisers.|$|E

50|$|Reasons for win: Although Claudia Jordan fumbled the {{presentation}} and Natalie Gublis {{did not do}} her team any favors by saying {{she wanted to get}} out of the costume, the CEO of Zappos generally <b>liked</b> <b>their</b> comic more than KOTU's.|$|R
5000|$|Reasons for loss: Despite {{a decent}} presentation, {{and the team}} {{creating}} a child-friendly mascot that Donald Jr. and Eric <b>liked,</b> <b>their</b> overall event wasn't up to the standard of Infinity's, and failed to properly demonstrate the luxury aspects of the brand.|$|R
5|$|Brodeur is {{regarded}} as an engaging raconteur in his spare time. He has hosted a street hockey tournament {{in his hometown of}} St. Leonard, Quebec, for each of the Devils' Stanley Cup championships, where he played as a forward.

He has two sisters, Line and Sylvie.|$|E
5|$|Etruscan {{architecture}} {{was created}} between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of ancient Rome finally absorbed Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood {{and other materials}} of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything <b>like</b> <b>their</b> original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources {{we have a good}} deal of information on what once existed.|$|E
5|$|Gopalam and {{his wife}} Ammi, jovial by nature, treat the couple <b>like</b> <b>their</b> own children. Although Mary finds the Hindu customs strange, she says nothing to Gopalam and Ammi because she needs her job to repay David. She vents her {{frustration}} to Rao and Devaiah, who bear it patiently. Although Sita wanted Mary to teach her music, Mary's short temper diminishes her confidence and Rao takes over her music lessons.|$|E
60|$|Amicia. I {{know nothing}} about it. I <b>liked</b> <b>their</b> shabbiness--they had only what was {{indispensable}} {{in the way of}} dress and scenery. That often pleases me: the imagination, in certain cases, is more finely persuaded by the little than by the much.|$|R

50|$|At the camps, Sting were speculating {{that the}} island was going to {{surprise}} them by swapping some team members. This eventually got them worried. The news spread to Claw's camp, and {{they were worried about}} it as well, because they really <b>liked</b> <b>their</b> team.|$|R
