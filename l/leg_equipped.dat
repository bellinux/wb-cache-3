40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} {{appropriate technology}} {{in the form of}} cosmetic and functional ankle joint for prosthetic leg user is equivalent to the K 3 level which enables ambulation with variable cadence. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the gait characteristics between transtibial amputee when wearing endoskeletal prosthetic <b>leg</b> <b>equipped</b> with a multi-axis and energy store-return ankle joint technology and exoskeletal prosthetic leg without the technology during walking. A cross-over design study has been conducted towards the 14 transtibial amputees age 27. 50 years (± 7. 37) and with body mass index 20. 19 kg/m 2 (± 1. 62). Gait characteristics are evaluated using a Digital SLR camera with 120 frames per second video recording. The measured gait parameters are include the time required during the stance phase and swing phase, right and left step, and stride length. There was a significant differences in gait characteristic of the amputee when using the endoskeletal prosthetic leg and the exoskeletal during stance and swing phase (p = 0. 015), step left (p = 0. 025), step right (p < 0. 0001) and stride length (p < 0. 0001). The result is the using of endoskeletal prosthetic foot with the ankle joint technology can produce faster but more consistence movement for both normal and amputated leg...|$|E
40|$|D. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} analyses developed for several voltage source inverter topologies, which are indispensable in aiding the understanding and the design of these circuits. It describes the groundwork that {{is required for the}} development of custom design software for voltage source inverters. The different circuits that can be designed by using this program, are analyzed using conventional circuit analysis techniques. The equations are used to simulate the switching behaviour and to specify the required or recommended ratings of the main devices. The custom design program can be used to design three different topologies of voltage source inverters: a) hard switching (snubberless) six pulse bridge; b) hard switching (snubberless) six pulse bridge, equipped with a simple voltage clamp; and c) soft switching (snubbed) six pulse bridge, equipped with a conventional dissipative snubber circuit. The snubberless behaviour of a voltage source inverter leg is both experimentally and analytically investigated. Approximate equations are formulated which can be used to. determine the peak ratings of the main devices in the inverter, taking the reverse recovery of the freewheel diodes into account. The snubberless behaviour of an inverter <b>leg,</b> <b>equipped</b> with a simple voltage clamp across the dc link, is experimentally and theoretically investigated. Equations for design and determining the required peak ratings of the main devices are developed. It is shown that the simple voltage clamp can operate in two different modes, either as a fast discharging or as a slow discharging voltage clamp and that the ranges of applicability of thetwo modes of operation are different. Design rules for both modes of operation are presented. In order to develop the design equations for a snubbed inverter leg a suitable topology had to be identified first. A method for objectively comparing different inverter toplogies is proposed in this thesis, according to which the minimum on- and off-states of the main devices in the different topologies are compared for identical applications. This method is used to compare four different snubbed voltage source inverter topologies both theoretically and experimentally. As both methods indicate that the conventional snubber circuit allows the highest PWM switching frequency of the uncontrolled snubber circuits, this circuit is further investigated in its dissipative topology to develop the equations required for simulation and for inclusion in the program. The influence of snubber circuits on inductive inverter loads is also investigated. It is shown that for normal snubber sizes the effect of dead time forms the larger part of the output voltage distortion and that the effects of the snubber elements are normally of secondary importance. The effect of asymmetry of a specific snubber circuit on inverter loads is investigated and it is found that it introduces a de component in the output voltage. Finally the application of linear snubbers to switches that exhibit tail-forming characteristics is analyzed and optimized. The results allow the designer to minimize the total losses of the converter by identifying the optimal snubber size. The theoretical results are experimentally verifie...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of Laplace’s equation in calculating bandage pressure in venous leg ulcers Jan Schuren, Kay Mohr Background: Compression {{is generally considered}} to be the standard therapy for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. It controls oedema and supports venous blood flow to the heart. Aims: This article presents results from three studies comparing a new two-layer compression system with several other established systems in order to evaluate the {{efficacy of}} the compression forces exerted. Methods: Data from three studies, in which measurements were taken from 744 compression bandages applied to artificial <b>legs</b> <b>equipped</b> with pressure transducers are examined in this article. Results: The results are compared with theoretical compression forces calculated by a modified Laplace’s law equation which predicts graduated compression ranging from 27 – 72 mmHg at the ankle, tapering to 18 – 8 mmHg below the knee. However, the results of the studies show that calculations using this equation do not reliably predict actual measured sub-bandage pressures. Conclusions: The widespread belief that compression bandages provide graduated pressure from 40 mmHg at the ankle to 17 mmHg below the knee is based solely on theoretical mathematical equations and is not supported by the results of experimental studies.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we propose a design of a class of robotic legs (known as “Ninja legs”) that enable amphibious operation, both walking and swimming, for use on a class of hexapod robots. Amphibious <b>legs</b> <b>equip</b> the robot with a {{capability}} to explore diverse locations in the world encompassing both those that are on the ground as well as underwater. In this paper we work with a hexapod robot of the Aqua vehicle family (based on a body plan first developed by Buehler et al. [1]), which is an amphibious robot that employs legs for amphibious locomotion. Many different leg designs have been previously developed for Aqua-class vehicles, including both robust all-terrain legs for walking, and efficient flippers for swimming. But the walking legs have extremely poor thrust for swimming and the flippers are completely unsuitable for terrestrial operations. In this work we propose a single leg design with the advantages of both the walking legs and the swimming flippers. We design a cage-like circular enclosure for the flippers {{in order to protect the}} flippers during terrestrial operations. The enclosing structure also plays the role of the walking legs for terrestrial locomotion. The circular shape of the enclosure, as well, has the advantages of an offset wheel. We evaluate the performance of our design for terrestrial mobility by comparing the power efficiency and the physical speed of the robot equipped with the newly designed legs against that with the walking legs which are semi-circular in shape. The swimming performance is examined by measuring the thrust generated by newly designed legs and comparing the same with the thrust generated by the swimming flippers. In the field, we also verified that these legs are suitable for swimming through moderate surf, walking through the breakers on a beach (and thus through slurry), and onto wet and dry sand. I...|$|R

In loop 2, there is one pressurizer (PZR) on the hot leg, where a steam bubble is maintained during operation. The loops are arranged symmetrically, so the hot legs are diametrically opposed on the RPV's circumference. Because the SGs are elevated relative to the RPV, natural convection will circulate reactor coolant {{in the event of}} RCP malfunction.

MethodsCT scans of five fresh frozen full <b>leg</b> cadaver specimens, <b>equipped</b> with infrared reflective markers, were used to produce a specimen-matched femoral cutting block. Using those blocks, the bone cuts were made to implant a bi-compartmental femoral component. Rotational alignment of the components in the horizontal plane was determined using an optical measurement system and compared with all relevant rotational reference axes identified on the CT scans. ResultsAverage rotational alignment for the bi-compartmental component in the horizontal plane was 1. 9 ° (range 0 °– 6. 3 °; standard deviation 2. 6 °). One specimen that showed the highest deviation from the planned alignment also featured a completely degraded medial articular surface.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the experimental {{campaign on the}} prototype of the small scale ground mobile robot Mantis 2. 0. It is a hybrid leg-wheel mobile robot, designed for surveillance and inspection tasks, with a maximum payload (camera, sensors) of 1 kg. Its locomotion system has been conceived to operate both in outdoor environments, on irregular and yielding terrains, and in indoor locations characterized by steps and stairs. Other operative requirements are good speed, energetic efficiency and stable camera vision without oscillations on flat terrains. The Mantis architecture {{is based on a}} main body with two front actuated wheels, a passive rear axle with two idle wheels and two rotating legs. While motion on flat and even ground is purely wheeled, with differential steering, when additional traction is required, for example in case of ground irregularities or obstacles, the front legs can rotate, performing a mixed leg-wheel locomotion. The profile of the legs is inspired by the praying mantis, and is specially designed to climb square steps and stairs, grasping the top of the step and lifting up the robot body. For stair/step descent, the <b>legs</b> are <b>equipped</b> with passive degrees of freedom for shock absorption. The multibody simulations and the experimental tests on the Mantis 1. 0 prototype have shown the effectiveness of the proposed leg profile both for step climbing and for locomotion on uneven terrains and obstacles. The Mantis 2. 0 prototype is equipped with auxiliary passive wheels, which reduce friction between legs and step upper surface in the last phase of step climbing, which is the most critical, in order to improve the reliability of the whole manoeuvre for all friction conditions. The auxiliary wheels are connected to the legs by one-way bearings, in order to avoid loss of traction during the mixed leg-wheel locomotion. The results of the experimental campaign confirm the goodness of the Mantis design, which represents potentially a versatile multipurpose platform {{for a wide range of}} unmanned applications. The next step of the research will be the development of an autonomous or semi-autonomous guidance system, capable of coordinating legs and wheels for obstacle climbing without human intervention...|$|R
50|$|This ground-burrowing wasp may {{be found}} in well-drained, sandy soils to loose clay in bare or grass-covered banks, berms and hills as well as next to raised sidewalks, {{driveways}} and patio slabs. Females may share a burrow, digging their own nest cells off the main tunnel. A typical burrow is 25 - 50 cm deep and about 1.5 cm wide. In digging a burrow, the female dislodges the soil with her jaws and, using her hind legs, pushes loose soil behind her as she backs out of the burrow. Her hind <b>legs</b> are <b>equipped</b> with special spines that help her push the dirt behind her. The excess soil pushed out of the burrow forms a mound with a trench through it at the burrow entrance. Cicada killers may nest in planters, window boxes, flower beds or under shrubs, ground cover, etc. Nests often are made in the full sun where vegetation is sparse.After digging a nest chamber in the burrow, female cicada killers capture cicadas, paralyzing them with a sting. After paralyzing a cicada, the female wasp holds it upside down beneath her and takes off toward her burrow; this return flight to the burrow is difficult for the wasp because the cicada is often more than twice her weight. A wasp will often lug its prey up into the nearest tree, to gain altitude for the flight to the burrow. After putting one or more cicadas in her nest cell, the female deposits an egg on a cicada and closes the cell with dirt. Male eggs are laid on a single cicada but female eggs are given two or sometimes three cicadas; this is because the female wasp is twice as large as the male and must have more food. New nest cells are dug as necessary off of the main burrow tunnel and a single burrow may eventually have 10 or more nest cells. The egg hatches in one or two days, and the cicadas serve as food for the grub. The larvae complete their development in about 2 weeks. Overwintering occurs as a mature larva within an earth-coated cocoon. Pupation occurs in the nest cell in the spring and lasts 25 to 30 days. There is only one generation per year and no adults overwinter.|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{jack-up rigs}} {{are widely used}} in {{offshore}} {{oil and gas exploration}} and increasingly in temporary production and maintenance work. There is a steadily increasing demand for their use in deeper water and harsher environments. A typical modem jack-up has three independent <b>legs,</b> each <b>equipped</b> with a footing known as ‘spudcan’. This thesis is concerned with the performance of spudcan foundation subjected to vertical loading correspondent to preloading during its installation into uniform clay. The chief aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the bearing behaviour with the corresponding soil failure mechanisms during spudcan penetration. Centrifuge model test and Finite Element (FE) analysis are carried out extensively. In centrifuge modelling, a half-spudcan model and a full spudcan model are used. In the half- spudcan model test, a novel system for revealing soil failure mechanisms and measuring soil deformation has been adopted, in which the half-spudcan model is placed against a transparent window and a subsequent Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis is performed. The full-spudcan model test is conducted to measure the load-penetration response. In numerical simulation, both small strain and large deformation analyses are carried out with smooth and rough soil-spudcan interfaces considered. At the initial stage of penetration, it is observed that a cavity is formed above the spudcan as it is penetrating into a uniform clay. Meanwhile, soil flows towards the surface and thus soil heave forms close to the spudcan shoulders. With further penetration, the soil underneath the spudcan starts to flow back into the cavity on the exposed top of the spudcan. This backflow causes the spudcan to be embedded while the initially formed cavity remains open. Eventually, the spudcan becomes fully embedded and the soil flow mechanism reaches a fully localised failure mechanism with deep embedment. The lateral extent of visible distortion due to soil flow is confined well within 1. 5 - 1. 6 D (D: spudcan diameter). From both centrifuge and numerical investigations, it is found that in uniform clay, it is inevitable to form a cavity above the spudcan foundation. Thus, the stable cavity depth and soil back flow mechanisms are studied. It is clear that the back flow is caused by a Flow Failure, where it is due to the downward penetration of the spudcan. This is contrary to the Wall Failure that is the mechanism recommended by the current offshore design guidelines to estimate the stable cavity depth. In wall failure, the soil back flow is due to the cavity wall too high to stand. The stable cavity depth is estimated up to 4 times higher by the wall failure mechanism than the one by the flow failure. This explains that the wall failure is never observed in model test. Therefore, a new design chart with design formula is developed for design engineers in the stable cavity depth calculation. The spudcan bearing response is strongly correspondent with the variation of soil failure mechanisms during penetration. At the initial stage of the penetration, the spudcan bearing capacity increases with penetration, which is due to the increase of overburden pressure from cavity formation. At the second stage of the penetration, soil back flow embeds the spudcan, and the spudcan bearing capacity is increasing as the soil flow mechanism transits from its shallow failure mechanism to its deep failure mechanism. At the final stage of the penetration, the spudcan bearing capacity reaches its ultimate value, where the deep/localised failure mechanism remains. A rough spudcan shows 14 % higher bearing capacity than a smooth spudcan. And a flat-plate shows 8 % higher capacity than a spudcan with a same surface roughness. The ultimate bearing capacity factor N, = 10. 5 in uniform soil is recommended as a conservative value when the deep failure mechanism is reached. A correspondent N, = 10. 1 in NC clay is suggested for a deeply embedded spudcan...|$|R
