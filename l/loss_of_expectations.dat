2500|$|However, {{consideration}} is a doctrine deriving {{from the common}} law, and can be suspended under the principles of equity. Historically, England had two separate court systems, and the Courts of Chancery which derived their ultimate authority from the King via the Lord Chancellor, took precedence over the common law courts. So does its body of equitable principles since the systems were merged in 1875. The doctrine of promissory estoppel holds that when one person gives an assurance to another, the other relies on it {{and it would be}} inequitable to go back on the assurance, that person will be estopped from doing so: an analogue of the maxim that nobody should profit from their own wrong (nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans). So in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co the House of Lords held that a tenant could not be ejected by the landlord for failing to keep up with his contractual repair duties because starting negotiations to sell the property gave the tacit assurance that the repair duties were suspended. And in Central London Properties Ltd v High Trees House Ltd Denning J held that a landlord would be estopped from claiming normal rent during the years of World War II because he had given an assurance that half rent could be paid till the war was done. The Court of Appeal went even further in a recent debt repayment case, Collier v P J Wright (Holdings) Ltd. Arden LJ argued that a partner who had been assured he was only liable to repay one third of the partnership's debts, rather than be jointly and severally liable for the whole, had relied on the assurance by making repayments, and it was inequitable for the finance company to later demand full repayment of the debt. Hence, promissory estoppel could circumvent the common law rule of Foakes. Promissory estoppel, however, has been thought to be incapable of raising an independent cause of action, so that one may only plead another party is estopped from enforcing their strict legal rights as a [...] "shield", but cannot bring a cause of action out of estoppel as a [...] "sword". In Australia, this rule was relaxed in Walton Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher, where Mr Maher was encouraged to believe he would have a contract to sell his land, and began knocking down his existing building before Walton Stores finally told him they did not wish to complete. Mr Maher got generous damages covering his loss (i.e. reliance damages, but seemingly damages for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> as if there were a contract). Yet, where an assurance concerns rights over property, a variant [...] "proprietary estoppel" [...] does allow a claimant to plead estoppel as a cause of action. So in Crabb v Arun District Council, Mr Crabbe was assured he would have the right to an access point to his land by Arun District Council, and relying on that he sold off half the property where the only existing access point was. The council was estopped from not doing what they said they would. Given the complex route of legal reasoning to reach simple solutions, it is unsurprising that a number of commentators, as well as the Principles of European Contract Law have called for simple abandonment of the doctrine of consideration, leaving the basic requirements of agreement and an intention to create legal relations. Such a move would also dispense with the need for the common law doctrine of privity.|$|E

40|$|Schizophrenia {{cuts across}} all racial, gender, and {{socioeconomic}} lines. Schizophrenia affects 1 {{percent of the}} population in Ireland: 35000 people (Schultz & Andreason, 1999); and affects 1. 4 - 4. 6 percent per 1000 people in the USA: 2. 8 million - 9. 8 million people (Jabelensky, 2004). In South Africa the figure is approximately 1 {{percent of the population}} or 500 000 people (Nicholas, Malcolm, Krosigk & Pillay, 2003). The median age of onset is 21. 4 years for men and 26. 8 years for women (Daubenton & van Rensburg, 2001), with only 10 - 20 percent recovering fully after the first psychotic episode (Saddock & Saddock, 2003). The schizophrenic patient is often unable to continue life as before diagnosis, and may progressively need more care as the years pass. Deinstitutionalization {{over the course of a}} number of decades has resulted in responsibility for care of mentally-ill individuals shifting to the individual’s family. The struggles faced by such a family can be overwhelming as they struggle with this responsibilty due to lack of training, lack of knowledge and insufficient professional support (Winefield & Harvey, 1994). The stress on the caregivers is often magnified as their support structures around them may ‘shut down’ out of fear of the schizophrenic illness (Williams & Mfoafo-M’Carthy, 2006). The characteristic symptoms used to define schizophrenia include various forms of delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders and abnormalities in emotional expression, social interaction, attention, volition and drives. The functional decline of the schizophrenic individual leads not only to social difficulties, but also economic difficulties that may cripple a family (Fadden, Bebbington & Kuipers, 1987). When first diagnosed, some families may be so overwhelmed by the ‘label’ given to their family member, that they see little hope or way to move forward. One explanation is offered by an American psychiatrist whose own son was diagnosed with schizophrenia, “We experience this terrible feeling of loss and grief for the son we knew. There is also this terrible <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>expectations.</b> We feel cheated out of watching him mature…it is a mourning without end because, of course, Gary is not dead at all. He is very much still with us, seeming eternally twelve years old, needing constant care and attention” (Willick, 1994, p. 14). Providing such care is associated with high levels of distress. Accordingly, much attention has been given to understanding the pressures faced by family members, with the hope of understanding how coping resources may be strengthened to sustain these care-giving relationships (Harvey, Burns, Fahy, Manley & Tattan, 2001). However, despite gains in understanding the needs of a schizophrenic family member once out of the hospital environment, care-giving relationships can still break down. The individual with the illness is often left more vulnerable to relapse, recurrent hospitalizations, homelessness and other negative outcomes (Jewel & Stein, 2002). The stress of not only interacting with the afflicted family member, but also with the grief associated with the illness, places an incredible strain on the day-to-day functioning of that family (Pollio, North, Reid, Miletic & McClendon, 2006). From the brief review provided, it is evident that research has been conducted regarding the stressors, strains and difficulties of caregivers of schizophrenic family members. However, the strengths of these families are under-investigated, and the current study will attempt to start filling this voi...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{demonstrate}} how assessment of life expectancy and <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> {{life can be}} used to address a wide range of research questions of public health interest pertaining to the prognosis of cancer patients. METHODS: We identified 135, 092 cases of colon adenocarcinoma diagnosed during 1961 - 2011 from the population-based Swedish Cancer Register. Flexible parametric survival models for relative survival were used to estimate the life expectancy and the <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life. RESULTS: The <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life for males aged 55 at diagnosis was 13. 5 years (95 % CI 13. 2 - 13. 8) in 1965 and 12. 8 (12. 4 - 13. 3) in 2005. For males aged 85 the corresponding figures were 3. 21 (3. 15 - 3. 28) and 2. 10 (2. 04 - 2. 17). The pattern was similar for females, but slightly greater <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life. The <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life is reduced given survival up to a certain time point post diagnosis. Among patients diagnosed in 2011, 945 life years could potentially be saved if the colon cancer survival among males could be brought to the same level as for females. CONCLUSION: Assessment <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life facilitates the understanding of the impact of cancer, both on individual and population level. Clear improvements in survival among colon cancer patients have led to a gain in life expectancy, partly due to a general increase in survival from all causes. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Wind is an {{important}} energy source and {{is regarded as a}} valuable alternative to traditional electric power-generating sources. There is an increasing interest in the develop-ment and use of wind energy as a substitute for more conventional energy because of its high potential and minimum impact on the environment. Generating capacity from wind power behaves quite differently than that from more conventional generating sources, as the wind is highly variable and is both site and terrain specific. These conditions dictate the need to develop suitable models and procedures to assess the reliability implications associated with integrating wind power in electric power systems. This paper presents an approach to modelling wind power in generating-capacity reliability studies using an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) time series. The technique is illustrated by application to a representative test system using wind data from a site in Saskatchewan, Canada. The test system is used to illustrate the effect on the system risk of adding increasing amounts of wind capacity to a conventional generating system. The risk is assessed using the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> load <b>expectation</b> and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>expectation</b> indices. The generating capacity credit attributable to wind power is expressed in terms of the increase in system peak load-carrying capability at the criterion risk level. These analyses are extended to consider multiple wind sites with dependent and independent wind regimes...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study is to utilise mixed methodology to build a conceptual framework, theory and model describing the mechanisms by which multilevel factors influence the developmental and life course outcomes with a focus on perinatal depression. Methodology and Methods: I used a critical realist approach to social epidemiology theory building. Emergent methods included: key informant interviews, focus groups, thematic analysis, conceptual mapping, situational analysis, factor analysis, logistic, linear, and Bayesian spatial and multilevel regression studies. Explanatory theory building utilised abductive Inference to the Best Explanation. Results: Theoretical concepts emerging included: <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>expectation,</b> marginalisation, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> control, nurturing and support, social support networks, access to services, ethnic migration and the role of global economy, business and media. Multilevel spatial studies suggest that strong ecological social networks increase depression among migrant mothers but not Australian mothers.

40|$|Cancer patient {{survival}} {{is the single}} most important measure of cancer patient care. By quantifying cancer patient survival in different ways further insights can be gained in terms of temporal trends and differences in cancer patient survival between groups. The objective of this thesis is to develop and apply methods for estimating the cure proportion and <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life for cancer patients. In paper I, a cure model was used to study temporal trends in survival of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in Sweden. Cancer patient survival was estimated in a relative survival setting and quantified as the proportion cured and the median survival time of uncured for different age groups and by calendar time of diagnosis. We found a dramatic increase in the cure proportion for the age group 19 - 40, although almost no improvement was seen for patients aged 70 - 79 at diagnosis. In paper II, a flexible parametric cure model was developed to overcome some limitations with standard parametric cure models. This model is a special case of a non-mixture cure model, using splines instead of a parametric distribution for the modeling. The fit of the flexible parametric cure model was compared to the fit of a Weibull non-mixture cure model, and shown to be superior in cases when the standard non-mixture cure model did not give a good fit or did not converge. Software was developed to enable use of the method. In paper III, the possibility of using a flexible parametric relative survival model for estimating life expectancy and <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life was evaluated. Extrapolation of the survival function is generally needed, and the flexible parametric relative survival model was shown to extrapolate the survival very well. The method was evaluated by comparing survival functions extrapolated from 10 years past diagnosis to observed survival by the use of data with 40 years of follow-up. Software was developed to enable use of the method. In paper IV, the life expectancy and <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life was estimated for colon cancer patients in Sweden. Even though relative survival was similar across age for colon cancer patients, the <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life varied greatly by age, since young patients have more years to lose. We also found that the life expectancy of colon cancer patients improved over time. However, the improvement has to a large extent mimicked the improvement seen in the general population, and therefore there were no large changes in the <b>loss</b> in <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life. In conclusion, the methods presented in this thesis are additional tools for estimating and quantifying population-based cancer patient survival, that can lead to an improved understanding of different aspects of the prognosis of cancer patients...|$|R
