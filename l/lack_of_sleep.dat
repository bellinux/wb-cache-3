Work intensity can lead to many negative health consequences, such as <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> stress, and lack of recreation.|$|E
5|$|The Muslims found {{themselves}} in greater difficulties by day. Food was running short, and nights were colder. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> made matters worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community. Only at night, when the attacks stopped due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship. According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became serious and fear was everywhere.|$|E

30|$|Introduction: Sleep is a {{fundamental}} need for recovery, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> good <b>sleep</b> is associated with adverse effects. ICU patients have increased risk for disturbed sleep architecture. The importance <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> is internationally recognized. Recently, we determined that the optimal cut-off score for sufficient sleep was a numeric rating score (NRS <b>sleep)</b> <b>of</b> ≥ 6 (1). Subsequently, this sleep NRS was implemented in our ICU practice, supplemented with the Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RSCQ) when sleep was deemed insufficient.|$|R
50|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} {{can sometimes}} be self-imposed due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> desire to <b>sleep</b> or the habitual use <b>of</b> stimulant drugs. <b>Sleep</b> deprivation is also self-imposed to achieve personal fame {{in the context of}} record-breaking stunts.|$|R
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress, alcohol abuse, flickering light, or a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary {{to bring about a}} seizure. Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|During {{the week}} before his death, {{he was dealing with}} two pending lawsuits, one a {{paternity}} case and the other a recording contract dispute that was due to be heard by a UK High Court the following week. He was also troubled with wanting to leave his manager, Michael Jeffery. Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe exhaustion caused by overworking, a chronic <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> and a persistent illness assumed to be influenza-related. Lacking trusting personal relationships, his insecurities about the future and disillusionment with the music industry contributed to his frustration.|$|E
5|$|For {{some days}} Hendrix {{had been in}} poor health, {{due in part to}} fatigue caused by overworking, a chronic <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> and an illness assumed to be influenza-related. Insecurities about his {{personal}} relationships and disillusionment with the music industry had also contributed to his frustration. Although the details of his final hours and death are disputed, Hendrix spent much of his last day with Monika Dannemann. During the morning of September18, she found him unresponsive in her apartment at the Samarkand Hotel, 22Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., and he was taken to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where an attempt was made to resuscitate him. He was pronounced dead at 12:45p.m.|$|E
50|$|Between 1941 and 1945, Josef {{went through}} Auschwitz, Dachau, Bergen-Belsen, Gross-Rosen, Balkenhain, Hirschberg and Buchenwald {{concentration}} camps. His life in these camps was {{mentally and physically}} exhausting. He worked 12-hour shifts with only one meal a day (which consisted of a minuscule portion of bread and watery soup). Many people died from the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> food, <b>sleep</b> deprivation, and regular beatings.|$|R
5000|$|Sleep apnea, obstructive <b>sleep</b> apnea, {{obstruction}} <b>of</b> {{the airway}} during <b>sleep,</b> causing <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sufficient deep <b>sleep,</b> {{often accompanied by}} snoring. Other forms <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> apnea are less common. When air is blocked from entering into the lungs, the individual unconsciously gasps for air and sleep is disturbed.

5|$|Single-purpose {{characters}} {{needed a}} distinctive personality trait to quickly establish {{them with the}} player, rather than serving as a disposable item, while major characters had to reflect the player's progression and actions through the game. Mitsoda wrote the characters by thinking about who each character was, assigning them motivations determining why they were where they were, what they thought about the player and what they wanted from them. In accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer Chad Moore, the Malkavian player character has a dialog script distinct {{from that of the}} other eight clans; Mitsoda said {{it was one of the}} simpler aspects of the development cycle. He wrote the Malkavian script last, with time running out on development, and the overwork and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> contributed to what Mitsoda considered an unhealthy state of mind, ideal for writing insane dialog. He wanted to highlight their madness, without making it comical. Since the story is set during the Camarilla's takeover of Los Angeles, the team simplified the plot by only allowing the player to belong to one of the LA-based clans.|$|E

30|$|Sleep is a {{fundamental}} need for recovery while a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> good <b>sleep</b> is associated with adverse effects. ICU patients have an increased risk for disturbed sleep. Various sleeping questionnaires {{have been developed to}} assess the different aspects <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> The Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) {{is one of the most}} commonly used sleep assessment tools for the ICU consisting of 5 questions on different aspects <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> and reasons for poor sleep. However, it seems irrelevant to burden patients that state to have a good night sleep with the complete RCSQ. For clinical and developmental use it is useful to quantify sleep in a simple and effective manner. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate a simple sleeping numeric rating score; NRS sleep.|$|R

40|$|<b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> {{restorative}} <b>sleep</b> is {{implicated in}} threats {{to public health}} and safety as well as negative individual health outcomes, which are more pronounced among those living in rural poverty. This study addressed the need for an approach to these problems that is sensitive to culture and community. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> among young adults living in rural poverty to inform development of strategies to improve sleep behavior in this population. Research questions explored the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> constructs <b>of</b> the theory of planned behavior which was used as a framework for the study, and the larger cultural context <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> This study used semistructured interviews with a purposeful sample (n = 12) of young adults aged 18 - 24 years living in 5 counties in northernmost New York State. Thematic analysis was used to code data and identify themes. Key themes included the presence of a persistent struggle to balance sleep with preferred activities and a belief that the body controlled sleep behavior. Participants identified family and employers as influencing their sleep behavior and reported an overall <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> agency regarding <b>sleep</b> behavior. Participant comments included cautious intentions about sleep coupled with reluctance to exert themselves to engage in intended sleep behavior. Findings may contribute to positive social change by amplifying the voices of participants as consumers of services in a manner that informs the development of education and treatment strategies...|$|R

50|$|<b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> {{sufficient}} <b>sleep</b> {{has been}} suggested as a cause for weight gain or the difficulty in maintaining a healthy weight. Two hormones responsible for regulating hunger and metabolism are leptin, which inhibits appetite and increases energy expenditure, and ghrelin, which increases appetite and reduces energy expenditure. Studies have shown that chronic sleep deprivation is associated with reduced levels of leptin and elevated levels of ghrelin, which together result in increased appetite, especially for high fat and high carbohydrate foods. As a result, sleep deprivation over time may contribute to increased caloric intake and decreased self-control over food cravings, leading to weight gain.|$|R
