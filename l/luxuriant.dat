5|$|The {{buildings}} in the southeast were scarcely affected by the 19th century restoration apart from the chapel. Many of {{the walls of the}} 12th century tower have survived, partly rebuilt in the 15th century, and there are traces of a Romanesque chapel. The park was redesigned in the 19th century, enclosed in dry stone walls with several entrances. These have since been removed, as have the <b>luxuriant</b> gardens of the 18th century. Some traces remain in the form of boxwood, some alleys, the pools on the two terraces and the rockery.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Confucian ethics were the {{selected}} virtues of filial piety, harmonious relationships, ritual, and righteousness. The amalgamation of these ideas into a theological system involving earlier cosmological theories of yin and yang {{as well as the}} five phases (i.e. natural cycles which governed Heaven, Earth, and Man) was first pioneered by the official Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE). Although full authenticity of Dong's authorship of the <b>Luxuriant</b> Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals comes into question with hints that parts were rewritten around the time of Liu Xiang (798 BCE) or Liu Xin (d. 23 CE), three of his original memorials sent to the throne discussing his syncretic version of Confucianism were preserved in the 1st-century-CE Book of Han.|$|E
5|$|India {{lies within}} the Indomalaya ecozone and {{contains}} three biodiversity hotspots. One of 17 megadiverse countries, it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian, 13.7% of all avian, 7.9% of all reptilian, 6% of all amphibian, 12.2% of all piscine, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. About 21.2% of the country's landmass {{is covered by}} forests (tree canopy density >10%), of which 12.2% comprises moderately or very dense forests (tree canopy density >40%). Endemism is high among plants, 33%, and among ecoregions such as the shola forests. Habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and North-East India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain. The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree. The <b>luxuriant</b> pipal fig tree, shown on the seals of Mohenjo-daro, shaded Gautama Buddha as he sought enlightenment.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} quagga {{does not appear to}} extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more <b>luxuriant</b> pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.|$|E

25|$|As of 2002, {{the dense}} {{mangrove}} swamp forest, which included <b>luxuriant</b> growths of palms, was undergoing extinction due to urbanization.|$|E
25|$|High quality fabrics {{were also}} woven from nettle; poppy-stem fibre was {{sometimes}} interwoven with flax, {{to produce a}} glossy smooth, lightweight and <b>luxuriant</b> fabric. Preparation techniques were {{much the same as}} those for linen.|$|E
25|$|How {{this city}} marches northward! The {{progress}} of 1835 and 1836 {{was nothing to}} the <b>luxuriant</b> rank growth of this year. Streets are springing up, whole strata of sandstone have transferred themselves from their ancient resting places to look down on bustling thoroughfares for long years to come. Wealth is rushing in upon us like a freshet.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, Samuel Bishop {{and other}} ranchers started to raise cattle on the <b>luxuriant</b> grasses that {{grew in the}} Owens Valley. The ranchers came into {{conflict}} with the Paiutes over land and water use, {{and most of the}} Paiutes were driven away from the valley by the U.S. Army in 1863 during the Owens Valley Indian War.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} is {{open all}} year from 6am to 5pm. The best weather at the sanctuary is during November and December when {{the area is}} cooled by the Northeast monsoon and the grasslands are the most <b>luxuriant.</b> The best time for bird watching is from October to January and {{the best time for}} animal viewing is from March to August.|$|E
25|$|The Houtman Abrolhos {{is unusual}} in having a <b>luxuriant</b> and diverse living coral reef at such a high latitude. 194 species in 50 genera have been {{recorded}} there, {{all but two of}} which are tropical. This is a surprisingly high coral diversity, considering the high latitude of the reef, and the relatively low diversity of other biota. For a full list, see list of corals of the Houtman Abrolhos.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{vegetation}} around Bisbee has a semi-desert appearance with shrubby acacia, oak and the like, {{along with}} cacti, grass, ocotillo and yucca. The town itself {{is much more}} <b>luxuriant</b> with native trees such as cypress, sycamore and cottonwood plus the introduced ailanthus and Old World cypresses, cedars and pines. Palms are capable of large size, but are not reliably hardy. A few higher-elevation trees such as blue spruce and white fir are growing fairly well in Bisbee.|$|E
25|$|Shey Phoksundo National Park in Dolpa District, {{established}} in 1984, {{is situated in}} the trans-Himalayan region of northwestern Nepal and represents the Tibetan Plateau ecosystem. The park, covering an area of , contains <b>luxuriant</b> forests mainly composed of blue pine, spruce, cypress, poplar, fir and birch. It is habitat for the endangered snow leopard, the blue sheep and many species of birds such as Himalayan monal, blood pheasant, cheer pheasant and snow partridge. It is a religious Buddhist site.|$|E
25|$|A Kiss in the Dreamhouse is a feat of {{imagination}} scarcely ever recorded. It's breathtaking. Somehow, a bold assurance of intention {{has met with}} a hunger for experimenting with sound to expand an already formidable group of songs into pure, open-minded ambiguity. The flesh of the song will balloon out or contort into unimaginable patterns; indecipherable echoes volley between {{the walls of the}} recording; glassy, splintered tones pierce the <b>luxuriant</b> sheen of the mix. Repeated listens trick the sense of balance; tremendous risks are taken.|$|E
25|$|The novella is {{generally}} not as formally experimental as the long story and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with personal and emotional development rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains something of the unity of impression that is {{a hallmark of the}} short story, but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more <b>luxuriant</b> description.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter coat}} is unusually long and uniform for an animal its size, with a <b>luxuriant</b> mane of tough, long hairs {{along the back}} from the occiput {{to the base of}} the tail. The coat is {{generally}} coarse and bristly, though this varies according to season. In winter, the coat is fairly dense, soft, and has well-developed underfur. The guard hairs are 50–75mm long on the flanks, 150–225mm long on the mane and 150mm on the tail. In summer, the coat is much shorter and coarser, and lacks underfur, though the mane remains large.|$|E
25|$|An {{extinct volcano}} {{constitutes}} two-thirds of Aegina. The northern and western sides consist of stony but fertile plains, which are well cultivated and produce <b>luxuriant</b> crops of grain, with some cotton, vines, almonds, olives and figs, {{but the most}} characteristic crop of Aegina today (2000s) is pistachio. Economically, the sponge fisheries are of notable importance. The southern volcanic {{part of the island}} is rugged and mountainous, and largely barren. Its highest rise is the conical Mount Oros (531 m) in the south, and the Panhellenian ridge stretches northward with narrow fertile valleys on either side.|$|E
25|$|In appearance, Fox was dark, corpulent and hairy, to {{the extent}} that when he was born his father {{compared}} him to a monkey. His round face was dominated by his <b>luxuriant</b> eyebrows, with the result that he was known among the Whigs as 'the Eyebrow.' Though he became increasingly dishevelled and fat in middle age, the young Fox had been a very fashionable figure; in particular, he had been the leader of the 'Maccaroni' set of extravagant young followers of Continental fashions. Fox enjoyed riding and cricket but, in the latter case, the combination of his impulsive nature and considerable weight led to his often being run out between wickets.|$|E
25|$|While {{the great}} inlet of the Bay of Kotor winds {{deep into the}} High-Karst zone of Mt. Orjen, Mediterranean climate penetrates far inland. Profound {{mixtures}} of species {{from more than one}} climatic zone and in addition endemic and stenoendemic species and special vegetation types with marked transitional vegetation units restricted exclusively to ecotons of humid (Csa) subtropical and hyper humid oceanic- (Cfs) climates are especially notable. Mediterranean cyclones and sirocco storms are accountable for the heavy precipitation (up to 5000mm/m2 at Crkvice, 940 m AMSL) that feeds the <b>luxuriant</b> and hyper-humid type of eastern Mediterranean vegetation comparable to colchidia-hyrcanian formations of the Caucasus and Asia Minor in the exceptionally damp and mild climate of the Montenegrin coast.|$|E
25|$|A second tarn once {{existed in}} Brown Cove {{to the north}} at Catstye Cam, but this is now reduced {{to a couple of}} small pools {{widening}} the stream. Brown Cove Tarn was another creation of the Greenside mine, a stone faced dam being built in about 1860. The dam is still in place but water now leaks through the base, the extended tarn-bed a smooth patch of <b>luxuriant</b> turf. A water leat passing beneath the north face of Catstye Cam to Red Tarn Beck can still be traced although it is now in ruins. Water from Brown Cove and Red Tarn unites {{at the base of the}} east ridge to form Glenridding Beck, flowing on through the village to Ullswater.|$|E
25|$|These {{conditions}} are particularly {{characteristic of the}} northern regions; in the south the vegetation on the uplands is more <b>luxuriant.</b> Among the many varieties of trees and plants found are the date palm, mimosa, wild olive, giant sycamores, junipers and laurels, the myrrh and other gum trees (gnarled and stunted, these flourish most on the eastern foothills), a magnificent pine (the Natal yellow pine, which resists the attacks of the white ant), the fig, orange, lime, pomegranate, peach, apricot, banana, and other fruit trees; the grape vine (rare), blackberry, and raspberry; the cotton and indigo Plants, and occasionally the sugar cane. There are in the south large forests of valuable timber trees; and the coffee plant is indigenous in the Kaffa country, whence it takes its name.|$|E
25|$|The general {{tone of the}} fur is reddish, {{with the}} {{brightest}} hues occurring in winter. In the winter coat, the back is clothed in a saturated rusty-red to reddish colour with brownish highlights {{along the top of}} the head, neck and shoulders. The throat, chest, flanks, and belly and the upper parts of the limbs are less brightly coloured, and are more yellowish in tone. The lower parts of the limbs are whitish, with dark brownish bands on the anterior sides of the forelimbs. The muzzle and forehead are greyish-reddish. The tail is very <b>luxuriant</b> and fluffy, and is mainly of a reddish-ocherous colour, with a dark brown tip. The summer coat is shorter, coarser, and darker. The dorsal and lateral guard hairs in adults measure 20–30mm in length. Dholes in the Moscow Zoo moult once a year from March to May.|$|E
25|$|In Parikia town, {{houses are}} built and {{decorated}} {{in the traditional}} Cycladic style, with flat roofs, whitewash walls and blue-painted doors and window frames and shutters. Shadowed by <b>luxuriant</b> vines, and surrounded by gardens of oranges and pomegranates, the houses give the town a picturesque aspect. Above the central stretch of the seafront road, are {{the remains of a}} medieval castle, built almost entirely of the marble remains of an ancient temple dedicated to Apollo. Similar traces of antiquity, in the shape of bas-reliefs, inscriptions, columns, and so on, are numerous. On a hillside in the southern outskirts of Parikia on the left of the Parikia – Alyki road are the remains of a temple dedicated to Asclepius. In addition, close to the modern harbour, the remains of an ancient cemetery are visible, having been discovered recently during non-archaeological excavations.|$|E
25|$|Having conquered Drangiana, Arachosia, Gedrosia and Seistan in ten days, Alexander the Great (locally {{known as}} 'Iskander') crossed the Hindu Kush and was thus fully {{informed}} of the magnificence {{of the country and}} its riches in gold, gems and pearls. However, Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the <b>luxuriant</b> plains. Having taken a northeasterly direction, he marched against the Aspii (mountaineers), who offered vigorous resistance, but were subdued. Alexander then marched through Ghazni, blockaded Magassa, and then marched to Ora and Bazira. Turning to the northeast, Alexander marched to Pucela, the capital of the district now known as Pakhli. He entered Western Punjab, where the ancient city of Nysa (at the site of modern-day Mong) was situated. A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians, the people of Multan, who were very skilful in war. Alexander invested many troops, eventually killing seventeen thousand Cathians in this battle, and the city of Sagala (present-day Sialkot) was razed to the ground. Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C. and took his army to the heartlands of his empire.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} (written by Rowling) to {{the publications}} released in December 2008 mentions that the fictional character Beedle the Bard {{was born in}} Yorkshire, lived in the 15th century, and had [...] "an exceptionally <b>luxuriant</b> beard".|$|E
500|$|The {{chapters}} are devoted, respectively, to meat, {{fish and}} other dishes, and each concludes with a [...] "master chef's secret". Czerniecki's cooking style, as is evident in his book, was typical for the <b>luxuriant</b> Polish Baroque cuisine, which still had a largely medieval outlook, but was gradually succumbing to novel culinary ideas coming from France. It was characterized by generous use of vinegar, sugar and exotic spices, as well as preference for spectacle over thrift.|$|E
500|$|They sailed on, dining on Galapagos tortoises, {{and passed}} the atoll of Honden Island on 9 November. They passed through the Low Islands archipelago, with Darwin {{remarking}} that they had [...] "a very uninteresting appearance; a long brilliantly white beach is capped by a low bright line of green vegetation." [...] Arriving at Tahiti on 15 November he soon found interest in <b>luxuriant</b> vegetation and the pleasant intelligent natives who showed the benefits of Christianity, refuting allegations he had read about tyrannical missionaries overturning indigenous cultures.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1977, author Nicholas Schaffner {{described}} {{the combination of}} these [...] "color representations of the Hindu scriptures" [...] and the album-wide message espoused by Harrison in [...] "The Lord Loves the One" [...] as [...] "a <b>luxuriant</b> rock devotional designed to transform his fans' stereo equipment into a temple". In a 1982 interview with ISKCON's Mukunda Goswami, Harrison discussed the song's lyrics and referred to his use of the Krishna and Arjuna picture, along with the credit he gave Prabhupada's book, as a [...] "plug" [...] for the Hare Krishna movement.|$|E
500|$|Vanbrugh planned The Relapse around {{particular}} actors at Drury Lane, writing their stage habits, public reputations, {{and personal}} relationships into the text. One such actor was Colley Cibber himself, {{who played the}} <b>luxuriant</b> fop Lord Foppington in both Love's Last Shift and The Relapse. However, Vanbrugh's artistic plans were threatened by a cutthroat struggle between London's two theatre companies, each of which was [...] "seducing" [...] actors from the other. The Relapse came close to being not produced at all, but the successful performance that was eventually achieved in November 1696 vindicated Vanbrugh's intentions, and saved the company from bankruptcy as well.|$|E
500|$|... "You Caught Me Smilin'" [...] is a hymn {{to getting}} high, {{introduced}} by a [...] "slow, wispy soul {{that sounds like}} it's drifting in from a distant radio somewhere". Jurek wrote, [...] "Sister Rose's voice is all sweet, and at first so is Sly's, but as the horns and bassline come stepping in, Sly's voice gets heavy and is distorting in places deliberately. The delicate keyboard lines, <b>luxuriant</b> and in the pocket as they are, cannot keep the voice contained. There's a minimal instrumental break in the tune and it suddenly fades just as it emerged." ...|$|E
500|$|The outrage after Pound's wartime {{collaboration}} with Mussolini's regime was {{so deep that}} the imagined method of his execution dominated the discussion. Arthur Miller considered him worse than Hitler: [...] "In his wildest moments of human vilification Hitler never approached our Ezra... he knew all America's weaknesses and he played them as expertly as Goebbels ever did." [...] The response {{went so far as}} to denounce all modernists as fascists, and it was only in the 1980s that critics began a re-evaluation. Macha Rosenthal wrote that it was [...] "as if all the beautiful vitality and all the brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its <b>luxuriant</b> variety were both at once made manifest" [...] in Ezra Pound.|$|E
500|$|According to New Zealand {{music critic}} Graham Reid, a {{contemporary}} Australian review remarked on the album's religiosity: [...] "oftentimes {{the music is}} a more truthful guide {{to the sense of}} the lyrics than the words themselves. Harrison is not a great wordsmith but he is a superb musician. Everything flows, everything interweaves. His melodies are so superb they take care of everything …" [...] Like Holden, Nicholas Schaffner approved of the singer's gesture in donating his publishing royalties to the Material World Charitable Foundation and praised the album's [...] "exquisite musical underpinnings". Although the [...] "transcendent dogma" [...] was not always to his taste, Schaffner recognised that in Living in the Material World, Harrison had [...] "devised a <b>luxuriant</b> rock devotional designed to transform his fans' stereo equipment into a temple".|$|E
500|$|He feels {{a dreamy}} {{quality in the}} best of Bates's writing, as when he meets a boa constrictor: [...] "On seeing me the reptile {{suddenly}} turned, and glided at an accelerated rate down the path. ...The rapidly moving and shining body looked like a stream of brown liquid flowing over the thick bed of fallen leaves." [...] However he is less impressed with Bates's remarks about the [...] "intellectual inferiority" [...] of the natives, and observes that Bates was wrong about the fertility of tropical soils, which are often poor: the <b>luxuriant</b> growth results from rapid recycling of nutrients. He celebrates the [...] "famous closing passage" [...] of the book, where Bates expresses his [...] "deep misgivings" [...] about returning to England, and writes that recent [...] "progress" [...] in the Amazon is just as shocking.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{have found the}} pleasure Romans took in the [...] "theatre of life and death" [...] {{to be one of}} the more difficult aspects of their civilization to understand and explain. The younger Pliny rationalized gladiator spectacles as good for the people, a way [...] "to inspire them to face honourable wounds and despise death, by exhibiting love of glory and desire for victory even in the bodies of slaves and criminals". Some Romans such as Seneca were critical of the brutal spectacles, but found virtue in the courage and dignity of the defeated fighter rather than in victory—an attitude that finds its fullest expression with the Christians martyred in the arena. Even martyr literature, however, offers [...] "detailed, indeed <b>luxuriant,</b> descriptions of bodily suffering", and became a popular genre at times indistinguishable from fiction.|$|E
500|$|Harold Davidson {{was born}} on 14 July 1875 in Sholing, near the south coast port of Southampton, to the Reverend Francis Davidson and his wife Alice. Francis Davidson was the vicar of St Mary's, Sholing, a post he had held since 1866; as many as 27 members of the Davidson family were or had been Anglican clergy. Alice Davidson, née Hodgskin, was a great-niece of the educationist and Rugby School {{headmaster}} Thomas Arnold. Sholing was a poor parish, with a mixed population of dock labourers and itinerant workers {{many of whom had}} little interest in churchgoing. Francis Davidson, described by Harold Davidson's earliest biographer, Tom Cullen, as [...] "a tiny man... with a <b>luxuriant</b> beard that gave him the appearance of a gnome", served the parish for 48 years. Although he could be pugnacious when necessary, according to a former parishioner he was a true pastor, willing to offer help whatever the circumstances.|$|E
