40|$|Although {{diabetes}} mellitus, a metabolic disease, {{does not}} fall into the group of diseases induced by toxic substances or environmental pollution, there is much evidence that some chemicals have considerable importance in its development. Exposure to substances with potential renal toxicity is especially dangerous for diabetics because it accelerates and intensifies diabetic nephropathy. This paper discusses {{the relationship between the}} xenobiotics and the development of diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy with particular emphasis on those substances that causes the greatest damage to the kidneys. These are cadmium, iron, <b>lead,</b> <b>arsenic,</b> polychlorinated organic <b>compounds,</b> nitrogen compounds, and contrast agents.

40|$|Besides the {{compounds}} of cadmium and <b>lead,</b> mercury and <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are among the}} most important and most frequent contaminants of the environment. e level of contamination of the environment with heavy metals and arsenic is a serious factor influencing its quality, and is of con-siderable health concern. Increased concentrations of these pollutants in individual components of the ecosystem (water, soil, plants, etc.) pose a risk of damage to physiological functions in living organ-isms. e chronic detrimental effect of heavy met-als and arsenic on animals is demonstrated latently without clinical symptoms (immunopathological changes, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity, etc). As most wild animals are components of the food chain, {{there is a need to}} trace heavy metal con-centrations in the tissues of animals not only with respect to immunopathological changes and intoxi-cations but also from the viewpoint of potential health hazard to humans. Metal toxicity depends on their chemical composition, animal species, dose, and time of exposure of animal organisms to heavy metals (Underwood, 1977; Bencko et al., 1984; Páv and Márová, 1988).

40|$|Arsenic is {{the focus}} of public {{attention}} because of its toxicity. Arsenic analysis, its toxicity, and its fate in the environment have been broadly studied, still its blank values, adsorption to sampling materials and pre-concentration of water samples as well as stabilization of <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> in water samples under field conditions have been very little investigated. In this study, we investigate the blank values and adsorption of <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> for different laboratory materials.

25|$|Arsenic {{biochemistry}} {{refers to}} biochemical processes that can use <b>arsenic</b> or its <b>compounds,</b> such as arsenate. Arsenic is a moderately abundant element in Earth's crust, and although many <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> are often considered highly toxic to most life, {{a wide variety}} of organoarsenic compounds are produced biologically and various organic and inorganic <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> are metabolized by numerous organisms. This pattern is general for other related elements, including selenium, which can exhibit both beneficial and deleterious effects. Arsenic biochemistry has become topical since many toxic <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> are found in some aquifers, potentially affecting many millions of people via biochemical processes.|$|R
2500|$|There are two routes {{by which}} {{inorganic}} <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> are methylated. The first route uses Cyt19 arsenic methyltransferase to methylate arsenic (III) to a mono-methylated <b>arsenic</b> (V) <b>compound.</b> This compound is then {{converted to a}} mono-methylated <b>arsenic</b> (III) <b>compound</b> using Glutathione S-Transferase Omega-1 (GSTO1). The mono-methylated <b>arsenic</b> (V) <b>compound</b> can then be methylated again by Cyt19 arsenic methyltransferase, which forms a dimethyl <b>arsenic</b> (V) <b>compound,</b> which {{can be converted to}} a dimethyl <b>arsenic</b> (III) <b>compound</b> by Glutathione S-Transferase Omega-1 (GTSO1). The other route uses glutathione (GSH) to conjugate with arsenic (III) to form an arsenic (GS) 3 complex. This complex can form a monomethylated arsenic (III) GS complex, using Cyt19 arsenic methyltransferase, and this monomethylated GS complex is in equilibrium with the monomethylated arsenic (III). Cyt19 arsenic methyltransferase can methylate the complex one more time, and this forms a dimethylated arsenic GS complex, which is in equilibrium with a dimethyl arsenic (III) complex. Both of the mono-methylated and di-methylated <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> can readily be excreted in urine. However, the monomethylated compound was shown to [...] be more reactive and more toxic than the inorganic <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> to human hepatocites (liver), keratinocytes in the skin, and bronchrial epithelial cells (lungs).|$|R

40|$|Successful in vivo {{chelation}} {{treatment of}} metal intoxication requires {{that a significant}} fraction of the administered chelator in fact chelate the toxic metal. This depends on metal, chelator, and organismrelated factors (e. g., ionic diameter, ring size and deformability, hardness/softness of electron donors and acceptors, route of administration, bioavailability, metabolism, organ and intra/extracellular compartmentalization, and excretion). In vivo chelation is not necessarily an equilibrium reaction, determined by the standard stability constant, because rate effects and ligand exchange reactions considerably influence complex formation. Hydrophilic chelators most effectively promote renal metal excretion, but they complex intracellular metal deposits inefficiently. Lipophilic chelators can decrease intracellular stores but may redistribute toxic metals to, for example, the brain. In chronic metalinduced disease, where life-long chelation may be necessary, possible toxicity or side effects of the administered chelator may be limiting. The metal selectivity of chelators is important {{because of the risk}} of depletion of the patient’s stores of essential metals. Dimercaptosuccinic acid and dimercaptopropionic sulfonate have gained more general acceptance among clinicians, undoubtedly improving the management of many human metal intoxications, including <b>lead,</b> <b>arsenic,</b> and mercury <b>compounds.</b> Still, development of new safer chelators suited for long-term oral administration for chelation of metal deposits (mainly iron), is an important research challenge for the future.

50|$|Many {{studies show}} that {{trivalent}} <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> bind to pairs of cysteine residues.

Such strong sulfur-arsenic bond can be, again, regulated by designing a peptide domain that exhibits higher affinity toward the arsenic, such as tetracysteine motif. By modulating the distance between the two pairs of cysteine residues and the space between the arsenic centers of FlAsH-EDT2, a cooperative and entropically favored dithiol arsenic bond could be achieved.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Contemporary {{combined}} therapies {{that include}} the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> have reduced relapse rates from ~ 50 to < 10 % in acute promy-elocytic leukemia (APL) patients, however relapse treatment remains controversial. Treatment outcomes in relapsed patients with APL previously treated with combined ATRA + <b>arsenic</b> <b>compound</b> therapy were investigated. A retrospective, obser-vational study was conducted of 25 patients with APL (male to female ratio, 17 : 8; mean age, 36. 4 ± 10. 3 years) exhibiting first-time relapse following combined ATRA + <b>arsenic</b> <b>compound</b> therapy. These patients were subsequently treated with secondary ATRA + <b>arsenic</b> <b>compound</b> therapy, salvage chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy or intrathecal chemotherapy, between January 1994 and December 2010. The overall remission rate, duration of remission and toxic effects were assessed. Patient outcomes included mortality during secondary induction therapy (6 / 25, 24. 0 %); complete recovery from central nervous system (CNS) relapse following intrathecal chemotherapy (1 / 25, 4. 0 %); complete remission following ATRA + <b>arsenic</b> <b>compound</b> therapy (10 / 25, 40. 0 %), chemotherapy (3 / 25, 12. 0 %) and targeted therapy (1 / 25, 4. 0 %); and non-remission (NR) following ATRA + <b>arsenic</b> <b>compound</b> therapy (4 / 25, 16 %). Four (16. 0 %) patients were subsequently treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplanta-tion (allo-HSCT), two of which remained disease-free {{at the end of the}} study period and two of which succumbed to the disease. Secondary bone marrow and CNS relapse occurred in 14 (56. 0 %) patients and one (4. 0 %) patient, respectively. ATRA + arsenic compound-based combination therapy was effective in re-inducing morphological remission in relapsed patients with APL with previous exposure to ATRA + <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds,</b> producing low molecular remission rates and high risk of secondary relapse. Furthermore, investigation of early allo-HSCT is required to determine its potential as a therapeutic option for re-inducing morphological remis-sion in relapsed patients with APL with previous exposure to ATRA + <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Information on the {{physical}} and chemical properties of <b>arsenic</b> and <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> can be found in Table 1. 1, for further details please refer to IARC (1980). The list is not exhaustive, nor does it comprise necessarily the most commercially important arsenic-containing substances; rather, it indicates the range of <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> available. 1. 2 Chemical and physical properties of the agents Arsenic (atomic number, 33; relative atomic mass, 74. 92) has chemical and physical properties intermediate between a metal and a nonmetal, and {{is often referred to as}} a metalloid or semi-metal. It belongs to Group VA of the Periodic Table, and can exist in four oxidation states: – 3, 0, + 3, and + 5. Arsenite, As III, and arsenate, As V, are the predominant oxidation states under, respectively, reducing and oxygenated conditions (WHO, 2001; IARC, 2004). From a biological and toxicological perspective, there are three major groups of arsenic compounds:-inorganic <b>arsenic</b> compounds,-organic <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds,</b> and-arsine gas. Of the inorganic <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds,</b> <b>arsenic</b> trioxide, sodium arsenite and arsenic trichloride are the most common trivalent <b>compounds,</b> and <b>arsenic</b> pentoxide, arsenic acid and arsenates (e. g. lead arsenate and calcium arsenate) are the most common pentavalent <b>compounds.</b> Common organic <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> include arsanilic acid, methylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid (cacodylic acid), and arsenobetaine (WHO, 2000). 1. 3 Use of the agents <b>Arsenic</b> and <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> have been produced and used commercially for centuries.
