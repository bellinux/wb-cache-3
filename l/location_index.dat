40|$|Value {{added in}} the poplar wood value chain has great {{economic}} effects for poplar farmers and have {{a fundamental role in}} sustainable supplying of required cellulosic materials of industries in long-term. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the value chain of poplar and use the results to improve it. In order to determine the poplar value chain, Porter's value chain analysis framework was used. The statistical society consists of 76 experts to identify poplar wood value who were active in different parts of the value chain. Value chain analysis was performed using the <b>location</b> quotient <b>index.</b> With this method the local economic conditions of poplar wood value chain were evaluated to the global economic conditions poplar wood value chain in the country. With the help of experts and using a questionnaire, important industries that use poplar wood as a raw material were determined. The maximum poplar value chain <b>location</b> quotient <b>index</b> was blong to Golestan (2. 72) and the minimum poplar value chain <b>location</b> quotient <b>index</b> was blong to Hormozgan (0. 24). The Northern provinces (Golestan, Guilan and Mazandaran) had the highest <b>location</b> quotient <b>index.</b> The <b>location</b> quotient <b>index</b> of the poplar wood value chain of Golestan, Guilan and Mazandaran were 2. 72, 2. 19 and 2. 03, respectively.

40|$|We utilise {{and develop}} Whittle's restless bandit {{formulation}} to analyse a simple class of inventory routing problems with direct deliveries. These routing problems {{arise from the}} practice of vendor-managed inventory replenishment and concern the optimal replenishment {{of a collection of}} inventory holding locations controlled centrally by a decision maker who is able to monitor inventory levels throughout the network. We develop a notion of location indexability from a Lagrangian relaxation of the problem and show that (subject to mild conditions) the locations are indeed indexable. We thus have a collection of <b>location</b> <b>indices</b> in closed form, namely, real-valued functions of the inventory level (one for each location), which measure in a natural way (namely, as a fair charge for replenishment) each location's priority for inclusion in each day's deliveries. We discuss how to use such <b>location</b> <b>indices</b> to construct heuristics for replenishment and assess a greedy index heuristic in a numerical study where it performs strongly. A simpler approximate index analysis is available for the case in which the demand at each location is Poisson. This analysis permits a more explicit characterisation of the range of holding cost rates for which (approximate) location indexability is guaranteed...|$|R
