5|$|Following the war, Admiral Jellicoe was {{tasked with}} helping {{to plan and}} {{coordinate}} the naval policies and defences of the British Dominions. New Zealand was made available for his transportation, and was refitted between December 1918 and February 1919 for the tour; the main changes were the removal of her flying-off platforms and the <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> four-inch guns. The first stop was India, with New Zealand arriving in Bombay on 14 March 1919 and departing six weeks later. The battlecruiser arrived at Albany, Western Australia, on 15 May, where Jellicoe and his staff disembarked to take an overland route across the country. New Zealand sailed via Melbourne and Hobart to depart from Sydney for New Zealand on 16 August.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. The Concorde or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire nose section was angled downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior windows that were more vertically angled. In the B-70 design, only the upper section of the nose moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With the nose raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost horizontal. A system that blew 600F air from the engines was used for both defogging and rain removal. The <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the nose.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{substantially}} <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> voltage (0.3V versus 0.7V for silicon diodes) germanium diodes have an inherent advantage over silicon diodes, especially in circuits like full-wave bridge rectifiers which result in 2X voltage drop because the current must pass through two diodes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{opportunistic}} networks, centrality characterizes a node’s {{capability to}} act as a communication hub. In this paper, we provide an in-depth study of choosing effective centrality metrics for message forwarding in bandwidth-limited opportunis-tic networks. Based on this study, we propose a destination-unaware forwarding algorithm that accounts for the popularity of a node and the contact durations between nodes. We evaluate the algorithm on two experimental human mobility traces. The sim-ulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher system throughput while maintaining a <b>lower</b> <b>forwarding</b> cost compared with several known destination-unaware forwarding schemes.

25|$|In modern sets, a {{semiconductor}} diode {{is used for}} the detector, which is much more reliable than a cat's whisker detector and requires no adjustments. Germanium diodes (or sometimes Schottky diodes) are used instead of silicon diodes, because their <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> voltage drop (roughly 0.3V compared to 0.6V) makes them more sensitive.|$|E
25|$|The Dongó's wings {{were simply}} braced {{compared}} with most biplanes of the day, with an arrangement {{made possible by}} the narrow chord and large stagger. A single, vertical, faired interplane strut on each side braced the rear spar of the upper wing to the <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> spar. Towards its top a metal faired-in oblique strut braced the forward, upper spar and there was a similar arrangement at its foot to the rear spar. To minimise drag, there were no conventional cross bracing flying wires but instead a single, faired diagonal strut from the top of each interplane struts to the corresponding lower fuselage longeron.|$|E
25|$|The General Electric Tungar {{rectifier}} was a mercury vapor (ex.:5B24) or argon (ex.:328) gas-filled electron tube {{device with}} a tungsten filament cathode and a carbon button anode. It operated similarly to the thermionic vacuum tube diode, but the {{gas in the}} tube ionized during forward conduction, giving it a much <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> voltage drop so it could rectify lower voltages. It was used for battery chargers and similar applications from the 1920s until lower-cost metal rectifiers, and later semiconductor diodes, supplanted it. These were made up to a few hundred volts and a few amperes rating, and in some sizes strongly resembled an incandescent lamp with an additional electrode.|$|E

25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They have a <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their {{forward voltage drop}} at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 250 major {{subcontractors}} supplied various {{systems and}} components to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The {{structures of the}} orbiter were manufactured at various companies under contract to Rockwell International's Space Transportation Systems Division, Downey, Calif. The upper and <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> fuselage, crew compartment, forward reaction control system and aft fuselage were manufactured at Rockwell's Space Transportation Systems Division facility in Downey and were transported overland from Downey to Rockwell's Palmdale, Calif., assembly facility. The midfuselage was manufactured by General Dynamics, San Diego, Calif., and transported overland to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The wings (including elevons) were manufactured by Grumman, Bethpage, Long Island, N.Y., and transported by ship from New York via the Panama Canal to Long Beach, Calif., and then transported overland to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The vertical tail (including rudder/speed brake) were manufactured by Fairchild Republic, Farmingdale, Long Island, N.Y., and transported overland to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The payload bay doors were manufactured at Rockwell International's Tulsa, Okla., facility and transported overland to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The body flap was manufactured at Rockwell International's Columbus, Ohio, facility and transported overland to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The aft orbital maneuvering system/reaction control system pods were manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, St. Louis, Mo., and transported by aircraft to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility.

2500|$|An IGBT {{features}} a significantly <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> voltage drop {{compared to a}} conventional MOSFET in higher blocking voltage rated devices, although, MOSFETS exhibit much <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> voltage at lower current densities due {{to the absence of}} a diode Vf in the IGBT's output BJT. As the blocking voltage rating of both MOSFET and IGBT devices increases, the depth of the n- drift region must increase and the doping must decrease, resulting in roughly square relationship decrease in forward conduction versus blocking voltage capability of the device. By injecting minority carriers (holes) from the collector p+ region into the n- drift region during forward conduction, the resistance of the n- drift region is considerably reduced. However, this resultant reduction in on-state forward voltage comes with several penalties: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Aircar was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{parallel}} chord, unswept wings with strong stagger. [...] The wings were built around two wooden spars, with metal ribs and edges but fabric covered; they were fixed to {{the upper and lower}} fuselage. [...] The interplane struts were N-shaped, linking upper and lower spars, aided by one diagonal strut on each side running from the upper rear spar to the <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> spar.

The original canopy over its single seat cockpit was raised above the rear fuselage line and had single oval windows both on the sides and as a windscreen. The oval shape made the <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> window frames broad close to the fuselage, limiting the pilot's view and the cockpit was modified {{at least once in}} the period 1954-6, leading to more conventional glazing with straight lower edges and thin windscreen frames.

[...] As before, the wing was supported by the forward members of its girder fuselage; a vertical strut near the leading edge and an inverted V-strut behind. [...] As the wing was strut rather than wire braced there was no longer a need to extend these struts above the wing into a pylon.

2500|$|The H.31 was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{straight}} edged, parallel chord wings with slight sweep and essentially no stagger; {{the leading edge of}} the lower wing was marginally behind that of the upper one because its chord was a little less. It also had a slightly smaller span. A single, wide chord, airfoil section interplane strut on each side, with widened roots to lower interference drag, separated the bays; on each side pairs of flying wires and landing wires provided cross bracing between these struts and the fuselage. The wings were built around twin Duralumin box main spars, with metal and wood ribs. [...] There were ailerons on the upper planes. [...] Neither wing was directly fuselage mounted but instead held off by pairs of N-form struts on each side. Those joining the lower wing to the low-mid fuselage were longer than those of the cabane and the <b>lower</b> <b>forward</b> component was itself a close pair. Both upper and lower wings had the common cut-outs to improve the pilot's vision but the H.31 had a forward, full chord slot between the upper wings as well.|$|E
