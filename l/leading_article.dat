25|$|Bernard Darwin was an {{authority}} on Charles Dickens. He frequently contributed the fourth <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> in The Times. The fourth Leader was devoted to flippant themes, and Darwin was known to insert quotes from or about Dickens in them. When Oxford Press issued all classics by Dickens around 1940, each with a foreword by a Dickensian scholar, Darwin was chosen to contribute the foreword to The Pickwick Papers. He was also asked by The Times to pen the main tribute to cricketer W.G. Grace when Grace's birth centenary was celebrated in 1948. The article has been included since in a few anthologies.|$|E
25|$|The two-tier {{structure}} established was also seen as problematic. In particular, {{the division of}} planning between districts and counties {{was a source of}} friction between the new councils. Thamesdown Borough Council called for a further reform and complete abolition of counties as they felt Wiltshire County Council was unable to respond to the needs of an expanding urban area. Further complaints surrounded the loss of water supply and sewerage powers to regional water authorities created by the Water Act 1973. This was felt to reduce the ability of district councils to plan new housing developments. It was also felt that the boundaries of the metropolitan counties were too tightly drawn, leaving out much of the suburban areas of the conurbations. The <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> in The Times on the day the Act came into effect noted that the new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively.|$|E
25|$|At a later {{election}} Hackett {{was opposed to}} John Madden, and this time lost by only a small margin. In 1882 he resigned his positions at Trinity College and went to Western Australia to become a squatter in the Gascoyne district. His first season was a bad one {{and he decided to}} give up the land. He joined forces with Charles Harper, the proprietor of The West Australian, and very soon his influence on this paper began to be felt. The Western Mail was established in 1885 and both papers became prosperous. In 1887 Hackett became editor of The West Australian and was a strong advocate of responsible government. Western Australia received its constitution in 1890, and Alexander Forrest selected Hackett as the first man to be asked to join the nominee Western Australian Legislative Council. The population of the colony was still under 50,000 but was beginning to rise, and the discovery of gold accelerated this. The newspapers grew with the population and became very valuable properties. Hackett, as editor, was writing a daily <b>leading</b> <b>article,</b> and was also the business manager.|$|E

500|$|The {{influx of}} émigrés, {{and the rising}} rates of violent crime {{associated}} with it, led to popular concerns and comments in the press. The government passed the Aliens Act 1905 {{in an attempt to}} reduce immigration. The popular press reflected the opinions of many at the time; a <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> in The Manchester Evening Chronicle supported the bill to bar [...] "the dirty, destitute, diseased, verminous and criminal foreigner who dumps himself on our soil". The journalist Robert Winder, in his examination of immigration into Britain, opines that the Act [...] "gave official sanction to xenophobic reflexes which might... have remained dormant".|$|E
500|$|After the trial, {{the press}} and public {{remained}} broadly sympathetic to the Orsborne brothers.

On {{the day after the}} sentencing, The Times <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> noted the public's sustained pleasure in the escapade. Nearly 30 years later, in his social history of the between-the-wars years, Ronald Blythe portrayed the affair as an anti-establishment gesture, [...] "a colourful snook cocked in the face {{of some of the most}} soul-crippling officialdom ever experienced by ordinary men and women".|$|E

Fishman writes that [...] "the [...] (crazy) Anarchists were almost accepted as part of the East End landscape"; the terms [...] "socialist" [...] and [...] "anarchist" [...] had been conflated in the British press, who used the terms interchangeably to refer to those with revolutionary beliefs.

And these are the men who use the pistol and the knife." ...|$|E
500|$|By mid-1858 the {{problems}} with the Thames had been building for several years. In his [...] novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was [...] "a deadly sewer... in the place of a fine, fresh river". In a letter to a friend, Dickens [...] said: [...] "I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that [...] "in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep" [...] on the Thames foreshore, and that [...] "the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged —rising to [...] in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained {{on the banks of the}} river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event [...] "The Great Stink"; the <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> in the City Press observed that [...] "Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a [...] "pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination", while a second wrote that [...] "the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream".

Richard Preston, blogging for The Daily Telegraph, compared the importance of Griffin's appearance with past infrequent Question Time panellists such as comedians Eddie Izzard, Norman Pace and Jim Davidson, while also expressing confidence that the hour-long show and David Dimbleby would provide enough scrutiny to expose Griffin if he was a 'lightweight' or a 'bluffer'; he suggested that [...] "Britain truly does have problems" [...] if a trio of mainstream politicians did not manage to take him apart.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine the discursive {{construction}} of Danish national identity {{in relation to the}} articulation of freedom of speech and the terrorist attacks in Paris on january 7 th and in Copenhagen on february 16 th and 17 th, 2015. The examination will base itself on carefully chosen empirical data consisting of eight <b>leading</b> <b>articles</b> in the four national Danish newspapers; Information, Jyllands-Posten, Kristeligt Dagblad and Politiken, published in the period after the attacks. By utilizing the qualitative methods of discourse analysis with the primary use of discourse theories of Norman Fairclough, and further clarifying and applying the selected cultural theories of Benedict Anderson, Paul Ricoeur, Stuart Hall, Clifford Geertz and Aníbal Quijano, the analysis will illustrate the construction of identity in the chosen <b>leading</b> <b>articles.</b> The investigation takes departure in the discourses from Carsten Stage’s analysis in Tegningekrisen (2011) thus contributing to the investigations theoretical framework. The analysis of this paper will present how the discourses have shifted since Tegningekrisen (2011) and how new discourses have arisen. The examination concludes that the <b>leading</b> <b>articles</b> construct Danish identity by creating imagined communities from categories with ideological and cultural similarities and concepts of sameness. These categories are also defined by categories that are not included because of elements deemed too different. All <b>leading</b> <b>articles</b> inscribe themselves into Stage’s discourses, but since the situational and the socio-cultural context has changed since 2006, the discourses portray freedom of speech and tolerance in a somewhat different manner. There is a cultural and ideological struggle occurring in the <b>leading</b> <b>articles,</b> in relation to defining the boundaries of Danish identity and of freedom of speech, as well as its correct utilization...|$|R

500|$|The Local Government Act 1972 {{reformed}} {{local government}} in England {{by creating a}} system of two-tier metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties and districts throughout the country. The act formally established Greater Manchester on 1 April 1974, although Greater Manchester County Council (GMCC) had been running since elections in 1973. The <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> in The Times {{on the day the}} Local Government Act came into effect noted that the [...] "new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively". Frangopulo noted that the creation of Greater Manchester [...] "was the official unifying of a region which, through history and tradition, had forged for itself over many centuries bonds... between the communities of town and village, each of which was the embodiment of the character of this region". The name Greater Manchester was adopted, having been favoured over Selnec by the local population.|$|E
500|$|In 1920, Rutherford {{published}} a booklet, Millions Now Living Will Never Die, {{and a year}} later published his first hardcover book, The Harp of God. [...] This was followed by a further nineteen hardcover books, each with one-word titles, such as Creation (1927), Jehovah (1934) and Children (1941). His publications reached a total printing of 36 million copies. In 1925 he gained full control over what doctrines would be taught in Watch Tower Society publications, overruling the refusal by the five-man Editorial Committee to publish his article, [...] "Birth of the Nation", which contained significant doctrinal changes. Rutherford later claimed Satan had [...] "tried to prevent the publication of that article ... but failed in that effort"; In 1927 the Watch Tower Society ceased printing of Russell's Studies in the Scriptures. The Editorial Committee was dissolved in 1931, after which Rutherford wrote every <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> in The Watch Tower until his death. The 1933 Watch Tower Society Yearbook observed that the demise of the Editorial Committee indicated [...] "that the Lord himself is running his organization".|$|E
500|$|At {{the height}} of the stink, between 200 and 250 tons of lime were being used near the mouths of the sewers that {{discharged}} into the Thames, and men were employed spreading lime onto the Thames foreshore at low tide; the cost was £1,500 per week. On 15 June Disraeli tabled the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Bill, a proposed amendment to the 1855 Act; in the opening debate he called the Thames [...] "a Stygian pool, reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors". The Bill put the responsibility to clear up the Thames on the MBW, and stated that [...] "as far as may be possible" [...] the sewerage outlets should not be within the boundaries of London; it also allowed the Board to borrow £3million, which was to be repaid from a three-penny levy on all London households for the next forty years. The terms favoured Bazalgette's original 1856 plan, and overcame Hall's objection to it. The <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> in The Times observed that [...] "Parliament was all but compelled to legislate upon the great London nuisance by the force of sheer stench". The bill was debated in late July and was passed into law on 2 August.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of Davidson's treatment by the consistory court was first {{raised by the}} Church Times immediately after the trial. A <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> argued that, although Davidson's conduct had been [...] "foolish and eccentric", his intentions {{at least at the}} start of his ministry had been guided by idealism. Chancellor North was criticised both for lacking compassion and for the general conduct of the proceedings: [...] "No experienced criminal solicitor could conceivably have blundered so badly and consistently." [...] In 2006 Davidson's granddaughter, Karylin Collier, privately published a brief biography, The Rector of Stiffkey: His Life and Trial, in which she maintains the innocence of all the charges against him. Tucker argues that [...] "Harold Davidson probably deserved to be quietly defrocked for his shortcomings as a priest", but nevertheless believes that he was not an immoral man. He also highlights the incompetent presentation of Davidson's case by his legal team, particularly their failure to question the provenance of the Barbara Harris letter. Tucker concludes that since the proceedings were flawed and the evidence of immorality flimsy, the Church of England owes it to the Davidson family to re-examine the original findings.|$|E

He finished his statement by saying that [...] "I regret that the normal method of historical verification has been sacrificed to the perhaps necessary requirements of a journalistic scoop." [...] The <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> in The Guardian described his public reversal as showing [...] "moral courage". Irving, who had been described in the introductory statement by Koch as a historian [...] "with no reputation to lose", stood at the microphone for questions, and asked how Hitler could have written his diary in the days following the 20 July plot, when his arm had been damaged. He denounced the diaries as forgeries, and held aloft the photocopied pages he had been given from Priesack. He asked if the ink in the diaries had been tested, but there was no response from the managers of Stern. Photographers and film crews jostled to get a better picture of Irving, and some punches were thrown by journalists while security guards moved in and forcibly removed Irving from the room, while he shouted [...] "Ink!

500|$|By {{the time}} the appeal was prepared, Seck had left Legal Services but was still the {{attorney}} of record. [...] The tribe paid to fly him to Washington, D.C. to prepare the brief with Dan Israel of NARF and Bernie Becker, the tribe's attorney who would argue the case before the Supreme Court. At oral arguments on April 20, 1976, Becker pointed out that Public Law 280 gave the state jurisdiction over criminal matters and civil [...] "causes of actions" [...] – a legal term for lawsuits. Since Congress had also passed other Indian laws at the same time, such as the various Indian Termination Acts, which specifically authorized states to collect taxes from Indians, its silence in this area meant Congress {{did not intend to}} do so with Public Law 280. Becker brought up the <b>leading</b> <b>article</b> on Public Law 280, by UCLA law professor Carole Goldberg, that argued that the law was established {{to address the problem of}} crime on reservations. He also noted that tribes which had adequate law-and-order processes, such as the Red Lake Band of Chippewa, were excluded from state jurisdiction in Minnesota. Arguing for the State of Minnesota was C. H. Luther of the State Attorney General's office. Luther argued four points for the tax being valid: a) the language of the statute; b) the legislative history of Public Law 280; c) prior judicial opinions; and d) public policy. Luther conceded that if the trailer was a fixed house or real property, it would be exempt from taxation. Luther also stated that other taxes [...] such as gasoline, sales, income and other taxes of general applicability [...] would apply to Indians.|$|E
