5|$|Of {{the total}} number of the Robinsons who hid in the ruins of the city only a portion's names and <b>locations</b> <b>are</b> known.

The table below lists some of those who have been mentioned in the memoirs or other written works on the subject.|$|E
5|$|On September18, a heavy {{northern}} gale wrecked {{the ship}} Smoker {{on the bar}} at Tampico, Tamaulipas, in Mexico. On September19, two ships were capsized, the John Howell and the J.K.L.

The storm made landfall early on September19 in a rural area of Tamaulipas to the north of Tampico. Based on John Kaplan and Mark DeMaria's inland decay model created in 1995, it is estimated that the cyclone dissipated several hours later.|$|E

5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often harvested from the wild as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection from the wild for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal <b>locations</b> <b>are</b> affected directly by pollution and siltation, and indirectly by the effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|Tangascootack Creek is {{considered}} to be a cold water fishery. The tributary North Fork Tangascootack Creek has significant trout and macroinvertebrate populations. On the main stem of the creek, there are limited numbers of fish and some aquatic ecosystems, though in the middle and upper parts of the creek, there is virtually no life in the water. Near the headwaters and Bear Swamp, there is some aquatic life, as these <b>locations</b> <b>are</b> upstream of the strip mines and acid mine drainage. The main species of fish in the creek are brook trout, Semotilus atromaculatus, Catostomus commersoni, and Rhinichthys atratulus. Young-of-the-Year trout also live in the creek.|$|E
