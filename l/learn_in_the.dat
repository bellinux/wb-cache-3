25|$|Technology is {{essential}} to the field of educational psychology, not only for the psychologist themselves as far as testing, organization, and resources, but also for students. Educational Psychologists whom reside in the K- 12 setting focus the majority of their time with Special Education students. It has been found that students with disabilities learning through technology such as IPad applications and videos are more engaged and motivated to <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom setting. Liu et al. explain that learning-based technology allows for students to be more focused, and learning is more efficient with learning technologies. The authors explain that learning technology also allows for students with social- emotional disabilities to participate in distance learning.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, Rashi {{was first}} brought to learn Torah {{by his father}} on Shavuot day {{at the age of}} five. His father was his main Torah teacher until his death when Rashi was still a youth. At the age of 17 he married and soon after went to <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yeshiva of Rabbi Yaakov ben Yakar in Worms, {{returning}} to his wife three times yearly, for the Days of Awe, Passover and Shavuot. When Rabbi Yaakov died in 1064, Rashi continued learning in Worms for another year in the yeshiva of his relative, Rabbi Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi, who was also chief rabbi of Worms. Then he moved to Mainz, where he studied under another of his relatives, Rabbi Isaac ben Judah, the rabbinic head of Mainz and one of the leading sages of the Lorraine region straddling France and Germany.|$|E

Framed by the literature, the research shows that workplace educators’ qualifications prepare them for facilitating <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. The most important findings show that their qualifications have prepared them for their roles and responsibilities <b>in</b> facilitating transformative <b>learning</b> within the workplace. Furthermore, the findings show that their qualifications, roles and responsibilities <b>in</b> facilitating <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace also impacted on workplace educators’ own thinking, prompting them to question their own values and beliefs. This perspective transformation allows for workplace educators better facilitating transformative <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace...|$|R

500|$|The first {{mentions}} of Palsgraf in law reviews were case notes {{written by}} law students, appearing {{over the course}} of the year following the decision by the Court of Appeals. Professor Robert L. Goodhart, in the Yale Law Journal in 1930, was at the front of an avalanche of commentary to such an extent that by 1938, Louisiana State University professor Thomas A. Cowan deemed Palsgraf [...] "a legal institution". The case entered the standard legal casebooks, from which law students <b>learn,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1930s, usually to illustrate the necessary connection between defendant's misconduct and plaintiff's injury in negligence cases. According to Posner, writing in 1990, [...] "Palsgraf is now the subject of a large scholarly literature, and is, I believe, the only case reprinted in all American casebooks on tort law." [...] Manz wrote, [...] "everyone who has sat in an American law school torts class can recall the basic facts—the crowded railroad platform, the running men, the dropped package, the explosion, and the falling scale. Palsgraf has become a sort of legal 'urban legend'—an allegedly true, but improbable, tale told and retold to each new class of law students." [...] Professor W. Jonathan Cardi noted, [...] "in law school classrooms, 'Palsgraf Day' is often celebrated with food and drink, dramatic reenactments, interpretive poems, and even mock duels between Judges Cardozo and Andrews".|$|E
500|$|The ending {{sequence}} with Pam and Jim in {{the hospital}} was filmed at the North Hollywood Medical Center using the Sacred Heart Hospital set from Scrubs. Although the good news Jim and Pam <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital was never specifically stated, episode writer Jen Celotta confirmed that the news was that Pam was pregnant; the script included an off-hand question from a nurse to Pam about whether she was pregnant so that viewers would make the connection later. Celotta said {{the idea of the}} pregnancy came as the writers were working on this specific episode, although she felt the show had always been heading in that direction. The series producers considered filming the scene with audible dialogue, but they thought the scene was more powerful without audio and felt actors John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer [...] "are such great actors and have the ability to convey so much without hearing their dialogue." [...] Celotta said the show's producers have no plans to release the scene with audio. While filming Jim Halpert's emotional reaction to the pregnancy news, Krasinski and director Ken Kwapis discussed the fact that Jim has been surrounded by this camera crew for the last five years, so he would be glad to share this moment with them. The moment when Jim looked directly at the camera, in particular, was meant to convey the idea that he was celebrating the news with the crew. The script did not call for tears, but Krasinski cried naturally as part of his performance.|$|E

2500|$|Tomasello further {{argues that}} {{cultural}} learning {{is essential for}} language-acquisition. Most children in any society, and all children in some, do not learn all words through the direct efforts of adults. [...] "In general, {{for the vast majority}} of words in their language, children must find a way to <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ongoing flow of social interaction, sometimes from speech not even addressed to them." [...] This finding has been confirmed by a variety of experiments in which children learned words even when the referent was not present, multiple referents were possible, and the adult was not directly trying to teach the word to the child. Tomasello concludes that [...] "a linguistic symbol is nothing other than a marker for an intersubjectively shared understanding of a situation." ...|$|E

Their line distribution and overall participation in the performance will be decided from their groups, in which case A would have the most number of lines while F would be backup dancers. They are informed they will have 3 days to practice, and then be reassigned to their final groups after a re-evaluation. The trainees are filmed individually performing the song which will then be watched and evaluated by the mentors. They are then given their new grades and asked to move to their new rooms by grade.

2500|$|The Soviet Union in 1918, {{decreed that}} all nationalities in the Soviet Union {{had the right}} to {{education}} in their own language. [...] Thus Ukrainians since that time were entitled to study and <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ukrainian language. During the Soviet times, the attitude to Ukrainian language and culture went through periods of promotion (policy of [...] "korenization"), suppression (during the period of Stalinism), and Ukrainization (with the epoch of Khrushchev). Ukrainian cultural organizations, such as theatres or the Writers' Union, were funded by the central administration. While officially there was no state language in the Soviet Union until 1990, Russian in practice had an implicitly privileged position as the only language widely spoken across the country. In 1990 Russian became legally the official all-Union language of the Soviet Union, with constituent republics having rights to declare their own official languages. The Ukrainian language, despite official encouragement and government funding, like other regional languages, was often frowned upon or quietly discouraged, which led to a gradual decline in its usage.|$|E

[...] His mother, Miriam Kayla, {{died when he was}} three years old. After his father remarried, he was sent to learn in a cheder in the nearby town of Wolbrum, where he boarded with his mother's relatives. Here he proved himself to have a sharp mind and understanding. People began calling him by the Yiddish {{translation}} of his name, [...] "Leib Hirsch". At the age of 12 he went to <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yeshiva ketana in Amstov, near Częstochowa, where he outpaced boys his own age in their studies. A year later, after his bar mitzvah, he moved to the yeshiva of the Sochatchover Rebbe, the Avnei Nezer, in Sochaczew. Here Frumer found fellow students at the same high intellectual level as he, and grew into a Torah scholar of note. He became a devout Sochatchover Hasid, and went on to serve the first three Sochatchover Rebbes.|$|E
