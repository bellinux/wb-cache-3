40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role that}} culture plays in the tax compliance process. Public finance is dependent upon taxpayers complying with tax laws.

Its objective is {{to test the hypothesis}} that certain aspects of a nation’s culture impact the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> evasion within that country. More specifically, do countries with lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> compliance with laws in general also experience lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> compliance or, in other words greater rates <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> evasion?

40|$|We {{examine the}} link between {{corporate}} governance, managerial incentives, and corporate tax avoidance. Similar to other investment opportunities that involve risky expected cash flows, unresolved agency problems may lead managers to engage in more or less corporate tax avoidance than shareholders would otherwise prefer. Consistent with the mixed results reported in prior studies, we find no relation between various corporate governance mechanisms and tax avoidance at the conditional mean and median <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> avoidance distribution. However, using quantile regression, we find a positive relation between board independence and financial sophistication for low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance, but a negative relation for high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance. These results indicate that these governance attributes have a stronger relation with more extreme <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance, which {{are more likely to}} be symptomatic of over- and under-investment by managers...|$|R
50|$|In the Intendancy of San Salvador (covering {{roughly the}} same {{territory}} as today's El Salvador), many Creoles and other settlers wanted to separate control of the colony from the Guatemalan Captaincy General. This was largely due to economic and political reasons.

5000|$|Most {{economic}} commentators {{suggest that}} the first [...] "true" [...] tax haven was Switzerland, followed closely by Liechtenstein. Swiss banks had long been a capital haven for people fleeing social upheaval in Russia, Germany, South America and elsewhere. However, {{in the early part}} of the twentieth century, during the years immediately following World War I, many European governments raised taxes sharply to help pay for reconstruction efforts following the devastation of World War I. By and large, Switzerland, having remained neutral during the Great War, avoided these additional infrastructure costs and was consequently able to maintain a low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes.</b> As a result, there was a considerable influx of capital into the country for tax related reasons. It is difficult, nonetheless, to pinpoint a single event or precise date which clearly identifies the emergence of the modern tax haven.|$|E

50|$|As a {{grassroots}} group of generally low and moderate income families, Tennesseans for Fair Taxation is allied with state public employee and schoolteacher groups, along with faith-based organizations and good government groups, {{in establishing a}} progressive, broad-based state income tax {{as part of a}} larger tax modernization package that would also repeal the food tax and reduce the sales tax. This group notes that Tennessee is shown by almost all objective measures to have one of the lowest per capita <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> of the fifty U.S. states but that the tax share is disproportionately placed upon poorer people. This is because the majority of state tax revenues in Tennessee are derived from a sales tax, which applies to food, clothing, furniture, car parts, and other necessities, but not private school tuition, real estate investments, attorney fees, or stocks and bonds (except for interest earned and dividends, which are taxed at 6 percent under the Hall income tax, Tennessee being the only state with this provision). In Tennessee, food for human consumption is taxed at 5.5% (This was lowered from 6 to 5.5% in January 2008) and most other items of commerce at 7%, with local jurisdictions empowered to add as much as another 2.75% to this, making the overall sales tax rate in many jurisdictions, including the major urban areas, 8.25% on food and 9.75% on other items.|$|E

40|$|A {{benchmark}} {{result in}} {{the political economy of}} taxation is that the degree of redistribution is positively linked to income inequality. However, empirical evidence supporting such a relationship turns out to be mixed.

By focussing on structure induced equilibria in which taxpayers vote over the size <b>of</b> the income <b>tax</b> and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> enforcement, we show that higher inequality may well decrease the extent of redistribution, depending on two opposing effects: the standard political effect and a negative tax base effect working through increases in the average <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance and the share of enforcement expenditures in total tax revenue. ...|$|R
