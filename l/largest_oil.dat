5|$|According to Japanese weather officials, heavy rain, flood, {{storm and}} high wave {{warnings}} {{were put into}} effect for all of Kyūshū and adjacent areas in Honshū. The two largest air carriers in Japan, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, cancelled at least 36 domestic flights ahead of the storm. Several of the <b>largest</b> <b>oil</b> refineries halted oil product shipments from three refineries. Kyushu Railways postponed services on five lines, one of which crossed the entire prefecture. Long distance ferries were also shut down. Iwakuni, Yamaguchi was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 3 and Sasebo, Nagasaki was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness Storm Watch.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, William Rockefeller Jr., John's brother, built another {{refinery}} in Cleveland {{and brought}} John into the partnership. In 1867, Henry M. Flagler became a partner, {{and the firm}} of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler was established. By 1868, with Rockefeller continuing practices of borrowing and reinvesting profits, controlling costs, and using refineries' waste, the company owned two Cleveland refineries and a marketing subsidiary in New York; it was the <b>largest</b> <b>oil</b> refinery in the world. Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler was the predecessor of the Standard Oil Company.|$|E

5|$|Oil {{reserves}} {{discovered in}} the later 20th century in the seas both east and west of Shetland have provided a much-needed alternative {{source of income for}} the islands. The East Shetland Basin is one of Europe's <b>largest</b> <b>oil</b> fields {{and as a result of}} the oil revenue and the cultural links with Norway, a small Home Rule movement developed briefly to recast the constitutional position of Shetland. It saw as its models the Isle of Man, as well as Shetland's closest neighbour, the Faroe Islands, an autonomous dependency of Denmark.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the 48MW Kohtla-Järve Power Station– {{the first}} power {{station in the}} world to use {{pulverised}} oil shale at an industrial scale– was commissioned, followed by the 72.5MW Ahtme Power Station in 1951. To ensure sufficient electricity supply in Estonia, Latvia and north-west Russia, the Balti Power Station (1,430MW) and the Eesti Power Station (1,610MW) were built, the former between 1959 and 1971 and the latter between 1969 and 1973. The stations, collectively known as the Narva Power Stations, are the world's two <b>largest</b> <b>oil</b> shale-fired power stations. In 1988 Moscow-based authorities planned a third oil shale-fired power station in Narva with a capacity of 2,500MW, together with a new mine at Kuremäe. The plan, disclosed {{at the time of the}} Phosphorite War and the Singing Revolution, met with strong local opposition and was never implemented.|$|E
5|$|Once steel {{supplies}} {{had been}} agreed, an initial tranche of $35 million in funding {{was provided by}} the government Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which owned and manage the operation of the pipelines through its subsidiary organizations, the Defense Plants and the Defense Supplies corporations. In turn, the actual construction and operation of the pipelines would be carried out by the War Emergency Pipelines company (WEP), a non-profit corporation backed by a consortium of the <b>largest</b> <b>oil</b> companies in the United States: Atlantic Refining, Cities Service Oil, Consolidated Oil, Gulf Oil, Pan American Petroleum and Transportation, Standard Oil, Tidewater Associated Oil, Shell Oil, Socony-Vacuum Oil, Sun Oil and the Texas Pipe Line Company. The WEP was led by W. Alton Jones and Burt Hull, both with extensive backgrounds in the industry, with Oscar Wolfe as its chief engineer. The company established its offices in Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E
30|$|These {{countries}} {{have already been}} empirically investigated regarding the dependence structure between oil and exchange rates (see, e.g., Reboredo 2012; Reboredo et al. 2014). In addition, some <b>large</b> <b>oil</b> exporters (e.g., countries in the Middle East) and a <b>large</b> <b>oil</b> importer (China) are excluded from our analysis {{because they have no}} flexible exchange rates (their exchange rates fixed to the US dollar).|$|R

5|$|In Venezuela, {{citizens}} in coastal areas of Falcón, Sucre and Isla Margarita {{were moved to}} safer areas, and several thousands were evacuated due to the hurricane. The Simón Bolívar International Airport, as well as three other mainland airports, were closed. Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. temporarily closed its oil refinery in Curaçao, and two ports were briefly shut down; this caused a delay in two oil deliveries. The Valero Energy Corporation shut down its <b>largest</b> <b>oil</b> refinery in Aruba. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane, oil companies in Trinidad and Tobago ceased production and removed workers from offshore rigs; the Atlantic LNG company closed exports. Seven shelters were opened on Tobago, where about 560people evacuated for the storm. Two people died: one man trying to save his car, and one girl sleeping in her bed, when a tree fell on the roof above her room. Most evacuees were from low-lying areas, and {{on the day of the}} storm's passage most schools and businesses were closed. The two main airports in the country were closed, with one airline canceling all of its flights.|$|E
5|$|New mines {{were opened}} in Ahtme (1948), Jõhvi (No. 2, 1949), Sompa (1949), Tammiku (1951), {{and in the}} area between Käva and Sompa (No. 4, 1953). The Küttejõu open-pit mine was closed in 1947 and the Küttejõu {{underground}} mine was merged with the Kiviõli mine in 1951. The Ubja mine was closed in 1959. After construction of large oil shale-fired power stations, demand for oil shale increased and consequently new larger mines were constructed: the underground mines Viru (1965) and Estonia (1972) along with the open-pit mines Sirgala (1963), Narva (1970) and Oktoobri (1974; later named Aidu). Correspondingly, several exhausted smaller mines like Kukruse (1967), Käva (1972), No. 2 (1973), No. 4 (1975), and Kiviõli (1987) were closed. The Estonia Mine became the <b>largest</b> <b>oil</b> shale mine in the world. Because {{of the success of}} oil shale-based power generation, Estonian oil shale mining peaked in 1980 at 31.35million tonnes, and in the same year power generation peaked at 18.9TWh. The industry declined during the subsequent two decades. Demand for electric power generated from oil shale decreased following construction of nuclear power stations in the Russian SFSR, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station. At the end of 1988, a fire broke out in the Estonia Mine. The largest underground fire in Estonia, it continued for 81days and caused serious pollution of ground and surface waters.|$|E
5|$|Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring (1943) – in {{the autumn}} of 1942 the WAAC {{commissioned}} Knight to paint a portrait to bolster female recruitment to the ordnance factories, as the Ministry of Supply were concerned at the level of disaffection and absenteeism among women working in the factories. The resulting painting is one of the <b>largest</b> <b>oil</b> paintings in the entire WAAC collection, and the largest single figure portrait it acquired throughout the war. The painting was first shown on 30April 1943 at the Royal Academy and the next day was reproduced in eight British newspapers. The painting, along with Knight and Loftus, also featured in a British Paramount News short film shown in cinemas, and was reproduced in a poster version by WAAC. The success of the painting led to further industrial commissions for Knight throughout the 1940s. In 1945 she painted Switch Works at Ellison Switchgear in Birmingham. This was followed by paintings of operations at the Dow Mac concrete railway-sleeper works and at the Skefko ball bearing factory.|$|E

Exports of oil boomed from 1.9% to 91.2% between 1920 and 1935. By the end of the 1930s, Venezuela had become the third-leading oil producer in the world, behind the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the leading exporter.|$|E
