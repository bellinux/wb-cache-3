40|$|The world's {{ocean and}} land {{ecosystems}} act as sinks for anthropogenic CO 2, {{and over the}} last half century their combined sink strength grew steadily with increasing CO 2 emissions. Recent analyses of the global carbon budget, however, have uncovered an abrupt, substantial (???? 1 ?PgC?yr? 1) and sustained increase in the <b>land</b> <b>sink</b> in the late 1980 s whose origin remains unclear. In the absence of this prominent shift in the <b>land</b> <b>sink,</b> increases in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations since the late 1980 s would have been ???? 30 ?% larger than observed (or ???? 12 ?ppm above current levels). Global data analyses are limited in regards to attributing causes to changes in the <b>land</b> <b>sink</b> because different regions are likely responding to different drivers. Here, we address this challenge by using terrestrial biosphere models constrained by observations to determine if there is independent evidence for the abrupt strengthening of the <b>land</b> <b>sink.</b> We find that net primary production significantly increased in the late 1980 s (more so than heterotrophic respiration), consistent with the inferred increase in the global <b>land</b> <b>sink,</b> and that large-scale climate anomalies are responsible for this shift. We identify two key regions in which climatic constraints on plant growth have eased: northern Eurasia experienced warming, and northern Africa received increased precipitation. Whether these changes in continental climates are connected is uncertain, but North Atlantic climate variability is important. Our findings suggest that improved understanding of climate variability in the North Atlantic may be essential for more credible projections of the <b>land</b> <b>sink</b> under climate change...|$|R

While  13 C-based calculations of the <b>land</b> <b>sink</b> decline with increasing estimates of terrestrial carbon residence times (through the fossil fuel-induced isotopic disequilibrium term in equations describing the global atmospheric budgets of  13 CO 2 and CO 2), estimates of <b>land</b> <b>sinks</b> based on CO 2 fertilization of plant growth are directly proportional to carbon residence times. Here we used a single model of terrestrial carbon turnover, the Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model, to simultaneously estimate 1984 – 1990 terrestrial carbon storage using both approaches. Our goal was to identify the fraction of the  13 CO 2 -based <b>land</b> <b>sink</b> attributable to CO 2 fertilization.

40|$|Problem statement: Recently {{the impacts}} of climate change, in particular, sea level rise, had been a major concern for many Pacific island countries. In early 2000, there were a series of media {{coverage}} over sea level rise issues using Tuvalu as an example. The daily life of Tuvalu revolves around the ocean and the immediate threat on the islands people, economy, environment and its islands is of concern to the Tuvalu government. The Tuvalu government has concluded that Tuvalu was destined {{to become the first}} nation to be sunk by global warming because {{it is one of the}} smallest and lowest-lying countries in the world. Approach: In this study, sea level data from the Australian project will be focussed on despite the fact that the length of data is not sufficiently long. The AusAID funded South Pacific Sea Level and climate monitoring project was set up in response to concerns raised by Pacific island countries over the potential impacts of an enhanced greenhouse effect on climate and sea levels in the South Pacific for 20 years. Results: Based upon the 15 ½ years of sea level data from the project, the sea level rise rate in Tuvalu as at september 2008 was 5. 9 mM year - 1. This was about four times higher than the global average of 1 - 2 mm year - 1. Sea level in the Tuvalu area had risen approximately 9. 14 cm since the inception of the project 15 ½ years ago. However, it was to be noted that the land is quite stable and the rate of <b>land</b> <b>sinking</b> is - 0. 06 mM year - 1 only. Accordingly, there was no significant impact on the sea level trends. Conclusion: Although the data length is just over 15 years, the sea level trend values do not fluctuate significantly since 1999.

40|$|An {{original}} nonlinear three-dimensional {{finite element}} model is developed to predict the residual land subsidence adjacent to depleted gas fields, as a delayed response from an active aquifer which may keep on compacting {{for a long time}} after the field abandonment. The pore pressure recovery within the reservoir and the depletion of the lateral/bottom aquifer are simulated by a subsurface flow model coupled with the equation of state of the residual gas repressurized by the ground water which floods the field. The resulting pore pressure distribution is used as input data in a pore-elastic structural model of land subsidence. The modeling approach is nonlinear because of both the dynamic coupling between the flux from the aquifer and the reservoir gas pressure response, and the dependence of the porous medium elastic properties on the effective intergranular stress and the loading/unloading conditions. The model is applied to the 3, 000 m deep gas reservoir of Dosso degli Angeli, one of the major fields in the Northern Adriatic sedimentary basin, made of three major gas pools. Representative basin-scale mechanical parameters have been obtained from laboratory triaxial and oedometric tests, density logs, and recent measurements of in situ compaction by the use of radioactive markers. In 1992, at the end of 21 year production life the maximum pore pressure drawdown in the depleted pools approached 300 kg/cm(2). The largest land settlement from the modeling simulation turns out to be 31 cm, in good agreement with the available leveling records. Numerical predictions suggest that a residual <b>land</b> <b>sinking</b> of about 10 cm is yet to be expected in 2042, i. e., 50 years after the field abandonment, close to the areas of Porto Garibaldi and Casal Borsetti a few kilometers south and north of the field, respectively, namely between two and three times the subsidence experienced by those areas during the field development.

At the Grau-de-la-Dent tide-gauge in the Camargue (Rhone delta, France), daily sea-level records are available since 1905. Hourly tide data spanning the period 1979 – 1995 were obtained through the digitisation of the original paper records: the local harmonic constants and the surges for the whole 20 th century have been computed from these hourly observations. It appears that the annual maximum observed sea-level height increases by 4 mm/yr {{at a rate that}} is two times faster than the average observed relative sea level. The increasing trend of the annual maximum positive sea surges (+ 1. 9 mm/yr), which is equal to the average relative sea-level rise, is thus responsible for this difference. The most important meteorological factor associated with local sea-surge occurrences is wind blowing from 1001 to 1201 sectors, which tends to push the water toward the coasts. Since 1961, the frequency and the speed of wind from this sector increased, although with some variability, thus contributing in part to the increase in the frequency and intensity of the surges. Due to the changing hydrodynamics phenomenon in the Camargue, a positive feedback mechanism between extreme marine events and shoreline regression is another factor to explain the sea-surge rise over the long term. The increase in sea-surge frequency and height during the last century is especially of concern in the deltaic area if the nearfuture global sea-level rise predicted by climate models is also taken into account. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Any rise in sea level will have adverse impacts such as coastal erosion and flooding, depending on the time scale and the magnitude of the rise and the human response to it (Paskoff, 1993). A rise in sea level may be due to several factors acting on various time scales, i. e., atmospheric storms (Bouligand and Pirazzoli, 1999; Pirazzoli, 2000; Trigo and Davies, 2002; Pirazzoli and Tomasin, 2002), river flooding in estuaries (Svensson and Jones, 2002), but also <b>land</b> <b>sinking</b> or similar non climate-related changes, linked to sediment compaction, isostasy, coastal geomorphologic evolutions or urban development.

40|$|Dopo aver inquadrato il processo della subsidenza che dagli inizi degli anni cinquanta ha interessato in modo particolare il territorio e la città di Venezia per le {{intensive}} estrazioni di acque sotterranee, viene effettuata un'analisi di dettaglio dell'attuale situazione altimetrica del comprensorio lagunare. Lo studio si basa sostanzialmente sulla interpretazione delle altimetrie 1993 confrontate a quelle del 1973 risultanti dalle due rispettive livellazioni di alta-altissima precisione condotte dal C. N. R., I. S. D. G. M. Questi rilievi, partendo da capisaldi stabili di terraferma (nei pressi della pedemontana) arrivano a Mestre, quotano la superficie della città storica con particolare dettaglio, i capisaldi lungo le linee circumlagunari e l'intero cordone litoraneo, chiudendo l'anello attorno alla laguna. L'analisi relativa all'arco di tempo ventennale ha permesso di confermare la stabilità del territorio accertata definitivamente nel 1975 nella zona industriale e nel centro storico dopo la diversificazione degli approvvigionamenti idrici, di definire con precisione l'andamento della subsidenza naturale, ove l'incidenza antropica è assente, e le aree più fragili del territorio quali quelle litoranee. An {{overview of}} the land subsidence occurred {{in the city of}} Venice and its hinterland in the past decades is first presented. In particular the responsibility of groundwater withdrawals in the sinking process is briefly de-scribed. Man-induced subsidence averaged about 14 cm in the industrial area of Porto Marghera, the center of groundwater pumping, and 10 cm in the city of Venice, from 1952 to 1969. Starting in 1970 a general piezometric improvement began, because of the regulation and diversification of the water supply in the Venetian area and the shutdown 01 many artesian wells. In Marghera in 1975 only 170 l/sec were withdrawn against the 500 l/sec in 1969. Concurrently with the recovery 01 aquifers, the subsidence slowed down until it stopped and in 1975 a land rebound 01 about 2 cm was recorded in the city 01 Venice. In spite 01 this, one has {{to keep in mind that}} the subsidence is mostly irrecoverable and that its effects still remain. Again, since Venice lives on the water, its land elevation must be referred to the mean sea level. The overall loss in elevation with respect to water level can be synthesized as the result 01 three factors: subsidence due to groundwater exploitation, natural subsidence and eustatic rising 01 sea level. Their joint contribution in the «lowering» 01 the surface level 01 Venice with respect to the water level was a total of 22 cm from 1908 to 1975, a determining figure in the recurring phenomenon 01 «acqua alta» (flooding). After reviewing the past altimetrical situation, an evaluation of the land elevation 01 the territory is then presented lor the last twenty years; a precise regional leveling was infact carried out in 1993 with the same path 01 the 1973 one. These surveys include the lines from Treviso (farther inland, the stable origin 01 the survey) to Mestre (Venice-mainland), from Mestre to the extreme part 01 the city 01 Venice and those all around the lagoon edges including the littoral strips. This 20 -year period is quite significant to evaluate the present trend 01 land subsidence alter the cessation 01 the man-induced phenomenon measured first in 1973 and completely verified in 1975. In general the 1993 leveling, compared with that 01 1 ' 973, has pointed out two different behaviors between the zones in the mainland and surroundings 01 Venice and in the city, which are decidedly stable, and the areas along the extreme edges 01 the lagoon and littoral where <b>land</b> <b>sinking</b> is still going on even il the rate 01 subsidence is much lesser than that measured during the previous critical 20 - year period. In order to a have view 01 the whole area under examination, the map 01 the 1973 - 93 contour lines 01 equal subsidence has been drawn, using the Kriging technique and comparing the height 01 the 208 bench marks distributed along the leveling lines. Reading these curves il appears even more evident the ground stability 01 the zones in the mainland, Venice and its surroundings, and the negative trend in soil elevation at the northern and southern extremities of the lagoon's edge and along the littoral. It is noted that the variations in elevation along the lines are progressively decreasing either southward or northward going towards the littorals. Concerning the littoral strips, one has to bear in mind that these areas are those 01 more recent deformation with respect to the others and that they are close to the rivers' outflows, so the natural compaction 01 recent deposits is more active here than elsewhere and the rate 01 natural subsidence is greater. An ideal line 01 demarcation between the two above mentioned stable and subsiding lagoon sectors can be outlined. Particular attention has been devoted to the altimetrical situation 01 Venice because 01 its importance in the lagoon environment. The city's area (about 8 km 2) is covered by a network 01 123 benchmarks, 65 01 which constitute the base for comparison since 1961. A reliable map 01 subsidence contour lines was drawn by using again the Kriging technique. The pattern 01 these lines, that are positive almost everywhere, stresses the stability 01 the historical city's ground elevation. Some 01 the curves 01 equal subsidence are closed outlining small negative «bowls». Examination 01 data indicates that very localized sinkings occur in the more recently lilied areas (Marittima-Tronchetto and S. Elena-Giardini) where one can suppose that the process 01 consolidation is still going on (even though at a very small rate), and in certain areas bordering the principal canals; the latter could be partly linked to an erosion action induced by the speed 01 water currents along the canals. By analyzing the temporal piezometric surface variations 01 the once exploited aquifers, one can confirms that presently the contribution 01 groundwater withdrawals to land subsidence doesn't exist as a general cause. Only very localized influences can be found...|$|E
