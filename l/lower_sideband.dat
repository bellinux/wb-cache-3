25|$|The {{broadcast}} or {{transport channel}} for TV {{in countries that}} use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular synchronising pulses. The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial sideband, the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the <b>lower</b> <b>sideband</b> is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the <b>lower</b> <b>sideband</b> components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this {{is done by the}} RF and IF filters.|$|E
25|$|SSB takes {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} entire original signal is encoded in either one of these sidebands. It is not necessary to broadcast the entire mixed signal, a suitable receiver can extract the entire signal from either the upper or <b>lower</b> <b>sideband.</b> This means that the amplifier can be used much more efficiently. A transmitter can choose to send only the upper or <b>lower</b> <b>sideband,</b> the portion of the signal above or below the carrier. By doing so, the amplifier only has to work effectively on one half the bandwidth, which is generally easier to arrange. More importantly, with the carrier suppressed before it reaches the amplifier, it can amplify the signal itself to higher energy, it is not wasting energy amplifying a signal, the carrier, that can (and will) be re-created by the receiver anyway.|$|E
25|$|When single-sideband {{is used in}} amateur radio voice communications, it {{is common}} {{practice}} that for frequencies below 10MHz, <b>lower</b> <b>sideband</b> (LSB) is used and for frequencies of 10MHz and above, upper sideband (USB) is used. For example, on the 40 m band, voice communications often take place around 7.100MHz using LSB mode. On the 20 m band at 14.200MHz, USB mode would be used.|$|E

40|$|Important {{requirements}} of a millimetre-wave heterodyne receiver for radio astronomy are that it can detect dual-linear polarisation and retain both upper and <b>lower</b> <b>sidebands.</b> One such arrangement, {{referred to as a}} sideband-separating (2 SB) layout, uses a 900 phase shift on either the LO or signal path before mixing, and the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>sidebands</b> are separated into unique IF outputs once orthogonally re-combined. There is continuing interest to build arrays of heterodyne receivers and part of the challenge is to fit all of the receiver components within a given volume. To realise dual-linear polarisation and 2 SB within receiver arrays, a new, more compact approach must be taken. Integrating a turnstile as the signal splitter reduces overall layout space and provides excellent polarisation isolation. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

25|$|If we {{just look}} at the {{short-term}} spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) as a function of time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the <b>lower</b> <b>sideband</b> below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.|$|E
25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both sidebands remaining (double sideband suppressed carrier). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed <b>lower</b> <b>sideband,</b> includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} amateur radio frequencies {{are commonly}} used for transmitting and receiving PSK31 signals. They normally occupy the lower edge of each band's digital modes section. PSK31 operators generally use upper sideband (USB), even on frequencies below 10MHz where the convention normally calls for <b>lower</b> <b>sideband.</b> This is because (a) signals then spread upwards into the digimode section from the [...] "base" [...] frequency, and (b) using QPSK requires both stations {{to use the same}} sideband.|$|E

We show that the squeezing criterion translates directly into a sufficient criterion for entanglement of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>sidebands</b> of the optical field. Thus, this result demonstrates the first unconditional teleportation of broadband entanglement. Our teleporter achieves sufficiently high fidelity to allow the teleportation to be cascaded, enabling, in principle, the construction of deterministic non-Gaussian operations...|$|R

This instability is excited {{in a narrow}} spectral range around the scale length of the quasi-mode which is about half the pump wavelength. The growth rates are of order of the ion cyclotron frequency.

2500|$|Note {{that there}} are two choices for : 43000Hz and 47000Hz, called [...] {{low-side}} and high-side injection. With high-side injection, the spectral components that were distributed around 45000Hz will be distributed around 2000Hz in the reverse order, also known as an inverted spectrum. That is in fact desirable when the IF spectrum is also inverted, because the BFO inversion restores the proper relationships. One reason for that is when the IF spectrum is the output of an inverting stage in the receiver. Another reason is when the SSB signal is actually a <b>lower</b> <b>sideband,</b> instead of an upper sideband. But if both reasons are true, then the IF spectrum is not inverted, and the non-inverting BFO (43000Hz) should be used.|$|E
2500|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} an SSB signal {{is to remove}} one of the sidebands via filtering, leaving only either the upper sideband (USB), the sideband with the higher frequency, or less commonly the <b>lower</b> <b>sideband</b> (LSB), the sideband with the lower frequency. Most often, the carrier is reduced or removed entirely (suppressed), being referred to in full as single sideband suppressed carrier (SSBSC). Assuming both sidebands are symmetric, which {{is the case for}} a normal AM signal, no information is lost in the process. [...] Since the final RF amplification is now concentrated in a single sideband, the effective power output is greater than in normal AM (the carrier and redundant sideband account for well over half of the power output of an AM transmitter). Though SSB uses substantially less bandwidth and power, it cannot be demodulated by a simple envelope detector like standard AM.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{course a}} useful {{modulation}} signal m(t) will generally not {{consist of a}} single sine wave, as treated above. However, by the principle of Fourier decomposition, m(t) can be expressed as the sum {{of a number of}} sine waves of various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Carrying out the multiplication of [...] 1+m(t) with c(t) as above then yields a result consisting of a sum of sine waves. Again the carrier c(t) is present unchanged, but for each frequency component of m at fi there are two sidebands at frequencies fc + fi and [...] fc - fi. The collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband, and those below constitute the <b>lower</b> <b>sideband.</b> In a slightly different way of looking at it, we can consider the modulation m(t) to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components (as results from a formal Fourier transform of a real valued quantity) as shown in the top of Fig. 2. Then one can view the sidebands as that modulation m(t) having simply been shifted in frequency by fc as depicted at the bottom right of Fig. 2 (formally, the modulated signal also contains identical components at negative frequencies, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 2 for completeness).|$|E
50|$|The Kahn-Hazeltine {{system also}} called ISB was {{developed}} by American engineer Leonard R. Kahn and the Hazeltine Corporation. This system used an entirely different principle—using independently modulated upper and <b>lower</b> <b>sidebands.</b> While a station using the system would sound best with proper decoding, it was also possible to use two standard AM radios (one tuned above and the other below the primary carrier) to achieve the stereophonic effect, although with poor stereo separation and fidelity compared to a proper Kahn system AM stereo receiver. One {{of the best known}} stations to use the Kahn system was 890/WLS, Chicago. WLS still transmits in AM stereo today but uses the Motorola C-QUAM system instead.|$|R

2500|$|The RF {{bandwidth}} of an AM transmission (refer to Figure 2, {{but only}} considering positive frequencies) is twice the bandwidth of the modulating (or [...] "baseband") signal, since {{the upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>sidebands</b> around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth {{as wide as the}} highest modulating frequency. Although the bandwidth of an AM signal is narrower than one using frequency modulation (FM), it is twice as wide as single-sideband techniques; it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient. Within a frequency band, only half as many transmissions (or [...] "channels") can thus be accommodated. For this reason analog television employs a variant of single-sideband (known as vestigial sideband, somewhat of a compromise in terms of bandwidth) {{in order to reduce the}} required channel spacing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} the induction motor current to identify and quantify common faults within a two-stage reciprocating compressor. The theoretical basis is studied to understand current signal characteristics when the motor undertakes a varying load under faulty conditions. Although conventional bispectrum representation of current signal allows the inclusion of phase information and the elimination of Gaussian noise, it produces unstable results due to random phase variation of the sideband components in the current signal. A modified bispectrum based on the amplitude modulation feature of the current signal is thus proposed to combine both <b>lower</b> <b>sidebands</b> and higher sidebands simultaneously and hence describe the current signal more accurately. Based on this new bispectrum a more effective diagnostic feature namely normalised bispectral peak is developed for fault classification. In association with the kurtosis of the raw current signal, the bispectrum feature gives rise to reliable fault classification results. In particular, the low feature values can differentiate the belt looseness from other fault cases and discharge valve leakage and intercooler leakage can be separated easily using two linear classifiers. This work provides a novel approach to the analysis of stator current for the diagnosis of motor drive faults from downstream driving equipment...|$|R
