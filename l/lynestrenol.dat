50|$|<b>Lynestrenol</b> was {{developed}} by the Dutch pharmaceutical company Organon in the late 1950s. It received a Dutch patent for <b>lynestrenol</b> in 1957, and <b>lynestrenol</b> subsequently became a component of Lyndiol, the first Dutch contraceptive pill, in the early 1960s. Around this time, pre- and post-marketing clinical trials of <b>lynestrenol</b> were conducted, and in 1965, a study consisting of 200 Dutch women was published. <b>Lynestrenol</b> was approved, in the United Kingdom, in combination with mestranol in 1963 and in combination with ethinylestradiol in 1969.|$|E
50|$|Etynodiol is a 19-nortestosterone derivative. Structurally, it {{is almost}} {{identical}} to norethisterone and <b>lynestrenol,</b> differing only in its C3 substituent. Whereas norethisterone has a ketone at C3 and <b>lynestrenol</b> has no substituent at C3, etynodiol has a hydroxyl group at the position.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lynestrenol</b> {{itself does}} not bind to the {{progesterone}} receptor and is inactive as a progestogen. It is a prodrug, and upon oral administration, is rapidly and almost completely converted into norethisterone, a potent progestogen, in the liver during first-pass metabolism. No other metabolites besides norethisterone are formed from <b>lynestrenol.</b> As such, its pharmacological activity is essentially identical to that of norethisterone. The conversion of <b>lynestrenol</b> into norethisterone is catalyzed by CYP2C9 (28.0%), CYP2C19 (49.8%), and CYP3A4 (20.4%), while other cytochrome P450 enzymes are each responsible {{for no more than}} 1.0% of the total conversion. It appears that <b>lynestrenol</b> first undergoes hydroxylation of the C3 position, forming etynodiol as an intermediate, followed by oxygenation of the hydroxyl group to form norethisterone.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lynestrenol</b> is a {{derivative}} of 19-nortestosterone, {{and is a}} member of the estrane subgroup. It differs from norethisterone and etynodiol only by the lack of a ketone group and hydroxyl group at the C3 position, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Tigestol (INN, USAN), {{also known}} as 17α-ethynylestr-5(10)-en-17β-ol, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 19-nortestosterone group that was developed by Organon in the 1960s but was never marketed. It is an isomer of the related 19-nortestosterone derivative progestins <b>lynestrenol</b> and cingestol.|$|E
50|$|The peak blood are reached within 2 to 4 {{hours after}} oral administration, 97% of the {{administered}} dose being bound to plasma proteins. <b>Lynestrenol</b> and its metabolites are predominantly excreted in the urine, less through feces, active metabolite norethisterone elimination half-life being 16 to 17 hours.|$|E
50|$|Alkynylation finds use in {{synthesis}} of pharmaceuticals, {{particularly in the}} preparation of steroid hormones. For example, ethynylation of 17-ketosteroids produces important contraceptive medications known as progestins. Examples include drugs such as Norethisterone, Ethisterone, and <b>Lynestrenol.</b> Hydrogenation of these compounds produces anabolic steroids with oral bioavailability, such as Norethandrolone.|$|E
50|$|Nandrolone, {{together}} with ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), {{is also the}} parent compound of {{a large group of}} progestins, the norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivatives. This family is subdivided into two groups: the estranes and the gonanes. The estranes include norethisterone (norethindrone), norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, <b>lynestrenol,</b> etynodiol diacetate, and noretynodrel, while the gonanes include norgestrel, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, dienogest (actually a 17α-cyanomethyl-19-nortestosterone derivative), and norelgestromin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lynestrenol</b> {{has been}} marketed alone as Exluton and Exlutona, in {{combination}} with mestranol as Anacyclin, Lyndiol, Lyndiol 1, Lyndiol 2.5, Nonovul, and Noracycline, and {{in combination with}} ethinylestradiol as Anacyclin, Fysioquens, and Minilyn, among other formulations and brand names. It has been used mainly in Europe and is marketed in many other countries throughout the world. The drug was never marketed in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Cingestol (INN, USAN) (former {{tentative}} {{brand name}} Lutisan), {{also known as}} 17α-ethynylestr-5-en-17β-ol, is a steroidal progestin of the 19-nortestosterone group that was never marketed. It was synthesized in 1969 and {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Organon as a low-dose, progestogen-only contraceptive, but in 1984, was still described as [...] "under investigation". The drug is an isomer of <b>lynestrenol</b> with the double bond between C5 and C6.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lynestrenol</b> (INN, USAN, BAN, JAN), {{also known}} as 17α-ethynyl-3-desoxy-19-nortestosterone or 17α-ethynylestr-4-en-17β-ol, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 19-nortestosterone group. It is a synthetic, orally active progestogen and has a strong progestogenic effect on the uterine endometrium (transforming proliferative endometrium into secretory one), inhibits secretion of gonadotropins, suppresses maturation of follicles in the ovaries and ovulation, and reduces menstrual bleeding. It is used as an oral contraceptive and {{in the treatment of}} gynecological disorders.|$|E
50|$|A few progestins have weak estrogenic activity. These {{include the}} 19-nortestosterone {{derivatives}} norethisterone, noretynodrel, and tibolone, {{as well as}} the norethisterone prodrugs norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, <b>lynestrenol,</b> and etynodiol diacetate. High dosages of norethisterone and noretynodrel have been associated with estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with alleviation of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. In contrast, non-estrogenic progestins were not found to be associated with such effects.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, <b>lynestrenol,</b> etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|Flumedroxone acetate {{is said to}} have weak or slight progestogenic {{activity}} without other hormonal activity (including estrogenic, antiestrogenic, androgenic, anabolic, or glucocorticoid). It has been assessed in over 1,000 patients for the treatment of migraine, with effectiveness ranging from excellent to less than that of the reference antimigraine drug methysergide. In keeping with its {{progestogenic activity}}, flumedroxone acetate produces menstrual irregularities, namely polymenorrhea, and breast tension as side effects in women. Other progestogens including medroxyprogesterone acetate, <b>lynestrenol,</b> allylestrenol, dydrogesterone, and normethandrone have also been found to be effective for migraine in a high percentage of women.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>lynestrenol,</b> a synthetic progesterone-like drug, {{has been investigated}} on normal human blood leucocytes in vitro. <b>Lynestrenol</b> significantly increased the percentage of active T rosettes (a test for T-cell competence) at concentrations of 10 - 1 to 10 - 4 μg/ml (controls: 16. 5 %; drug at 10 - 1 μg/ml; 23. 6 %; P< 0. 001). It did not alter the percentage of total T rosettes (a quantitative measure of T cells) {{and the percentage of}} EAC rosettes. It increased the non-adherent cells in the leucocyte adherence inhibition test (LAI) over a dose range between 10 - 1 and 10 - 3 μg/ml (controls: 360, 000 compared to 517, 000 in the presence of 10 - 2 μg/ml; P< 0. 001) suggesting some leucocyte activation. Finally, it also increased the phagocytic properties of monocytes. These results indicate that <b>lynestrenol</b> acts upon normal human blood T lymphocytes, monocytes and possibly neutrophils. Therefore, <b>lynestrenol</b> appears to possess immunostimulatory properties. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lynestrenol,</b> {{which is}} a {{progestogen}} with weak oestrogenic features, has numerous theoretical advantages in the hormonal treatment of endometrial carcinoma {{of the body of}} the uterus when associated with combined radiotherapy and surgery.

40|$|A {{computerized}} morphometrical {{investigation was}} performed on endometriotic tissue from the peritoneum (n = 225) and rectovaginal nodules (n = 65) to compare histologically and stereologically the rectovaginal septum endometriotic nodule to peritoneal endometriosis. Mitotic activity, stromal vascularization and the epithelium/stroma ratio {{were found to be}} significantly different in peritoneal and rectovaginal endometriosis. The evaluation revealed a major role of glandular epithelium in rectovaginal nodules where the stroma sometimes appeared absent around glandular epithelium. The study demonstrated opposite effects of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) and <b>lynestrenol</b> on the two lesions. Indeed, in peritoneal endometriosis, after GnRHa therapy, our study demonstrated a lower rate of mitosis and poor stromal vascularization. The same drug was unable to induce the same effects in the nodule although, in contrast, <b>lynestrenol</b> has a strong effect on nodule vascularization. In conclusion, it is suggested that the rectovaginal adenomyotic nodule is a specific disease, different from peritoneal endometriosis. It is not the consequence of 'deep infiltrating' endometriosis but can probably develop from Mullerian rests present in the rectovaginal septum. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The present review {{gives the}} details of the {{genotoxic}} studies carried out till date for some selected synthetic progestins. Mutagenicity is defined as a permanent change in content or structure of the genetic material of an organism. A mutagenic hazard can be manifested as a heritable change resulting from germ-line mutations and/or somatic mutations leading to cancer or other chronic degenerative processes such as aging. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generated through normal metabolic processes or from toxic products, can lead to a state of oxidative stress that contributes to the pathogenesis of a number of human disease by damaging lipids, protein and DNA. Oral contraceptives have been used since the early 1960 s and are now used by about 90 million women world wide. The pill is given as a combination of an estrogen and a progestogen. The estrogen component of combined oral contraceptives is either ethinylestradiol or mestranol and the progestogens used are cyproterone acetate, desogestrol, ethynodiol diacetate, levonorgestrel, <b>lynestrenol,</b> megestrol acetate, norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, norethynodrel, norgestimate and norgestrel. Little is known about the long term health risks and potential protective effects of these individual components. Synthetic progestins induced the genotoxic damage and also various types of cancers, both singly as well as in combination with estrogens. Various synthetic progestins have been tested for their genotoxic effects in different experimental models, using different genotoxic end points. Ethynodioldiacetate, norethynodrel, norgestrel, <b>lynestrenol</b> and medroxyprogesterone acetate were found to be genotoxic only in the presence of metabolic activation supplemented with NADP. Megestrol acetate, cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate were found to be genotoxic in the absence of metabolic activation. On the basis of reports available it is suggested that the progestins in which double bond between carbon- 6 and carbon- 7 is present, they undergo nucleophilic reaction and generates free radical in the system to show the genotoxic effects and the progestins in which double bond between carbon- 6 and carbon- 7 is absent, they need metabolic activation like estrogens, such as estradiol- 17 β and ethinylestradiol to show the genotoxic effects...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} efficacy {{and the influence of}} progestogen-only contraceptives (POCs) in postpartum lactating mothers over a period of 18 -months. 250 mothers were randomised to either the study groups or the control group. In the study groups, 100 mothers were given an oral progestogen pill; <b>lynestrenol</b> and another 100 mothers were assigned to injectable progestogens; depot medroxy-progesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET EN), 50 each. The control group (n= 50) was given nonhormonal methods. There was no contraceptive failure or negative influence on lactation among the medication groups. There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups with respect to the continuation rates and to the adverse effects that led to premature discontinuation. In conclusion, POCs can be used by lactating mothers effectively and safely for at least 18 months.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prior to {{the start}} of cross-sex hormone therapy (CSH), {{androgenic}} progestins are often used to induce amenorrhea in female to male (FtM) pubertal adolescents with gender dysphoria (GD). The aim of this single-center study is to report changes in anthropometry, side effects, safety parameters, and hormone levels in a relatively large cohort of FtM adolescents with a diagnosis of GD at Tanner stage B 4 or further, who were treated with <b>lynestrenol</b> (Orgametril®) monotherapy and in combination with testosterone esters (Sustanon®). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical and biochemical data obtained during at least 6 months of hormonal treatment in FtM adolescents followed at our adolescent gender clinic since 2010 (n[*]=[*] 45) was conducted. McNemar's test to analyze reported side effects over time was performed. A paired Student's t test or a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was performed, as appropriate, on anthropometric and biochemical data. For biochemical analyses, all statistical tests were done in comparison with baseline parameters. Patients who were using oral contraceptives (OC) at intake were excluded if a Mann-Whitney U test indicated influence of OC. RESULTS: Metrorrhagia and acne were most pronounced during the first months of monotherapy and combination therapy respectively and decreased thereafter. Headaches, hot flushes, and fatigue were the most reported side effects. Over the course of treatment, an increase in musculature, hemoglobin, hematocrit, creatinine, and liver enzymes was seen, progressively sliding into male reference ranges. Lipid metabolism shifted to an unfavorable high-density lipoprotein (HDL) /low-density lipoprotein (LDL) ratio; glucose metabolism was not affected. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total testosterone, and estradiol levels decreased, and free testosterone slightly increased during monotherapy; total and free testosterone increased significantly during combination therapy. Gonadotropins were only fully suppressed during combination therapy. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) remained stable throughout the treatment. Changes occurred in the first 6 months of treatment and remained mostly stable thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of FtM gender dysphoric adolescents with <b>lynestrenol</b> monotherapy and in combination with testosterone esters is effective, safe, and inexpensive; however, suppression of gonadotropins is incomplete. Regular blood controls allow screening for unphysiological changes in safety parameters or hormonal levels and for medication abuse...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect on}} liver microsomal enzyme {{activity}} of three steroid contraceptive drug (SCD) combinations was compared in rats, mice and guinea-pigs. <b>Lynestrenol</b> plus mestranol, norethisterone plus mestranol and norethynodrel plus mestranol were given orally for 4 consecutive days (acute treatment) or 30 days (chronic treatment) at various doses eliciting an experimentally controlled antifertility activity which varied in its extent. In {{rats and mice}} all the combined treatments (with the exception of norethynodrel plus mestranol in mice) were active as inducers of liver microsomal enzymes. This induction seems to be mediated mainly by the progestogenic compounds. Oestrogens showed a very poor effect bordering on significance only in a few cases. No effect on liver microsomal protein or cytochrome P 450 concentration was obtained after treatment with doses capable of increasing the microsomal enzyme activity. The activity of the liver microsomal enzymes {{did not appear to}} be reduced immediately (2 h) after the last administration of the SCD given during 4 or 30 days.

30|$|From November 1993 {{through to}} April 2003 we {{performed}} a total of 105 phalloplasties using the radial forearm flap technique [5]. All of these patients were followed-up by the different members of our gender team and were treated according to the guidelines of the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association [6]. A successful real-life test for at least 2  years and hormonal treatment for at least 12  months were required before SRS. Usually, this treatment consisted of <b>lynestrenol</b> (5  mg), later in association with testosterone. All patients were non-smokers or had stopped smoking before the surgery and hormonal treatment was interrupted 3 – 4  weeks before the intervention to avoid specific sex steroid-related risks such as thrombosis. All 105 patients had a mastectomy in a separate operation. Phalloplasty was performed in conjunction with total hysterectomy in 69 cases (65.7 %) while in 36 cases (34.3 %) the total hysterectomy was conducted separately before the phalloplasty. Most of the patients in the last group were referred to us after the hysterectomy (with or without mastectomy) had been carried out by their own gynaecologist for diverse reasons (bleeding disorders, pain, psychological). In all cases vaginectomy was performed during phalloplasty.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the risk factors}} associated with persistence of human papillomaviruses (HPV) types 16, 18, and 33 in the normal cervix, a prospective study {{was carried out in}} Belgium of 323 women without cytological evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Demographic and clinical data were obtained by interview, and HPV DNA was assayed in cervical-swab specimens using the Fast Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction-based screening and confirmatory tests. A multi-variable linear regression model was constructed using four well-known risk factors: the use of an oral contraceptive which is either triphasic, or monophasic and containing ethynylestradiol in association with either norethysterone, or levonorgestrel, or <b>lynestrenol,</b> or gestoden, or estrogenic and containing estriol (P = 8 x 10 - 5), a positive history of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (P = 10 - 4), an age inferior or equal to 30 years (P = 0. 012), and cigarette smoking (P = 0. 020). Crude and adjusted relative risks were calculated for each HPV persistence predictor. The data and the results of the molecular biology of high-risk genital HPVs are consistent with the hypothesis that the use of an oral contraceptive containing simultaneously and continuously both a potent estrogen and a high activity progestative is necessary to enhance significantly HPV transcription. These observations are also consistent with the hypothesis that the oral contraceptives and HSV genital infection are responsible for HPV persistence in the normal cervix but not for HPV-induced cervical transformation. The relatively weak correlation found for cigarette smoking may be explained by the very moderate induction effect of phorbol esters on HPV expression, in comparison with their important transforming effect on virus-infected cells, and thus by the limited number of HPV-infected women in our study. The fourth predictor probably represents several other risk factors associated with young age such as a high number of sexual partners. SCOPUS: ar. jFLWNAinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
