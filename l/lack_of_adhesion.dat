In this paper {{we present a}} way of making industrially processed passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) with evaporated Al rear side and laser fired contacts (LFC) subsequently solderable and module capable. Solderability is enabled by sputtering a solderable stack on the Al metallization, but it becomes apparent that the deposited stack <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> due to dust originating from the LFC process. Therefore prior to the deposition of the solderable stack, cleaning of the rear side is essential. Therefore, test samples and PERC solar cells with evaporated Al rear side and LFC are fabricated and four cleaning methods are introduced and applied with varying influence on adhesion and cell efficiency. We show that proper cleaning processes enable a well-adhering solderable rear side metallization which permits cell interconnection and encapsulation into mini-modules...|$|R

50|$|Desmocollin-3 is a calcium-dependent {{glycoprotein}} that is {{a member}} of the desmocollin subfamily of the cadherin superfamily. These desmosomal family members, along with the desmogleins, are found primarily in epithelial cells where they constitute the adhesive proteins of the desmosome cell-cell junction and are required for cell adhesion and desmosome formation. The loss of these components leads to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> and a gain of cellular mobility.|$|E
40|$|The urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator receptor (uPAR) is a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored {{protein that}} mediates cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin (VN). We demonstrate here that this cell adhesion process {{is accompanied by}} the formation <b>of</b> an <b>adhesion</b> patch characterized by an accumulation of uPAR into areas of direct contact between the cell and the matrix. The adhesion patch requires the glycolipid anchor and develops only on a VN-coated substrate, but not on fibronectin. It consists of detergent-insoluble microdomains that accumulate F-actin and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, but not beta(1) integrins. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> inhibition <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> {{in the presence of}} integrin-blocking reagents and adhesion on a VN fragment without the RGD sequence indicated that the <b>adhesion</b> <b>of</b> uPAR-bearing cells on VN could occur independently of integrins.

50|$|The {{new design}} steamed well and {{retained}} {{much of the}} Power of the P2's. The reduced weight meant they had a high power to weight ratio, and were good at hauling high speed expresses, although {{in the opinion of}} O.S. Nock they 'acquired a particularly bad reputation for wild and unsafe riding at high speed!' However, there were other problems which prevented them from ever making an impact on the east coast main line. The first of these was a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> causing wheel slip when starting, which meant that they could not be used on the Edinburgh-Aberdeen line for which they had originally been built. The second problem was that of reliability caused by their having been adapted from quite different locomotives. Both the A2/2 and the subsequent A2/3 suffered badly from frame movement, vibration and loose fittings. Using equal length connecting rods, as well as the divided drive meant that the centre cylinder was much further forward than the outside cylinders. During their lifetime in service Earl Marischal was the only A2/2 to cover over one million miles, 360,907 as a P2 and 673,947 as an A2/2.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{catechol}} moiety in the {{adhesive properties}} of mussel proteins and related synthetic materials has been extensively studied {{in the last years}} but still remains elusive. Here, a simplified model approach is presented based on a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of upward-facing catechols thiol-bound to epitaxial gold substrates. The orientation of the catechol moieties is confirmed by spectroscopy, which also showed <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> significant amounts of interfering o-quinones. Local force-distance curves on the SAM measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows an average <b>adhesion</b> force <b>of</b> 45 nN, stronger than that of a reference polydopamine coating, along with higher reproducibility and less statistical dispersion.

40|$|AbstractThe primary {{hemostatic}} von Willebrand factor (vWF) {{functions to}} sequester platelets from rheological blood flow and mediates their adhesion to damaged subendothelium at sites of vascular injury. We have surveyed {{the effect of}} 16 disease-causing mutations identified in patients diagnosed with the bleeding diathesis disorder, von Willebrand disease (vWD), on the structure and rheology of vWF A 1 domain adhesiveness to the platelet GPIbα receptor. These mutations have a dynamic phenotypical range <b>of</b> bleeding from <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> platelet <b>adhesion</b> to severe thrombocytopenia. Using new rheological tools in combination with classical thermodynamic, biophysical, and spectroscopic metrics, we establish a high propensity of the A 1 domain to misfold to pathological molten globule conformations that differentially alter the strength <b>of</b> platelet <b>adhesion</b> under shear flow. Rheodynamic analysis establishes a quantitative rank order between shear-rate-dependent platelet-translocation pause times that linearly correlate with clinically reported measures of patient platelet counts and the severity of thrombocytopenia. These results suggest that specific secondary structure elements remaining in these pathological conformations of the A 1 domain regulate GPIbα binding {{and the strength of}} vWF-platelet interactions, which affects the vWD functional phenotype and the severity of thrombocytopenia...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is a {{nonionic}} hydrophilic polymer {{having the}} same repeat unit as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). It is of interest in both biology and materials science. PEO surfaces demonstrate a unique <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>adhesion,</b> and PEO block copolymers are widely used in applications such as drug delivery. Unfortunately, the synthesis of PEO homopolymers and block copolymers can be experimentally challenging, with a typical method involving air sensitive organometallics {{and the removal of}} compounds such as naphthalene from the final product. Here we report a synthetic route that avoids these difficulties by using azeotropic distillation to remove water from the equilibrium reaction of an alkyl hydroxide and potassium hydroxide reacting to form water and a potassium alkoxide. Removing the water right side of the reaction drives the equilibrium to the right, towards the potassium alkoxide, avoiding the use of pyrophoric organometallics.

For instance, in the Catholic Church of Notre-Dame de Vevey, Switzerland, the mortar was fixed with steel wires and screws to the stone, to anticipate a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> to the substrate.

Video microscopy revealed that the adhesion sequence was mediated by the export and assembly of polymers, and consisted of initial attachment followed by cell motility and eventual production of permanent adhesive structures in the form of stalks that elevated the diatom above the substratum. A. longipes adhesive polymers are primarily composed of noncellulosic polysaccharides (B. A. Wustman, M. R. Gretz, and K. D. Hoagland [1997] Plant Physiol 113 : 1059 - 1069).

The FGF receptors are also down-regulated in K-fgf-transformed cells but not in parental 3 T 3, native bFGF-transfected, and ras-transformed NIH 3 T 3 cells. The addition of suramin to spbFGF and K-fgf cells rapidly promotes the up-regulation of FGF receptors. Suramin also induces lowering of the proliferation rate to that of parental cells, anchorage-dependent growth, assembly of cytoskeletal filaments, cellular adhesion, and spreading. These results suggest that spbFGF cells undergo autocrine transformation, possibly by an internal autocrine loop, in which there is constitutive activation of the FGF receptor.
