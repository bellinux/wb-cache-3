2500|$|Before Tesla had {{developed}} the Roadster's proprietary powertrain, they borrowed an AC Propulsion Tzero vehicle {{as a test}} mule and converted from Lead Acid AGM batteries to Lithium Ion cells which substantially increased the range, reduced weight, and boosted 0-60 performance. [...] Tesla then licensed AC Propulsion's EV Power System design and Reductive Charging patent which covers integration of the charging electronics with the inverter, thus reducing mass, complexity, and cost. However, Tesla was dissatisfied with how the motor and transmission worked in the chassis. Tesla then designed and built its own power electronics, motor, and other drivetrain components that incorporated this <b>licensed</b> <b>technology</b> from AC Propulsion. Given the extensive redevelopment of the vehicle, Tesla Motors no longer licenses any proprietary technology from AC Propulsion. The Roadster's powertrain is unique.|$|E

40|$|Industrial firms {{increasingly}} {{attempt to}} <b>license</b> their <b>technologies</b> apart from applying {{them in their}} own products. Because of the imperfections in technology markets, an active approach towards <b>technology</b> <b>licensing</b> does not automatically result in licensing transactions. To balance prior research, which has focused on licensing transactions as the outcome of licensing intentions, we take a contingency view to analyze how characteristics of a firm's innovation ecosystem determine different strategic types of licensing. Specifically, we distinguish proactive licensing, which refers to identifying recipients for technology transactions, and reactive licensing, which relates to offering licenses to infringers of a firm's intellectual property. Survey data show that environmental antecedents concerning appropriability, i. e., patent protection and technological turbulence, and determinants regarding technology markets, i. e., transaction frequency and competitive intensity, have different effects on proactive and reactive licensing. On this basis, the article has major implications for research into <b>technology</b> <b>licensing,</b> markets for <b>technology,</b> and open innovation. <b>Technology</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>Technology</b> exploitation Markets for technology Appropriability Open innovation...|$|R
