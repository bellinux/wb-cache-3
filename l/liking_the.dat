5|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} generally favorable reviews, with reviewers <b>liking</b> <b>the</b> story, writing, character designs and music, {{but with some}} criticizing the lack of new gameplay mechanics. Additionally, the Wii version was criticized for using resized graphics from the Nintendo DS version, without any modifications to make them appear better on a larger screen. The Nintendo DS version was a commercial success in North America, with pre-orders being {{more than double the}} amount Capcom had estimated.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the first episodes was negative, with many reviewers not <b>liking</b> <b>the</b> characters and finding the comedy drama format unusual. As the series progressed, critics' opinions became more positive; the production values rated highly and the fantasy scenes, which became a hallmark of Cold Feet, were well received. An average of eight million viewers watched the series each week. The following year it won awards from the Royal Television Society, the Broadcasting Press Guild and the British Comedy Awards. It was also nominated for the Rose d'Or and a Banff Rockie Award. All six episodes have been released on VHS, DVD and internet media formats.|$|E

In WWE 2K16, the player has to fight for ranks to earn championships (the main goal is to reach the WWE Hall of Fame by fulfilling certain requirements). WWE 2K17 brings in a promo engine and every action can trigger a backstage brawl depending on what answer the created superstar gives. WWE 2K18 continues with the promo engine from 2k17 with free roaming now a central focus.|$|E

According to Kapoor, she wasn't inclined towards academics though received good grades {{in all her}} classes except mathematics. After graduating from Welham she studied commerce for two years at Mithibai College in Vile Parle (Mumbai). Kapoor then registered for a three-month summer course in microcomputers at Harvard Summer School in the United States. She later developed an interest in law, and enrolled at the Government Law College, Mumbai; during this period, she developed a long-lasting passion for reading. However, after completing her first year, Kapoor decided to pursue her interest to become an actress. She began training at an acting institute in Mumbai mentored by Kishore Namit Kapoor, {{a member of the}} Film and Television Institute of India (FTII).|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team included director Takumi Nakazawa, {{scenario writer}} Kotaro Uchikoshi, music composers Takeshi Abo and Chiyomaru Shikura, and character designer Hidari. The game was originally {{planned to be}} titled Parasite and be unrelated to the Infinity series, but when production started it was given the project name Project Infinity 3. Nakazawa and Uchikoshi had creative differences regarding the game's ending, each having their own idea for how the game should end; because of this and time constraints, the ending was left in an unfinished state, with the development team planning to develop a sequel that would conclude the game's story. The game was positively received by reviewers at Famitsu and RPGFan, with the former complimenting the game system and plot, and the latter <b>liking</b> <b>the</b> character design and music.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{arrived in}} Washington, D.C., {{on the evening}} of May 2. There, they completed additional training and performed picket duty throughout the district. While quartered {{on the floor of the}} United States House of Representatives, the enlisted men took it upon themselves to set up a mock session, passing a law first abolishing the House of Representatives, then the Union and reconstituting both in a manner of their <b>liking.</b> <b>The</b> more embarrassing and lawbreaking actions by the regiment included the burning of fences, which resulted in a letter of reprimand from Brigadier General Joseph K. Mansfield along with six enlisted men being removed and sent back to New York. On May 7, the 11th New York was officially sworn into Federal service by Brig. Gen.

5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Brooklyn Dodgers, winning 55–7. The Browns scored three touchdowns {{in five minutes}} during the first quarter. Cleveland added five more touchdowns {{in the second half}} and held a {{comfortable}} lead to the end. Fullback Marion Motley ran for 111 yards on five carries and scored two touchdowns, including a 50-yard run {{at the beginning of the}} second half. Tommy Colella scored a touchdown on an 82-yard punt return, and Bill Lund ran back an interception 28 yards for another. It was in this game that the Draw play was accidentally invented when Otto Graham tripped while dropping back for a pass. As he went down, sensing blitzers about to wallop him, he stuck the ball in Motley's stomach who scampered for a sizable gain. <b>Liking</b> <b>the</b> effect, Brown added it to the playbook during halftime. By the next game the play became a staple of the offense with several versions for different situations. As Cleveland's lead increased in the second half, Brown put in second-string players. Quarterback Otto Graham was replaced by Ermal Allen, who threw for two of the Browns' touchdowns and intercepted a pass while playing on defense. Cliff Lewis, Graham's primary backup, also played in the game. Brooklyn's only score came in the second quarter on a Bob Hoernschemeyer rush. The Dodgers were hurt by short punts from Mickey Colmer and a poor passing game. The team was held to 39 yards of passing. Edgar Jones, Cleveland's primary halfback suffered an elbow injury during the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} representing Vršac at the Exhibition {{was originally}} meant to depict folk hero Janko Halabura fighting the Turks, {{an idea to}} which Jovanović took a <b>liking.</b> <b>The</b> Vršac council members soon changed their minds, and Jovanović was asked to paint a composition showing the everyday lives of the town's inhabitants. Over {{the course of the}} triptych's creation, Jovanović visited his hometown {{on a number of occasions}} for the purpose of sketching its people and structures. The triptych proved to be a particularly difficult undertaking. Jovanović's firm grasp in Western Medieval panel and mural painting proved of great importance. Earlier, Jovanović had been the recipient of several church commissions that called for multi-sectional painting, though not to the same extent as some of his contemporaries, such as Uroš Predić. Each scene needed to connect seamlessly with the others, and Jovanović was met with the additional challenge of painting a number of figures engaged in actions requiring precise definition. The artist addressed this by carefully drawing each figure, the landscape and the panels themselves so as to ensure compositional unity. To ensure natural light, Jovanović painted the triptych out of studio, en plein air. It took the artist about ten months to complete.|$|E

Other lesbian or bisexual women believe that it is a necessity or largely defines lesbian sexual activity. Lesbian couples are more likely to consider a woman's dislike of cunnilingus as a problem than heterosexual couples are, and it is common for them to seek therapy to overcome inhibitions regarding it.|$|E

The pilot was filmed in Ipswich, UK, in 1993.

During the storyline, the show was dealt another major blow when fan favorite Paul Michael Valley was fired and his character, Ryan, was killed off. Fans were relieved when Justine's reign of terror was put to an end when Carl finished her off with a letter opener. Wyndham was quoted as <b>liking</b> <b>the</b> storyline at first, but after it played out, she stated that {{she wished she had}} never appeared in it.|$|E
25|$|In Leon Festinger's {{cognitive}} dissonance experiment, {{participants were asked}} to perform a boring task. They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales. At the study's end, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 to say the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported <b>liking</b> <b>the</b> task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provides a reason for the doing the boring task, therefore no dissonance.|$|E
