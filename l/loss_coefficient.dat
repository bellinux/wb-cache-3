The hysteresis loss must have linear characteristic according to the frequency. However, the existing iron <b>loss</b> <b>coefficients</b> are defined by formula of frequency.

So, in this paper, the iron <b>loss</b> <b>coefficients</b> were defined by {{a function of the}} magnetic flux density, and the iron loss calculation is applied for Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor(IPMSM) of 600 (W) and 200 (W).

30|$|In {{practical}} applications of water-in-glass evacuated tube solar water heaters, {{the reduction of}} RMSEs, even slight, for predicting heat <b>loss</b> <b>coefficients</b> is a crucial improvement. This is because in practical productions and measurements, technicians usually {{need to deal with}} more than thousands of water heaters in a production period, and therefore a slight increase of prediction accuracy rate may help us avoid a decent number of measurement mistakes. To generate improvements for predicting the heat <b>loss</b> <b>coefficients,</b> this short report presents an alternative method for measuring heat collection rates and heat <b>loss</b> <b>coefficients</b> of water-in-glass evacuated tube solar water heaters using ELM. Results show that the ELMs have decent prediction results for heat collection rates and heat <b>loss</b> <b>coefficients,</b> compared to previous study using SVM, GRNN and MLFNs. This study shows that using Matlab software with the package of basic ELM can give precise predicted results of heat collection rates and heat <b>loss</b> <b>coefficients</b> with very convenient model development processes. Also, according to the algorithm of the ELM, it can dramatically reduce the required training time (Huang et al. 2004, 2006; Huang 2014), which are usually seen as one of the important advantages for {{practical applications}}. In future studies, we’ll focus on developing a completed system with the combination of different machine learning models, taking both RMSEs and required training times into further considerations.|$|R
