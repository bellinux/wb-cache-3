Following {{the collapse of}} the ruling Communist League, Croatia adopted a new constitution in 1990 – which replaced the 1974 constitution adopted by the Socialist Republic of Croatia – and organised its first multi-party elections. While the 1990 constitution remains in force, it has been amended four times since its adoptionin 1997, 2000, 2001 and 2010. Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991, which led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. Croatia's status as a country was internationally recognised by the United Nations in 1992. Under its 1990 constitution, Croatia operated a semi-presidential system until 2000 when it switched to a parliamentary system. Government powers in Croatia are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers. The legal system of Croatia is civil law and, along with the institutional framework, is strongly influenced by the <b>legal</b> <b>heritage</b> of Austria-Hungary. By the time EU accession negotiations were completed on 30 June 2010, Croatian legislation was fully harmonised with the Community acquis. Croatia became a member state of the European Union on 1 July 2013.|$|E

This American insight has not been lost on other Western legal systems {{in the context of}} their antidiscrimination statutes and opinions. This article explores the favorable reception that disparate impact analysis has had bother in other countries with similar <b>legal</b> <b>heritages</b> and in international law. Despite the wide acceptance of disparate impact analysis in the international marketplace of legal ideas, the concept remains controversial among scholars in the United States. Moreover, American courts have been retreating from any application of the doctrine beyond narrow bounds. The comparative law perspective offered by this article sheds light on the American debate over the legitimacy of the disparate impact theory of discrimination and over its proper scope. This perspective reveals that if the United States is out of step with respect to disparate impact, it is not aberrant in the way its critics have suggested, because the American interpretation and application of the theory are more restrictive than those of other nations...|$|R

40|$|The {{concerns}} for the achievement of a unique European codification in civil law are numerous and raise several questions on the future identity of the European private law. Many theories {{have been written about}} ius commune but one thing is sure: there is something like a <b>legal</b> common <b>heritage</b> in Europe. European states have, however, choosen to follow their own path during the era of codifactions (19 th century) thus leading to the well known diversity of legal cultures in Europe. But today, thanks to an increased importance of the discipline of comparative law and thanks to the European Union, efforts are made again in order to converge european legal systems. The author gives an overview of the following questions: (1) Does the European Union have the legal powers to harmonize private law (2) If, and to what extent, such a harmonization is useful and(3) by which methods of harmonization it can be achieved. The conclusion insists on the necessity of a better understanding of comparative law and of the diversity of european legal cultures, before heading towards a massive harmonization of European private law. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Swedish journalistic {{traditions are}} mixed between {{classical}} liberal {{ideas on the}} press as a fourth estate and social responsibility ideas of necessary relationships between the political system and the media system. Historically, the prospects for independent journalism {{could not possibly be}} better. Sweden was the first country in the world to include a Freedom of Information Act in its constitution as early as 1766, and since then freedom of expression and freedom of infor-mation have been embedded in the Swedish constitution (Hultén, 2004). On the other hand, the Swedish media system can broadly be described as a democratic-corporatist model, with a party-press system and public service broadcast media system as distinctive features, at least until the deregulation and liberalization era of the 1990 s (Hallin and Mancini, 2004). Accordingly, there also exist parallel perceptions of journalistic values and news reporting norms in Sweden. While the <b>legal</b> liberal <b>heritage</b> encourages independent and objective journalism with a critical approach, the idea of social responsibility underlines the need for balanced news, reflecting diverging perspectives and opinions in society. These contradictory norms still affect most journalistic practices, even if the recent market-orientation of the Swedish media system has, to a considerable extent, undermined public service perspec-tives. Furthermore, the global process of further commercialization of the media certainly imposes new challenges for serious news reporting and the watchdog function of journalism. Investigative journalism is expansive and risky compared to infotainment formats and recycling press releases (Allan, 2005; Hamilton, 2004). Against this historical background, the state of contemporary investigative journalism in Sweden is summarized. The main questions are: How do different actors in the Swedish society perceive investigative journalism today? To wha...|$|R
