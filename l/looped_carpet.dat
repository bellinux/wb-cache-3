50|$|There are {{different}} types of carpet like twists, which is {{commonly referred to as}} a berber. Twist carpeting is composed of multiple twisted fibers set into the carpet backing. It is typically used in low traffic areas. Another type of <b>carpeting</b> is <b>looped</b> <b>carpets,</b> which are composed of looped fibers set into the carpet backing. This type of carpeting is typically used in high traffic areas as it is easy to clean.|$|R
50|$|Formerly {{known as}} Greenwood & Coope (originally a {{textiles}} accessory supply business started in 1924) Cormar Carpets, {{set up by}} the late Neville Cormack O.B.E, {{was one of the first}} companies to start producing tufted carpet in Britain in 1956 at Nunn Hill Mills in the Rossendale Valley, Lancashire. It moved to Brookhouse Mill in Greenmount, Lancashire in 1959 and a second mill, Holme Mill in Ramsbottom, was purchased via the acquisition of Holmebury Carpets in 1973. All Cormar's wool twists, wool <b>loop</b> <b>carpets</b> and stain resistant polypropylene carpets are produced on site at its Lancashire mills.|$|R
50|$|Carpet {{styles are}} divided into two basic types. These types are <b>loop</b> pile <b>carpets</b> and cut pile carpets. Especially for {{cut-pile}} and its variations (Saxony, shag, frieze) the heat setting process is of highest importance.|$|R
25|$|The carpet is {{produced}} on a loom {{quite similar to}} woven fabric. The pile can be plush or Berber. Plush carpet is a cut pile and Berber <b>carpet</b> is a <b>loop</b> pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and <b>loop</b> <b>carpeting.</b> Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan and Arabia.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of carpets: the <b>loop</b> pile <b>carpet,</b> the cut carpet and the {{structured}} carpet, combining the first two.Very popular in the sixties thanks to its colorful prints, most carpets took a decorative appearance inside houses.|$|R
5000|$|Also new was the SL/E version, {{which used}} many {{interior}} options from the TC [...] "Sandpiper" [...] series {{such as the}} radio/cassette, four-spoke steering wheel, timber dash inserts, velour seat trim, <b>loop</b> pile <b>carpet</b> and timber (Hardboard) door trim inserts. The SL/E also received the five-speed manual as standard.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} first devoted to present our method for {{modeling}} unresolved magnetic {{structures in the}} Milne-Eddington inversion of spectropolarimetric data. The related definitions and other approaches and different used inversion algorithms are recalled for comparison. In a second part, we apply our method to quiet Sun data outside active regions. We obtain the quiet Sun photospheric magnetic field as composed of unresolved opening and connected magnetic flux tubes, which form a <b>loop</b> <b>carpet</b> of field lines. We then analyze the spatial correlation, which we also observed for the magnetic field vector, in terms of flux tube diameter, distance, and field strength. We find that different observations with the Zurich imaging polarimeter and THEMIS polarimeter mounted on the THEMIS telescope give very close results, and we add results also very close derived from HINODE/Solar Optical Telescope/spectropolarimeter observations analyzed with the same method. We obtain a mean flux tube diameter of 30 km, a mean flux tube distance of 230 km, and a mean flux tube magnetic field of 1. 3 kG...|$|R
50|$|People {{restoring}} classic {{cars will}} often freshen up the interior by putting in new carpet to cover new floor pans. When they do replace the carpet {{in their cars}} they have quite a few options in molded carpet. There are several websites that specialize in molded carpets. There are several styles of molded carpet, the most popular include 80-20 loop, cutpile and essex. Most cars from the 1940s to the mid-1970s used 80-20 <b>loop</b> <b>carpet.</b> The major exception being Cadillac which used cut pile in their cars at various times. After 1974 car makers used cut pile or essex <b>carpet</b> exclusively. 80-20 <b>loop</b> which is 80% rayon 20% nylon thus the name. It has a texture similar to berber house carpet. Cut pile is {{what you see in}} modern cars. It looks like little strands of hair. Essex is a longer more plush version of cut pile carpet. It's softer to the touch than cut pile and 80-20 loop, but is also more expensive than the other two.|$|R
50|$|The term frieze {{can also}} be used for the curly nap frieze fabrics have, as well as the action of raising the nap, which differs from {{standard}} methods. Today, frieze is also a term applied to a textile technique used in modern machine-loomed carpeting, as well as the textile produced. Carpets made with this technique are known for their resilience, due to a high twist rate, outperforming standard cut or <b>loop</b> pile <b>carpets.</b>|$|R
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} in an experimental room to measure the effect of human activity on airborne dispersal of settled fungal spores from carpet and vinyl tile flooring. A series of experiments were conducted in which commercial <b>loop</b> pile <b>carpet,</b> residential cut pile carpet, or vinyl tile installed in the experimental room were contaminated with Penicillium chrysogenum spores. The flooring materials were contaminated to two different levels (106 and 107 colony forming units per square meter [c. f. u. /m 2] of flooring surface). Airborne culturable and total P. chrysogenum concentrations were measured using Andersen single-stage impactor samplers and Burkard personal slide impactor samplers, respectively. Bioaerosol concentrations were measured at floor level, 1 meter, and the adult breathing zone (1. 5 meter) heights before and after human activity consisting of walking in a prescribed pattern for 1 minute in the room. Airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were greater with the higher surface loading for all three flooring materials. For all flooring materials {{there was no significant}} difference between sampler locations, although the data from the 1 -meter location were the highest, followed by the floor level and the breathing zone locations, respectively. The data from these experiments indicate that while a very small fraction of culturable P. chrysogenum spores present on flooring materials were aerosolized by walking, relatively high airborne concentrations of spores maybe re-entrained from contaminated materials. The airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were significantly higher after walking on cut pile carpet than with the other two flooring materials at both contamination levels, with the differences in concentration often ≥ 2 orders of magnitude. No differences were measured in airborne culturable P. chrysogenum between vinyl flooring and <b>loop</b> pile <b>carpet</b> at both contamination levels. Total spore data from the experiments with the 107 c. f. u. /m 2 contamination level indicated that walking on <b>loop</b> pile <b>carpet</b> produced higher airborne spore concentrations than similarly contaminated vinyl tile although no significant difference was observed at the 106 c. f. u. /m 2 level...|$|R
5000|$|The Coupé {{version was}} {{available}} with two different engines (1100 and 1300) {{and in two}} different trim levels (S and SL) {{for a total of}} four variants.In its base [...] "S" [...] trim, the coupé had single rectangular front headlamps, and wheels and hubcaps from the saloon. The pricier [...] "SL" [...] (for Sport Lusso) was distinguished by quadruple round headlamps, a specific grille, steel sport wheels without hubcaps, chromed window surround trim, door handles and fuel cap, and black decorative striping along the sills and across the tail panel. Inside it gained a leatherette-wrapped steering wheels, perforated leatherette upholstery, extended four-gauge instrumentation, <b>loop</b> pile <b>carpeting</b> and black headlining.|$|R
50|$|The Playing Field was a carpeted regular dodecagon which {{measured}} 34 ft across. The surface {{consists of}} a closed <b>loop,</b> low piled <b>carpet.</b> The perimeter of the field was defined by four-by-four boards. At {{the beginning of a}} match, there were 36 soccer balls (12 of each color: red, white or blue) arranged into 6 piles of 6 identical balls each. Each team was assigned a color and must collect only balls of their color during the game.|$|R
2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. <b>Loop</b> pile <b>carpets</b> are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|R
5000|$|Polypropylene is used {{to produce}} carpet yarns because it is inexpensive. It is {{difficult}} to dye and does not wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene is commonly used to construct berber carpets. In this case, polypropylene is {{commonly referred to as}} olefin. Large <b>looped</b> olefin berber <b>carpets</b> are usually only suited for light domestic use and tend to mat down quickly. Berber <b>carpets</b> with smaller <b>loops</b> tend to be more resilient and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles. Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade cut-pile styles are well constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices. Polypropylene carpets are known to have good stain resistance, but not against oil- based agents. If a stain does set, {{it can be difficult to}} clean. Commercial grade carpets can be glued directly to the floor or installed over a 1/4" [...] thick, 8-pound density padding. Outdoor grass carpets are usually made from polypropylene.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{quantification}} {{of a novel}} polypropylene/polyamide bicomponent fibre in binary mixtures with polyamide was subjected to validation by collaborative trial conducted at European level. Considering the probable acceptance of the novel fibre in Europe, this method is needed for consumer protection to allow market surveillance and antifraud controls. The aim {{of the study was}} to extend the scope of application of method 11 of Directive 96 / 73 /EC, based on the selective dissolution of one of the components in binary mixtures. The method foresaw sample treatment with 75 % m/m sulfuric acid at room temperature for a contact time of 1 h. In order to ensure accurate quantification of the blends under investigation, the washing procedure had to be modified with the addition of two rinsings of the residue with the reagent used for the dissolution. Following ISO 5725, a balanced uniform level test was performed on <b>loop</b> twisted <b>carpet</b> samples of three levels of concentration (25, 50 and 75 %, approximately) with the participation of seventeen European laboratories. The trueness was evaluated considering as reference values data obtained from manual separation of samples. The calculated bias varied from 0. 06 to 0. 49 %, rising with the increasing content of polyamide in the binary mixture. Repeatability and reproducibility limits were in the range 0. 69 - 1. 04 % and 0. 97 - 1. 87 %, respectively. In agreement with the members of the European Network of National Experts on Textile Labelling, the optimised method was judged fit-for-purpose and the reproducibility limit was established at 2 %. Based on this study, the scope of application of method 11 can be extended with the insertion of the novel fibre as the insoluble component (d factor 1. 005) and polyamide as the soluble one, provided that the modifications are adopted.
