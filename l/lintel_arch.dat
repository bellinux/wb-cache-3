50|$|The {{development}} of Roman architecture, however, did not remain limited {{to these new}} forms and materials. An unrelated process of architectural innovation continued unabated, which, although less conspicuous, proved their usefulness for solving structural problems and found their way permanently into Western architecture, such as the <b>lintel</b> <b>arch,</b> the independent corbel, and the metal-tie.|$|E
50|$|The façade has two gates with <b>lintelled</b> <b>arches.</b> Among these {{lies the}} {{tabernacle}} with the statues of Madonna with the Child and two Angels, attributed to Giovanni Pisano. Two niches {{open in the}} upper part of the façade: these houses the statue of Christ among the two Annunciation ones, and two other angels.|$|R
50|$|The five story Richardsonian Romanesque {{building}} {{was built on}} a very narrow lot. It is constructed of Longmeadow brownstone and is sparsely detailed with granite <b>lintels</b> and <b>arches.</b>|$|R
5|$|Wheelhouses are stone {{buildings}} {{from the}} later Iron Age whose characteristic features include an outer wall within which {{a circle of}} stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel) {{form the basis for}} <b>lintel</b> <b>arches</b> supporting corbelled roofing with a hearth at the hub. Eight presumed sites have been identified in Orkney although the style is different from those of Shetland and the Western Isles. The Orkney sites are four on Sanday, one on Calf of Eday, one at Hillock of Burroughston on Shapinsay and two on the Mainland at Burrian Broch and Broch of Gurness.|$|R

50|$|In architecture, a {{tympanum}} (plural, tympana) is the semi-circular or triangular decorative {{wall surface}} over an entrance, door or window, bounded by a <b>lintel</b> and <b>arch.</b> It often contains sculpture or other imagery or ornaments. Most architectural styles include this element.|$|R
50|$|All {{the windows}} have green {{louvered}} shutters. The south (front) facade {{is dominated by}} the centrally located main entrance on the first floor. It is sheltered by an open gable porch supported by columns. The entrance itself is flanked by sidelights and pilasters and surmounted by an ornate fanlight and segmented <b>arched</b> <b>lintel.</b> Above it is a detailed tripartite window within an arch partially cut into the frieze and cornice above it. It is flanked by pilasters supported another segmented <b>arch</b> <b>lintel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Built on high {{octagonal}} {{platform with}} smaller gates on the cardinal directions and five arches on each side. It {{is in the}} style of Mughal tombs at Delhi. The real grave is in an underground chamber and the false grave in the tomb chamber. The Quranic texts in Arabic are carved, inside tomb chamber, on <b>lintels,</b> <b>arches</b> and also above Jali work on eastern side walls. The extant parapet wall on the roof terrace is embellished with Merlon designs in brick red color evident from the traces. The lower portion of cylindrical dome surrounding the tomb was covered with thick plaster of brick red color. The mausoleum has a double dome and {{seems to have been a}} garden tomb and vav or step well to its across west the modern road was perhaps used for supplying the water to the garden.|$|R
50|$|The facade {{oriented}} {{towards the}} west is practically destroyed, but is marked by two balcony windows: one on {{the first and the}} other on the second floors. The second floor windows are actually dual windows with chamfered arcs. Meanwhile, the northern facade has a single window on the second floor, with rectangular <b>lintel</b> and <b>arch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "aisled roundhouses" [...] their characteristic features include an outer wall within which a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel) {{form the basis for}} <b>lintel</b> <b>arches</b> supporting corbelled roofing with a hearth at the hub. About a third are double-walled. They range in diameter from 4 to 11.5 m. Those sites that have been dated tend to fall within the period 25 BC to 380 AD. In the Northern Isles, 72% are found in association with broch sites, and they are of a later date than these towered structures in all cases. No sites in the west have such an association, an as yet unresolved enigma. The majority are dug into the landscape and only their thatched roofs would have been visible above the ground — although these would have been 6 metres or more in height. [...] Other examples were built above ground, such as Clettraval and [...] (on Grimsay).|$|R
50|$|Traditional masonry {{buildings}} had thick Load-bearing {{walls that}} supported {{the weight of the}} building. Openings in these load bearing walls such as doors and windows were typically small and spanned by steel <b>lintels</b> or masonry <b>arches.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{a two-story}} ashlar granite church which faces north. It is three bays wide and four bays deep. Its front facade {{includes}} two twin Roman arch windows each {{topped by a}} rose window, enclosed within a roman <b>arch</b> <b>lintel</b> with keystone.|$|R
50|$|A main portal {{leads into}} the church {{decorated}} by an intricately carved <b>arched</b> <b>lintel</b> and door frame. Another smaller doorway {{is located on the}} façade {{to the right of the}} front of the church. It is almost as intricately carved as the main entry door.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the {{building}} was a simple one-storey building, approximately of a square base, entirely built of brick, with a clean facade devoid of ornaments. Later additions {{led to the creation}} of a new romantic spirit, with <b>arched</b> <b>lintels</b> and the regular rhythm of prongs over the roof cornice.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} as a Türbe (tomb) for Hudavend Hatun, the {{daughter}} of Kilij Arslan IV in 1312.It was restored by the General Directorate of Religious Endowments (Vakiflar Genel Mudurlugu) in 1962. The tomb is made of yellow cut stone and is covered by a dome topped with a sixteen-sided pyramidal roof on an octagonal body. Total height is 15,5 metres. White marble {{was used in the}} <b>lintels,</b> the <b>arches,</b> the inscription plaques, and the cornice of the dome. The tomb is most known for its elaborate vegetal and zoomorphic carvings.|$|R
6000|$|... § VIII. The {{height of}} the load above the arch is {{determined}} by the needs of the building and possible length of the shaft; but with this we have at present nothing to do, for we have performed the task which was set us. We have ascertained, as it was required that we should in § VI. of Chap. III. (A), the construction of walls; (B), that of piers; (C), that of piers with <b>lintels</b> or <b>arches</b> prepared for roofing. We have next, therefore, to examine (D) the structure of the roof.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ground floor}} was 9 ft 6in (2.9m) high and other floors 9 ft barring {{the sixth floor}} which was 8 ft 6in (2·58m). From the {{exterior}} we see 6 ft by 4 ft 6 in (1·36m) windows on each floor in each bay with camber <b>arch</b> <b>lintels</b> and sandstone cills.|$|R
50|$|The brick of {{the house}} was laid in a five-course American bond. All of the double-hung sash windows have stuccoed jack <b>arch</b> <b>lintels.</b> Both the north and south facades are identical. The {{interior}} design {{of the house}} is a central hall plan. The original woodwork, including a pegged mortice-and-tenon-joined staircase handrail, is intact.|$|R
50|$|The Kümbet of Hudavend Hatun {{is located}} in Niğde city. It was built in 1312 and was {{commissioned}} by Hudavend Hatun, daughter of the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan IV, and was restored by the General Directorate of Religious Endowments (Vakiflar Genel Mudurlugu) in 1962. The tomb is made of yellow cut stone and is covered by a dome topped with an eight-faceted pyramidal crown on the exterior. Total height is 15.5 meters. White marble {{was used in the}} <b>lintels,</b> the <b>arches,</b> the inscription plaques, and the cornice of the dome. The tomb is most known for its elaborate vegetal and zoomorphic carvings.|$|R
5000|$|... 93 Ten Broeck Street: This two-and-half-story brick Italianate house {{sits on a}} large lot for the neighborhood. It has {{intricate}} detailing, including bay windows, segmental <b>arched</b> <b>lintels,</b> ironwork {{and heavy}} brackets on the cornices. Side porches overlook {{what was once the}} garden on the south side. It is not known when, exactly, it was built.|$|R
40|$|Cottage Cameron, {{along with}} Cottage Cline, was built about 13 {{years after the}} first cottages were {{constructed}}. They are constructed of limestone, as were the earlier cottages, but are not in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. There are colored stone sills and lintels on the window openings, but the <b>lintels</b> are not <b>arched</b> over the large, rectangular, double hung windows...|$|R
6000|$|... § VI. Now, it also happens, {{from its}} place in buildings, that the {{sectional}} roof over a narrow space {{will need to be}} considered before we come to the expanded roof over a broad one. For when a wall has been gathered, as above explained, into piers, that it may better bear vertical pressure, it is generally necessary that it should be expanded again at the top into a continuous wall before it carries the true roof. <b>Arches</b> or <b>lintels</b> are, therefore, thrown from pier to pier, and a level preparation for carrying the real roof is made above them. After we have examined the structure of piers, therefore, we shall have to see how <b>lintels</b> or <b>arches</b> are thrown from pier to pier, and the whole prepared for the superincumbent roof; this arrangement being universal in all good architecture prepared for vertical pressures: and we shall then examine the condition of the great roof itself. And because the structure of the roof very often introduces certain lateral pressures which {{have much to do with}} the placing of buttresses, it will be well to do all this before we examine the nature of buttresses, and, therefore, between parts (B) and (C) of the above plan, § IV. So now we shall have to study: (A) the construction of walls; (B) that of piers; (C) that of <b>lintels</b> or <b>arches</b> prepared for roofing; (D) that of roofs proper; and (E) that of buttresses.|$|R
50|$|The North Wisconsin Lumber Company Office is a {{historic}} building in Hayward, Wisconsin. The office was built in 1889 by the North Wisconsin Lumber Company, a prominent logging company in Wisconsin's Namekagon region which was founded by A.J. Hayward and R.L. McCormick. The building's design includes cast iron columns in its storefront, tall windows with <b>arched</b> <b>lintels,</b> and brick corbels and dentils.|$|R
50|$|In the {{northern}} lateral body, are {{the remains of}} the rectangular chapel, with semi-circular apse, covered in wicker doors, broken by an <b>arched</b> <b>lintel,</b> with straight and rectangular openings. The interior comprises two naves, separated by 3 arches over pillars, and covered by three transverse vaults. The juxtaposed apse is covered by a vaulted ceiling with a central shell motif at its apex.|$|R
50|$|The lounge also {{features}} a pressed metal ceiling with borders, roses and cornice, also a picture rail and tall timber cornice. Opening from here and other rooms onto the balcony are panelled and glazed French doors with tilting fanlights. The facade treatment here is face brickwork with flat brick <b>arch</b> <b>lintels,</b> simple pilasters continuing from ground level to the parapet, and double-hung windows with moulded plaster sills.|$|R
50|$|The mill buildings, {{completed}} in 1900 and 1904, {{were designed by}} preeminent mill architects Lockwood, Greene & Co. Mill No. 1 was three stories and Mill No. 2 was five stories, both of brick with <b>arched</b> <b>lintels</b> and stone sills. Mill No. 1 had the carding, drawing, and picking areas plus a repair shop on the first floor; weaving on the second floor; and spooling, warping, and spinning on the third.|$|R
50|$|All {{openings}} have brick <b>arch</b> <b>lintels.</b> There are two {{windows and}} a pair of doors with a three-paned fanlight above in the south-east (front) wall and one window in the north-west (rear) wall. A second pair of doors with three-paned fanlight above is in the north-east wall. The window openings in the south-east elevation are lined with wire mesh and each of the windows has a sliding timber panel, and a timber-lined sill and head.|$|R
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, buttressing, <b>lintels</b> and <b>arching.</b> At the same time there were increasing influences from English and continental European designs. These {{can be seen in the}} Romanesque chevron pattern on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral. St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons that had worked at Durham. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, Jedburgh and St Andrews.|$|R
50|$|The brick {{church has}} a steep gabled roof and is laid in English garden wall brick bond. The structure, two bays wide and three bays deep, faces east with twin {{entrance}} {{doors in the}} north and south bays. Each bay is rectangular, surmounted by a Federal-style transom and reached by two stone steps. The nave windows are rectangular, holding twelve-over-twelve lites and, decorated with splayed brick flat <b>arched</b> <b>lintels.</b> The interior contains a gallery which extends around three sides of the church.|$|R
50|$|In the Old Town of Utebo {{there are}} several brick houses with three floors, with access cover of {{centered}} <b>arch,</b> <b>lintelled</b> hollow galleries on the upper floor, and brick, wood or tile eaves.Also in the Plaza de la Constitución we can find the unique buildings of the Town Hall, the Day Centre, and the 'El Molino' Centre. The latter is situated on {{the remains of the}} old Utebo Mill, the only old building situated in El Monte. The mill was used for flour production.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of unreinforced and reinforced masonry spandrels is studied, using {{the results of}} several experimental tests carried out on H-shaped full-scale specimens. In particular, four unreinforced masonry specimens in different configurations, were built by varying the masonry material (bricks and stones) and lintel supports (wooden <b>lintel,</b> masonry <b>arch)</b> are considered. Each specimen was then reinforced with different strengthening techniques (tensioned bars, steel profiles and CFRP strips) and re-tested. The {{mechanical behaviour}} of the spandrel involves typically two types of failure: shear and flexural collapse. Starting from the experimental behaviour of the tested specimens, a numerical model able to predict the cyclic response of a spandrel subjected to seismic loading is presented and validated with the experimental results. The numerical model allows one to evaluate the energy dissipation that occurs in a masonry spandrel during a quasi-static cyclic test or a dynamic analysis...|$|R
50|$|The north {{elevation}} is also {{decorated with}} some elaboration, {{even though it}} faces a narrow passage. Windows {{on the second floor}} are topped by segmented arches and brick corbelled hoods, and the mansard roof is pierced by six dormers similar in style to the original one on the front. Windows on the south elevation are more simply styled, having only segmented <b>arch</b> <b>lintels,</b> and the cornice becomes simpler towards the rear of the building. The back elevation is also simply decorated, and is mostly obscured by a c. 1930s vernacular three-tier porch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} {{has important}} features. In {{the house now}} known as [...] "The Abbey", the sumptuous barrel-vaulted, coved plaster ceiling {{on the first floor}} has five pendants and elaborate strap work. The central rose decoration radiates with pomegranates and fleur-de-lis decorations. Another upstairs room has a flat ribbed plaster ceiling and the staircase has linenfold wainscote panelling. In [...] "The Grange", there are more elaborately decorated plaster ceilings, linenfold panelling in the rear passageway and a plastered archway with the heads of satyrs. There are other important features including a wide fireplace with an <b>arched</b> <b>lintel</b> on the ground floor.|$|R
50|$|The B.F. Goodrich Company Showroom is a B.F. Goodrich Company {{showroom}} {{located at}} 1925 S. Michigan Ave. in Chicago's Motor Row District. The showroom {{was built in}} 1911 to sell B.F. Goodrich tires and distribute them to other Chicago retailers. Christian Albert Eckstorm, a Chicago architect who designed many of the Motor Row showrooms, designed the building. The Second Empire building features a mansard roof with a terra cotta balustrade, three dormers with terra cotta frames, a partial cornice, and large second-story windows with <b>arched</b> <b>lintels.</b> Like most Motor Row buildings, its architectural ornaments are primarily located {{near the top of}} the building. B.F. Goodrich used the showroom until 1929.|$|R
50|$|The {{main house}} is a two-story wood frame structure, clad in stone veneer, with a hip roof and a partial {{concrete}} foundation. The house is five bays wide, with sash windows {{in most of the}} bays, and a central entrance flanked by sidelight windows, and topped by a transom window, all set under a segmented-arch pediment. The first floor windows are set in openings with slightly <b>arched</b> <b>lintels,</b> and the second-floor windows are set near the eave in the Federal style. The facade details are repeated on the south (ocean-facing) facade, and there are single-story extensions to the sides. The stone for the veneer was all locally gathered.|$|R
5000|$|The façade's {{central axis}} is {{emphasized}} {{by a large}} entrance portal, with a rounded arch that rises the height of two storeys. This deep, splayed passageway has an <b>arched</b> <b>lintel</b> decorated with plant motifs that introduces serried ranks of arches on either side. They are resting alternately on small columns and pillars variously decorated with fantastic creatures and inlaid geometric patterns. The wall beneath the great arch is densely worked with volutes of acanthus leaves and concatenated circles simulating rope made entirely of terracotta reliefs. The entrance is divided in two by a column of green marble with a capital and decorated entablature on which the two smaller arches rest.|$|R
