5|$|There {{used to be}} {{two large}} geysers fields in Nevada—Beowawe and Steamboat Springs—but they were {{destroyed}} by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants. At the plants, geothermal drilling reduced the available heat and lowered the <b>local</b> <b>water</b> table {{to the point that}} geyser activity could no longer be sustained.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the layers}} of pinacocytes and choanocytes {{resemble}} the epithelia of more complex animals, they are not bound tightly by cell-to-cell connections or a basal lamina (thin fibrous sheet underneath). The flexibility of these layers and re-modeling of the mesohyl by lophocytes allow the animals to adjust their shapes throughout their lives to take maximum advantage of <b>local</b> <b>water</b> currents.|$|E
5|$|Regional geology accords that Dublin's {{hard water}} is well-suited to making stout, such as Guinness, while the Plzeň Region's soft water {{is ideal for}} brewing Pilsner (pale lager), such as Pilsner Urquell. The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which {{benefits}} making pale ale {{to such a degree}} that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the <b>local</b> <b>water</b> in a process known as Burtonisation.|$|E

5|$|The Dening Hall has Daoist murals {{painted on}} {{three of its}} walls. The western wall's mural, {{said to have been}} painted in the Tang Dynasty, {{measures}} 17 by 7 meters and features a <b>local</b> <b>water</b> deity with a winged being at the top. With similar dimensions to the western mural, the eastern mural portrays the Dragon King. The hall contains nine statues, all dating from a more recent period than the hall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the earthquake, {{multiple}} phone lines were down, and scattered power outages affected about 54,000 households. Moreover, at least 70 underground 11,000 volt cables sustained some degree of damage, contributing to the outages. The shaking ruptured <b>local</b> <b>water</b> mains, resulting in widespread flooding that affected several streets. Furthermore, officials ordered the closure of bridges in the area as a precautionary measure; one bridge was reported to have succumbed to the strong ground motions. Days after its occurrence, a small electrical fire ignited in a control panel at Christchurch Hospital due to dislodged wiring as a result of ongoing aftershocks.|$|E

5|$|The cave {{was formed}} under phreatic {{conditions}} i.e. below the <b>local</b> <b>water</b> table, but lowering base levels {{to which the}} subterranean drainage was flowing resulted in some passages being abandoned by the river, and {{there is evidence of}} a number of abandoned resurgences. In particular, the passages in the 20th chamber are interpreted as a former Vauclusian spring, the waters of which once surfaced in the Ebbor Gorge. It is uncertain whether that was the original rising or whether it formed when the main rising at Wookey was blocked.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} {{nature of}} past eruptions at Silverthrone Caldera {{suggests that this}} volcano poses a significant long-distance threat to communities across Canada. A large explosive eruption can produce large amounts of ash that could significantly affect communities across Canada. Ash columns could rise to several hundred meters above the volcano which would make this a hazard for air traffic along the coastal airway between Vancouver and Alaska. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure as well as damage to other aircraft systems. In addition, pyroclastic fall could also have a deleterious effect on the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield surrounding the volcano. Melting of glacial ice could cause lahars or debris flows. This in turn could endanger water supplies on the Machmell River and other <b>local</b> <b>water</b> sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{flooding}} on Mangaia {{was regarded}} as the worst in almost 50years, as nearly the entire island was affected. According to locals, the ocean surrounding the island became red at one point due {{to the amount of}} soil being washed out to sea. Despite initial reports that the <b>local</b> <b>water</b> supply was contaminated, the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that it was safe to drink and there was a sufficient amount for all of the islands' 744 residents. Offshore, a sailboat was severely damaged by large swells produced by the storm and {{was on the verge of}} sinking. The sailor managed to secure the vessel and make it safely to shore.|$|E

5|$|In state {{legislative}} assembly elections in May 2016, the AIADMK {{was returned to}} power in Tamil Nadu, albeit with a reduced majority. The party lost eight seats to the opposing DMK in Chennai district and a further eight seats elsewhere; its losses were attributed to its perceived failure to properly address the flood crisis. On 16 June, K. Rosaiah, the governor of Tamil Nadu, announced the state government would soon develop comprehensive flood protection plans for Chennai and its surrounding coastal districts; he said the emphasis would be on providing better roads, storm water drains, solid waste management, sewerage management and street lights. The initiatives would be synergised with the Smart Cities Programme and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme. Funding had also been obtained from the World Bank and from the Asian Development Bank for climate-change impact reduction initiatives, {{as well as for}} the restoration of water bodies and tanks. As of July 2016, however, local citizens' groups said no constructive work had been done to rejuvenate <b>local</b> <b>water</b> bodies and that the effects of a similar north-east monsoon would have an equally destructive impact.|$|E
5|$|The former fishing {{hamlet of}} Holywell (local {{pronunciation}} ‘holly well’) was situated by the cliff on a ledge some 400 {{yards to the}} southwest of the public garden known as the Holywell Retreat. It was approached from what is now Holywell Road via the lane between the present Helen Gardens and StBede’s School {{which leads to the}} chalk pinnacle formerly known locally as ‘Gibraltar’ or the 'Sugar Loaf'. The ground around the pinnacle was the site of lime kilns also worked by the fishermen. The fishing hamlet at Holywell was taken over by the <b>local</b> <b>water</b> board in 1896 to exploit the springs in the cliffs. The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now even most of the foundations of the cottages have gone over the cliff.|$|E
5|$|The target {{chosen for}} the {{operation}} was a fresh-water aqueduct near Calitri in southern Italy, which supplied water to {{a large portion of}} the Italian population as well as several ports used by the Italian military; it was also hoped that its destruction would hamper Italian military efforts in North Africa and Albania. The airborne troops were delivered by converted Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bombers to the target on 10 February, but equipment failures and navigational errors meant that a significant portion of the troops explosives, and a team of Royal Engineer sappers, landed in the wrong area. Despite this setback the remaining members of the troop successfully destroyed the aqueduct and withdrew from the area, but were all captured by the Italian authorities within a short time; an Italian translator was tortured and executed and one paratrooper managed to escape captivity, but the rest remained as prisoners of war. The aqueduct was rapidly repaired before <b>local</b> <b>water</b> reserves ran out, ensuring that the local population and the ports were not deprived of water, and, consequently, that the Italian war efforts were not hampered. However, it served as a morale boost for the fledgling airborne establishment, and the technical and operational lessons learnt from the operation helped the development of further airborne operations.|$|E

5|$|This double {{disaster}} {{destroyed the}} Pope's {{plans for the}} crusade, as he had envisaged it to land in Theodore's rear while he was engaged with Robert's army. At the same time, the prospective leader of the crusade, William VI of Montferrat, fell ill. In November, the Pope was forced to postpone the crusade's departure for the next spring. With news of the Latin defeats and the postponement of the crusade, the exhausted defenders of Thessalonica surrendered the city to Theodore sometime in December 1224. The crusade to relieve it sailed in March 1225, and landed in Thessaly at Halmyros. The Crusader army was soon decimated by dysentery, allegedly because the Greeks had poisoned the <b>local</b> <b>water</b> supply. William of Montferrat himself succumbed to it, and {{the remnants of the}} army left Greece. Demetrius of Montferrat still hoped to recover his realm with the help of Frederick II, but died in 1227.|$|E
