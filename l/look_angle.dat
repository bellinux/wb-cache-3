40|$|International audienceOrthorectification using digital terrain {{models is}} a key issue for full-polarimetric complex SAR data because {{resampling}} the complex data can corrupt the polarimetric phase, mainly in terrain with relief.

Moreover, when using two CODAR stations the so-called “baseline problem” can affect the measurement. This occurs when both the instruments measure the same component of velocity. To avoid this problem and resolve properly the current vector, generally two radials must have an angle included by 30° and 150°.|$|E

50|$|Rain fade refers {{primarily}} to the absorption of a microwave radio frequency (RF) signal by atmospheric rain, snow or ice, and losses which are especially prevalent at frequencies above 11 GHz.

The Seasat radar data show evidence that the high return occurs only at a narrow range in look direction near the 90 deg.

40|$|Abstract—Autofocus {{algorithms}} {{are used}} to restore images in nonideal synthetic aperture radar imaging systems. In this paper, we propose a bilinear parametric model for the unknown image and the nuisance phase parameters and derive an efficient max-imum-likelihood autofocus (MLA) algorithm. In the special case of a simple image model and a narrow range of <b>look</b> <b>angles,</b> MLA co-incides with the successful multichannel autofocus (MCA). MLA {{can be interpreted as}} a generalization of MCA to a larger class of models with a larger range of <b>look</b> <b>angles.</b> We analyze its ad-vantages over previous extensions of MCA in terms of identifia-bility conditions and noise sensitivity. As a byproduct, we also pro-pose numerical approximations to the difficult constant modulus quadratic program that lies at the core of these algorithms. We demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methods using computer simulations in both the correct and mismatched system models. MLA performs better than other methods, both in terms of the mean squared error and visual quality of the restored image.
