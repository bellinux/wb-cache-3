2500|$|A {{constructive}} trust is a trust which is {{imposed by the}} courts whenever the defendant knows that he has dealt with property in an [...] "unconscionable manner", such as stealing it, possessing it via fraud, and accepting a bribe while in occupation of a fiduciary office. The {{constructive trust}} is intended to take the property from the defendant's control, preventing them from causing additional harm with it. It thus acts regardless of the parties' intentions. In Paragon Finance plc v DB Thakerar & Co, Millet LJ defined a constructive trust as a trust which [...] "arises by operation of law whenever the circumstances are such {{that it would be}} unconscionable for the owner of property (usually but not necessarily the <b>legal</b> <b>estate)</b> to assert his own beneficial interest in the property and deny the beneficial interest of another". Essentially, a constructive trust will arise whenever an owner either ignores, or interferes, with the rights of another person with an interest in that property. There is a distinction between personal and proprietary rights to property. A constructive trust normally gives a proprietary right to the beneficiary that can be enforced on any other person. The alternative (a personal right) merely gives the beneficiary the right to recover money equivalent to the value of the property.|$|E

Our monarchical predecessors had the same facilities, {{and it may be}} added, the same propensities, to rendering a law a dead letter, as belongs to our republican selves. The patent on our table, being for a nominal hundred thousand acres, contains the names of one hundred different grantees, while three several parchment documents at its side, each signed by thirty-three of these very persons, vest the <b>legal</b> <b>estate</b> in the first named, for whose sole benefit the whole concession was made; the dates of the last instruments succeeding, by one or two days, that of the royal patent itself.|$|E

5000|$|If {{a person}} has an {{equitable}} interest in property, this implies that some other person has the legal interest in that property. If one person has both the legal and equitable interest in the relevant property, {{he or she has}} no ‘equitable interest’ in that property as such. “If one person has both the <b>legal</b> <b>estate</b> and the entire beneficial interest in the land he holds an entire and unqualified legal interest and not two separate interests, one legal and the other equitable”. As stated by Brennan J in DKLR Holding Co (No 2) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW), [...] "an equitable interest is not carved out of a <b>legal</b> <b>estate</b> but impressed upon it".|$|E

50|$|A person {{provided}} {{money to}} purchase a <b>legal</b> <b>estate</b> in land {{in the name of}} another person, and {{there was no evidence that}} the purchaser intended to advance a loan or make a gift.
