5|$|Although Snake Pass {{is still}} the {{shortest}} route between Manchester and Sheffield, the more northerly Woodhead Pass, which is less steep and at a lower altitude, is now the primary road <b>link</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two cities. Unlike Snake Pass, the Woodhead route is a trunk road. Traffic levels on both passes remained similar until the 1980s, but the Woodhead Pass route is now favoured as it connects directly to the M1, while Snake Pass leads into the centre of Sheffield. Despite Sheffield and Manchester being among the largest UK cities by population, {{there is no direct}} motorway <b>link</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two. A Manchester to Sheffield motorway was first proposed in 1966, and a small section bypassing Denton and Hyde has been built, now the M67. The Woodhead Tunnel was closed in 1981 in anticipation of a road replacement, but linking the cities would have meant constructing many costly tunnels and viaducts across the Peak District. Consequently, the plans were shelved, but reports in December 2014 announced a revival of the scheme.|$|E
5|$|Although the pharaoh {{delegated}} his authority, {{the performance}} of temple rituals was still an official duty, restricted to high-ranking priests.

As the primary <b>link</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> human and divine realms, temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem.

These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E
