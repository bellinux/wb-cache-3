40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a legal {{framework}} concerning Leniency Program which is by far {{one of the most}} successful tools in detection and prosecution of criminal cartel conduct, which has been recently perceived as one of the most important and dangerous anticompetitive conduct. Under the current system, an applicant making a <b>leniency</b> <b>application</b> will apply to seek full immunity from sanctions. If full immunity is not available, the applicant can apply for a reduction of any fine levelled against it. The study examines the level of transparency, predictability and effectiveness in the Czech Republic, European Union and United States. Chapter three provides an overview of a historical aspect of a Leniency Program including case law and recent development in each of abovementioned jurisdiction. In order to take all aspects into account, an impact of this program on human rights and recidivism is also discussed in this paper. Final chapter contains a recent development concerning Antitrust Damages Actions and rules on disclosure of evidence on leniency...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{introduce}} {{the concept of the}} leniency programme and to describe its development and current legal regulation in the European Union and the Czech Republic, to evaluate its rules, its effectiveness and morality. The thesis also explores the relationship between leniency programme and other instruments in antitrust law enforcement. Leniency programme lies in granting full or partial immunity from sanction to the member of a cartel that reports the existence of this cartel to the antitrust authority. The thesis describes the key features of an effective leniency programme and compares these general postulates with real facts from the practise of the European Commission and the Office for the Protection of Competition. The thesis continues with pointing out the differences between European Commission notification issued in the years 1996, 2002 and 2006 and it describes how the programme works nowadays. It also focuses on the cases in which the Commission used the leniency programme. It also deals with the issue of European Competition Network and its Model Leniency Programme. Then it describes the leniency programme in the Czech Republic and the decisions by the Office for the Protection of Competition on the basis of <b>leniency</b> <b>application.</b> The comparison of Czech and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the most}} {{successful}} tool in the antitrust arsenal of the European Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U. S. Department of Justice {{has proven to be}} leniency programs, which provide full immunity from fines to the first cartel-member that confesses its participation in the conspiracy. Even though European and U. S. leniency programs are fairly similar to one another, procedural differences may undermine their effectiveness. It has long been argued that potential discovery of corporate statements accompanying the <b>leniency</b> <b>application</b> before the Commission in subsequent proceedings in the United States would put the firms that cooperated with the Commission at a disadvantage with respect to other conspirators in proceedings involving peculiar (and burdensome) U. S. features, such as class-actions, treble damages, and criminal sanctions. European institutions and practitioners are generally concerned about the 2 ̆ 2 uniquely liberal discovery standards that govern in the United States courts. 2 ̆ 2 This Comment suggests two additional ways to protect corporate statements from discovery or, at least, from admissibility at trial: (1) invoking Federal Rule of Evidence 408, which mandates that offers to compromise and statements made in settlement negotiations shall not be admitted at trial to show liability and (2) invoking the work-product doctrine, which protects the confidentiality of documents prepared in anticipation of litigation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the U. S. Department of Justice leniency program setup involving both corporate and individual leniency. Specifically, {{the interaction between}} corporate and individual leniency programs in concurrent operation, the design of optimal leniency program structure to elicit corporate <b>leniency</b> <b>applications</b> and the behaviour of economic agents subject to such programs comprise the primary directions of this thesis. In addressing corporate malfeasance under the option to apply for leniency, the intra-firm interplay of agents is modeled as a dynamic game of incomplete information. The principle findings are that if agents are symmetric in their access to leniency the concurrent operation of corporate and individual leniency programs is suboptimal {{as the presence of}} the individual leniency program detracts from corporate <b>leniency</b> <b>applications</b> due to a reallocation of incentives to report. On the other hand, under asymmetric access it is in fact optimal to utilise both leniency programs concurrently as there is no distortion in incentives to report but rather a threat effect in motion. Agent access to these leniency programs is imperative in determining the success of the combinatory policy structure...|$|R

40|$|In 2013 Act on the Protection of Competition was amended {{and there}} was added a section § 22 ba on direct <b>application</b> of the <b>leniency</b> programme. Following the {{amendment}} the Office for the Protection of Competition published a new version of the leniency programme. This Bachelor thesis focuses on deeper analysis of {{the historical development of}} the programme in the European and Czech environment. The main basis of this work is to analyse the changes that have led to more successful <b>application</b> of the <b>leniency</b> programme in proceedings before the Office. Since 2013 the Office has recorded two-times increase of applications for waiver or reduction of fines which arises from better legal certainty of the applicants. The Office in its proceedings systematically violates the Administrative Procedure, prolongs proceedings inefficiently and in some cases it even significantly exceeds a specified time limited period for issuance of acts.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} interdependencies between {{corporate}} and individual leniency programs. In a duopoly model where corporations are separated into representing owners and operating managers, {{conflicts between the}} two types of agents arise if the relative benefits of participating in the corresponding leniency programs differ. As an example of what might cause differing relative benefits, the paper considers the inclusion of damage payments for owners which are not covered by the corporate leniency program. The main findings are: (1) Individual <b>leniency</b> <b>applications</b> are never observed. (2) Threats by managers to apply for individual leniency may, however, increase the owners’ incentive to carry out corporate self-reports. (3) In other cases, the individual leniency program increases the owners’ tolerance for cartel activity for two reasons: Either the corporate leniency program is sufficiently unattractive to the owners, or the owners rely on the option to apply for corporate leniency after the Antitrust Authority has opened a case. (4) Finally, the more distortion decreases, the more ineffective the individual leniency program becomes.

40|$|Constructing a {{birth and}} death model of cartels, this paper {{examines}} the im-pact of a corporate leniency program on the frequency of cartels in a population of industries. An innovative feature of the model is taking account of how a leniency program impacts enforcement through non-leniency means, specifically, {{the effectiveness of a}} competition authority in prosecuting cases without a le-niency applicant. It is shown that a leniency program is assured of lowering the cartel rate when leniency cases take up sufficiently few competition authority resources or when enforcement was initially very weak. When leniency cases are just as intensive to prosecute and penalties are sufficiently low then a leniency program is not only ineffective but actually raises the cartel rate because of its deleterious effect on non-leniency enforcement. It is also found that the effect of a leniency program can vary significantly across industries. Finally, measuring the performance of a leniency program using the number of <b>leniency</b> <b>applications</b> is shown to be problematic because a leniency program can lower the cartel rate while generating no applications and raise the cartel rate while generating many applications...|$|R
40|$|The book {{contains}} {{a full and}} up-to-date account {{of the implications of}} concurrent enforcement of EC and UK competition law. It addresses the interaction of criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings in the UK and the EU as regards procedure, evidence, and remedies. The volume {{contains a}}n in-depth examination of the principles regulating concurrent proceedings and explains in detail the practical solutions following from the construction of EU and UK legislation. Concurrent Proceedings in Competition Law offers a thorough review of the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as analysing the English authorities in the area of procedure and evidence insofar as relevant to the interplay between criminal, civil and administrative proceedings in competition law. The main focus is on stays, binding effect of administrative decisions and judgments, and disclosure and admissibility of evidence in English law and its relationship with Community Law and Human Rights standards. The analysis expands to the practical consequences of case allocation within the European Competition Network, choice of forum within the EU, litigation in the US, and <b>leniency</b> <b>applications</b> in multiple jurisdictions. The impact of Council Regulation 1 / 2003 and the Commission Notices on cooperation within the Network of Competition Authorities and on cooperation with the courts of EU member states is fully explored. Criminalization of cartels in the UK adds a further dimension to the interplay of concurrent proceedings. Issues of stays, binding effect of administrative decisions and disclosure and admissibility of evidence are also studied when they arise in a dispute that is being decided by an arbitral tribunal...|$|R
40|$|This Article employs {{sustainability}} as {{a framework}} to analyze the recent proposed physical expansion plans of Columbia University {{for the purpose of}} illustrating the complexities that arise in urban development and higher education practices, as well as the problems of trying to simultaneously implement both. Governments and courts traditionally provide a high level of deference and <b>leniency</b> in the <b>application</b> of land-use laws and regulations when it comes to siting and expansion issues for educational institutions, yet institutions of higher education, particularly those located in urban areas, create unique dilemmas for sustainability. For example, available land for expansion is often a physical and political challenge, and the institutional business model behind expansion plans can overshadow the educational purposes that the expansion is intended to serve. Further, the acquisition of new land needed for expansion can result in a “university creep” into neighborhoods where the scale of the proposed development may not be in keeping with past and present community character. Part I of this article offers a framework for defining and evaluating sustainability in the higher education context. Part II further explores the roles of higher education in sustainability, and Part III applies these concepts {{in the context of the}} Columbia University expansion by exploring public participation and community engagement issues, including the controversial use of eminent domain in this case. The community benefits agreement developed as part of the expansion plan is examined, as are the impacts of displacement and gentrification resulting from the expansion...|$|R
