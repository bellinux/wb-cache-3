2500|$|Seeking to find {{uses for}} his {{accumulated}} capital, Leavitt entered into several banking ventures. He {{was elected president}} of the Fulton Bank of New York City. Later, in 1838, he became president of the American Exchange Bank, a large <b>lending</b> <b>institution</b> headquartered in Manhattan, with which he served for 16 years. During his tenure at American Exchange, there was a financial panic, during which European bondholders of the State of Illinois declared their intention to foreclose on the bonds issuer. [...] "Grave fears were entertained that the bonds would not be paid", wrote The New York Times, [...] "and several financiers had failed in placing them in the European market, but by pledging his own credit, Mr. Leavitt succeeded in creating a degree of confidence in the scheme, and it was a source of pride to him in after years that all the holders of the bonds eventually received both principal and interest." [...] To reassure the bondholders, Leavitt not only advanced his own funds, but traveled to England to meet jittery European stakeholders.|$|E
