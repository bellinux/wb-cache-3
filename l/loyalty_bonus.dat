There's to be no compensation payment and that's final." [...] Banks then refused the move until Stoke boss Tony Waddington seemingly negotiated a £2,000 payment out of Leicester. It was only some years later that Banks was informed that Stoke had actually made the payment, not Leicester. Waddington valued good goalkeepers highly, and the two built up a close relationship. During this time, Banks moved to Madeley, Staffordshire. He replaced John Farmer as the club's number one, and kept goal {{in the last four}} games of the 1966–67 season, making his home debut at the Victoria Ground in a 3–1 win over his former club Leicester.|$|E
500|$|He {{was offered}} the chance to return to Bolton Wanderers, but manager George Mulhall was only able to offer 50% of Allardyce's wages at Sunderland. Instead he made a {{surprise}} £95,000 move to Third Division side Millwall, {{who were able to}} match Sunderland's wages and also pay out a £30,000 signing on fee and a £10,000 <b>loyalty</b> <b>bonus.</b> Millwall player-manager Peter Anderson had seen Allardyce as the successor to long-serving central defender Barry Kitchener, and as Anderson was also a property developer he allowed Allardyce to live rent free in a six-bedroom mansion. The [...] "Lions" [...] ended the 1981–82 season in mid-table, and Anderson was sacked in November 1982. Chairman Alan Thorne offered Allardyce the vacant management position, but Allardyce rejected the offer as he felt that at aged 28 he was far too young to enter management. Instead it was George Graham who took up his first management position, and Graham immediately froze Allardyce out of the first team on both matchdays and training after Allardyce insisted that he would not report teammates who broke Graham's rules. He came close to joining Charlton Athletic on a free transfer in March 1983, but Charlton boss Lennie Lawrence did not complete the move {{before the end of the}} transfer deadline. Graham agreed to pay Allardyce £15,000 to cancel his contract, acting under the assumption that Allardyce would struggle to find a club willing to offer him £300 a week.|$|E
5000|$|Individual bonuses {{can range}} from a few {{thousand}} to {{tens of millions of}} dollars, pounds or euros, payable in cash or less obvious forms including pension funds, shares, options, profit-shares and assets derived from the bank's transactions. A variable performance-related bonus is often the substantial part of a senior banker's contractual remuneration; thus they effectively work for a share in the net profits (but not net losses) for which they are responsible, with a relatively small fixed salary. Such bonuses are payable under contract, rather than at discretion; nevertheless the amount of a contractual bonus usually depends on some subjective assessment of the factors required to be taken into account. Individual bonus awards may be calculated by reference to complex formulae combining personal, departmental, corporate, group or share price performances against targets; additional adjustments may be made for factors such as [...] "guaranteed bonuses" [...] often agreed for the early stages of a new employment or venture, <b>loyalty</b> <b>bonuses,</b> or [...] "smoothing" [...] in years where an individual outperforms the bank as a whole. In case of disagreement, especially on resignation, the proper basis of contractual bonus assessment, even if to some extent discretionary, can be negotiated or litigated.|$|R

40|$|While a {{vast number}} of studies have pointed out the keys of {{relationship}} marketing practices in consumer markets, little {{attention has been paid to}} the value the organization can get from such strategies in the B 2 B market. The literature provides relatively little support for the effectiveness of relationship marketing programs. The purpose of this research is to produce some evidence of the association between customer relationship marketing strategies which are attraction activities and <b>Loyalty</b> programs (<b>Bonus,</b> Contact, Customer satisfaction, Contact) and the market performance. The proposed hypotheses are tested in the case of telecommunication service firms, where long-term relationship is needed. This research involved collecting data from Iranian Telecommunication managers of 105 telecommunication companies to understand the relationship exists between attraction and loyalty programs (Bonus-Contact-Satisfaction and complaint) with market performance of the companies and the market performance is measured by market position, customer perception about the firm and customer’s loyalty. The hypotheses were evaluated using a SEM analysis, which associates relationship between attraction activities and Loyalty and interaction programs with market performance (customers’ perceptions, market position and loyalty) by using Partial Least Square (PLS) Techniques. The findings suggest that the effect of attraction and loyalty programs are greater than service quality on market performance, Furthermore, This means that, loyalty and interaction programs are more influential on companies’ awareness and penetration in the market (market position). Attraction activities (service quality) has greater impact on customer’s perception, however bonus and customer satisfaction are more associated with customers’ loyalty also customer satisfaction has grater impact on customers’ loyalty than service quality.

40|$|Drawing on the {{evolving}} research on customers’ identification with companies, our study explores the {{mechanism by which}} customer-company identification generates customer loyalty in a retail setting. We demonstrate that customers’ identification with the retailer is a central element to establish strong emotional ties i. e. affective commitment between customers and the retailer. These emotional ties or affective commitment to the retailer in turn (a) motivate loyalty intentions, i. e. repurchase intention but also (b) motivate so-called customer extra-role behaviours, behaviours which are neither expected by definition nor financially rewarded by the organization such as customers suggesting improvement chances or customers giving other customers a helping hand. We empirically demonstrate that while all of these extra-role behaviours are strongly levered by customer-company identification (through the resulting affective commitment), only some are driven by the classic relationship construct satisfaction. We additionally show which image perceptions of the retailer {{form the basis for}} identification by highlighting those stereotypes that are most salient in triggering customer-company identification. These findings are of high managerial relevance as they uncover a mechanism to strengthen the emotional relationship between the retailer and its customers that goes beyond the ubiquitous primarily economic bonding approaches through e. g. customer <b>loyalty</b> cards or <b>bonus</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} and {{acceptance}} of online gambling is concerning to academics and clinicians {{in the field of}} pathological gambling research. This study proposes a theoretical framework that outlines the effect of technological developments in information technology (IT) on gambling behaviour. The aim of the study is to produce theoretical propositions that can be investigated empirically in future research. Grounded Theory was employed to enable a theoretical framework to conceptualise online gambling behaviour and the utility of IT in gambling behaviour. In total, eight participants were interviewed via semi-structured interviews until theoretical saturation was achieved. The theoretical framework was contrasted against existing problem gambling research. Grounded Theory has indicated that developments in IT have been a catalyst for Elevated Gambling Involvement, in terms of both participation and pre-occupation, and that this phenomenon was produced via the following behavioural constructs: Increased Outcome Control, Reduced Discipline, Expediency and Consumer Value. Participation in online gambling activities is increasing rapidly (Griffiths, 2010). The increase in participation in gambling has the compound accumulative effect of removing negative stigma attributed to the risk behaviour, justifying it as a socially acceptable leisure activity (LaPlante & Shaffer, 2007; Cornish, 1978). The rapid growth {{and acceptance of}} online gambling is concerning to academics and clinicians in the field of pathological gambling research (LaPlante, Kleschinsky, LaBrie, Nelson, & Shaffer, 2008 a). However, this social issue is {{compounded by the fact that}} many treatment professionals and clinicians have little knowledge available about the nature and causes of disordered online gambling simply because there is a distinct lack of research on this subject. Gambling pathology is considered to be an under researched phenomenon (Meyer, Hayer, & Griffiths, 2009; Shaffer, Peller, LaPlante, Nelson, & LaBrie, 2010). It is highly probable that what is accepted knowledge from pathological gambling research will not necessarily be directly applicable to online gambling. Online gambling comprises radically variant environmental and structural characteristics compared to the traditional modes of gambling that current etiological knowledge is based on. Currently, online gambling is still conceptualised in accordance with theory relating to offline gambling behaviour. Furthermore, research has been directed towards developing harm minimisation strategies for online gambling on the assumption that the risk factors involved for developing a pathological gambling disorder online is identical to risk factors involved offline. There is potential for focusing on responsible gambling strategies that are not online gambling specific. Put simply, there is potential for missing the risk factors for development of pathological gambling unique to online gambling if the gambling studies field relies solely on existing offline research without understanding the complexity of cognitive and behavioural processes existent within online gambling. According to Shaffer et al. (2010) “Many of the policy development efforts rely on professional opinions and/or conventional wisdoms related to gambling generally, and internet gambling, specifically” (p. 271). To date, only a handful of peer-reviewed studies are available that focus specifically on online gambling. Shaffer et al. (2010) conducted a literature search for internet gambling research that yielded only 30 studies that had internet gambling as the focus. Within these 30 studies the majority were simply commentaries (20) and the remaining studies were based on self-report rather than empirical behavioural data. The self-report studies were further limited through a lack of representativeness via self-selected samples and low response rates. As Baumeister, Vohs, and Funder (2007) demonstrated, self-report data is often incongruent with observed behavioural data. With this in mind, exclusively using self-report evidence to determine internet gambling social and health policy in the absence of behavioural data is imprudent. In the literature review Shaffer et al. (2010) omitted the two empirical studies that provided actual behavioural data. Perhaps the most pertinent conclusion in the longitudinal behavioural study of internet sports wagering was that the participants demonstrated an adaptation to the behaviour (LaPlante, Schumann, LaBrie, & Shaffer, 2008 b). Put simply, gambling behaviour decreased over time; with a particular decline observed within the first 90 days of initially gambling within that specific betting account. With reference to this finding LaPlante et al. (2008 b) concluded that assumptions that internet gambling will stimulate excessive patterns of gambling were erroneous. However, research has also demonstrated that online gamblers bet across several different betting accounts and on different gambling activities (i. e., not just sports wagering) simultaneously (Parke, 2008; Parke, Rigbye, Parke, & Vaughan-Williams, 2007). Moreover, it is common for internet sports bettors to switch betting accounts frequently to maximise introductory and <b>loyalty</b> promotional <b>bonuses</b> (Parke, 2008; Parke et al., 2007), and therefore one would anticipate marked changes in betting participation on a singular account. The other internet gambling study that used behavioural data has provided valuable cohort characteristics and epidemiology specifically for online poker gambling. LaPlante et al. (2008 a) observed that the vast majority of online poker gamblers were male, but that the female poker gamblers did not differ significantly to males except for gambling for shorter durations. The study also demonstrated that, while excluding the most involved poker gamblers (the top 5...|$|R

40|$|This paper examines, in an {{innovative}} way {{as compared to}} the literature on the subject, “whether, how and under what conditions” certain technical devices, such as so-called “loyalty bonuses,” devised to increase the holding period of shares, can effectively reach their goal of countering the short-termist tendency involved in company investment decisions. This trend is an expression of compliance toward the current short-termism of the financial market as evidenced by the enormous shortening of the average share-holding period. This is not a recent phenomenon but it becomes more marked in times of crisis. Thus many projects, although functional to a company’s competitiveness, are rejected simply because of their deferred profitability and therefore incompatibility with the short market horizon, more focused on results emerging from quarterly reports than on a company’s long-term choices for business development. If the market is unable to immediately and adequately incorporate into prices the benefits from deferred returns, shareholders can equally obtain them if they remain durably connected with the company, but this choice must be encouraged by appropriate incentives. The <b>loyalty</b> <b>bonus</b> may be useful for this purpose and for long-term company interests, because it contributes to a better alignment of shareholders’ expectations with a more long-term vision in investment strategy. However the bonus, rather than involving the minority shareholders in the enterprise’s “mission,” often degenerates into a Control Enhancing Mechanism, though with unusual effects, among which a situation of “captivity” for all shareholders, even and especially the majority shareholders. In any case the utility of the bonus can occur, especially in less efficient markets. In a fully efficient market it could be harmful...|$|E
