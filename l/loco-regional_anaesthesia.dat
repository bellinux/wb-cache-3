40|$|Reducing {{discomfort}} during injection <b>Loco-regional</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> {{is commonly}} used for both intraocular and extraocular surgical procedures, although the provision {{and use of the}} anaesthetic technique varies worldwide. Injection techniques (retrobulbar, peribulbar and sub-Tenon’s blocks) are associated with significant pain; indeed, many patients have a fear of pain. Discomfort during injection can, however, be reduced and patients can be made comfortable through reassurance, careful performance of the technique and the provision of sedation and/or analgesia. In this article, the authors describe common loco-regional anaesthetic techniques and measures to reduce discomfort during injection, thus improving patient satisfaction...|$|E

The anaesthetic implications of this pathology are discussed. By analogy with other cerebral arteriopathies, the aim of our management was to keep mean arterial blood pressure and end-tidal carbon dioxide so as to prevent any cerebral ischaemic or vasospastic phenomenon. We preserved the cerebral venous return by avoiding excessive head-down position. We used a balanced anaesthetic technique because it allows easier titration of the depth of anaesthesia with regard to mean arterial pressure.

40|$|Shoulder {{surgery is}} very often {{followed}} by severe postoperative pain. <b>Loco-regional</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> has greatly contributed {{as a solution}} of this problem. Nevertheless most of surgery is still performed under general anaesthesia. In this case many different methods have been proposed in order to mitigate postoperative pain. Intra-articular administration of local anaesthetics after shoulder surgery is not yet in routinely clinical practice. In this study efficacy of intra-articular administration of Ropivacaine versus Bupivacaine has been evaluated. Analysis of results showed both drugs to share the same effectiveness within four hours postoperatively. In subsequent period (6 - 24 hours) Ropivacaine demonstrated to provide a statistically significant better postoperative pain relief. Furthermore Ropivacaine group patients needed postoperative analgesics {{to a lesser extent}} than Bupivacaine group. The long-losting satisfactory level of analgesia, particularly with Ropivacaine, could recommend the use of intra-articular analgesia even for day-hospital or one-day surgery procedures...|$|E
40|$|Anaesthesia is {{a medical}} act which {{eliminates}} the feeling of pain {{as well as the}} motor reactions of a person, before performing a surgical operation. <b>Loco-Regional</b> <b>Anaesthesia</b> (LRA) concerns only a part of the body such as the front arm or leg. This practice is increasingly used today notably because the patient can remain conscious and can recover more rapidly. However, LRA still remains a risky procedure. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical simulator called SAILOR for the training for LRA with neurostimulation. SAILOR is based on desktop virtual reality, realistic 3 -D rendering and interactive techniques with a classical mouse and keyboard. It simulates the various biological phenomena which can occur during an anaesthesia procedure. We also introduce a novel pseudo-haptic effect to enhance the palpation of the virtual patient’s body and feel the inner organs. The first feedback from users of the commercialized DVD version of SAILOR as well as the results of pilot tests suggest that this simulator is a very promising tool for education and training for LRA...|$|E
40|$|The non-closure of the visceral {{peritoneum}} (VP) is {{the gold}} standard in caesarean section (CS). For surgeons convinced {{of the benefits of}} VP closuring, we propose an alternative method for VP closure during CS, named by us, "Mass Closure Method" (MCM). According to our experience, this method has already been experimented, as described earlier, in 314 CSs in <b>loco-regional</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> All CSs in our department are performed using the modified Joel Cohen incision in the Stark CS, with the Munro Kerr way of hysterotomy. During haemostasis in 18 cases, author observed a small sub-peritoneal haematoma (5. 7 %), solved intra-operatively by singular stitches; 10 women received a bladder flap intraoperative detachment, with an accurate haemostasis (3. 1 %). No case of bladder flap haematoma was recorded, but only hyperechogenic areas in the vesicouterine space (VUS), to be ascribed to the intra-operatives stitches. The direct incision, no bladder flap formation and not suturing a part of the VP, substantially reduce the VUS surface, consequently decrease bleeding, and prevent a pouch formation. On the basis of the author's experiences, the MCM could represent for obstetrics a safe alternative to the surgical approach during CS, as it cut down operative time, surgical bleeding, BHF formation for the non-bladder flap formation, thus reducing the VUS surface. </...|$|E
40|$|Objective:To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} cost effectiveness of carotid surgery performed altering the perioperative protocol {{in an attempt to}} decrease resource utilisation. Setting:Department of vascular surgery in a large metropolitan teaching hospital in northern Italy. Design:Prospective, non-selective study. Materials and Methods:Three hundred and eighty carotid procedures were performed in 1995 on 343 patients (274 males, 69 females, mean age 68. 2 years, range 47 – 86 years). The most important cost containment measures, were: (i) limiting the use of contrast arteriography to cases of dubious ultrasonographic diagnosis; (ii) routine use of loco-regional anaesthesia; (iii) postoperative admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) only in selected cases; (iv) early postoperative discharge where possible. Results:Mortality was 0. 26 % and neurological morbidity 1. 58 %. General anaesthesia was required in eight patients (2. 1 %), and only seven patients (1. 8 %) were admitted postoperatively to the ICU. Arteriography was performed in 56 cases (14. 7 %). The average hospital stay was 5 days with a global cost of 43 036 ECU, as compared with a cost of 6764 ECU for patients treated traditionally with routine arteriography, general anaesthesia and routine ICU admission. Conclusions:Selective use of arteriography and ICU, routine use of <b>loco-regional</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and reduced hospital stay make it possible to lower the cost of cartid surgery without sacrificing quality...|$|E
30|$|The {{first case}} is a 42 -year-old para 2 {{suffering}} from symptoms of urinary incontinence since her last delivery 1  year before. A complete urogynaecologic evaluation revealed genuine stress incontinence, with no evidence of prolapse. The patient showed no improvement after a course of postpartum pelvic floor muscle training. A TOT was performed according to Delorme et al. [5], under <b>loco-regional</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Appropriate antibiotics were administered before starting the procedure according to our protocol. Surgery and post-operative course were both uneventful. The patient was discharged the same day after voiding satisfactorily. A preventive course of amoxicillin and clavulanate was prescribed (875  mg+ 125  mg BID for 7  days). A first post-operative evaluation after 10  days showed a healed flat suburethral scar, without tenderness or vaginal discharge. The patient was continent subjectively, with no voiding abnormalities. A follow-up evaluation after 5  weeks {{showed no sign of}} infection or erosion. Ten months later, the patient presented to our department complaining of a feeling of a foreign body in her vagina. A vaginal inspection revealed the presence of a 3 -cm-long erosion, with extrusion of the mesh {{at the site of the}} suburethral incision with purulent discharge. Under local anaesthesia, the wound edges were excised and the exteriorised portion of the mesh was removed. The mucosal edges were approximated by interrupted stitches of 2 - 0 Vicryl®. A positive cultural exam of the removed graft revealed the presence of Escherichia coli. A course of antibiotics was prescribed. At a check-up 5 months later, the patient was doing well and was still continent.|$|E
40|$|Abstract AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of sedation with benzodiazepines in a large population of patients undergoing oral surgery and age-related implications. METHODS: A group of 1 179 consecutive patients undergoing oral surgery in the Dental Clinic of the University of Padua between 2001 and 2003 was evaluated by analysing their anaesthesiological records. The patients were divided into 5 age groups. All were pre-sedated with chlordemethyldiazepam per os, while induction of maximum subjective tranquillity was obtained with fractionated doses of intravenous diazepam. Arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR), anxiety level, pathologies, drugs taken, types of intervention, techniques of <b>loco-regional</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> immediately preoperative AP and HR and tranquillity, intraoperative AP and HR, data regarding postoperative psychomotor recovery, complications and drugs used for the treatment of perioperative pain, were evaluated in each group. RESULTS: Most of the patients (679) were in the 45 - 64 year-old group. Cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive pathologies proved to be age-dependent. Control AP and HR respectively increased and decreased with age. The doses of chlordemethyldiazepam used induced age-dependent preoperative tranquillity levels. The doses of i. v. diazepam necessary to obtain maximal preoperative subjective tranquillity fell as a function of age. The AP and HR values respectively increased during intervention and decreased in the first hour of intervention. Normal psychomotor recovery was less evident in older patients. The most significant corrective intraoperative interventions consisted of the administration of sublingual hypotensive drugs and in the immediate treatment of some cases of orthostatic hypotension and vaso-vagal syncope. CONCLUSIONS: The sedation technique and the antistress procedures employed proved safe and the intra- or postoperative complications almost non-existent. The variations observed in the parameters considered are compatible with the greater age of the treated subjects. PMID: 16224375 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for using external applied energy to rectify or ameliorate musculoskeletal disorders has been explored for decades. A shock wave is a pressure disturbance: tissue effect is cavitation, producing microtrauma or microfracture and haematoma formation, inducing, as {{to date is}} thought, increase in vascularization, increased soft callus and faster enchondral ossification. Anaesthesiological interest in this field is focused in non-union or delayed osseous union, joint stiffness or osteochondrosis and femoral head necrosis in adults. Actually, because of the pain associated with high energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy on bones, anaesthesia is necessary, but, since almost all patients have no complaint after treatment, {{there is no need}} of postoperative analgesia. Therefore, short duration anaesthetic techniques and agents should be preferred. <b>Loco-regional</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> or general anaesthesia are both suitable to the purpose. Fifty patients have been treated nowadays in our Institution with shock wave therapy needing anaesthesia. 18 patients (36 %) received general anaesthesia. Since patient's stay in hospital was expected to be short, short duration agents have been used, avoiding those causing unpleasent side effects, first emesis. We used Propofol or Remifentanil by continuous infusion, titrated to maintain stable haemodynamics and an appropriate level of anaesthesia. The short duration of action of Propofol depends on its rapid elimination, whereas Remifentanil undergoes rapid biotransformation to minimally active metabolites. 32 patients (64 %) received regional anaesthesia. We avoided long acting agents or high concentration drugs. Spinal blocks have been performed with 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine; brachial plexus blocks, sciatic-femoral blocks and an epidural block have been performed with 0. 5 - 1 % xylocaine or 1 % mepivacaine. Shock Wave Therapy has been done during a 3 -day hospital stay. With suitable anaesthesiological treatment and preparation, almost all patients could be treated as outpatients or with an overnight hospital stay...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Perioperative {{analgesic}} {{management is}} mandatory in anaesthesia; {{the possibility to}} provide analgesia {{at the site of}} pain, with minimal impairment of other functions, is the rationale behind loco-regional anaesthetic (LRa) techniques. <b>Loco-regional</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> success is connected to optimal local anaesthetic distribution around the nerves; the real time sonographic visualization of the technique enhances the possibilities to make a more efficacious and safer block. Furthermore post-operative pain assessment in a patient where we are unable to communicate verbally is particularly difficult and an effective post-operative analgesia is essential. OBJECTIVES To design and test with a clinical trial, efficacy, safety and duration of three new different ultrasound-guided loco-regional techniques in dogs and one ultrasound-assisted neuraxial technique in the equine specie. LIST OF THE STUDIES STUDY n° 1 : Comparison between three different ultrasound-guided for radial, ulnar, medial, musculocutaneous (RUMM) nerves block approaches in dogs undergoing thoracic limb surgery. STUDY n° 2 : Ultrasound-guided femoral-obturator nerve in dogs undergoing TPLO surgery. STUDY n° 3 : A new approach to transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in dogs undergoing mastectomy. STUDY n° 4 : Ultrasound-assisted extradural technique in horse. STUDY DESIGN All the studies started from a prospective anatomical research. Randomized and prospective single blinded clinical trials (study 1 and 2). Prospective clinical trials (study 3 - 4). ANIMALS 1. Study n° 1 : 5 dog cadavers and 30 owner’s client dogs. 2. Study n° 2 : 6 dog cadavers and 20 owner’s client dogs. 3. Study n° 3 : 10 dog cadavers and 10 owner’s client dogs. 4. Study n° 4 : two horse’s tails obtained from the slaughterhouse, 15 experimental Standard bred horses, 20 owner’s client Warmblood horses. METHODOLOGY All the studies were divided in one or more anatomical studies and one clinical study. Anatomical study: dissections and ultrasound (US) scanning to gain three-dimensional and bi-dimensional anatomical knowledge of the interested region in order to find a target ultrasound window and to design an US-guided LRa needling technique. For the studies 1, 2, 3 a comparison between the sonoanatomy and the real anatomy was performed by evaluation of the spread after injection of new methylene blue solution around the nerves visualized by US. Clinical study: US-guided techniques developed during the anatomical studies were applied in order to evaluate the intra operative and post-operative analgesia provided from the LR anaesthesia. Intra-operative monitoring and post-operative pain were evaluated by a blind operator (study 1 - 2 - 3). RESULTS Study n° 1 Anatomical phase: opening the arm in the medial face, at gleno-humeral joint level, the four nerves appeared at the same deepness and held in the same intermuscular fascia; descending toward the elbow the radial nerve enters the intermuscular fascia and goes towards the lateral portion of the arm. The ultrasound images confirm the presence of the nerves around the axillary artery in the proximal approach called axillary approach (AGR). In the medial and lateral midhumeral approaches the radial nerve appeared at a different depth, in comparison to the other three nerves and near to the humerus. Clinical phase: intra operative fentanyl infusion resulted necessary in 5 / 10 dogs LGR, 0 / 9 MGR dogs and 0 / 10 dogs AGR belonging the respectively groups. Post-operative first rescue analgesia performed 2. 07 ± 1. 98 LGR, 4. 25 ± 1. 25 in MGR and 8. 6 ± 1. 15 hours after extubation for AGR. The execution of the block resulted easier in the AGR respect to the other groups. Study n° 2 Anatomical phase: femoral nerve (FN) and obturator nerve (ON) are present together at the level of L 6 th vertebral body and L 7 th transvers process. From the ultrasound study the two nerves appeared as two holes inside the iliopsoas muscle that diverge, moving the probe caudally. Both nerves were stained for more than 4 cm with a 0. 1 mL kg- 1 of new methylene blue solution injection. Clinical phase: intraoperative fentanyl infusion resulted necessary in 1 / 10 dogs belonging R 3 (ropivacaine 0. 3 %) and 3 / 10 dogs belonging R 5 (ropivacaine 0. 5 %). Post-operative first rescue analgesia performed 550. 9 ± 58. 52 minutes R 3, 664. 2 ± 151. 4 minutes R 5 {{from the end of the}} surgery (p= 0. 06). Study n° 3 Anatomical phase: the abdominal nerves (T 12 -T 13 -L 1 -L 2 -L 3 - l 4) appear to be very close dorsally, where they pass the aponeurosis of the transversus muscle in order to run over it and enter the fascia between the internal oblique and transversus muscle. The separation between the 2 muscle was identifiable in a US-window nominated as ‘target US pocket’. T 13, L 1, L 2, L 3, L 4 nerves resulted stained with 0. 2 mL kg- 1 of new methylene blue solution. Clinical phase: in 3 / 10 dogs where TAP block was performed at the ‘target US pocket’ with 0. 2 mL kg- 1 ropivacaine 0. 25 % 2 μ kg- 1 of fentanyl at T 1 was administered. Post operative pain score < 3 for the first 4 hours after the surgery in 10 / 10 dogs. Study n° 4 Anatomical phase: two peculiar US images were detected for last sacral bone and first intercoccygeal spaces. First intercoccygeal gave a peculiar image named ‘cat face’ and it was used as US target window to design a US-assisted epidural technique. The mean ± SD depths detected at the level of first and second intercoccygeal spaces were respectively 2. 79 ± 0. 27 cm and 2. 85 ± 0. 18. Clinical study n° 5 : In 100 % of the horses the ‘cat face’ was detected and in 20 / 20 horses epidural performed wit US-assisted technique result efficacy during laparoscopic surgery. The mean ± SD between the trained operator and untrained operator Δ (TO-UO) was 1. 08 ± 1. 06 cm. The mean ± SD between Δ (UO-US) was 2. 55 ± 1. 73 and the Δ(TO-US) was 1. 86 ± 1. 24. DISCUSSIONS The axillary approach resulted in an easier and more effective block compared to the other two and it was superior in terms of duration for the post-operative analgesia. The femoral-obturator approach provided an effective analgesia in dog undergoing TPLO surgery with both the ropivacaine concentration used. The block resulted capable to post pone a first rescue analgesia at least 5 hours after the end of the surgery. The new approach to transversus abdominis plane block in dogs undergoing mastectomy resulted efficacious and it might be a routinely analgesia technique in a dog with a history of mammary tumour. Ultrasound-assisted extradural technique in horse resulted feasible and it might increase the rate of success of neuroaxial anaesthesia in this species...|$|E
