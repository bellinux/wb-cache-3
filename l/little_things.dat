25|$|Throughout his career, Mussina also complemented his pure {{pitching}} ability {{by doing}} the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> well. He issued very few walks, held baserunners well, and fielded his position superbly.|$|E
25|$|And again I say, these <b>little</b> <b>things</b> {{that one}} does - considerate, compassionate, courageous - I guess it's pretty hard {{to be able to}} realize the impact they have.|$|E
6000|$|... "At my age," [...] {{the old man}} said, [...] "even a <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> upsets one, and {{the affair}} of {{yesterday}} was no <b>little</b> <b>thing.</b> I wonder much that the agitation did not kill me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Speaker (laughing). [...] "Tut, tut, {{never mind}} a <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> like that. I {{am sure that}} after all that we have gone through together, the House is quite agreed that a <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> like {{parliamentary}} procedure doesn't matter." ...|$|R
60|$|COLONEL. Excitable <b>little</b> <b>thing.</b> You don't {{understand}} her, Peachey.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1993 Carmody was {{the subject}} of a musical documentary, Blood Brothers - From <b>Little</b> <b>Things</b> Big Things Grow, by Rachel Perkins and {{directed}} by Trevor Graham, which explored Carmody's life, using music clips and historical footage.|$|E
25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some <b>little</b> <b>things</b> in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Esther!" [...] cried Ada, sinking on {{her knees}} beside it. [...] "Look here! Oh, Esther, my love, the <b>little</b> <b>thing!</b> The suffering, quiet, pretty <b>little</b> <b>thing!</b> I am so sorry for it. I am so sorry for the mother. I never saw a sight so pitiful as this before! Oh, baby, baby!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{one day a}} <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> {{happened}} that clothed itself in significance.|$|R
500|$|... "One of {{the most}} {{important}} things we were looking for in casting was the actors' ability to play the subtleties – the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> that a character doesn't say or do that create the edge, the things that get under your skin and spook you," [...] Morgan said about the auditions.|$|E
500|$|He talked {{openly in}} the music press about his problems, telling the NME: [...] "When I cut myself I feel so much better. All the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> {{that might have been}} {{annoying}} me seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain", and [...] "I'm {{the sort of person who}} wakes up in the morning and needs to pour a bottle down my throat".|$|E
500|$|Asked {{to choose}} {{the best player in}} history, Henderson declined, saying, [...] "There are guys who have done {{different}} things very well, but I don't know of anyone who mastered everything." [...] Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, [...] "I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. The <b>little</b> <b>things,</b> I probably mastered." [...] Of his various records and achievements, he values his career runs scored mark the most: [...] "You have to score to win." ...|$|E
60|$|When he {{was beside}} her, he felt very {{big and strong}} and brave and longed {{for a chance to}} show her how brave he was. She was such a timid <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> herself that the least <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> frightened her, and Johnny Chuck was glad that this was so, for it gave him a chance to protect her.|$|R
60|$|She affects not {{to notice}} him. Poor <b>little</b> <b>thing!</b> Hippolyte is distracted--annihilated--inconsolable and charming.|$|R
6000|$|So the <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> grew bigger. He {{was healthy}} and normal, ate regularly, slept long hours, {{and yet the}} growing <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> was {{becoming}} an obsession. Work performed. The phrase haunted his brain. He sat opposite Bernard Higginbotham at a heavy Sunday dinner over Higginbotham's Cash Store, {{and it was all}} he could do to restrain himself from shouting out:- ...|$|R
500|$|The episode's subplots, however, {{received}} mixed reviews. McNutt wrote that, while Tate {{had given}} a [...] "rather subtle and charming performance", the Nellie-Dwight subplot felt like [...] "a leftover idea" [...] from the previous season. Tedder, on the other hand, liked the Dwight-Nellie subplot for its silliness, concluding that [...] "ongoing plotlines are great, but it's still the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> on this show". Trammell felt that the joke involving font was [...] "cute", {{but he did not}} enjoy the rest, writing that [...] "the resulting antics just weren't that funny".|$|E
500|$|The Ring production, filmed for {{television}} in 1980, initially provoked controversy, but was celebrated after its final performance in 1980 with a 45-minute standing ovation. Chéreau disliked grand opera, but said: [...] "After Bayreuth, I {{felt the need}} to work on a theatrical project of some breadth... I have never put on <b>little</b> <b>things.</b> I am interested only in spectacles that rise above themselves". He first considered Goethe's Faust but then directed in 1981 Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt for Villeurbane and Paris, aiming at [...] "an incandescence of theatrical experience, a global spectacle".|$|E
500|$|The première {{took place}} 16 February 1925 {{at a concert}} of the [...] (SMI) at the Salle Érard in Paris. [...] The mélodies were {{performed}} by Jane Bathori and conducted by Darius Milhaud. [...] Delage had gotten Bathori to agree to perform it {{late in the year}} before. In a letter to her dated 27 September 1924, he wrote: [...] "My publisher had to send you my seven <b>little</b> <b>things</b> in the hope they would interest you.... They are a bit basic for your great virtuosity, but that could tempt you to do something good with them".|$|E
60|$|Patsy {{took the}} baby, a good <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> {{and placed it}} in its mother’s arms.|$|R
60|$|WELLWYN. [Applying the {{decanter}} to her dips.] Poor <b>little</b> <b>thing!</b> I'll {{try this}} hot tea.|$|R
60|$|JOB ARTHUR. Why, that's what I think myself, Mr. Gerald. It's such a <b>little</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
500|$|I can {{at times}} feel {{strongly}} the beauties, you describe, in themselves & for themselves — but more frequently all things appear little — all knowledge, {{that can be}} acquired, child's play — the universe itself—what but an immense heap of <b>little</b> <b>things?</b> — I can contemplate nothing but parts, & parts are all little — ! — My mind feels as if it ached to behold & know something great — something one & indivisible — {{and it is only}} in the faith of this that rocks or waterfalls, mountains or caverns give me the sense of sublimity or majesty! — But in this faith all things counterfeit infinity! ...|$|E
500|$|In February, Higgins {{had contributed}} a tribute song to the album, Cannot Buy My Soul, for noted {{indigenous}} singer, Kev Carmody, singing [...] "Droving Woman" [...] with musician Paul Kelly and group Augie March. On 7 July, she {{participated in the}} Live Earth concert in Sydney, performing her own set before joining Carmody, Kelly and vocalist John Butler on stage for the song [...] "From <b>Little</b> <b>Things</b> Big Things Grow". Emily Dunn in The Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] " [...] {{could have been the}} event's anthem". Rolling Stone's Dan Lander pointed out a highlight, when the [...] "whole crowd sung along– all eleven verses." ...|$|E
500|$|Lady Bracknell's line, [...] "A handbag?", {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most {{malleable}} in English drama, lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled. Edith Evans, both on stage and in the 1952 film, delivered the line loudly in a mixture of horror, incredulity and condescension. Stockard Channing, in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in 2010, hushed the line, in a critic's words, [...] "with a barely audible 'A handbag?', rapidly swallowed up with a sharp intake of breath. An understated take, to be sure, but with such a well-known play, packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with a life of their own, it's the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> that make a difference." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. [After a moment’s reflection.] No, I don’t {{think it}} is quite a <b>little</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{held out}} to you a slender hope," [...] said he. [...] "I told you that there was one <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> might save you. That hope has borne no fruit; the <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> I spoke of has not come to pass. It rested with Madonna Paola, here. She had it in her hands to effect your salvation, but she has refused. Your blood rests on her head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{seen some}} pretty cheerful funerals," [...] said Boardman. [...] "And it's this {{principle}} of steps, of degrees, {{of having to}} do this <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> and that <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> that keeps funerals from killing the survivors. I suppose this is worse than a funeral--look {{at it in the}} right light. You mourn as one without hope, don't you? Live through it too, I suppose." ...|$|R
500|$|... "The Box" [...] was co-written by co-executive {{producer}} Josh Singer {{and executive}} story editor Graham Roland, while being directed by [...] veteran Jeffrey Hunt. The episode {{was shot in}} the second half of July 2010. Hunt later tweeted on-set photos in January 2011. At San Diego Comic-Con International during the summer leading up to the season premiere, actress Jasika Nicole told the audience they would finally be able to see her character's apartment, which has previously been only alluded to in an early season two episode. She explained, [...] "It's really neat! [...] There's all these tiny <b>little</b> <b>things</b> that give you insight into how things are. [...] I know the color of (Astrid's) walls, so watch out!" ...|$|E
500|$|Nagarjuna {{added that}} the film's {{characters}} would reborn with no special purpose unlike other reincarnation films like Janaki Ramudu (1988), Arundhati (2009) and Magadheera (2009). Saran {{said in an interview}} that the film basically has a family-oriented theme and is about falling in love with [...] "small, <b>little</b> <b>things</b> that you sort of don't see every day, but are really, really important". Unlike other reincarnation based films, the film's story develops two separate themes— the relationship between reborn lovers, but also the relationship between reborn parents and their children. Naga Chaitanya acknowledged in an interview with The Hindu that the film's script might seem to have a few overly-convenient coincidences, but felt that Kumar's detailing in every scene made the script believable.|$|E
500|$|On the day [...] "Smile" [...] was released, Allen {{appeared}} on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge with DJ Jo Whiley, performing an acoustic version of [...] "Smile" [...] and {{a cover of}} The Kooks' song [...] "Naïve". At the Secret Garden Party, in September 2006, Allen made a rendition of the song and afterwards stated: [...] "The festival was well good, particularly as Lester, my ex, who I wrote 'Smile' about, and subsequently sold his story to the papers, had a tent called 'the shit tent' positioned directly opposite the main stage. So he and his new girlfriend had {{no option but to}} watch me perform to a couple of thousand people singing 'Smile' back to me. Oh, it's the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> eh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle, I {{am quite}} disappointed. Mrs. Lyons {{showed me the}} bear she has got tied up in their compound, {{and it is the}} most wretched <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> not bigger than Rover, papa's retriever, and it's full-grown. I thought bears were great fierce creatures, and this poor <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> seemed so restless and unhappy that I thought it quite a shame not to let it go." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mariquera = n. (or Maricada) A <b>little</b> <b>thing.</b> A non-transcendental fact. A {{synonym for}} Vaina (mildly profane).|$|R
