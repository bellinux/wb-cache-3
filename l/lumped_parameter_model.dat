50|$|Macro-level {{models are}} the {{mathematical}} model at system level, which defines {{the relationship among}} system input variables, system state variables, and system measures variables/outputs where the model is often a somewhat simplified representation of the system, for example a <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>model.</b> The trade-off is increased coverage with possibly reducing accuracy of a particular degradation mode. Where this trade-off is permissible, faster prototyping may be the result. However, where systems are complex (e.g., a gas turbine engine), even a macro-level model may be a rather time-consuming and labor-intensive process. As a result, macro-level models may not be available in detail for all subsystems. The resulting simplifications need to {{be accounted for by}} the uncertainty management.|$|E
50|$|SELDM is a <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>model</b> {{because the}} highway site, the {{upstream}} basin, and the lake basin each are {{represented as a}} single homogeneous unit.

Use of the lumped parameter approach facilitates rapid specification of model parameters to develop planning-level estimates with available data. The approach allows for parsimony in the required inputs to and outputs from the model and flexibility {{in the use of}} the model. For example, SELDM can be used to model runoff from various land covers or land uses by using the highway-site definition as long as representative water quality and impervious-fraction data are available.|$|E

The piping system of a plant is not always {{the same as that of}} a test site. Then it is important to evaluate the effect of piping systems on surge characteristics in centrifugal compressors.

40|$|Modelling of {{heterogeneous}} {{systems is}} always a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. Most libraries of object-oriented, equation-based, multi-physical simulation tools are based on <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> description <b>models.</b> However, there are different ways of including spatial dependency of certain variables in the model. One way that might be quite difficult is to manually discretize the model into an interconnection of <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>models.</b> This approach can get very time-consuming and is always sensitive to modelling or identification errors. To avoid these issues, we try {{to take advantage of}} the well-established methods for automatically discretizing a distributed <b>parameter</b> <b>model</b> for example by means of Finite Element methods. However, to achieve a suffiently good approximation, these methods very often result in large-scale dynamic systems that can not be handled within equation-based simulators. To overcome this drawback there exist different approaches within the literature. On the basis of deformable mechanical structures, one way of including distributed <b>parameter</b> <b>models</b> into libraries of <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>models</b> for the purpose of common simulation is pointed out in the present paper. For the implementation of the resulting models the authors take advantage of equation-based modelling libraries as new models can here easily be integrated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{extends the}} {{so-called}} Effective Process Time (EPT) approach to single server flowlines with finite buffers and blocking. The {{power of the}} EPT approach is that it quantifies vari-ability in workstation process times without the need to identify each of the contributing disturbances, and that it directly provides an algorithm for the actual computation of EPTs. It is shown that EPT real-izations can be simply obtained from arrival and departure times of lots, by using sample path equations. The measured EPTs {{can be used for}} bottleneck analysis and for <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>modeling.</b> Simulation experiments show that for <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>modeling</b> of flowlines with finite buffers, in addition to the mean and variance, offset is also a relevant parameter of the process time distribution.

The delay time is determined by the sum of all effective process times of the nonbottleneck workstations. The advantage of the application of the <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>model</b> is that the variability of the total line is determined by a measurement at the operating point of the actual manufacturing line. This variability depends upon the operating point. Examples show that this dependency is not too strong for lines with a distinct bottleneck workstation in the actual line...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of back-supported buffer plates comprising a solid face sheet and foam core backing impacted by {{a column of}} high velocity particles (sand slug) is investigated via a <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>model</b> and coupled discrete/continuum simulations. The buffer plate is either resting (unattached) or attached to a rigid stationary foundation. The <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>model</b> is used to construct maps of the regimes of behaviour with axes of {{the ratio of the}} height of the sand slug to core thickness and the normalised core strength. Four regimes of behaviour are identified based on whether the core compression ends prior to the densification of the sand slug or vice versa. Coupled discrete/continuum simulations are also reported and compared with the <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>model.</b> While the model predicted regimes of behaviour are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, the <b>lumped</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>model</b> is unable to predict the momentum transmitted to the supports as it neglects the role of elasticity in both the buffer plate and the sand slug. The numerical calculations show that the momentum transfer is minimised for intermediate values of the core strength when the so-called “soft-catch” mechanism is at play. In this regime the bounce-back of the sand slug is minimised which reduces the momentum transfer. For high values of the core strength, the {{response of}} the buffer plate resembles a rigid plate with nearly no impulse mitigation while at low values of core strength, a slap event occurs when the face sheet impinges against the foundation due to full densification of the foam core. This slap event results in a significant enhancement of the momentum transfer to the foundation. The results demonstrate that appropriately designed buffer plates have potential as impulse mitigators in landmine loading situations...|$|E
