[...] "It took me a half-hour to figure out they were giving me distance and direction," [...] Hambleton explained. [...] "No. 1 at Tucson National is 408 yards running southeast.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{was directed by}} Doug Nichol and filmed in Sardinia from 5-8 July 1999. Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also pretty easy to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People {{came up to me and}} told me how great and how sexy it was. They also told me I looked really healthy, but how wrong they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and although I was slim at the time, that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet was always going to <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} part of Girard's career, there seemed no place for {{beneficial}} imitation. Jean-Michel Oughourlian objected that [...] "imitation can be totally peaceful and beneficial; I don't believe that I am the other, I don't want to take [...] his place [...] This imitation can <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> become sensitive to social and political problems." [...] Rebecca Adams argued that because Girard's theories fixated on violence, he was creating a 'scapegoat' himself with his own theory: the scapegoat of positive mimesis. [...] Adams proposed a reassessment of Girard's theory that includes an account of loving mimesis or, as she preferred to call it, creative mimesis.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, Coltrane had a {{religious}} experience {{that may have}} helped him overcome the heroin addiction and alcoholism he had struggled with since 1948. In the liner notes of A Love Supreme, Coltrane states that, in 1957, [...] "I experienced, {{by the grace of}} God, a spiritual awakening which was to <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music." [...] The liner notes appear to mention God in a Universalist sense, and do not advocate one religion over another. Further evidence of this universal view regarding spirituality {{can be found in the}} liner notes of Meditations (1965), in which Coltrane declares, [...] "I believe in all religions." ...|$|E
2500|$|People {{gather at}} the site of the execution, lamenting that a queen's death will bring shame upon England. Mary enters and says her farewells to the crowd, which {{includes}} Talbot, telling them she will be going to a better life. She calls them to a final prayer (Mary, with Chorus: Deh! Tu di un úmile preghiera il suono odi / [...] "Ah! May Thou hear the sound of our humble prayer") and, together, she and the crowd pray for God's mercy. When Cecil arrives to tell her that the time for her execution has come, he informs her that Elizabeth has granted her final wishes, including allowing Anna to accompany her to the scaffold. Then Mary offers a pardon to the queen (Mary, Anna, Talbot, Cecil, chorus: Di un cor che more reca il perdóno / [...] "From a heart that is dying, may pardon be granted"). Leicester comes to bid her farewell. Both are distraught and he expresses outrage. Mary asks him to support her at the hour of her death and protests her innocence once again (Aria: Ah! se un giorno da queste ritorte / [...] "Ah! Though one day from this prison your arm wanted to abduct me, now you <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> my death"). She is then led to the scaffold.|$|E

"As {{long as he}} had his mistresses, {{things were}} better, but since the last one was exiled because she allowed herself to be insolent towards the King, {{and he has not}} {{provided}} himself with a new one, his temperament has grown worse, and I have daily been subjected to outbursts because of this, which has occurred even in front of the staff. This hostility have increased so much during the winter that I have reached the end of my patience." [...] She expressed her view upon love and sexuality and when Gustav III studied certain letters after his late mother in the company of others, as they contained information regarding the alleged love affair between his mother Queen Louisa Ulrika av Count Carl Gustaf Tessin, and the complaints from Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden over the attention Tessin gave his consort:" [...] It is undoubtedly so, that these papers can give reason for reflection; it does <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> consider how easily a poor woman is judged and how unfortunate it is to have a heart filled with emotion, for a tender nature is a misfortune as well as a blessing, and no human can resist the power of love, even though friendship must at times be the comfort for the wise one, yes, nothing is more true than the inscription who were once placed upon the image of God of Love: 'Eho you are, her is your true master, he has been, he is and always will be.' You have to admit, my dear friend, that woman is truly an unhappy creature: while men have their complete freedom, she is always burdened by prejudice and circumstance; you may say, that men also have that hindrance, but it is not in equal degree. I am convinced that most women would ask for nothing more than to be transformed to men to escape the unhappy bondage and enjoy their full freedom." ...|$|E
