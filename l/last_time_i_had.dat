500|$|Jonathan Meades ate at The Restaurant for The Times in late 1993, {{and noted}} the {{evolution}} of some dishes and sauces from White's days at Harveys. These included making the pig's trotter dish more [...] "delicate", and only using the white part of the leeks in a pressed leek and langoustine starter. Meades also noticed that White had [...] "tempered" [...] the sauces served with meat and fish, referring to their previous versions as [...] "assault courses". He praised a new roasted salmon and tapenade dish, calling it [...] "of breathtaking quality", {{and the work of}} pastry chef Roger Pizey. Meades later listed The Restaurant as the second best in the country at the end of 1994, placed only behind Phil Vickery, having recently taken over from Gary Rhodes, at the Castle Hotel, Taunton. He gave both restaurants an equal nine stars out of ten. When celebrity chef Keith Floyd listed his five favourite restaurants for The Guardian in September 1994, he included The Restaurant in third place, saying [...] "The food is exquisite. He's a difficult bastard, but I like him. He came through le Gavroche, through Albert Roux, and he's developed on from there. Along with Albert, I think he's one of the finest cooks in the country. <b>Last</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a bean and langoustine soup which was sensational, outstanding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Addams {{married his}} second wife, Barbara Barb (Estelle B. Barb), in 1954. A {{practicing}} lawyer, she [...] "combined Morticia-like looks with diabolical legal scheming," [...] by which she wound up controlling [...] "The Addams Family" [...] television and film franchises and persuaded {{her husband to}} give away other legal rights. At one point, she got her husband {{to take out a}} US $100,000 insurance policy. Addams consulted a lawyer on the sly, who later humorously wrote: [...] "I told him the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> word of such a move was in a picture called Double Indemnity starring Barbara Stanwyck, which I called to his attention." [...] In the movie, Stanwyck's character plotted her husband's murder. The couple divorced in 1956.|$|E
2500|$|I was to {{have dinner}} that night with [...] Cadogan. As I lay in my bath, I {{reflected}} that the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him {{had been in his}} room at the Foreign Office when I had handed him my letter of resignation from the Diplomatic Service. [...] It seemed a long time ago. [...] Looking back on the few but crowded years between, it occurred to me forcibly how fortunate I had been in my decision and how lucky not to miss the experiences which had fallen to my lot in the intervening space of time. To me, it was not disagreeable to look forward to a future of uncertainty and insecurity, with none of the slow inevitability of a career in the Government service; to feel myself, in however small a way, the master of my destiny. With my left foot I turned the hot-water tap full on and wallowed contentedly.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{forgotten}} them. I am not without feeling. You do not understand. Since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been home this <b>last</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> realized {{more than ever}} that I could not live away from my home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I am {{justified}} in answering yes. But <b>I</b> may <b>have</b> mistrusted, too, on my part. No matter just now. We were {{speaking of the}} Junction <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> passed hours there since the day before yesterday." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remained}} in London two days, {{and on the}} third went down to Sanstead to see Audrey for the <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made my decision.|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s a funny {{feeling and}} I can’t explain it, {{but it always}} means good luck. <b>Last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> it an aunt o’ mine swallered ’er false teeth and left me five ’undred pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't feel {{flattered by}} it, Mr. Nevitt," [...] Gwendoline {{answered}} coldly, holding out her gloved hand {{to him with}} marked disinclination. [...] "I thought <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> said good-bye to you for good and for ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Tappitt, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to {{say good-bye}} to you in that way in your own house, of course it must be for the <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not meant to offend you, and I don't think I've given you ground for offence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not sure, Countess Katarina--since {{we are to}} be ceremonious to each other--that I {{do quite}} know, for since I {{returned}} from France <b>last</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seldom understood you; one moment you seem to me just as you used to be, at another you hold me at a distance, as if I were well-nigh a stranger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{could expect}} no better," [...] said I, [...] "but I {{think you might}} {{try to be a}} little kind to me for the last end of it. I see not why you should be harsh. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> loved you very well, Catriona--no harm that I should call you so for the <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done the best that I could manage, I am trying the same still, and only vexed that I can do no better. It is a strange thing to me that you can take any {{pleasure}} to be hard to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur's {{memory has}} soon returned," [...] he answered, smiling. [...] "I have been chief maitre d'hotel {{in the cafe}} there for some years. The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the honor of serving {{monsieur}} {{there was only a}} few weeks ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{can assure}} you, Julia,' said the Colonel, 'you are {{perfectly}} right. My friend the Counsellor {{is a dangerous}} person; the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the pleasure of seeing him he was closeted with a fair lady who had granted him a tete-a-tete at eight in the morning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{likewise}} declare, on {{the word}} of a dying man, that the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the honour to see H.R.H. Charles, Prince of Wales, he told me from his own mouth, and bid me assure his friends from him, {{that he was a}} member of the Church of England.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} to think. Perhaps {{this is the}} <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> any {{decision}} to make for you, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> rather you should make your own choice; nor, indeed, am I sure of my own wishes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Madam,’ {{returned}} the Baronet, ‘when I tore up my papers, I promised your good husband to concern myself no more with your affairs; and I assure {{you for the}} <b>last</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no desire to judge you.’ ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was weak}} {{for want of}} food, for the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> eaten was {{yesterday}} at noon, at Mondolfo; and then but little. Yet all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> this day were some bunches of grapes that I stole in passing from a vineyard and ate as I trotted on along that eternal Via Aemilia.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Barbara, reflectively. [...] "I really don't {{know why}} I shouldn't, but I don't. She {{certainly}} poses too much, and the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{the pleasure of}} listening {{to her at the}} Wheelers' house she patronized me and the country too graciously. The country can get along without her commendation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, {{with a dry}} smile, [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to load {{three shots}} as quickly as that was at rather larger game. It was at elephants. I killed them all three as dead as I killed those woodcocks; but it very nearly went the other way, I can tell you; I mean that they very nearly killed me." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the left}} of the court was {{formerly}} a large grotto and curious water- works; and in a house, or shed, or part of the building, which opened with two folding-doors, like a coach-house, a large equestrian statue of one of the ancestors of the family in complete armour, as also another of a Roman Emperor in brass. But the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the curiosity to see this house, I missed that part; so that I supposed they were removed.|$|E

'As {{it is the}} <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> the honour,' she said, 'and as {{you have}} spoken of not knowing what I am, and also of the {{foundation}} of my influence here, you may now {{know that it is}} founded in a common cause.

60|$|This {{excellent}} Person, one of {{my earliest}} and dearest friends, died in the year 1835. We were under-graduates together of the same year, at the same college, and companions in many a delightful ramble through his own romantic country of North Wales. Much of {{the latter part of}} his life he passed in comparative solitude; which I know was often cheered by remembrance of our youthful adventures, and of the beautiful regions which, at home and abroad, we had visited together. Our long friendship was never subject to a moment's interruption,--and, while revising these volumes for the <b>last</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been so often reminded of my loss, with a not unpleasing sadness, that I trust the Reader will excuse this passing mention of a Man who well deserves from me something more than so brief a notice. Let me only add, that during the middle part of his life he resided many years (as Incumbent of the Living) at a Parsonage in Oxfordshire, which is the subject of the seventh of the 'Miscellaneous Sonnets,' Part III.|$|R
60|$|Well, as I say, I hadn't {{been expecting}} that bell to hush things up to any great extent. Nor did it. The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard it, I {{had been in}} my room {{on the other side}} of the house, and even so it had hoiked me out of bed as if {{something}} had exploded under me. Standing close to it like this, I got the full force and meaning of the thing, and I've never heard anything like it in my puff.|$|E
6000|$|... "After that I {{put it to}} music. I {{played it}} on the piano, and guessed the playing of it on full orchestras and blaring bands. I chanted it, I sang it-epic, lyric, comic; and, after a weary long while, of course I slept {{in the midst of}} it, and knew not that I slept until I awoke at twelve to-day. The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard the clock strike was six. Six {{unbroken}} hours is a capital prize for me in the sleep lottery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is a dictum of old Walters, the Moorworth doctor, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{anything}} to do with him, when I was a small child. I suppose I remembered it for its oracular sound, and because I was not intended to listen. He was talking over with Markham some illness I had just got through, and wound up with, [...] "He may be healthy and active now; but he has no constitution, {{there is a tendency to}} low fever, and if he meets with any severe illness, it will go hard with him."' ...|$|E
6000|$|I trust, sir, {{this is the}} <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> {{to trouble}} you with these twopenny concerns. But until some step is taken by the three Powers, or until <b>I</b> <b>have</b> quite {{exhausted}} your indulgence, I shall continue to report our scandals as they arise. Once more, one thing or other: Either what I write is false, and I should be chastised as a calumniator; or else it is true, and these officials are unfit for their position.--I am, etc., ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{my hand in}} a Mugger's mouth," [...] {{said one}} of the Englishmen, stooping down (he was the man who had built the bridge), [...] "it was when I was about five years old--coming down the river by boat to Monghyr. I was a Mutiny baby, as they call it. Poor mother was in the boat, too, and she often told me how she fired dad's old pistol at the beast's head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed she is, Betty, {{almost as}} {{beautiful}} as you are," [...] said Isaac. [...] "She is tall and very fair for an Indian. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> something to tell about her more interesting than that. Since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been with the Wyandots this <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> discovered {{a little of the}} jealously guarded secret of Myeerah's mother. When Tarhe and his band of Hurons lived in Canada their home was in the Muskoka Lakes region on the Moon river. The old warriors tell wonderful stories of the beauty of that country. Tarhe took captive some French travellers, among them a woman named La Durante. She had a beautiful little girl. The prisoners, except this little girl, were released. When she grew up Tarhe married her. Myeerah is her child. Once Tarhe took his wife to Detroit and she was seen there by an old Frenchman who went crazy over her and said she was his child. Tarhe never went to the white settlements again. So you see, Myeerah is from a great French family on her mother's side, as this is old Frenchman was probably Chevalier La Durante, and Myeerah's grandfather." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, this is {{my second}} journey. I hope I shall come no more. We get a little extra pay and are better fed than we are with the regiment, {{and we have no}} drill; but then it is sad. <b>Last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> one with me who had left his wife and family behind; he was always sad, he talked to me {{sometimes}} of them, {{there was no one else}} to talk to. He was here for life, and he knew he should never see them again. She was young and would marry again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Batterbury {{shook his}} head mournfully. [...] "I regret to say, not quite so well as her friends could wish," [...] he answered. [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the {{pleasure}} of seeing her ladyship, she looked so yellow {{that if we had}} been in Jamaica I should have said {{it was a case of}} death in twelve hours. I respectfully endeavored to impress upon her ladyship the necessity of keeping the functions of the liver active by daily walking exercise; time, distance, and pace being regulated with proper regard to her age--you understand me?--of course, with proper regard to her age." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has driven}} {{many of the}} most respectable of our enemies into our arms, sir. We have never {{considered}} you a direct enemy, though unhappily inclining too much against us; 'but this will determine Sir Hugh,' said the commander-in-chief in our closing interview--I suppose you know, my dear father, that all your old friends, knowing what has happened, insist on calling you Sir Hugh. I assure you, I never open my lips on the subject; and yet Lord Howe drank to the health of Sir Hugh Willoughby, openly at his own table, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the honour to dine with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The only {{trouble is}} that I chose to go away this morning without telling him where I was going. Then I owned {{one-half}} of the wood-lot, with all there is or may be on it, and since it was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> {{the right to do}} anything regarding it without his knowledge, I refused to tell him where I was going. But now that he owns an equal share with you, Mr. Simpson and me, he will have a perfect right to question me." ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{political}} {{history of the}} United States, an event has happened of ominous import to fifteen slaveholding States. The State {{of which we are}} citizens has been always understood to have to have deliberately fixed its purpose whenever that event should happen. Feeling an assurance of what will be the action of the State, I consider it my duty, without delay, to prepare to obey its wishes. That preparation is made by the resignation of the office <b>I</b> <b>have</b> held. For the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> as a Judge of the United States, administered the laws of the United States, within the limits of the State of South Carolina. While thus acting in obedience to a sense of duty, I cannot be indifferent to the emotions it must produce. That department of Government which. <b>I</b> believe, <b>has</b> best maintained its integrity and preserved its purity, has been suspended. So far as I am concerned, the Temple of Justice, raised under the Constitution of the United States, is now closed. If it shall be never again opened, I thank God that its doors have been closed before its altar has been desecrated with sacrifices to tyranny.|$|R
6000|$|It is {{my belief}} {{that there are some}} [...] "national" [...] traits and things {{scattered}} about the world that are mere superstitions, frauds that have lived so long that they have the solid look of facts. One of them is the dogma that the French are the only chaste people in the world. Ever since I arrived in France this <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been accumulating doubts about that; and before I leave this sunny land again I will gather in a few random statistics and psychologize the plausibilities out of it. If people are to come over to America and find fault with our girls and our women, and psychologize every little thing they do, and try to teach them how to behave, and how to cultivate themselves up to where one cannot tell them from the French model, I intend to find out whether those missionaries are qualified or not. A nation ought always to examine into this detail before engaging the teacher for good. This last one has let fall a remark which renewed those doubts of mine when I read it: ...|$|R
