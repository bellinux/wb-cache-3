The nanocapsule consists of two nanotubes of different diameters joined with each other, forming T-junction. The bigger nanotube—(20.20) presents the area of methane storage.

The position of the K@C 601 +ion in the <b>locking</b> <b>chamber</b> is ruled by the electric field action and defines the state of the chamber—opened or closed access for methane molecules into the nanocapsule.|$|E

50|$|Enlarged Double Lock No. 23, Old Erie Canal is a {{historic}} Erie canal lock located at Rotterdam in Schenectady County, New York. It was built in 1841-1842 {{as part of the}} First Enlargement. It is built entirely of large cut limestone blocks, laid regular ashlar, and mortared with hydraulic cement. The Northeast <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> is 110 ft long and 18 ft wide; the Southwest <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> is 220 ft long and 18 to 20 ft wide; and the Center pier is 100 ft long and 26 ft wide. The Southwest <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> was expanded in 1889-1890. Lock 23 fell into disuse after the opening of the New York State Barge Canal in 1918. The <b>lock</b> <b>chambers</b> contain no water and the area is open as a local park. The site was reclaimed and stabilized by local volunteers starting in 1999. A replica of a board and batten locktender's hut was constructed between 2000 and 2003 by students from the Union College Department of Civil Engineering.|$|R

40|$|The San Antonio River Authority (SARA) {{initiated}} {{a project to}} extend tour boat navigation approximately 7, 000 feet upstream on the San Antonio River. To make {{this section of the}} river navigable, a small dam and parallel lock system will be built to transfer vessels between lower pool elevation of 631. 2 feet and upper pool elevation of 640. 0 ft. The hydraulic locks must transfer tour boats quickly, efficiently, comfortably and safely using available river flow. A physical model study was required to verify and refine the operational suitability of the proposed side-port lock system. The model was constructed and studied at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. The scope {{of the study was to}} build a physical model of one lock and its associated filling and emptying system and to test its operation on a scale model of the design vessel. The model was built at a scale of 1 : 8 and included a single <b>lock</b> <b>chamber,</b> a side-port gallery to convey water into and out of the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber,</b> and the upstream and downstream sluice gates. Two series of tests were conducted and at least one of the following parameters was modified during each test: The gate opening height, the gate opening duration, the gate opening as a function of time, the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> floor level, and the loading of the vessel. For each test, headwater, tailwater, water surface level in the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> and the opening rate of the sluice gate were recorded. The performance of the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> was determined qualitatively by inspection of the vessel reaction and the flow patterns inside the gallery and the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber.</b> The second and more extensive series of tests were videotaped.

40|$|Locks are key {{structures}} for {{the accessibility of}} ports and navigable waterways. The filling of the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> {{has to be done}} with special precautions, taking into account the forces experienced by the moored vessels during the levelling process. In case of filling through lock gate openings, one of the potential methods to minimize the hydrodynamic forces on the ships, is to insert breaking logs at the downstream side of the gate openings, aiming at an enhanced spreading and energy dissipation of the filling jets. To investigate the influence of the breaking log configuration on the induced flow patterns and their role in the energy dissipation of a turbulent filling jet, Flanders Hydraulics Research has defined a project in which both physical model research (phase 1) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (phase 2) are adopted. This report pertains to phase 2 of the project and concerns the CFD modelling of the flow pattern in a <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> during <b>lock</b> filling. A model was set up of a schematic <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> with mitre gates. In the lock gates, in total six openings are present. Non-stationary simulations were performed using the volume of fluid method, to take the influence of the motion of the free surface into account. Different configurations of the opening geometry were investigated: one in which the openings are aligned perpendicular to the lock gate and one in which the openings are aligned with the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> symmetry axis. For each of these configurations, the flow pattern in the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> is modelled both for a configuration with and a configuration without breaking logs. Also the translation waves in the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber</b> are visualised. Additionally, for the configuration with the openings aligned with the channel axis and without breaking logs, the influence of closing the valves of all openings with 50 % was investigated in an additional simulation. The simulations show that the influence of the geometry of the openings on the occurring flow patterns is relatively limited. Breaking logs on the other hand are shown to be effective in reducing the flow velocities in the <b>lock</b> <b>chamber.</b> At the same time, neither changes in the geometry of the opening nor the addition of breaking logs have a strong effect on the filling efficiency of the lock. nrpages: 35 + 50 (appendices) status: publishe...|$|R
