5|$|SCI {{is present}} in about 2% of all cases of blunt force trauma. Anyone who has {{undergone}} force sufficient to cause a thoracic spinal injury is {{at high risk for}} other injuries also. In 44% of SCI cases, other serious injuries are sustained at the same time; 14% of SCI patients also suffer head trauma or facial trauma. Other commonly associated injuries include chest trauma, abdominal trauma, pelvic fractures, and <b>long</b> <b>bone</b> fractures.|$|E
5|$|The innominate {{is known}} from seven examples, {{but most are}} quite incomplete. It {{includes}} a narrow ilium and long ischium. The ischial tuberosity, a narrow rough piece of bone in most placentals, is broad and smooth in Plesiorycteropus. With 17 specimens, the femur is the best represented <b>long</b> <b>bone.</b> It is distinctive in its long neck, similar only to the gymnure Echinosorex according to MacPhee. A projection known as the third trochanter is larger in P.madagascariensis. The tibia and fibula are extensively fused into a tibiofibula, of which eight examples are known. This bone resembles that of armadillos in the extensive fusion, the compression of the shaft of the tibia, the narrowness of the articulation surface at the distal end, and the broad space between the bones. Unlike in armadillos, the tibia and fibula are not inclined relative to each other, but about parallel. The astragalus, which is known from four examples, is wide and short and contains a uniquely large posteromedial process. Seven metapodials (middle hand or foot bones) are known, rather variable in size, but MacPhee was unable to separate metacarpals (from the hand) and metatarsals (from the foot). All are rather short and are broad proximally and narrow distally. Among the few known phalanges, the proximal phalange is shorter than the middle one and the distal phalanges are narrow and clawlike.|$|E
25|$|The {{head of a}} bone usually {{refers to}} the {{proximal}} end of the bone. The shaft refers to the elongated sections of <b>long</b> <b>bone,</b> and the neck the segment between the head and shaft (or body). The end of the <b>long</b> <b>bone</b> opposite to the head {{is known as the}} base.|$|E
50|$|Type II can {{be further}} subclassified into groups A, B, and C, which are {{distinguished}} by radiographic evaluation of the <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> and ribs. Type IIA demonstrates broad and short <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> with broad and beaded ribs. Type IIB demonstrates broad and short <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> with thin ribs that {{have little or no}} beading. Type IIC demonstrates thin and longer <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> with thin and beaded ribs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Long</b> <b>bones</b> are {{generally}} larger in males than in females {{within a given}} population. Muscle attachment sites on <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> are often more robust in males than in females, reflecting a difference in overall muscle mass and development between sexes. Sexual dimorphism in the <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> is commonly characterized by morphometric or gross morphological analyses.|$|R
50|$|The {{periosteum}} is a membrane {{that covers}} the outer surface of all bones, except at the joints of <b>long</b> <b>bones.</b> Endosteum lines the inner surface of the medullary cavity of all <b>long</b> <b>bones.</b>|$|R

25|$|OI Type V {{leads to}} {{calcification}} of the membrane {{between the two}} forearm bones, {{making it difficult to}} turn the wrist. Another symptom is abnormally large amounts of repair tissue (hyperplasic callus) at the site of fractures. Other features of this condition include radial head dislocation, <b>long</b> <b>bone</b> bowing, and mixed hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|A <b>long</b> <b>bone</b> is {{one that}} is {{cylindrical}} in shape, being longer than it is wide. However, the term describes the shape of a bone, not its size which is relative. Long bones are found in the arms (humerus, ulna, radius) and legs (femur, tibia, fibula), {{as well as in the}} fingers (metacarpals, phalanges) and toes (metatarsals, phalanges). Long bones function as levers; they move when muscles contract.They are responsible for the body's height.|$|E
5000|$|All bones possess larger {{or smaller}} {{foramina}} (openings) for {{the entrance of}} blood-vessels; these are known as the nutrient foramina, and are particularly large in the shafts of the larger <b>long</b> <b>bones,</b> where they lead into a nutrient canal, which extends into the medullary cavity. The nutrient arteries along with veins pass through this canal.A nutrient canal is found in <b>long</b> <b>bones,</b> in the mandible [...] and in dental alveoli. In <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> the nutrient canal {{is found in the}} shaft.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Long</b> <b>bones</b> are {{characterized}} by a shaft, the diaphysis, that is much longer than its width; and by an epiphysis, a rounded head {{at each end of}} the shaft. They are made up mostly of compact bone, with lesser amounts of marrow, located within the medullary cavity, and areas of spongy, cancellous bone at the ends of the bones. [...] Most bones of the limbs, including those of the fingers and toes, are <b>long</b> <b>bones.</b> The exceptions are the eight carpal bones of the wrist, the seven articulating tarsal bones of the ankle and the sesamoid bone of the kneecap. <b>Long</b> <b>bones</b> such as the clavicle, that have a differently shaped shaft or ends are also called modified <b>long</b> <b>bones.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are two {{congenital}} disorders of the <b>long</b> <b>bones.</b> In {{a disorder}} known as rachitis fetalis anularis {{the ends of}} the <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> (epiphyses) are enlarged. Another disorder is known as rachitis fetalis micromelica {{in which there is a}} deficiency in the growth (as a shortness) of the bones.|$|R
25|$|The {{piezoelectric}} effect is generally thought {{to act as}} a biological force sensor. This effect was exploited by research conducted at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which established that sustained application of electrical potential could stimulate both resorption and growth (depending on the polarity) of bone in-vivo. Further studies in the 1990s provided the mathematical equation to confirm <b>long</b> <b>bone</b> wave propagation as to that of hexagonal (Class 6) crystals.|$|E
25|$|Fractures {{and their}} {{underlying}} causes can be investigated by X-rays, CT scans and MRIs. Fractures are described by their location and shape, and several classification systems exist, {{depending on the}} location of the fracture. A common <b>long</b> <b>bone</b> fracture in children is a Salter–Harris fracture. When fractures are managed, pain relief is often given, and the fractured area is often immobilised. This is to promote bone healing. In addition, surgical measures such as internal fixation may be used. Because of the immobilisation, people with fractures are often advised to undergo rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimation}} {{of age in}} bioarchaeology and osteology actually refers to an approximation of skeletal or biological age-at-death. The primary assumption in age estimation is that an individual's skeletal age is closely associated with their chronological age. Age estimation can be based on patterns of growth and development or degenerative changes in the skeleton. Many methods tracking these types of changes have been developed {{using a variety of}} skeletal series. For instance, in children age is typically estimated by assessing their dental development, ossification and fusion of specific skeletal elements, or <b>long</b> <b>bone</b> length. In adults, degenerative changes to the pubic symphysis, the auricular surface of the ilium, the sternal end of the 4th rib, and dental attrition are commonly used to estimate skeletal age.|$|E
5000|$|At birth, {{only the}} metaphyses of the [...] "long bones" [...] are present. The <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> {{are those that}} grow {{primarily}} by elongation at an epiphysis {{at one end of}} the growing <b>bone.</b> The <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> include the femurs, tibias, and fibulas of the lower limb, the humeri, radii, and ulnas of the upper limb (arm + forearm), and the phalanges of the fingers and toes. The <b>long</b> <b>bones</b> of the leg comprise nearly half of adult height. The other primary skeletal component of height is the spine and skull.|$|R

25|$|A growth {{center is}} located in the head of each mandibular condyle before an {{individual}} reaches maturity. This growth center consists of hyaline cartilage underneath the periosteum on the articulating surface of the condyle. This is the last growth center of bone in the body and is multidirectional in its growth capacity, unlike a typical <b>long</b> <b>bone.</b> This area of cartilage within the bone grows in length by appositional growth as the individual grows to maturity. Over time, the cartilage is replaced by bone, using endochondral ossification. This mandibular growth center in the condyle allows the increased length of the mandible needed for the larger permanent teeth, {{as well as for the}} larger brain capacity of the adult. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face, and thus is charted and referred to during orthodontic therapy. When an individual reaches full maturity, the growth center of bone within the condyle has disappeared.|$|E
500|$|Bonnet's flag is {{traditionally}} {{represented as a}} white skull above a horizontal <b>long</b> <b>bone</b> between a heart and a dagger, all on a black field. Despite the frequent appearance of this flag in modern pirate literature, no known early-Georgian period source describes any such device, much less attributes it to Bonnet. This version of Bonnet's flag {{is probably one of}} a number of pirate flags appearing on an undated manuscript with unknown provenance in Britain's National Maritime Museum, which was donated by Dr. Philip Gosse in 1939. Bonnet's crew and contemporaries generally referred to him flying a [...] "bloody flag", which likely means a dark red flag. There is also a report from the 1718 Boston News-Letter of Bonnet flying a death's-head flag during his pursuit of the Protestant Caesar, with no mention of color or of any <b>long</b> <b>bone,</b> heart, or dagger.|$|E
