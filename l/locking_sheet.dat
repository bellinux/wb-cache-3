40|$|The {{fretting}} {{performance of}} self-piercing riveting joining dissimilar sheets in TA 1 titanium alloy and H 62 copper alloy was studied in this paper. Load-controlled cyclic fatigue tests {{were carried out}} using a sine waveform and in tension-tension mode. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray techniques were employed to analyze the fretting failure mechanisms of the joints. The experimental results showed that there was extremely severe fretting at the contact interfaces of rivet and sheet materials for the joints at relatively high loads levels. Moreover, the severe fretting in the region on the <b>locked</b> <b>sheet</b> {{in contact with the}} rivet was the major cause of the broken <b>locked</b> <b>sheet</b> for the joints at low load level...|$|R

40|$|The fatigue {{performances}} of self-piercing riveting (SPR) joints connecting similar and dissimilar sheets of TA 1 titanium alloy (TA 1), Al 5052 aluminium alloy (Al 5052) and H 62 copper alloy (H 62) were studied in this paper. The specimens of similar TA 1 sheets treated with {{stress relief annealing}} were prepared to investigate the influence of relief annealing on the mechanical properties of SPR joints. Fatigue tests were conducted to characterize the fatigue lives and failure modes of the joints. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to determine the fatigue failure mechanisms of the joints. The results showed that stress relief annealing has an apparent impact on the fatigue performances but has little influence on the static strengths of the joints. For SPR joints in similar or dissimilar sheets, joints between similar TA 1 sheets possess the best fatigue resistance, which are {{significantly higher than the}} joints in dissimilar sheets. In addition, most of the joints failed in the rivet and the <b>locked</b> <b>sheet</b> through fatigue tests, except the joints between TA 1 and Al 5052, which failed only in the <b>locked</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fretting wear in {{aluminium}} alloy AA 5754 joined by self-pierce riveting (SPR), {{a relatively new}} fastening technique increasingly used in vehicle structures, has been investigated in this paper. Surface damages have been induced when a joint experienced a sinusoidal cyclic tension-tension load. Various degradation zones have been characterised in the contact surfaces between the aluminium sheets, {{as well as the}} rivet and the <b>locked</b> <b>sheet.</b> Subsequent examination of the fretting scars at the contact surfaces and through the cross-section has been carried out using optical and scanning electron microscopies. The fretting patterns in the self-piercing riveted joints have been identified. It was noted that fretting wear was initially patchy and layers of compacted debris were created as fretting continued. An Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the fretting debris from the interface between the rivet and the aluminium sheet revealed the presence of Al, Fe, Si, C and O so that it is suggested that intimate mixing of debris from the {{aluminium alloy}} and the steel rivet had occurred. The effects of testing conditions such as the load magnitude and the number of loading cycles on the fretting wear patterns were also studied. Metallographic examination has shown that these fretting zones are critical with respect to fretting crack nucleation. The test results have shown that joint fracture initiates at these critical zones...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{the project}} {{is to examine the}} rivetability of new steels and to {{investigate}} the mechanical behaviour of self-piercing riveted (SPR) aluminium-steel hybrid structures for automotive applications. Interstitial Free Steel (I. F.) of 1. 2 mm thickness was joined to Aluminium 5754 of 2 mm thickness and Aluminium 5182 (coated and uncoated) of 1. 5 mm thickness. The work began by initially conducting a quality assessment of the various joints that were produced in order to establish the optimum conditions for joining the various sample combinations to be investigated. A relationship was established between the head height and the interlock distance {{on the one hand and}} between the interlock distance and the lap shear strength of samples. It was also established that for higher lap shear strength, it is preferable to use the stronger material (I. F. steel) as the pierced sheet and the weaker material (5182) as the <b>locked</b> <b>sheet.</b> However, the results showed that this rule could not be applied for predicting the fatigue behaviour of SPR joints between I. F. steel and 5182. An investigation of the fatigue failure mechanisms was undertaken and possible reasons for this behaviour are discussed. The influence of fretting was also investigated by using scanning electron microscopy and reported. The fatigue behaviour of Dual Phase (DP 600 + 5182) SPR joints was investigated. It was observed that the position of fatigue crack initiation differed with the maximum applied load. An explanation for this observation was provided by considering the failure mechanism of the samples under different load levels. The study also showed how fretting led to the initiation of fatigue cracks. The corrosion behaviour of (I. F. steel + 5182) samples was investigated by conducting tests in a salt spray according to the ASTM B 117 - 97 standard. Three types of corrosion were observed; galvanic corrosion, differential aeration corrosion, uniform corrosion and are discussed. The weight change with time was monitored and was used to describe the corrosion behaviour. The lap shear strength was measured as a function of corrosion time. The presence of the corrosion product within the overlap was observed to greatly influence the lap shear strength behaviour. A further study was carried out in order to examine the influence of the individual alloys on the corrosion of the SPR samples. In this part the potential influence of pulse current treatment on corrosion was also investigated and was observed to increase greatly the corrosion resistance of the I. F. steel. Principal findings for this observation are also provided. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{adiabatic}} {{limit of}} a recently proposed dynamical extension of Taylor relaxation, multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics (MRxMHD) is summarized, with {{special attention to}} the appropriate definition of relative magnetic helicity. The formalism is illustrated using a simple two-region, sheared-magnetic-field model similar to the Hahm [...] Kulsrud [...] Taylor (HKT) rippled-boundary slab model. In MRxMHD a linear Grad [...] Shafranov equation applies, even at finite ripple amplitude. The adiabatic switching on of boundary ripple excites a shielding current sheet opposing reconnection at a resonant surface. The perturbed magnetic field as a function of ripple amplitude is calculated by invoking conservation of magnetic helicity in the two regions separated by the current sheet. At low ripple amplitude "half islands" appear {{on each side of the}} current <b>sheet,</b> <b>locking</b> the rotational transform at the resonant value.

40|$|Abstract. We examine, {{and find}} {{evidence}} to support, {{the hypothesis that}} the width of Siple Coast ice streams in West Antarctica is set by the development of significant internal melting (i. e., development of temperate ice conditions) within the ice sheet at the margins. We first illustrate, from published ice sheet deformation data and from sim-ple 1 -D thermal modeling based on temperature-dependent flow and conduction prop-erties, that most existing Siple Coast ice stream margins {{are in a state of}} partial melt, with temperate ice being present over a substantial fraction of the sheet thickness. We show that, although the margins sustain high lateral strain rates, they can support (and hence transmit to the cold ridges) notably less lateral shear stress than would the some-what less rapidly deforming ice located inboard, away from the ridge. We then propose, and quantify approximately, a possible related mechanism of margin formation, that is, of <b>locking</b> the <b>sheet</b> to the bed at the margin. Shear heating of the temperate ice con-tinually generates melt, which percolates toward the bed below. If this develops a chan-nelized marginal drainage of Röthlisberger type, the standard theory argues that the high, nearly lithostatic, basal pore pressure elsewhere (i. e., near the bed within the fast mov-ing stream) is somewhat alleviated within the channel. This results in a higher Terza-ghi effective normal stress, which we quantify approximately, acting along the bed near the channel, thereby creating high resistance against frictional shear and possibly lock-ing the ice to the bed, naturally forming an ice stream margin. Our estimates are that the effective normal stress acting on the bed just outside such a channel, and hence the till shear strength, can be twenty to sixty times larger than that inferred to be present at the bed within the fast-moving stream. Reduced basal fluid pressure, and hence en-hanced strength, over a broad region near the margin is shown sufficient to remove the strong stress concentration at the slipping to locked bed transition, and provides a sta-bilizing mechanism for the margin. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Why do ice streams {{exist on}} the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet, like near the Siple Coast? And what sets their width? They are streams of {{typically}} 30 - 80 km horizontal width, flowing rapidly towards the Ross Sea at hundreds of m. yr − 1. The streams are bordered by slow moving ice, frozen to the bed, but no structure in the bed has been cited as controlling {{the location of the}} stream margins. We examine, and find evidence supportive of, the hypothesis that the stream width is set by the development of significant internal melting, i. e., development of temperate ice conditions, within the sheet. We first show, from published ice sheet deformation data and from thermal modeling based on temperature-dependent flow and conduction properties, that most existing Siple Coast ice stream margins are indeed in a state of partial melt, with temperate ice being present over a substantial fraction of the sheet thickness. We then propose and quantify approximately, if incompletely, a possible related mechanism of margin formation, that is, of <b>locking</b> the <b>sheet</b> to the bed outboard of that temperate zone. Shear heating of the temperate ice continually generates melt which percolates toward the bed below. If that develops a channelized marginal drainage of Röthlisberger type, standard theory argues that the high, nearly lithostatic, pore pressure elsewhere (i. e., near the bed within the fast moving stream) is somewhat alleviated within the channel. That results in a higher Terzaghi effective normal stress, which we quantify approximately, acting along the bed just outboard of the channel, and hence creates high resistance against frictional shear and locks the ice outboard to the bed, naturally forming an ice stream margin. Our estimates are that the effective normal stress acting on the bed just outside such a channel is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that inferred to be present at the bed within the fast-moving stream. 1...|$|R

Camcoil is a capstan system that is used when steel band fabricated. Exist for example in production lines their steel band should be annealed. Our goal with this work is {{to come up with}} a completed production basis on a Camcoil for heavy industry. The basis should contain calculations, 3 D-constructions, drawings and cost proposal on manufacturing and detail purchase. Demands on this project: 1. 15 ton load 2. Strip width up to 1500 mm 3. Head diameter 610 mm 4. Production speed 35 m/min 5. Economy manufacturing 6. Be simple Several concepts were decided out of the feasibility study. The concepts were compared against each other and finally only one was left. Result of the design concept became one shaft with three capstan heads and a support function. One conceivable working process was planed with a Gantt-table. A decision was made that the work of the Camcoil should be separated in several details. Earlier work on Camcoil was study to increase our understanding for the work. Some of the examined parts were shaft dimensions, bearings, head shape, tripod, support function and hydraulic cylinder for the capstan and support. Some of the calculations have been made in Ansys. Directional deformation, Von Mises stress for the shaft, length of the hydraulic cylinder in the capstan heads and the stress for tripod and support function was calculated. Analytic calculations were made on some parts. Frequency analysis for the system was made with Dunkerleys method. The reaction forces in the bearings were calculated with a combination of elementary case. Lifecycle of the bearings can with this be appreciated. Hydraulic cylinder strength in capstan heads and support function, <b>locking</b> assemblies, <b>sheet</b> metal thickness and control off beam dimensions in support was also decided with analytic calculations. 3 D models were made on several details in the system.
