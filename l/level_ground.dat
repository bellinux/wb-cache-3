5|$|Like {{almost all}} Coraciiformes the bee-eaters are cavity nesters. In {{the case of}} the bee-eaters the nests are burrows dug into the ground, either into the sides of earth cliffs or {{directly}} into level soil. Both types of nesting site are vulnerable, those on <b>level</b> <b>ground</b> are vulnerable to trampling and small predators, whereas those in cliffs, which are often the banks of rivers, are vulnerable to flash floods, which can wipe out dozens or hundreds of nests. Many species will nest either on cliffs or on <b>level</b> <b>ground</b> but prefer cliffs, although Böhm's bee-eater always nests on <b>level</b> <b>ground.</b> The burrows are dug by both birds in the pair, sometimes assisted by helpers. The soil or sand is loosened with jabs of the sharp bill, then the feet are used to kick out the loose soil. It has been suggested that riverine loess deposits that do not crumble when excavated may be favoured by the larger bee-eaters. There may be several false starts where nests are dug partway before being abandoned; in solitary species this can give the impression of colonial living even when that is not the case. The process of nest building can take as long as twenty days to complete, during which time the bill can be blunted and shortened. Nests are generally used only for a single season and are rarely used twice by the bee-eaters, but abandoned nests may be used by other birds, snakes and bats as shelter and breeding sites.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} the town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate border {{crossing}} originally opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County board of supervisors proposed moving rerouting the road to be shorter and on more <b>level</b> <b>ground,</b> although there was opposition from local residents and businesses who favored the old road. However, the route of the road to Tecate has remained the same since then.|$|E
5|$|On <b>level</b> <b>ground</b> again, {{they began}} to make quick progress. They awoke {{on the morning of}} 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the Ninnis Glacier) far larger than the first. As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once {{at the bottom of the}} glacier they spent four days {{crossing}} fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} roadbed featured blind switchbacks and an 11% grade on {{the descent}} into Seven Mile canyon. The access road to Canyonlands National Park was rebuilt 1988, {{and the construction}} crews severely damaged SR-313 in the process. The highway was completely rebuilt, starting in 1989, to its modern form. The reconstruction reduced the maximum grade from 11% to 8% and re-graded the switchbacks to be on <b>level</b> <b>ground</b> to eliminate the blind corners.|$|E
5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some <b>level</b> <b>ground,</b> before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on <b>level</b> <b>ground,</b> aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E

5|$|Continuing into Onondaga County and {{the village}} of Jordan, NY31 begins to make a turn northward while {{connecting}} to {{the northern end of}} NY317 (the former northern terminus of NY31C) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to <b>level</b> <b>ground</b> and resuming an eastward alignment {{in the shadow of the}} Thruway. Once inside the limits of Van Buren, NY31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of NY173 in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of Baldwinsville, where NY31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the Seneca River to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY31 merges with NY690 northward, traversing the Seneca River and straddling the western edge of Baldwinsville.|$|E
5|$|Like wolves, coyotes use a den (usually {{the deserted}} holes of other species) when gestating and rearing young, {{though they may}} {{occasionally}} give birth under sagebrushes in the open. Coyote dens can be located in canyons, washouts, coulees, banks, rock bluffs, or <b>level</b> <b>ground.</b> Some dens have been found under abandoned homestead shacks, grain bins, drainage pipes, railroad tracks, hollow logs, thickets, and thistles. The den is continuously dug and cleaned out by the female until the pups are born. Should the den be disturbed or infested with fleas, the pups are moved into another den. A coyote den can have several entrances and passages branching out from the main chamber. A single den can be used year after year.|$|E
5|$|The Allies seem to {{have formed}} into two wings; on the right were the Athenians, Corinthians, Sicyonians and Troezenians, and on the left were the Spartans with other contingents. The right wing marched across <b>level</b> <b>ground</b> {{straight}} towards the Persian camp, whilst the left wing attempted to outflank the Persians by passing through more broken ground. The right wing thus began fighting with the Persians while the left wing was still approaching. Herodotus reports that the Persians fought well at first, but that the Athenians and the contingents with them wished to win the victory before the Spartans arrived, and thus attacked ever more zealously.|$|E
