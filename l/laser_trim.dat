40|$|Abstract: The {{resistance}} {{increase by}} transverse cutting is {{more quickly than}} by ordinate cutting when using <b>laser</b> <b>trimming.</b> Therefore, the precision and efficiency of <b>laser</b> <b>trimming</b> can be improved at low cost through reasonable design of the L-cut. In this paper, the finite element method is used to study the influence of L-cut on the resistance of chip resistor. Experiments proved that the qualitative and quantitative conclusions {{of the influence of}} L-cut on the resistance obtained by the finite element method are consistent with the experimental results. Thus, using the conclusions of the influence of L-cut on the resistance obtained by the finite element method can provide the control basis for improving the trimming precision and trimming efficiency.

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{studies the}} effects of varying <b>laser</b> <b>trim</b> {{patterns}} on several performance parameters of thin film resistors such as the {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) and target resistance value. Design/methodology/approach - The benefits and limitations of basic trim patterns are taken into consideration and the plunge cut, double plunge cut and the curved L-cut were selected to be modelled and tested experimentally. A computer simulation of the <b>laser</b> <b>trim</b> patterns has been developed for the modelling process of the resistors. The influence of the trim length and resistor dimensions on the TCR performance and resistance value of the resistors is investigated. Findings - It is found that variation in trim length, within the range of 5 to 15 mm, can give significant increases in the TCR of the thin films. Thus, for the plunge TCR cut can reach up to 11. 51 ppm/oC, for the double plunge cut up to 14. 34 ppm/oC and for the curved L-cut up to 5. 11 ppm/oC. Originality/value – Research on {{the effects of}} various laser trimming geometries on the TCR and target resistance accuracy is limited, especially for patterns such as the curved L-cut,which is investigated in this paper...|$|E

The passive components required to enable high performance consume premium {{space on the}} surface of the printed circuit board. Integrating the resistor function into the laminate substrate frees up the PCB surface area consumed by the discrete component, enabling increased device functionality by the placement of more active components. When the typical 5 to 20 % tolerance of embedded resistors can be allowed, the resistors satisfy the device requirements. The resistive materials and the PCB fabrication processes used to fabricate the resistors are currently not able to achieve precision of 1 % or less. <b>Laser</b> <b>trim</b> technology achieves < 1 % tolerance on thin film embedded resistor panels.

The use of screen printed thick film interconnect provides advantages of versatility over thin film although feature sizes may be larger and deposited resistors wider in tolerance. Multi-layer thick film is a technique for further improvements in integration using a screen printed insulating dielectric to ensure connections between layers are made only where required.

40|$|Existing {{thick film}} hybrid {{microcircuit}} (HMC) production utilizing integral thick film resistors requires that thick film resistors be deposited via screen printing {{directly on the}} base alumina substrate material. This requirement, when coupled with circuits of moderate to high density and associated layer buildup prior to resistor application, results in printing on surfaces with significant topography surrounding the resistor, compared to required as-printed resistor thicknesses. Due to the technological requirement to print resistors after most other thick film processing has been completed, resistor printing is seldom performed on a flat surface. The surface topography of the substrate surrounding the resistor area prohibits the printing process from maintaining a relatively uniform printed resistor thickness across the substrate. Although resistors are, in most cases, adjusted to final electrical values by physically modifying the length-to-width ratio through <b>laser</b> <b>trimming,</b> the resistors must be within certain resistance ranges. This variation in thickness translates into potential scrap product through extreme variation in as-fired resistor electrical values and/or product incapable of being <b>laser</b> <b>trimmed</b> due to excessive resistor thickness.
