40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} we {{describe}} methods of a visual speech segmentation. We present a design of a technique for the segmentation of a visual speech. The visual speech is a visible component of the speech. The segmentation is determining of the time boundaries between speech units. We search the phonetic boundaries in the visual signal. This may be carried out either manually or automatically. Assistance of a <b>lip-reading</b> <b>expert</b> is a necessary requirement for good manual segmentation. We designed a technique for the automatic segmentation of the visual speech. We describe the visual data statistically using the hidden Markov models (HMMs). Then we search the phonetic boundaries by the Viterbi algorithm. For experiments we used our Czech audio-visual speech corpus [1]. I...|$|E
40|$|Audio-visual speech {{recognition}} {{is used to}} make {{speech recognition}} more robust in case when the acoustic speech signal is affected by increased environmental noise. Since visual speech expression is not affected by the acoustic noise, it is used as supplemental information for the recognition. Usually, the shape of lips of a speaker is described by either pixel-based or shape-based features. Many works were published on these two basic approaches. After experiments with various parameterizations we decided to use expert knowledge about human lip-reading for {{development of a new}} parameterization. We used information provided by human <b>lip-reading</b> <b>experts</b> and speech therapists. Based on this information we designed a combined parameterization for description of visual speech part. Experiments with this parameterization were performed on two different databases: English audio-visual database XM 2 VTS and Czech audio-visual database UWB- 05 -HSCAVC. The designed parameterization combines both basic approaches and uses shape-based description for outer lip contour and pixel-based description for description of inner part of a mouth. Results obtained in experiments with this parameterization showed that it outperforms the traditionally used parameterizations.
