5|$|In {{contrast}} to the H-11 and H-16 the H-20, equipped with two Jumo 211F-2s, had more powerful armament and radio communications. The defensive armament consisted of one MG 131 in an A-Stand gun pod for the forward mounted machine gun position. One rotatable Drehlafette DL 131/1C (or E) gun mount in the B-stand was standard and later MG 131 machine guns were added. Navigational direction-finding gear was also installed. The Peil G6 was added to locate targets and the FuBI 2H blind <b>landing</b> <b>equipment</b> was built in to help with night operations. The radio was a standard FuG 10, TZG 10 and FuG 16Z for navigating to the target. The H-20 also was equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutters. The bomb load of the H-20 could be mounted on external ETC 1000 racks, or four ESAC 250 racks. The sub variant H-20/R4 could carry 20 50kg (110lb) bombs as external loads.|$|E
25|$|As part of Spanish {{preparations}} for an intended siege of Brest, a well-situated fort {{was to be}} built on the Peninsula completely commanding the Roadstead of Brest. Águila's chief engineer, Captain Cristóbal de Rojas, designed a modern fortification, christened El Leon - companies took turns in construction, foraging and defence. Spanish admiral Pedro de Zubiaur arrived with twelve ships <b>landing</b> <b>equipment,</b> which accelerated {{the construction of the}} fort, and two shaped bastions with a glacis were formed in front of the drawbridge guarding where the peninsula joined the mainland. The fort had a significant number of guns, one bastion containing eighteen culverins and another smaller bastion had six; many of the these guns were brought by the fleet of Zubiaur. Don Tomé de Paredes was appointed commander of the garrison of the fort, with his company, that of Diego de Aller and Pedro Ortiz Dogaleño totalling 401 men, with a mission to complete the construction of the fort. All this was created in a mere twenty six days of construction.|$|E
500|$|Hōshōs {{flight deck}} was [...] long and [...] wide. The forward end sloped down {{at an angle}} of −5° to help {{aircraft}} accelerate during takeoff. A small island was mounted well forward on the starboard side and contained the ship's bridge and air operations control center. The island was fitted with a small tripod mast intended to mount the ship's fire-control system. Fifteen different types of <b>landing</b> <b>equipment</b> were evaluated before the British longitudinal wire system was adopted. Low landing speeds of the time meant that aircraft had little difficulty in stopping, but their light weight made them vulnerable to wind gusts that could blow them {{over the side of}} the carrier, and the longitudinal wires helped to prevent that. Forward of the island was a collapsible crane for loading aircraft into the forward hangar.|$|E

2500|$|Mariehamn Airport {{used two}} radio {{transmitters}} for contacting airplanes: the [...] "MAR" [...] and [...] "Locator S" [...] beacons. The airport was not {{equipped with an}} instrument landing system (ILS) or a radar; while ILS equipment had been purchased for the airport {{two years before the}} accident, local land disputes postponed their installation. A low-power approach lighting system stretched from 1020 meters before the runway and was powered from the same source as [...] "Locator S" [...] which could mean turning on the lights may have reduced the voltage to the beacon. The area around the beacon, which had the highest obstacle profile, did not have any lights. Contemporary press even went to call the <b>landing</b> <b>equipment</b> of the airport a [...] "death trap" [...] after the accident.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the {{distance}} from Pančevo to downtown Belgrade, which at that time required crossing the Danube, {{a decision was made}} to build a new airport which would be closer. The airport was planned to be built just across the river Sava, in a neighborhood today known as Novi Beograd. It was opened on 25 March 1927 under the official name of Belgrade International Airport (also known as Dojno polje Airport). From February 1928, the aircraft owned by the first local airline Aeroput started taking off from the new airport. The airport had four [...] long grass runways. The design for a reinforced concrete hangar that was built at the airfield was made by the Serbian scientist Milutin Milanković, better known for his theory of climate change. A modern terminal building was built in 1931, while the <b>landing</b> <b>equipment</b> for conditions of poor visibility was installed in 1936.|$|E

2500|$|The last {{aircraft}} of {{the series}} {{was based on a}} partially completed third twin-engined Vellore airframe, fitted with a new, broader fuselage with a glazed pilots' compartment, a spatted tailwheel and powered by 600hp (450kW) Bristol Pegasus IM3 radials. [...] This variant was renamed the Vickers Vellox, flying {{for the first time on}} 23 January 1934 in the hands of Mutt Summers. [...] Vickers hoped to sell the Vellox as a ten-passenger airliner and the new fuselage had five windows per side in front of large starboard side freight doors at the wing trailing edge, but the sole example was used by Imperial Airways as a freighter, mailplane, and for testing Lorenz blind <b>landing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The Vellox crashed shortly after takeoff from Croydon Airport in August 1936 due to a loss of power possibly as a result of some fuel problem. The crew of two pilots and two wireless operators was killed.|$|E
