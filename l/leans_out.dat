5|$|Landing safely on the Moon, {{the astronomers}} {{get out of}} the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their {{blankets}} and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn <b>leans</b> <b>out</b> of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.|$|E

The day before the election, it ran one featuring a car, labelled [...] "the people", travelling along [...] "Aberhart Highway No. 1" [...] and arriving at a railway crossing. A train, labelled [...] "common sense", was approaching from around the bend, along tracks labelled [...] "fundamental facts". Aberhart <b>leans</b> <b>out</b> the [...] "S.C.

500|$|Amy wakes on 26 June 2010 in {{her home}} to {{discover}} that her parents have been brought back into existence and she and Rory celebrate their wedding day. At the reception, River leaves her blank diary for Amy which prompts Amy to recall the Doctor and something he told {{her when she was}} seven during his rewind. She interrupts her father's speech, imploring the [...] "Raggedy" [...] Doctor from her memories to come back. As she recites the old wedding proverb ("something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue"), relating that to what the Doctor had said about the TARDIS, the TARDIS and the Doctor appear. The Doctor comes out of the TARDIS and after a brief conversation with Amy, introduces himself by saying [...] "Hello everyone! I'm Amy's imaginary friend, but I came anyway!" [...] and joins the wedding festivities. Afterwards, he returns River's diary and the vortex manipulator to her so she can return to her own time. She sadly tells him he will soon learn who she truly is and that it will change everything. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor explains to Amy and Rory that unanswered questions remain about the destruction of the TARDIS and the nature of [...] "the silence" [...] that will fall. The Doctor receives a telephone call alerting him to the presence of [...] "an escaped Egyptian goddess on the Orient Express, in space". He tells them that this will have to be goodbye. They agree that it is goodbye and Amy <b>leans</b> <b>out</b> of the TARDIS and yells [...] "Goodbye!". The three then leave on their next adventure.|$|E

It was on such an evening that the strange man struggled up the pass. Broadly speaking, only strange men did struggle up the pass. But I had never seen one like this one before.|$|E
60|$|Watching {{building}} {{operations in}} Holland brings home to you forcibly, what previously you have {{regarded as a}} meaningless formula--namely, {{that the country is}} built upon piles. A dozen feet below the level of the street one sees the labourers working in fishermen's boots up to their knees in water, driving the great wooden blocks into the mud. Many of the older houses slope forward at such an angle that you almost fear to pass beneath them. I should be as nervous as a kitten, living in one of the upper storeys. But the Dutchman <b>leans</b> <b>out</b> of a window that is hanging above the street six feet beyond the perpendicular, and smokes contentedly.|$|E

A red Leviathan comes {{screaming}} down Main Street with a white trail of dust behind it, smothering the occupants of vehicles which have barely succeeded in getting out of the way, and makes a spectacular finish before the Pelican by sliding the last fifty feet on locked rear wheels.|$|E
60|$|The hours went by, how many, {{she never}} learned, till at length the clouds cleared; the moon became visible, and by its light she saw an awful scene. Everywhere around was water; it lapped within a yard, {{and it was}} rising still. Now Elsa saw that in the great beam she clasped were placed short spokes {{for the use of}} those who set the sails above. Up these she climbed as best she might, till she was able to pass her body between two of the vanes and support her breast upon the flat surface of one of them, as a person does who <b>leans</b> <b>out</b> of a window. From her window there was {{something}} to see. Quite near to her, but separated by fifteen or twenty feet of yellow frothing water, a little portion of the swelling shape of the mill stood clear of the flood. To this foam-lapped island clung two human beings--Hague Simon and Black Meg. They saw her also and screamed for help, but she had none to give. Surely it was a dream--nothing so awful could happen outside a dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{the whole}} I {{recommend}} you to persevere; {{you are doing}} very well." [...] Mr. Scalper's next proceeding is peculiar. He takes from the cupboard a roll of twine, about fifty feet in length, and attaches one end {{of it to the}} neck of the bottle. Going then to one of the windows, he opens it, <b>leans</b> <b>out,</b> and whistles softly. The alert ear of Policeman Hogan on the pavement below catches the sound, and he returns it. The bottle is lowered {{to the end of the}} string, the guardian of the peace applies it to his gullet, and for some time the policeman and the man of letters remain attached by a cord of sympathy. Gentlemen who lead the variegated life of Mr. Scalper find it well to propitiate the arm of the law, and attachments of this sort are not uncommon. Mr. Scalper hauls up the bottle, closes the window, and returns to his task; the policeman resumes his walk with a glow of internal satisfaction. A glance at the City Hall clock causes him to enter another note in his book.|$|E

6000|$|I {{imagine that}} Grossetto {{is not a}} town much known to travel, for it is absent from all the guide-books I have looked at. However, it is chief in the Maremma, where sweet Pia de' Tolommei languished and perished of the {{poisonous}} air and her love's cruelty, and where, so many mute centuries since, the Etrurian cities flourished and fell. Further, one may say that Grossetto is on the diligence road from Civita Vecchia to Leghorn, {{and that in the}} very heart of the place there is a lovely palm-tree, rare, if not sole, in that latitude. This palm stands in a well-sheltered, dull little court, out of every thing's way, and turns tenderly toward the wall that shields it on the north. It has no other company but a beautiful young girl, who <b>leans</b> <b>out</b> of a window high over its head, and I have no doubt talks with it. At the moment we discovered the friends, the maiden was looking pathetically to the northward, while the palm softly stirred and opened its plumes, as a bird does when his song is finished; and there is very little question but it had just been singing to her that song of which the palms are so fond,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{the chance}} came as I was {{watching}} a muskrat at his supper. It was twilight in the woods. I had drifted in close to shore in my canoe to see what Musquash was doing {{on top of a}} rock. All muskrats have favorite eating places--a rock, a stranded log, a tree boll that <b>leans</b> <b>out</b> over the water, and always a pretty spot--whither they bring food from a distance, evidently for the purpose of eating it where they feel most at home. This one had gathered a half dozen big fresh-water clams onto his dining table, and sat down in the midst to enjoy the feast. He would take a clam in his fore paws, whack it a few times on the rock till the shell cracked, then open it with his teeth and devour the morsel inside. He ate leisurely, tasting each clam critically before swallowing, and sitting up often to wash his whiskers or to look out over the lake. A hermit thrush sang marvelously sweet above him; the twilight colors glowed deep and deeper in the water below, where his shadow was clearly eating clams also, in the midst of heaven's splendor.--Altogether a pretty scene, and a moment of peace that I still love to remember. I quite forgot that Musquash is a villain. But the tragedy was near, as it always is in the wilderness. Suddenly a movement caught my eye on the bank above. Something was waving nervously under the bushes. Before I could make out what it was, there was a fearful rush, a gleam of wild yellow eyes, a squeak from the muskrat. Then Upweekis, looking gaunt and dark and strange in his summer coat, was crouched on the rock with Musquash between his great paws, growling fiercely as he cracked the bones. He bit his game all over, {{to make sure that it}} was quite dead, then took it by the back of the neck, glided into the bushes with his stub tail twitching, and became a shadow again.|$|E
50|$|The opening {{sequence}} is {{of a girl}} (presumably a mentally disabled person) walking down the street. She is approached by {{a man in a}} car who <b>leans</b> <b>out</b> of his window and plays with her hair. She then gets {{in the back seat of}} his car and rides away.|$|E
