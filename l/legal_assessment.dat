The force necessary to respond to violent resistance and whether the force that was used was proportionate were disputed.|$|R

40|$|Intent and {{mitigating}} circumstances {{play a central}} role in moral and <b>legal</b> <b>assessments</b> in large-scale industrialized societies. Although these features of moral assessment are widely assumed to be universal, to date, they have only been studied in a narrow range of societies. We show that there is substantial cross-cultural variation among eight traditional small-scale societies (ranging from hunter-gatherer to pastoralist to horticulturalist) and two Western societies (one urban, one rural) in the extent to which intent and {{mitigating circumstances}} influence moral judgments. Although participants in all societies took such factors into account to some degree, they did so to very different extents, varying in both the types of considerations taken into account and the types of violations to which such considerations were applied. The particular patterns of assessment characteristic of large-scale industrialized societies may thus reflect relatively recently culturally evolved norms rather than inherent features of human moral judgment...|$|R
40|$|Authentic {{assessments}} are aligned with workplace activities, {{as opposed to}} the more artificial, largely exclusively summative and austere, nature of traditional university assessment methods. In this paper, the authors assert that authentic assessments, although traditionally the preserve of extra and co-curricular (ECCA) course delivery, have the crucial benefit of improving teaching standards on academic law degree programmes, through ensuring that the key 'critical reasoning' skill which ensures academic assessment success, has been identified by the assessor and developed by the student throughout the assessment. In this paper, the essential elements of the critical reasoning skill is subdivided into its composite parts, into a simple checklist, for use in <b>legal</b> <b>assessments.</b> This checklist, when applied by the assessor, has two main purposes: (i) to ensure that the student has achieved the appropriate grade for the assessment; and (ii) to ensure consistency and maintenance of quality in the assessment method...|$|R
40|$|Can {{international}} {{non-governmental organizations}} (INGOs) influence domestic policy? This paper offers new quantitative {{evidence of the}} impact of INGOs in one specific policy area—Freedom of Information (FOI) laws—as well as highlighting an under-studied mechanism of INGO influence on the design of domestic laws. I test this argument by examining the effect of legal analyses of draft FOI legislation published by the INGO Article 19. These analyses provide expert <b>legal</b> <b>assessments</b> and make normative evaluations—both information politics and symbolic politics. I find that in countries in which Article 19 conducted legal analyses, the design of the subsequently passed FOI laws was significantly stronger than in countries that were not subject to such analyses. I demonstrate that this finding is not an artifact of Article 19 ’s selection process. I also present suggestive evidence that highlights symbolic politics, not information politics, as the more salient mechanism. Finally, I examine the process of FOI drafting and adoption in Serbia to illustrate the argument and specific mechanisms at work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new analytical framework for assessing losses from unsuitable investment advice, integrating both legal and economic aspects. First, {{a core of}} legal concepts for assessing losses is identified that is common to most jurisdictions. These include negligence in advice, causation as examined by the but-for-test, and the loss caused by the unsuitable advice. Building upon these legal concepts, five economic tests are developed for analyzing the causal chain from improper advice to financial loss. If the tests show that the advice was unsuitable, the investor {{did not know about}} it, the investment violated his risk patterns, and the assets most likely chosen with suitable advice would have performed better, an economic proof for establishing liability is provided, thus supporting <b>legal</b> <b>assessments</b> of losses. Several new analytical tools are suggested to substantiate the analysis. As a major conclusion, it is shown that proving liability for unsuitable investment advice gets more difficult, the more financially sophisticated an investor is. (authors' abstract...|$|R

However, the discussion on limitations with the {{approaches in}} regard to aspects such as uncertainties, {{the nature of the}} threat and risk to civilians is limited. The aim of this work is to identify important challenges when applying risk based approaches to military activity. This article discusses risk based approaches in general and their military applications. Five generic quality requirements on risk analysis are presented from research in risk philosophy. Two military application areas for risk analysis: military intelligence, and risk management in <b>legal</b> <b>assessments</b> are analysed in relation to the presented quality requirements on risk analysis. From the analysis it is clear that risk analysis {{is an integral part of}} the decision-making analysis and cannot be separated in time, space or organisationally from the decision-making process in general. Defining the scenario to analyse, including the time span, is a central task in risk analysis and will affect every aspect of the risk estimation. Therefore, the principles for scenario definition must be communicated and continuously updated throughout the organisation. Handling the uncertainties throughout the process is also important, especially if the aim is a resilient military system...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{power to}} {{influence}} many social determinants of health lies within local government sectors that are outside public health's traditional remit. We analyse {{the challenges of}} achieving health gains through local government alcohol control policies, where legal and professional practice frameworks appear to conflict with public health action. METHODS: Current legislation governing local alcohol control in England and Wales is reviewed and analysed for barriers and opportunities to implement effective population-level health interventions. Case studies of local government alcohol control practices are described. RESULTS: Addressing alcohol-related health harms is constrained {{by the absence of}} a specific legal health licensing objective and differences between public health and <b>legal</b> <b>assessments</b> of the relevance of health evidence to a specific place. Local governments can, however, implement health-relevant policies by developing local evidence for alcohol-related health harms; addressing cumulative impact in licensing policy statements and through other non-legislative approaches such as health and non-health sector partnerships. Innovative local initiatives-for example, minimum unit pricing licensing conditions-can serve as test cases for wider national implementation. CONCLUSIONS: By combining the powers available to the many local government sectors involved in alcohol control, alcohol-related health and social harms can be tackled through existing local mechanisms...|$|R
