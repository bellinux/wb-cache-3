At the 45 nm technology node, the area footprint of a 10μm x 10μm TSV {{is comparable to}} that of about 50 gates. Furthermore, manufacturability demands landing pads and keep-out zones which further increase TSV area footprint. Depending on the technology choices, TSVs block some subset of <b>layout</b> <b>resources.</b> Via-first TSVs are manufactured before metallization, thus occupy the device layer and result in placement obstacles. Via-last TSVs are manufactured after metallization and pass through the chip. Thus, they occupy both the device and metal layers, resulting in placement and routing obstacles. While the usage of TSVs is generally expected to reduce wirelength, this depends on the number of TSVs and their characteristics. Also, the granularity of inter-die partitioning impacts wirelength. It typically decreases for moderate (blocks with 20-100 modules) and coarse (block-level partitioning) granularities, but increases for fine (gate-level partitioning) granularities.|$|E

It is imperative for an automated buffer insertion algorithm to be able to efficiently optimize tens of thousands of nets.

40|$|Abstract—Built-in {{self-test}} (BIST) is {{a well-known}} design technique in which part of a circuit is {{used to test the}} circuit itself. BIST plays an important role for embedded memories, which do not have pins or pads exposed toward the periphery of the chip for testing with automatic test equipment. With the rapidly increasing number of embedded memories in modern SOCs (up to hundreds of memories in each hard macro of the SOC), product designers incur substantial costs of test time (subject to possible power constraints) and BIST logic physical resources (area, routing, power). However, only limited previous work addresses the physical design optimization of BIST logic; notably, Chien et al. [7] optimize BIST design with respect to test time, routing length, and area. In our work, we propose a new three-step heuristic approach to minimize test time as well as test physical <b>layout</b> <b>resources,</b> subject to given upper bounds on power consumption. A key contribution is an integer linear programming ILP framework that determines optimal test time for a given cluster of memories using either one or two BIST controllers, subject to test power limits and with full comprehension of available serialization and parallelization. Our heuristic approach integrates (i) generation of a hypergraph over the memories, with test time-aware weighting of hyperedges, along with top-down, FM-style min-cut partitioning; (ii) solution of an ILP that comprehends parallel and serial testing to optimize test scheduling per BIST controller; and (iii) placement of BIST logic to minimize routing and buffering costs. When evaluated on hard macros from a recent industrial 28 nm networking SOC, our heuristic solutions reduce test time estimates by up to 11. 57 % with strictly fewer BIST controllers per hard macro, compared to the industrial solutions.

The study collected data by means of questionnaire, personal observation, and informal discussion with senior library staff members. Literature and Internet sources were also consulted with a purpose to explore the related studies in the field. The study indicates the need for Pakistani university libraries to improve their professional standards and to take a more active role in formulating a proper policy and aims and objectives on educating the users. Teaching the users about library structure, location and <b>layout,</b> <b>resources</b> and services is of great value. Particular importance must be given to this, to enable users to make effective and efficient use of library for independent study and research. This purpose can be achieved by developing the orientation programmes, basic bibliographic instruction and advanced bibliographic instruction based on the demands of categories of users. Various factors were found to be the contributors for inhibiting the successful execution of a quality user education programme as: lack of proper policy by the authorities, lack of assessment of library users 2 ̆ 7 educational and information needs, inadequate in-service training for library staff, poor response from the students and teachers, and insufficient budget for acquiring audio-visual aids. This study has practical implications for the mangers of university libraries, librarians and information specialists for developing constructive instructional programmes. It can be useful for improving the value and meaningfulness of such projects in other kind of libraries as well. Not many studies on the user education programme have been conducted in Pakistan. This research is of the perception of students, teachers and librarians about such programmes.

40|$|Extensive {{research}} {{efforts have been}} made in construction simulation. Nevertheless, work space is neglected or not explicitly represented, and spatial conflicts are not considered in simulation tools. Accordingly, finding possible solutions to spatial conflicts is not integrated within the simulation. Spatial conflicts should be considered and properly resolved because they affect construction performance in terms of safety and productivity, especially when spatial constraints are crucial to the project. A conflict-free simulation provides a better means for the practitioners to check the simulation results and compare various solutions. In addition, explicit representation of space is required to support planners with the evaluation of spatial organization of more efficient and safer workspaces on construction sites. The objective of this research is to propose a cell-based simulation method considering spatial constraints for the decision-makers to perform efficient spatial evaluation of site layouts, to identify and resolve spatial conflicts during construction operations, and then to facilitate the optimization of the site <b>layout</b> and construction <b>resources</b> from a variety of requirement perspectives that planners would normally consider in a real project. This method consists of the pre-processing, main-processing and post-processing phases, integrating site layout planning, simulation and animation of the simulation results.

This hampers productivity. Detailed advance planning of site space use over time and reorganization of the work may alleviate these inefficiencies. An interactive decision support tool is presented that loosely integrates <b>layout</b> with <b>resource</b> scheduling {{to make it easier}} to plan operations for which timing and space use are critical. Layouts for consecutive time frames, which together span the duration of construction, are created one at a time by the user. When a layout is identified as problematic because of spatial conflict, the user calls upon the scheduler to remedy the problem by delaying activities, changing resource allocation levels or resource types. The modified schedule is returned to the user who then proceeds with the layout task. The architecture and operation of this tool are described. A first version has been implemented. It brings to bear key issues in space-time cost trade-off and provides a test bed for experimentation with real-time distributed computing for site materials management.

40|$|As {{high-performance}} computing approaches exascale, the existing I/O system design {{is having trouble}} keeping pace in both performance and scalability. We propose to address this challenge by adopting database principles and techniques in parallel I/O systems. First, we propose to adopt an array data model because many scientific applications represent their data in arrays. This strategy follows a cardinal principle from database research, which separates the logical view from the physical layout of data. This high-level data model gives the underlying implementation more freedom to optimize the physical layout and to choose {{the most effective way}} of accessing the data. For example, knowing that a set of write operations is working on a single multi-dimensional array makes it possible to keep the subarrays in a log structure during the write operations and reassemble them later into another physical <b>layout</b> as <b>resources</b> permit. While maintaining the high-level view, the storage system could compress the user data to reduce the physical storage requirement, collocate data records that are frequently used together, or replicate data to increase availability and fault-tolerance. Additionally, the system could generate secondary data structures such as database indexes and summary statistics. We expect the proposed Scientific Data Services approach to create a “live” storage system that dynamically adjusts to user demands and evolves with the massively parallel storage hardware...|$|R

A {{major part of the}} management process is the allocation of teaching activities to rooms which have appropriate size, <b>layout</b> and <b>resource</b> availability. Matching the needs of the overall teaching requirement with the space provision within an institution is difficult to achieve and is currently performed poorly within the university sector. Furthermore, in many cases, it is a requirement to split an activity over more than one room. For example, lectures can be too large to fit in one room or good teaching practice requires that seminars and tutorials are taught in small groups. Space management then involves decisions on splitting as well as the assignments to rooms and time-slots. These decisions must be made whilst satisfying the pedagogic requirements of the institution and constraints on space resources. The efficiency of such management can be measured by the “utilisation”: the percentage of available seat-hours actually used. In many institutions, the observed utilisation is unacceptably low, and this provides our underlying motivation: to study the factors that affect teaching space utilisation, with the goal of improving it.
