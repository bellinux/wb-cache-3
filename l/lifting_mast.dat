6000|$|After {{the launch}} Davy {{and all the}} people {{returned}} home, and the Fair Nancy was towed to the [...] "shear-hulk" [...] to have her masts put in. The shear-hulk is a large ship in which is placed machinery for <b>lifting</b> <b>masts</b> into other ships. Every one who has looked at the thick masts of a large vessel, must see at a glance that they could never be put there by any number of men. Machinery is used to do it, and the shear-hulk contains that machinery; so that when a ship has to get her masts put up she is dragged alongside of this vessel. In the meantime Davy renewed his prayer to his father to let him go to sea, and at last the old man consented. His mother cried a good deal at first, and hoped that Davy would not think of it; but his father said that it would do him good, and if he became tired of it after the first voyage he could give it up. Davy was overjoyed at this, and went immediately to his friend the fisherman, Ben Block, who was very much delighted too, and took him to a shop to buy clothes and a sea-chest for the voyage.|$|R

Oftentimes, the deepness of the scanner patternator is not suitable in order to catch both spray jets of double flat spray nozzles. An upgrade for Herbst scanner patternator SPRAYERTEST 1000 is available. A modified table HV 1000 -L with 2 m in depth, which is double of the current one, is introduced to deal with that specific problem. An easy replacement of the patternator table in existing operating equipments is suggested...|$|R

An analysis of variance based on the total power of the spectral distribution indicates the relative effect of each experimental factor, including Wong interactions with torque. Reinstallation of the main pinion assembly is shown to introduce changes in the vibration signature, suggesting the possibility of a strong effect of maintenance on HUMS design and use. Based on these results, further research will be conducted to compare these vibration responses with actual OH 58 c helicopter transmission vibration patterns...|$|R

50|$|The name Lastage {{derives from}} the various ship's ballast-related {{activities}} that took place here (ballasten, ontlasten and belasten). Near the Schreierstoren on the quay along the IJ, a crane was built to <b>lift</b> cargo, <b>masts</b> and anchors. A ditch was dug between Montelbaansgracht and Geldersekade around 1530, and was named Rechtboomssloot after Cornelis P. Boom, one of the landowners in the area. The old stream that ran through the Lastage was named Kromboomssloot. Local residents' proposals in 1543 and 1548 to incorporate Lastage into the city were not accepted, despite efforts made by a delegation sent to the Great Council of Mechelen, who brought along a painting of the area by Cornelis Anthonisz. illustrating the local situation. In 1550 there were already 550 houses outside the city walls. In 1564, the residents, backed by the vogt, urged the city government once more to expand the city. Due to the activities in the area posing a potential fire hazard, the city government denied the plea again.|$|R

The interviews focused on eliciting the interviewees' personal background in terms of their educational and career history, their involvement in the front-end of the design process and their perspectives of the issues encountered in defining requirements and developing designs. ¿ The analysis in this report represents a snapshot in time, from the establishment of <b>MaST</b> <b>LIFT</b> until September 2004. ¿ The findings describe the organisational structure of <b>MaST</b> <b>LIFT,</b> a process map describing key activities on a timeline, a description of the main issues identified and possible improvements, and a description of the skills and competences used throughout the process. ¿ The main issues identified were classified as follows: (a) the healthcare delivery system redesign; ¿ There were some concerns that the service models were not sufficiently defined when design development started (b) the organisational structure; ¿ A complex organisational structure and multitude of stakeholders were put in place to deliver <b>MaST</b> <b>LIFT,</b> the expected economies of scale have not yet been achieved. There have also been constant changes of the stakeholders involved with the schemes, leading to continuous redesign. In addition, some tensions between stakeholders has occurred as a consequences of the complex MaST organisational structure. (c) the definition of processes; ¿ PCTs are considered to be novice construction clients. However, they were involved in the development of 13 schemes without appropriate technical support and without knowledge on the requirements capture and design issues. There is some indication that the schemes were being developed at their initial stages without appropriate project management structures to link the LIFT vision to its operational level. Design management is considered by the interviewees to have been generally poor. There were also some difficulties with regards to affordability and, in general, erratic management of change. All these issues are related to poor definition of processes. d) the definition of roles and responsibilities; ¿ The poor definition of processes has also led to a degree of confusion with regards to roles and responsibilities. There was lack of specific expertise that should have been available throughout the process (e. g. development), some roles and responsibilities were not clear for all involved in the process (e. g. MaST core team after the bidding process), and this has led to difficulties in terms of drilling down directives from the strategic leadership. ¿ Fourteen broad level skills, qualifications and experience were identified amongst the team. ¿ It was found that the complexity of the organisational structure coupled with the lack of common understanding of the process, roles and responsibilities exerted pressures on the 'as is' skills profile of the stakeholders involved. ¿ The report makes recommendations with regard to the use of skills audits and the skill needs for managing such initiatives...|$|R

40|$|Although, {{mulberry}} {{plants are}} grown in Australia as ornamentals or fruit, {{there are no}} data available or work done to assist in establishing a sericulture industry. This research conducted in Lockyer Valley in South East Queensland covered four areas of mulberry leaf production in identifying mulberry varieties and practices suitable for Australian conditions. The first trial involved identifying local mulberry varieties with desirable characters of high leaf yield, high protein content, high carbohydrate content and high moisture content; these are the characters desirable for sericulture production. Nine mulberry varieties consisting of Morus nigra, Morus alba and Morus macroura cv. Shahtoot, were identified as planting material in South East Queensland. Cuttings were raised in polybags in a glasshouse for 18 weeks. The plants of nine varieties (LV 1 to LV 9) were transplanted into the field on raised plastic mulch beds at a row by tree spacing of 4 m × 2 m. A randomised block design and three replications was used. Irrigation and fertiliser were applied through a drip system. Three sets of data were recorded over the trial period. Harvest 1 was taken at 20 weeks after transplanting, Harvest 2 at 13 weeks after first pruning and Harvest 3 at 30 weeks after second pruning. The characters evaluated were leaf and shoot yield (fresh and dry weight), crude protein and carbohydrate (TNC) content, moisture content, growth rate, number of shoots, number of branches, stem diameter, longest shoot height, internode length, leaf size and shape, number of leaf lobe and 20 leaf weight. The number of branches, stem diameter, longest shoot height, internode length were measured on the longest shoot at harvest. Using Harvest 2 data, when leaves are normally harvested and fed to silkworms, varieties, LV 5 and LV 7, recorded higher fresh leaf yields (2. 13 t/ha and 2. 21 t/ha respectively), leaf moisture content (60 % and 59 %), and intermediate carbohydrate content (17. 5 % and 14. 9 %). Although both varieties, LV 5 and LV 7, recorded low protein contents (13. 6 % and 15. 7 % respectively), they were recommended for sericulture production based on overall performance. LV 9, at Harvest 3 recorded high fresh leaf yield (5. 6 t/ha), protein content (18. 6 %), carbohydrate content (12. 5 %) and moisture content (65 %), therefore it was also recommended for sericulture production. The second trial involved five varieties Morus alba sp. (MA), Morus nigra sp. cathayana, Morus nigra sp. kanva (MK), Morus nigra sp. multicaulis (MM) and Morus nigra sp. (MN) imported from Indonesia. The trial set up, {{data collection and analysis}} were the same as in the first trial. Two sets of data, Harvests 1 and 2, were recorded over the research period. Varieties, MM, MK and MC were recommended for silkworm feeding based on leaf yield, protein content, carbohydrate content and moisture content. MM recorded the highest leaf yield (6. 57 and 8. 13 t/ha), followed by MK (3. 66 and 4. 79 t/ha) and then MC (3. 43 and 4. 54 t/ha) for Harvests 1 and 2. Moisture content for MM (68 % and 75. 1 %), MK (71 % and 77. 5 %) and MC (71 % and 76. 2 %) were high at both harvests except for MM (68 %) which recorded the lowest at Harvest 1. MM (17. 5 % and 15. 5 %) recorded the lowest at both harvests for protein content, whereas MK (17. 8 % and 18. 9 %) and MC (17. 6 % and 18. 9 %) maintained intermediate protein contents at both harvests. MK (18. 1 % and 15. 5 %) recorded the highest carbohydrate at both harvests while MM, in general, recorded intermediate carbohydrate contents. MC recorded intermediate and lowest carbohydrate content (13. 8 % and 12. 7 %) at Harvests 1 and 2 respectively. In general, MM, MK and MC showed characters which were higher than MA and MN, although MM recorded low protein content. The third trial looked at the effect of plant density on the main economic characters of mulberry plants. A local variety, LV 1, was planted using six density treatments of row x plant spacing 0. 6 m x 0. 5 m, 0. 6 m x 1. 0 m, 0. 6 m x 1. 5 m, 4. 0 m x 0. 5 m, 4. 0 m x 1. 0 m, 4. 0 m x 1. 5 m using a strip plot design. Two sets of readings were measured over the research period. Harvest 1 occurred at 26 weeks after first pruning and Harvest 2 at 37 weeks after the second pruning. The 4. 0 m x 0. 5 m spacing treatment (5, 000 plants/ha) was recommended for sericulture practice because leaf yield was high (2541 kg/ha and 4274 kg/ha) at Harvests 1 and 2, protein content was highest (19. 7 % and 19. 1 %) at both harvests, carbohydrate content was lowest (14. 1 %) but second highest (20. 2 %) at Harvest 1 and 2 respectively. Moisture content was highest (59. 9 %) and low (61. 4 %) at Harvests 1 and 2. The fourth area of study involved designing, developing and testing a mechanical mulberry leaf harvester. The harvester consisted of a reel, reciprocating cutting knife, conveyor, hydraulic system, <b>lift</b> <b>mast,</b> collection bin and support frames. The harvester was supported at the tractors three point linkage and operated by the tractors hydraulics. The harvester was field tested on 14 and 20 week mulberry plants, planted at 1 m apart and at row spacing of 4 m. Harvesting operations were performed at three tractor forward speeds (1. 5, 2. 0 and 3. 0 km/h) in combination with reel, cutting knife and conveyor speeds. It was observed that all mulberry plants within the effective cutting area (100 % cutting efficiency) were harvested at the three forward speeds. The collected yield ranged from 0. 63 t/ha to 2. 25 t/ha, collection efficiency ranged from 65 % to 93 % and damaged shoots ranged from 9 % to 34 %. New shoots budded and grew from all the harvested shoots (damaged and undamaged). The four trials showed that local varieties LV 5, LV 7, and LV 9 together with imported varieties MC, MK and MM produced high leaf yield, protein, carbohydrate and moisture content. A 4 m x 0. 5 m spacing (5000 trees/ha) treatment showed high values for the desirable characters, therefore the six high production varieties as well as the 4 m x 0. 5 m spacing arrangement are recommended for sericulture production in Australia. Also the mechanical leaf harvester which showed satisfactory performance can be utilised to minimise labour costs...|$|R
