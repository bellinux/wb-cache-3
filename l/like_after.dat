5|$|The soundtrack to Nier {{is largely}} {{composed}} of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer {{for the band}} freesscape, and had previously worked on video games such as Etrian Odyssey. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, where she {{tried to imagine what}} they would sound <b>like</b> <b>after</b> 1000 years of drifting.|$|E

25|$|In {{the past}} 127 years, the {{municipality}} {{has seen a}} 29% increase in local population (from 31815 in 1864 to 40940 in 1991). This was not a gradual nor homogeneous increase, since there were periods of extreme growth or rapid decline. During the 20th century, growth after 1920 is notably influenced by the restriction of trans-Atlantic emigration, just <b>like</b> <b>after</b> 1991, the population decreases were associated with liberal emigration policies {{as a result of}} the Maastricht Treaty.|$|E
25|$|Reference {{sites are}} often used to {{determine}} appropriate species to plant and {{may be used as}} sources for seeds or cuttings. Reference communities serve as models for what restoration sites should ideally look <b>like</b> <b>after</b> restoration is complete. Concerns about using reference sites have been raised however, as conditions at the restored and reference sites may not be similar enough to support the same species. Also, restored riparian zones may be able to support a variety of possible species combinations, therefore the Society for Ecological Restoration recommends using multiple reference sites to formulate restoration goals.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in Etruria, {{still in}} the spring of 217 BC, Hannibal tried without success to draw the main Roman army under Flaminius into a pitched battle by devastating the area the latter had been sent to protect. Hannibal then {{employed}} a new , when he marched around his opponent’s left flank and effectively cut him off from Rome. Advancing through the uplands of Etruria, the Carthaginian now provoked Flaminius into a hasty pursuit without proper reconnaissance. Then, in a defile on the shore of Lake Trasimenus, Hannibal lay in ambush with his army. The ambush was a complete success: in the battle of Lake Trasimene Hannibal destroyed most of the Roman army and killed Flaminius with little loss to his own army. 6,000 Romans had been able to escape, but were caught and forced to surrender by Maharbal's Numidians. Furthermore, Scipio, aware of the fighting, sent his cavalry in support but it was also caught and annihilated. As a result of this victory, the heterogeneous force of insurgent Gauls, Africans, Iberians and Numidians had more military equipment than they could use themselves and sold the surplus via Egyptian traders to the Romans. <b>Like</b> <b>after</b> all previous engagements, the captured enemies were sorted according to whether they were Romans, who were held captive, or non-Romans, who were released to spread the propaganda that the Carthaginian army was in Italy to fight for their freedom against the Romans. Strategically, Hannibal had now disposed of the only field force that could check his advance on Rome; but, despite the urgings of his generals, he did not proceed to attack Rome. Instead, he marched to the south in the hope of winning over allies amongst the Greek and Italic population there.|$|E

To the 1981 season Halmstads BK hired Dutch manager Jan Mak and with him came Frank Schinkels, the first non Swedish player in the club, but with a poor start saw the club end up in 9th place. In 1982 the club ended up in 8th and earned {{a spot in the}} play-off, but IFK Göteborg proved to strong with 2–4 totally. In 1983 the club climbed two {{positions}} much due to British goalkeeper Ken Allen. 1984 started with a fight between the board and manager Jan Mak and it ended it with Jan Mak leaving the club, he was replaced by Stefan Lundin, the club reached 8th place and IFK Göteborg proved to strong in the play-off again. Halmstads BK topt the table during the spring of 1985 but a poor ending of the season saw the club end in 7th place. During the middle of the 1986 season Stefan Lundin left the club for Portugies C.S. Marítimo and was replaced by Kenneth Rosén, the season ended with a 5th place and Stig Nilsson became the new chairman. A series of injuries on keyplayers saw the club end up second to last and was relegated from Allsvenskan {{for the first time in}} 14 years in 1987. Stuart Baxter became new manager in 1988 and ever after losing several keyplayers and trailing after Mjällby AIF with 7 point, the club was able to claim the top spot on better goal difference. The club ended up in a 5th place in their return to Allsvenskan in 1989.|$|E

It's an organ of power." [...] According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed, the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did, the same people who worked in the Soviet system are working there.

Following his appeal for the return of the prosthesis, he received a telephone call from two youths who said they [...] "might be able to recover the lost leg" [...] but asked [...] "What is it worth?" [...] Infuriated, McFall refused to pay anything and asked the youths whether they had considered what being an amputee was <b>like.</b> <b>After</b> McFall agreed to take no further action against them, the youths anonymously returned the prosthesis to the Institute a week later.

In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Scottish Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Scottish Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, and wrote [...] "Song of the Ancients" [...] in an entirely fictional language. She wrote that song by listening to songs in as many languages as possible and jumbling them up together. For the other languages, she tried to imagine what they would sound <b>like</b> <b>after</b> 1000 years of drifting.|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} was [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin, which Bell said [...] "was a fun homage to Michael Jackson, and it {{set the tone}} for the rest of the episode". Futterman said that Blaine's [...] "slick showmanship" [...] made him a [...] "natural for lead vocals", and Slezak called it [...] "the best use of Darren Criss' voice on Glee in quite some time" [...] and gave it an [...] "A−". Lynch also gave it an [...] "A−", and said Criss [...] "captured the {{excitement}} and the spunky bravado of the original". Sullivan was another fan of [...] "the sheer awesomeness of Darren Criss" [...] on the song, and characterized it as [...] "a tribute that's more respectful than any other in the episode". Chaney dissented from the general approval; she gave it a [...] "C+" [...] and wrote that [...] "the number was appropriately big and splashy, but musically, it sounded like all the funk had been drained right out of it". She described [...] "Bad" [...] similarly as she gave it a [...] "C−": [...] "this tune also sounded noticeably defunkified". Sullivan was also unimpressed; he wrote that the performance let [...] "the world know what 'Bad' sounds <b>like</b> <b>after</b> it's drained of every ounce of danger". Lynch gave it a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that [...] "as silly as a choreographed gang fight between teenagers in a parking lot sounds (and was), the choreography was crisp and the attitude was a lot of fun". Slezak also praised the fight choreography, and stated that he [...] "got chills" [...] when Santana sang the chorus, and gave the song a [...] "B+". Futterman noted the [...] "interesting twist" [...] in the song's arrangement [...] "thanks to the Warblers' penchant for a cappella", and said that [...] "Artie and Santana" [...] began their battle for [...] "vocal MVP of the episode" [...] with [...] "Bad".

2500|$|Political {{scientist}} and cultural critic James Miller believes that since Ken Kesey had invited the Hells Angels {{to one of}} his outdoor Acid Tests, the hippies had viewed the bikers unrealistically, idealizing them as [...] "noble savages" [...] and thus [...] "outlaw brothers of the counterculture". Miller also maintains that the Rolling Stones may have been misled by their experience with a British contingent of self-described [...] "Hells Angels", a non-outlaw group of admirers of American biker gear who had provided nonviolent security at a free Stones concert earlier that year in Hyde Park, London. Cutler, however, denies ever having had any illusions about the true nature of Californian Hells Angels.

2500|$|The {{basic concept}} of Pyst {{was to show}} what Myst Island (from the best-selling game) would look <b>like</b> <b>after</b> four million people (players) had visited and [...] "explored".

Palladium President Ed Bernstein wanted the game to be a [...] "transformative work that moved way beyond Myst", in order to avoid copyright issues with Myst publisher Broderbund on the grounds of being a parody work. However, a spokesman from Broderbund said the company was unfazed with the project, commenting [...] "We've seen imitators and they usually just give us a good chuckle". Bergman discovered that the sense of comic timing he had become accustomed to in his live shows couldn't be replicated in the digital realm, and had to adapt accordingly. Firezine said that the game was illustratory of Bergman's ability to [...] "survey America's culture and obsessions like a maniacal monitor reflecting the absurdness of it all, while casting his iconoclastic eye to read the entrails of the present coarse [...] and our delirious future".|$|E
2500|$|Tejada {{perceived}} Traditionalism as {{a unique}} Spanish response to the 1515-1648 rupture in European political thought; the latter afterwards degenerated into absolutism, liberalism, totalitarism, and most recently into secular, parliamentarian, free-market, nation-state democracies. Traditionalism itself was politically best embodied in Carlism. Its essence was threefold. First, it consisted of Catholic unity; some scholars claim that Tejada was opposed to religious liberty, others maintain that he was opposed to equality of faiths and advocated a state-endorsed Catholic orthodoxy. Second, it embraced historical, social, accountable, representative, foral, federative, missionary, organic and hereditary monarchy. Third, {{it was based on}} a subsidiary state model. The latter marked total reversal from original Tejada's penchant for omnipotent leadership and reflected the Traditionalist logic of state serving society, society serving man, and man serving God. A de-centralized withdrawn state, with is functions reduced, is to provide merely a framework for communities making it up, developed historically and safeguarded by separate legal establishments; The communities in question are to be governed by autonomous intermediary bodies and should participate in state politics represented in the Cortes by delegates of various [...] "gremios, hermandades, agrupaciones, cámaras, comunidades y cofradías"; Tejada juxtaposed Spanish communitarian fueros against the French individual liberties. According to some, the proposal advanced by Tejada was intended as a discussion how Spain should look <b>like</b> <b>after</b> Franco.|$|E
