5|$|Alma crossed southeastern Georgia as a {{tropical}} storm, damaging a few houses and causing <b>light</b> <b>damage.</b> The storm re-intensified into a hurricane over the western Atlantic Ocean, and its outer rainbands dropped heavy rainfall in Wilmington, North Carolina. Alma encountered colder water temperatures and its intensity decreased {{to being an}} extratropical cyclone on June13. Its remnants dissipated a day later over Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|June 22, 1972- Tropical Storm Agnes {{passes to}} the east of the state, {{dropping}} moderate amounts of rainfall of up to 7.6inches (193mm) in Middletown and causing higher than normal tides. The storm causes <b>light</b> <b>damage</b> and 1 death in Delaware.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced <b>light</b> <b>damage</b> in the Outer Banks, {{primarily from}} flooding and high winds. Over 100houses were damaged, while numerous cars were disabled from the flooding. Damage totaled about $7.5million (2004USD). Alex produced strong waves and rip tides along the East Coast of the United States, causing one death and several injuries.|$|E
50|$|When U-371 first {{attempted}} to surface after crippling the Menges, depth charges forced her back down, while putting {{out all the}} <b>lights,</b> <b>damaging</b> the hydroplanes, and rupturing the trim tanks. The U-boat levelled off at about 200 - 215 m, leaking badly. The depth charge attacks continued at about 30-minute intervals, with increasing accuracy, and the U-boat sustained further damage.|$|R
40|$|Simple beaker {{experiments}} {{established that}} <b>light</b> <b>damages</b> fecal coliforms in waste stabilization ponds by an oxygen-mediated exogenous photosensitization. Wavelengths {{of up to}} 700 nm were able to damage bacteria. The ability of wavelengths of > 425 nm to damage fecal coliforms was dependent {{on the presence of}} dissolved sensitizers. The sensitizers were ubiquitous in raw sewage, unaffected by sewage treatment, not derivatives of bacteriochlorophyll or chlorophyll, absorbed well in UV light, and had a slight yellowish color; they are therefore believed to be humic substances. The ability of <b>light</b> to <b>damage</b> fecal coliforms was highly sensitive to, and completely dependent on, oxygen. Scavengers of H 2 O 2 and singlet oxygen could protect the bacteria from the effects of sunlight, but scavengers of hydroxyl radicals and superoxides could not. Light-mediated damage of fecal coliforms was highly sensitive to elevated pH values, which also enabled light with wavelengths of > 425 nm (in the presence of the sensitizer) to damage the bacteria. We conclude that humic substances, pH, and dissolved oxygen are important variables in the process by which <b>light</b> <b>damages</b> microorganisms in this and other environments and that these variables should be considered in future research on, and models of, the effects of light...|$|R
50|$|The oak {{has been}} hit {{repeatedly}} by <b>lighting,</b> <b>damaging</b> the branches and hollowing out the center. During restoration in the 1970s an old hideout of the Forest Brothers was found inside the cavity. Seven people could stand inside the tree before {{it was filled with}} 8 t of reinforced concrete. The tree is still viable, although it has lost its top because of the lightning strikes.|$|R
5|$|The storm {{first brought}} gusty winds and heavy {{rainfall}} to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. While it was weakening, Alma produced flooding {{in central and}} eastern Cuba, causing seven deaths and forcing 3,000people to evacuate. Moderate precipitation spread across Florida, while thunderstorms from the storm caused <b>light</b> <b>damage</b> and killed one girl. Moisture from the storm spread up the Atlantic coast.|$|E
5|$|A light {{storm surge}} of 1 to 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) was {{reported}} along the northeast Florida coast into southeastern Georgia. The storm's outer rainbands dropped light rainfall of around 1 inch (25 mm) across coastal Florida, northward to North Carolina. A station on Bermuda reported sustained winds of 47 mph (76 km/h), with gusts to 78 mph (126 km/h). Only <b>light</b> <b>damage</b> {{occurred on the}} island.|$|E
5|$|After {{moderate}} beach erosion {{from previous}} hurricanes Dennis and Floyd, Irene caused significant beach erosion {{on the eastern}} Florida coastline. The erosion exposed the foundations of private homes, leaving some uninhabitable. Beach erosion damage totalled to $21million. Many beach access points were closed until more sand could be pumped in, or until the stairways were rebuilt. Strong north winds and high seas severely destroyed or damaged docks in the Indian River Lagoon. Heavy rainfall, ranging from 5 to 9inches (127 to 229mm) in Martin and St. Lucie Counties flooded 260homes. Strong wind gusts from 60 to 70mph (97 to 113km/h) severely damaged 34houses and caused <b>light</b> <b>damage</b> to 1,114homes in Martin, St. Lucie, and Brevard Counties. In addition the winds damaged 465mobilehomes, 15severely, and destroyed one. 555commercial buildings also experienced <b>light</b> <b>damage,</b> and gusty winds downed about 1,000trees. Rough seas broke a large barge free from its mooring into a bridge on Florida Highway 528. In Flagler County, the hurricane caused severe damage to four homes, and minor damage to 173houses and 18businesses. Damage in northeastern Florida totaled to $51million.|$|E

5000|$|Mornington Island {{recorded}} {{more than}} 300 mm (12 in) of precipitation in a 24&#8209;hour period and experienced gusts of 100 km/h (60 mph). A few {{houses in the}} island lost power. [...] However, only <b>light</b> <b>damages</b> occurred, {{and there were no}} casualties on the island. The town of Karumba also experienced heavy damage, with the storm surge damaging the beach. The towns Burketown and Doomadgee in Queensland were isolated for two weeks due to flooded roads.|$|R
5|$|Although Blanca {{remained}} {{far from}} Jalisco, large swells and rip currents {{produced by the}} hurricane claimed four lives. In Northwestern Mexico, watches and warnings were raised prior to the storm's landfall. Blanca caused generally <b>light</b> <b>damage</b> in the region, consisting of downed trees and power lines. Remnant moisture from the system spread across the Southwestern United States, resulting in several days of scattered thunderstorms. Flash flooding occurred in multiple states, washing out roads and damaging homes, though the overall effects were limited.|$|E
5|$|German {{casualties}} {{amounted to}} three Bf 109s destroyed, two severely damaged, and two Bf 110s severely damaged. Seven Bf 110s and one Bf 109 suffered <b>light</b> <b>damage.</b> Johann Fuhrmann and Roman Stiegler {{were the only}} pilots to die in this action. A third—Dietrich Robitzsch from Jagdgruppe 101—wrote-off a Bf 109 but was uninjured. Two pilots were wounded: Feldwebel Hans Troitzsch (Bf 109) and Leutnant Gustav Uellenbeck (Bf 110).|$|E
5|$|Nina {{never made}} {{landfall}} while active, although some forecasts called for Nina {{to be the}} first hurricane to make landfall on Hawaii, but the hurricane veered west before landing. However, it came close enough to Hawaii to cause <b>light</b> <b>damage</b> and prompt evacuations. Nina was the first hurricane to affect the island of Kauai at that intensity. This storm was preceded by a winter storm that caused damaging surf along the north coast of Kauai and was both preceded and proceeded by cold fronts sweeping over Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Strong {{winds and}} rough surf caused {{moderate}} coastal damage to southern portions of Saint Lucia; the combination impacted houses near {{the coast and}} also led to losses in the banana crop. Minor roof damage was also reported, and damage totalled $2.6million (2004USD $ USD)) on the island; three serious injuries were reported on the island due to the hurricane, though no fatalities were reported. In Dominica, winds reached 43mph (69km/h). High waves from Ivan caused <b>light</b> <b>damage</b> to southwestern Martinique and Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 28January 1945 was an {{inconclusive}} naval {{battle of}} the Second World War fought between two British Royal Navy light cruisers and three Kriegsmarine (German navy) destroyers near Bergen, Norway. The battle was both the last of many actions between British and German warships off Norway during the war, and the second last surface engagement to be fought by the Kriegsmarine. It resulted in heavy damage {{to one of the}} German destroyers and <b>light</b> <b>damage</b> to another destroyer and both British cruisers.|$|E
5|$|The Jamaican general {{election}} scheduled for August 27 was postponed until September 3, {{at which point}} they went ahead as planned. Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller of unnecessarily extending {{the state of emergency}} (and related curfews) to maintain her political control as predictions at the time suggested that she and her party would be ousted by the opposition. She and her party ultimately did lose the election, although Dean's <b>light</b> <b>damage</b> was not thought to have been a major factor.|$|E
50|$|If {{the rate}} of neutral {{mutations}} in a sequence {{is assumed to be}} constant (clock-like), and if most differences between species are neutral rather than adaptive, then the number of differences between two different species can be used to estimate how long ago two species diverged (see molecular clock). In fact, the mutation rate of an organism may change in response to environmental stress. For example, UV <b>light</b> <b>damages</b> DNA, which may result in error prone attempts by the cell to perform DNA repair.|$|R
