25|$|Within the {{limestone}} areas of Wales, there have arisen karstic landscapes during the postglacial period, though elements {{of these were}} initiated during and even before successive ice ages. <b>Limestone</b> <b>pavements</b> are best developed along the 'north crop' within the Brecon Beacons National Park and there are numerous sinkholes and shakeholes, together with sinks, sections of dry valley and resurgences. Cave development is extensive and includes systems such as Ogof Ffynnon Ddu (Britain's deepest cave), Dan-yr-ogof (partly showcave) and Wales' most extensive system Ogof Draenen.|$|E
500|$|Mount Tymfi {{represents}} {{a series of}} uplifted fault blocks and faulted escarpments and is largely composed of Palaeocene-Eocene limestone, with some exposures of Campanian-Jurassic dolomite and limestone on the northern scarp. The lower slopes are dominated by younger flysch rocks, which consist of thin beds of graded sandstones intercalated with softer, fissile siltstones. Extended glacial conditions prevailed on the uplands of Mount Tymfi during the Late Quaternary period, ca. 28,000 years ago. The glacial landscape is well-developed, especially on the southern slopes of Mount Tymfi, across the Astraka-Gamila plateau, and in the upland terrain above the villages of Skamneli and Tsepelovo, where lateral and terminal moraines form major landscape features.

2500|$|Around 360 {{million years}} ago during the Carboniferous period, England was lying at the equator, covered by the warm shallow waters of the Rheic Ocean. During this time Carboniferous Limestone was deposited, as found in the Mendip Hills, in the Peak District of Derbyshire, north Lancashire and the {{northern}} Pennines. The erosion of this landscape by carbonation has led to very distinctive scenery.

The area contains roches moutonnées, dolines and <b>limestone</b> <b>pavements</b> {{as a consequence of the}} ice ages. In addition moraines have been left behind by various glacial periods. The Platt was completely covered by a glacier for the last time at the beginning of the 19th century. Today 52% of it consists of scree, 32% of bedrock and 16% of vegetation-covered soils, especially in the middle and lower areas.|$|E

50|$|Conditions for <b>limestone</b> <b>pavements</b> {{are created}} when an {{advancing}} glacier scrapes away overburden and exposes horizontally bedded limestone, with subsequent glacial retreat {{leaving behind a}} flat, bare surface. Limestone is slightly soluble in water and especially in acid rain, so corrosive drainage along joints and cracks in the limestone can produce slabs called clints isolated by deep fissures called grikes or grykes (terms derived from a northern English dialect). If the grykes are fairly straight and the clints are uniform in size, the resemblance to man-made paving stones is striking, but often they are less regular. <b>Limestone</b> <b>pavements</b> that develop beneath a mantle of topsoil usually exhibit more rounded forms.|$|E
