50|$|The queue takes a {{right turn}} inside the UFO and then sharp left {{turn into the}} {{boarding}} area. The loading and unloading sections are separate, so riders in the <b>loading</b> <b>side</b> of the station see an empty train returning. Inside the loading station there are pods which contain mannequins dressed in the park's souvenir clothing and wrapped in plastic to look like they've been captured by the aliens. While the train is loading and waiting to be dispatched, a sound effect is played that imitates a jet engine warming up. As the train was dispatched, a sound effect similar to a take off was played and {{the lights in the}} launch tunnel flickered in a wave pattern. In addition, the two stations are the only parts of the ride which had much lighting; most of the ride is in the dark. As such, the Flight of Fear buildings at Kings Island and Kings Dominion have also been used to store trains and parts for other rides; the Kings Island Flight of Fear building formerly held the trains for that park's defunct stand-up coaster, King Cobra and still holds some of the seats removed from The Crypt.|$|E

40|$|Deeper {{deregulation}} {{in power}} supply industry has made reactive power ancillary service management a critical task to power system operators from both technical and economic perspectives. This paper proposes a practical market-based reactive power ancillary service management scheme to tackle the challenge. Reactive power ancillary service procurement and settlement issues are addressed in the paper. Least cost solution is applied to ensure optimal reactive power dispatch when procuring reactive power support. The total minimum reactive cost is separated into two components: one is assigned to the generation side while {{the other to the}} <b>loading</b> <b>side.</b> Cost responsibility of the <b>loading</b> <b>side</b> is recovered from reactive power charge of the reactive loads taking the amount of reactive power and location into account. On the other hand, cost responsibility of the generation side is equitably allocated to generators according to their different obligations of providing reactive power to support their own active power delivery in a transmission grid. Reactive power cost compensation to a generator is based on the incurred cost of its reactive power contribution less the cost of its obligation to support the active power delivery. Reactive OPF formulation is developed as an analysis tool and the validity of the proposed scheme is examined using a modified IEEE 14 -bus system. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyze the effect of {{clenching}} on the biomechanical response of human mandible and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) to traumatic force by the finite element (FE) method. Material and Methods: FE models of the mandible and the TMJ in resting and clenching positions were prepared. Distribution and magnitude of von Mises stress were analyzed by applying force as a point load in the symphyseal, canine, body and angle regions of the mandible. In addition, strain energy density (SED) at the articular disc and in posterior connective tissue of TMJ was analyzed. Results: In the resting position, von Mises stress was mainly concentrated at the condylar neck and in the retromolar region of the mandible. In the clenching position, the stress at the condylar neck decreased in all loadings. The stress in the retromolar region similary decreased in the symphyseal, canine and body loading, respectively; however, higher stress was observed in the retromolar region on the <b>loading</b> <b>side</b> in the angle loading. High SED was generated at the articular disc and in posterior connective tissues of TMJ in the resting position. The SED in these tissues decreased in all loadings in the clenching position. Conclusions: Clenching generally reduces stress at the condylar neck and in the retromolar region of the mandible, and strain energy at the articular disc and in posterior connective tissue of TMJ by traumatic forces on the mandible; however, clenching induces greater stress in the retromolar region on the <b>loading</b> <b>side</b> by traumatic force to the angle region...|$|E

40|$|A large {{percentage}} of the railway bridges in the UK rail network and around Europe are of riveted construction exceeding in many cases 100 years of age.

30|$|The {{equivalent}} stress values {{in both the}} contact and fixation models were smallest for central loading, while buccal and lingual loading showed substantially equivalent values {{greater than that of}} central loading. Equivalent stress occurrence sites were observed to be high in bone surrounding the implant neck on the <b>loading</b> <b>side,</b> similar to previous reports [36, 37]. Hobo et al. [38] stated that while implants were resistant to vertical pressure, horizontal pressure (bending movements) generated torque in the implants and had more harmful effects; therefore, {{it would be wise to}} limit the occlusal contact of the superstructure to vertical pressure and avoid horizontal pressure as much as possible. This was also consistent with reports that lateral loading generated more stress than vertical loading, as is also found in Sato et al.’s report using a geometric analysis [39], and supports the existing clinical concept that a lateral force applied to an implant greatly increases the stress in the surrounding bone.|$|E
30|$|In {{agreement}} with the monotonically descending energy landscape of the dynamic proton wire, the titratable D/E sites assume distinct pKa values in different phases of the function cycle of the c-ring. More specifically, the pKa value of a given D/E site (e.g., Gluc 59 in the yeast mitochondrial FO) transiently decreases when approaching the Arg-finger (Arga 176), {{as a result of}} which the proton is released. Since it is accompanied by a large energy drop, the proton release at the V 0 −V− junction is a high probability event; so is the unidirectional rotation of the c-ring, because both events are in the same chain of Bayesian probabilities. Therefore, one can conclude that, analogous to a dropping chain at a table edge, the proton release drags the corresponding c-subunit to move toward the Arg-finger. Concurrently, the rigid-body rotation of the c-ring moves the neighboring c-subunit on the proton <b>loading</b> <b>side</b> away from the Arg-finger, and the pKa of the D/E site in this c-subunit starts returning to “normal,” permitting proton loading. Thus, the proton loading at the V+−V 0 junction requires and drives the corresponding c-subunit {{to move away from the}} Arg-finger. Being buried in the lipid bilayer environment, the “normal” pKa of the D/E site seems to be sufficiently high to attract protons from the entrance side of the membrane. At this point, it is important to clarify a common, yet false belief about the role of the Arg-finger. It is often assumed that on the proton-releasing side of the Arg-finger, the electrostatic attraction between the Arg-finger of the stator and incoming deprotonated D/E site of the c-ring contributes to the overall driving force for the c-ring rotation. However, a second, similar attraction on the proton <b>loading</b> <b>side</b> would energetically disfavor the unidirectional rotation, thus canceling the first attraction. Unfortunately, this second attraction is usually selectively ignored. In {{agreement with}} the pseudo twofold symmetry of FO as well as the reversibility of the F 1 FO type of ATP synthase machinery, our arguments presented here are likely suitable for both the ∆p-driven ATP synthesis and the ATP hydrolysis-driven proton pumping process.|$|E
30|$|For a uniporter of {{molecular}} weight ≥ 50  kDa, its major conformation changes {{are most likely}} to be slower than the diffusion-dominated substrate loading and releasing. In other words, the substrate loading (k_ 1 ^ 0 and k_ - 3 ^ 0) and releasing (k − 1 and k 3) steps are usually much faster than those of the transition- 0 (k 4 and k − 4) and transition- 1 (k 2 and k − 2) steps, as long as the substrate concentration on the <b>loading</b> <b>side</b> is sufficiently high (≫K d,L) and that on the releasing side is low (≪K d,R, implicating relatively large k − 1 and/or k 3). Thus, the terms corresponding to steps k_ 1 ^ 0, k_ - 1, k_ 3, and k_ - 3 ^ 0 in the above equations can be omitted. In other words, depending on the experimental setup as well as properties of the transporter, the rate-limiting step(s) is very likely to be at either transition- 0 or transition- 1 (or sometimes both).|$|E
