25|$|Plants {{designed}} for <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal)</b> are increasingly used in locations {{as varied as}} Germany, Victoria, Australia and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas mixture into the boiler.|$|E
50|$|Australian coal {{is either}} {{high-quality}} bituminous coal (black coal) or lower-quality <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal).</b>|$|E

50|$|Bituminous coal occurs {{primarily}} in Coleman, Eastland, Erath, Jack, McCulloch, Montague, Palo Pinto, Parker, Throckmorton, Wise, and Young counties of Texas. <b>Lignite,</b> or <b>brown</b> <b>coal,</b> occurs in deposits in the Texas Coastal Plain.|$|R
5000|$|Anthochori (Ανθοχώρι meaning [...] "flower village", before 1927: Καρούμπαλι - Karoumpali) was a {{settlement}} in Arcadia, Greece. Anthochori was demolished during 2006-8 {{in order to provide}} the Megalopoli Power Plant with <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal).</b>|$|E
50|$|Maceral {{maturity}} can {{be estimated}} by vitrinite reflectance. This gives information on the carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen composition of the coal, and determines the type of coal: <b>lignite,</b> <b>brown</b> <b>coal,</b> bituminous coal, anthracite or graphite.|$|E
50|$|The main {{rivers of}} the {{district}} is the Rhine which forms most of the north-eastern border {{of the district}}, {{as well as the}} Erft. In {{the southern part of the}} district are big open pit <b>Lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal)</b> mines.|$|E
25|$|Refined coal is {{the product}} of a coal-upgrading {{technology}} that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown)</b> <b>coals.</b> It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. The goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Depending on the situation, precombustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.|$|R
25|$|Coal {{comes in}} four main types or ranks: <b>lignite</b> or <b>brown</b> <b>coal,</b> {{bituminous}} coal or black coal, anthracite and graphite. Each {{type of coal}} has a certain set of physical parameters which are mostly controlled by moisture, volatile content (in terms of aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons) and carbon content.|$|R
50|$|Montan wax, {{also known}} as lignite wax or OP wax, is a hard wax {{obtained}} by solvent extraction of certain types of <b>lignite</b> or <b>brown</b> <b>coal.</b> Commercially viable deposits exist {{in only a few}} locations, including Amsdorf, Germany, and in the Ione Basin near Ione, California.|$|R
50|$|The {{railway network}} of Aliveri power station was {{relatively}} extensive. It {{was used to}} transport <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal)</b> from nearby mines to the power station, which was located near the sea, {{so that it could}} use sea water for cooling.|$|E
50|$|Coal mining in Ukraine {{is often}} being {{associated}} with the Donets Black Coal Basin in the eastern Ukraine, {{but there are some}} other located throughout the country. Ukraine has a well developed mining industry of bituminous coal (black or rock coal), anthracite, <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal)</b> as well as peat.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, the Gujarat state government's {{department}} of mining and geology {{pointed out that}} there were huge deposits of limestone, <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal),</b> bentonite and bauxite inside the protected area of the sanctuary and argued that the ban on mining in the sanctuary was holding back development of the local economy.|$|E
50|$|Some {{particularly}} rich uranium deposits {{are formed}} in palaeochannels which are {{filled in the}} lower parts by <b>lignite</b> or <b>brown</b> <b>coal,</b> which acts as a particularly efficient reductive trap for uranium. Sometimes, elements such as scandium, gold and silver may be concentrated within these lignite-hosted uranium deposits.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>lignite</b> or <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> to adsorb basic dyes in single and {{multicomponent}} systems is analysed using IAST. The single component isotherms were correlated well using the Langmuir (L) and Freundlich (F) isotherms {{and the same}} isotherms, as L-L, F-F, L-F and F-L were used to model the binary dye-lignite isotherms. A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the Langmuir constants in the IAST...|$|R
25|$|The {{deposits}} of coal in Sulukta mainly consist of <b>lignite</b> or <b>brown</b> <b>coal.</b> From a petrogprahic point of view, the coal of Sulukta contains fusain and clarain. Historically, Sulukta's coal was extracted using both surface and underground mining methods. Currently, it is extracted using only the underground mining method, {{as there is}} no longer any surface mining equipment in the town. Private mines have replaced almost all of the large-scale, state-owned mines of the Soviet period.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{application}} of BWEs is in <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal)</b> mining, {{where they are}} used for soft rock overburden removal {{in the absence of}} blasting. They are useful in this capacity for their ability to continuously deliver large volumes of materials to processors, which is especially important given the continuous demand for lignite.|$|E
50|$|Coal {{upgrading}} technology {{refers to}} a class of technologies developed to remove moisture and certain pollutants from low rank coals such as sub-Bituminous coal and <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal)</b> and raise their calorific values. Companies located in Australia, Germany and the United States are the principal drivers of the research, development and commercialisation of these technologies.|$|E
5000|$|A typical or showpiece {{example of}} {{bilateral}} monopoly is a <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> [...] ) mine and a lignite based power station. Since transport of lignite is not economic, the power station is located {{close to the}} mine. The mine is monopolistic in producing lignite and as the only buyer the power station acts as a monopsonist.|$|E
50|$|Refined coal is {{the product}} of the {{application}} of a coal upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown)</b> <b>coals</b> and raising their calorific values. Coal refining or upgrading technologies are typically pre-combustion treatments and/or processes that alter the characteristics of a coal before it is burned. The goals of pre-combustion coal upgrading technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when coal is burned. Depending on the situation, pre-combustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to post-combustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers. A primary benefit of refined coal is the capacity to reduce the net volume of carbon emissions that is currently emitted from power generators and would reduce the amount of emissions that is proposed to be managed via emerging carbon sequestration methodologies. Refined coal technologies have primarily been developed in the United States, several similar technologies have been researched, developed and tested in Victoria, Australia, including the Densified coal technology (Coldry Process) developed to alter the chemical bonds of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> to create a product that is cleaner, stable (not prone to spontaneous combustion), exportable and of sufficiently high calorific value to be a black coal equivalent.|$|R
30|$|Humic {{substances}} are {{the most}} widespread natural organic substances that are ubiquitous in the environment, both aquatic and terrestrial. They are found in sediments, peat, <b>lignites,</b> <b>brown</b> <b>coal,</b> sewage, composts and other deposits (Stevenson 1995; Hedges et al. 2000). Humic substances are not well defined, but are generally divided into three fractions based on their solubility in acids and alkalis: humic acid (HA) that is soluble in alkali and insoluble in acid; fulvic acid (FA) that is soluble in alkali and acid, and humin that is insoluble in both alkali and acid. Humic substances are comprised mainly of aromatic, aliphatic, phenolic and quinonic components, which are covalently bound through C–C, C–O–C and N–C bonds (Stevenson 1995). In nature, humic substances are extremely resistant to biodegradation (Paul et al. 1997). HA can absorb heavy metals and xenobiotic compounds, hence increase their solubility and mobility in water. Also during chlorination of treated water, HA can cause the formation of trihalomethanes and other carcinogenic and mutagenic substances. Therefore their presence in industrial effluents can cause damage to the ecosystem. (Morimoto and Koizumi 1983; Qi et al. 2004). Furthermore, the presence of humic compounds results in colored effluents leading to esthetic constraints when these effluents are discharged to the environment (Saar and Weber 1980; Yang and Shang 2004).|$|R
40|$|Geopolymers {{have been}} {{synthesized}} from mechanically activated <b>lignite</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> fly ash. Mechanical activation of fly ash {{has been carried}} out using laboratory ball mill. To determine the structural changes in both, the fly ash and the resulted geopolymer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements were performed. Isothermal conduction calorimetry method was applied to study the geopolymerisation reactions in mechanically non-activated (raw) and activated fly ash samples. The isothermal conduction calorimetry results showed similar peak intensity for mechanically activated (530 min) fly ash samples. However, the intensity of peak for 120 min milled <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> fly ash was the highest. The compressive strength of the specimen was found to be dependent on the grinding residence time as well as composition/type of fly ash...|$|R
5000|$|The Comal Power Plant was {{originally}} a <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal)</b> power generating facility, built starting in 1925, in New Braunfels, Comal County, Texas. [...] It {{has since been}} converted to loft apartments. At its peak, the plant supplied about 70,000 kWh. It was decommissioned in the 1970s, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Geographically {{it covers}} both the {{lowlands}} of the Lower Rhine Bay {{as well as}} the mountains and hills of the Eifel. The district has rich <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal)</b> deposits, which is used in open pit mining. Another big industry is paper production, which dates back to {{the second part of the}} 16th century. The main river in the district is the Rur.|$|E
5000|$|Australia {{contains}} 76 billion tonnes of coal reserves, or approximately 8 {{percent of}} known worldwide deposits. Australian coal deposits include both <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal)</b> and black coal. The premier producing areas for Australian coal are the Bowen Basin {{in the state}} of Queensland, the Hunter Region {{in the state of}} New South Wales, and the Latrobe Valley in the state of Victoria. http://www.australiancoal.com.au/resources.htm ...|$|E
50|$|At present, in {{the region}} of Prievidza, there is a {{developed}} mining industry of <b>lignite</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> which influences the environment in the area. Unfortunately, the chapel was situated in one of the undermined parts of the village and was endangered. That is why the representatives of the regional restoration atelier of the Monumental institute in Banská Bystrica decided to save this historical building. A unique transport in the Slovak history was planned and the 400 tonne heavy chapel was transported using wheeled transporter borrowed from Germany on December 6, 2000. It is now situated in another part of Kos which is not undermined.|$|R
40|$|Coal is {{expected}} to remain the dominant fuel for electricity generation in the Slovak republic for a considerable time in the future. Mining of <b>lignite</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> is necessary for security and stabilizes the electricity systems of this republic through the heat power Nováky (ENO). Coal combustion processes represent a significant potential for contamination of environmental components. The elemental composition of coal from the mine Cígeľ showed that coal contains variable amount of arsenic which was found due {{to the presence of}} sulfide minerals containing arsenic in the coal substance. Close monitoring of the coal quality and composition of coal ashes is therefore essential...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} extremeophile microalgae that are tolerant of low pH, we queried the AMIS database to identify any <b>lignite</b> mines (<b>brown</b> <b>coal).</b> <b>Lignite</b> is typically mined from soil which is rich in sulfur, which can give rise to low pH water bodies (Muzik 1982; Shang and Scott 2011). According to the AMIS database, the Onakawana mine (located at 81.433 longitude and 48.419 latitude) is the only abandoned lignite mine registered in Ontario. Lignite was mined there during the early 1980 ’s and no mine closure plan was filed or reported (Muzik 1982). Thus, we expected {{there to be a}} high probability of identifying low pH water bodies in proximity to the mine site where acid-tolerant high-lipid producing microalgae may be found.|$|R
50|$|The Anina mine {{still has}} large anthracite, <b>lignite,</b> <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> and oil shale {{reserves}} amounting to over 840 million tonnes. The {{large share of}} these reserves is represented by oil shale with reserves amounting to 728 million tonnes and represents the largest oil shale reserves in Romania. Other important reserves include 83 million tonnes of anthracite, 26 million tonnes of brown coal and 6 million tonnes lignite.|$|E
50|$|About 30 {{million years}} ago, {{parts of the}} Rhine Massif sank and formed a lowland region. Due to the {{subtropical}} climate at that time, there was a luxuriant plant growth of abundant varieties. About 15 million years ago, these plants died out and formed a peat layer up to 270 metres thick. From the pressure of earth layers lying over it, the peat was compressed into <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal).</b>|$|E
50|$|The North Bohemian Basin (Nordböhmisches Becken, {{formerly}} {{also the}} Teplitz-Komotauer Becken), in Czech called more often the Most Basin (Mostecká pánev), is a landscape in North Bohemia (Czech Republic). It forms the south-western and central {{parts of the}} Ústí nad Labem Region. It is among the richest European deposits of <b>lignite</b> (<b>brown</b> <b>coal),</b> which has been extracted here since {{the second half of}} 19th century, mostly by extensive surface mining.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lignite</b> {{deposits}} (soft <b>brown</b> <b>coal)</b> {{can contain}} significant uranium mineralization. Mineralization {{can also be}} found in clay and sandstone immediately adjacent to lignite deposits. Uranium has been adsorbed onto carbonaceous matter and as a result no discrete uranium minerals have formed. Deposits of this type are known from the Serres Basin, in Greece, and in North and South Dakota in the USA. The uranium content in these deposits is very low, on average less than 0.005% U3O8, and does not currently warrant commercial extraction.|$|R
40|$|Leaching of iron, manganese, zinc, {{vanadium}} {{and copper}} from fly ashes from <b>lignite,</b> black and <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> in power stations with grate combustion was compared. The ashes were leached {{according to the}} regulation 338 / 1997 by the method described in a US EPA directive, with aqueous and reagent extracts at pH 2. 9 and 4. 9. The performed experiments proved that the method of preparation of aqueous extracts has no influence {{on the amount of}} a leached metal. The amounts of a metal leached by the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) in dependence on pH of the extraction reagent differ for the studied metals and fly ashes types...|$|R
40|$|The palynolgical and the {{elemental}} composition of coals may reflect both differences in plant assemblages and depositional environment {{at the time}} of peat accumulation (Sajgó and Brukner-Wein, 2003). In this study we integrate the carbon and nitrogen isotopic biogeochemistry of Tertiary Pannonian coals with palynology to elucidate the role of different factors in coalification e. g. specified floral contributions (individual plant families), microbial activity (bacterial decay, fungal degradation) and type of mire. Bulk coal parameters, palynological characteristics and stable isotope ratios of organic C and N were measured in a survey of 45 low-rank <b>coals</b> (<b>lignites</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>coals)</b> from two different areas (samples were deposited in the Transdanubian Mid-Mountains during the Middle Eocene: 9 coal fields, mostly in paralic environment, under subtropical climate and in North Mid-Mountains during Middle Miocene: 5 coal fields in particularly paralic environment with narrow seaways and their heteropic sedimentary facies at the margin of the Pannonian Basin under warm temperate climate, probably mesophytic forest frost-free winters).
