5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy. He goes on to tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E

5000|$|Especially at ski areas, {{chairlifts}} {{are referred}} to with a ski industry vernacular. <b>A</b> one-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "single", <b>a</b> two-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "double", <b>a</b> three-person <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> “triple”, four-person <b>lifts</b> are “quads”, and <b>a</b> six-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "six pack". If the <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> detachable chairlift, it is typically referred to as <b>a</b> “high-speed” <b>lift,</b> which results in a “high-speed quad” or “high-speed six pack”.|$|R

25|$|Gatlinburg is an {{important}} tourism destination in Tennessee, with many man-made attractions, and it borders the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Ober Gatlinburg is the only ski resort in Tennessee. It has eight ski trails, three chair <b>lifts,</b> <b>a</b> wildlife encounter area, and is accessible via roads and a gondola from the city strip. The Gatlinburg Trolley, a privately funded public transit system, caters to area tourists.|$|E

25|$|A wagon brake has {{a handle}} which, when pushed down, extends a steel rod down {{and onto the}} stage. When fully extended, the steel rod {{actually}} <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> section of the wagon slightly off the stage floor. The bottom end of the rod has a threaded cavity that will accept an extension spindle, which in turn {{can be used to}} adjust the height of the wagon above the stage. The brake is released by raising its handle, thereby retracting the steel rod away from the stage.|$|E

500|$|Chris says {{he hates}} classic rock {{stations}} because they {{always end up}} playing We Built This City from Starship. The radio station Chris tunes in to is [...] "Classic Rock 103.7 WHTT". WHTT was the callsign for the current Boston, MA radio station WODS, a classic hits station {{at the time that}} played the same music the fictional WHTT apparently airs before flipping to Top 40 in 2012 as 103.3 Amp Radio. The station had the callsign from 1983–86. This further references Boston influences on the TV show. Another station actually holds the callsigns now, 104.1 WHTT-FM in Buffalo, NY, with the same format. After Stewie is injected with steroids, he <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> barbell on one side and says [...] "I have the power!" [...] and the show then shifts scenes the same as in Masters of the Universe. It is mentioned that Connie is the key to One-Eyed Willy’s gold, a reference to The Goonies. Paul Sorvino and Chazz Palminteri are seen acting in a fictional movie called [...] "Distracting Trumpet". After Stewie's steroids injection wears off and he jumps out the bedroom window, the music playing is from the cartoon The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to rebel from his father, Peter decides {{to reach for the}} freezer to take out some ice cream during dinner, much to the chagrin of Tom Tucker, who {{attempts}} to stop him. As Peter <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> spoon of ice cream to his mouth, he is warned by Tucker several times not to eat it. When he does, however, Tucker repeatedly spanks him, in reference to the 1979 drama feature Kramer vs. Kramer (even though the spanking does not occur in the movie). After author Gore Vidal appears at the radio station Brian had invited him to speak at, Vidal quickly leaves after he finds the show to be low-brow. This causes Brian to quit the show, noting that he has become [...] "worse of a sell-out" [...] than when Stewie appeared in a Butterfinger commercial. Stewie is then shown eating a Butterfinger, and says [...] "Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger", which is a parody of the many Butterfinger commercials featuring Bart Simpson, and utters the annoyed grunt, D'oh!, a phrase used regularly by The Simpsons character Homer Simpson. The bit is also a reference to the negative criticism and similarities between Family Guy and The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, [...] "Wind Chimes", [...] "Wonderful", {{and most}} parts of [...] "Vegetables" [...] were {{completely}} rerecorded with dramatically scaled-down arrangements. Jardine felt that [...] "there are some pretty cool songs on that album but I didn't like rehashing some of the Smile songs. That didn't work for me." [...] "Vegetables" [...] was reworked {{as a kind of}} campfire song, [...] "Wonderful" [...] traded its harpsichord, strings, and horns with a haphazardly-played organ, high-pitched backing vocals, and a doo-wop sing-along section, and the marimbas in [...] "Wind Chimes" [...] were replaced by organ and dissonant noise. The only songs not explicitly taken from Smile are [...] "Little Pad" [...] and [...] "Gettin' Hungry". Other tracks took elements of Smile era compositions to make something slightly different; [...] "She's Goin' Bald" [...] borrows the verse melody from a Smile fragment known as [...] "He Gives Speeches", [...] "With Me Tonight" [...] is a variation on [...] "Vegetables", and [...] "Fall Breaks and Back to Winter (W. Woodpecker Symphony)" [...] <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> recurring melodic hook from [...] "". While the Beatles' Paul McCartney was present at an April 1967 session for [...] "Vegetables", the recording where he allegedly provides celery biting sounds was not used on Smiley Smile.|$|E
500|$|A common {{concern was}} that it was simply too {{vulnerable}} in traffic. Your Computer commented that [...] "a periscope would be handy if you intended driving the C5 on busy roads since your head is only at bonnet level." [...] The Guardian's motoring correspondent wrote of her [...] "grave misgivings about its use in congested traffic... On a sharp turn it too easily <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> rear wheel, is hazardously silent, and low down. It disappears below a car driver's sight-line when pulling up alongside. The prospect of these vehicles merging into heavy traffic, dwarfed by heavy lorries, buses, and cars, is worrying. Their low speed risks turning them into mobile chicanes for other traffic." [...] Another Guardian writer wrote that he [...] "would not want to drive [...] C5 in any traffic at all. My head was on a level with the top of a juggernaut's tyres, the exhaust fumes blasted into my face. Even with the minuscule front and rear lights on, I could not feel confident that a lorry driver so high above the ground would see me." [...] Sinclair issued a publicity photograph showing the C5's industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, in a C5 alongside a cardboard cutout of an Austin Mini to illustrate that the C5 driver's seated position was actually higher than that of a Mini driver.|$|E
50|$|A {{top station}} (Bergstation) or upper station {{is usually the}} highest station of <b>an</b> aerial <b>lift,</b> <b>a</b> funicular, <b>a</b> T-bar <b>lift</b> or <b>a</b> rack railway. The lowest station is the valley station. Passengers or skiers usually alight at the top station.|$|R

2500|$|Harpsichords vary in {{size and}} shape, but {{all have the same}} basic mechanism. The player {{depresses}} a key that rocks over a pivot in the middle of its length. The other end of the key <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> jack (a long strip of wood) that holds a small plectrum (a wedge-shaped piece of quill, often plastic in the 2010s), which plucks the string. [...] When the player releases the key, the far end returns to its rest position, and the jack falls back. The plectrum, mounted on a tongue that can swivel backwards away from the string, passes the string without plucking it again. [...] As the key reaches its rest position, a felt damper atop the jack stops the string's vibrations. These basic principles are explained in detail below.|$|E
2500|$|The PANYNJ broke {{ground on}} a $365 million {{improvement}} plan in December 2016. [...] Completion {{is expected in}} 2018.

'The {{construction}} of his painting {{turns on the}} orchestration of these geometrical volumes, which shift their position, develop, interweave following the movements in space of the painter himself.

These architectural combinations of cubes supported the image as it appears to the senses, that of a woman whose torso is naked, holding in her left hand a cup while with the other hand she <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> spoon to her lips. It can be easily understood that Metzinger is trying to master chance, he insists that each of the parts of his work must enter into a logical relationship with all the others. Each should, precisely, justify the other, the composition should be an organism as rigorous as possible and anything that looks accidental should be eliminated, or at least kept under control. None of that prevented either the expression of his temperament or the exercise of his imagination.' (Albert Gleizes) ...|$|E
