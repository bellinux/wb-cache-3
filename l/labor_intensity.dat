40|$|Please do not cite or {{circulate}} {{without permission}} from the authors This paper studies the effects of explicitly considering the agricultural sector on development accounting exercises. In particular, we first study why labor does not flow out of agriculture in poor countries given the particularly low labor productivity of agriculture relative to nonagriculture. We then analyze how potential explanations to this question affect development accounting. These potential explanations include: (1) differences in human capital; (2) home production and unmeasured output; (3) mismeasured inputs; and (4) differences in the <b>labor</b> <b>intensities</b> of the production functions across sectors. We use available data to assess such differences. This paper also proposes a methodology for development accounting for multisectoral models. We find that the explicit consideration of agriculture significantly increases the contribution of factors of production and reduces the role of TFP in explaining cross-country income differences. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Paterson strikers mobilized {{after years}} of declining wages, {{continued}} poor working conditions, and long work days. The increasing number {{of women and children}} in the labor supply due to changing social customs and improved health through technological advances provided cheaper labor for mill owners and reduced demand for more expensive male laborers, bidding down their wages. [...] In addition, technological advances in silk production reduced demand for skilled labor in the silk mills of Paterson. New technology in silk mills in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts which allowed weavers to run multiple looms at once posed significant competition to smaller New Jersey shops which manufactured silk much less efficiently and at a much higher cost. [...] In response to these much larger corporate mills with multiple-loom systems and in order to stay in business in the long run, New Jersey’s mills had to respond by adopting the more efficient technology. High skilled weavers such as those in ribbon shops thus fought against multiple-loom systems. The reduced <b>labor</b> <b>intensity</b> of the new silk industry also meant that low skilled broad-silk weavers would be displaced and hurt by the industry changes.

Depending on what the particular product is, the process could take up to 45 days. Most professional artisans go through six to seven years of training.Olive wood is used because it is easier to carve than other woods and could be done accurately with simple hand tools. Also, it has a diverse variety of natural color and tonal depth, due to the annual structure. It is also resistant to decay and receptive to a number of surfacing treatments.The olive tree’s wood is widely used in the manufacturing of various artistic, religious, and historical works such as cups, crosses, engraved key chains, Christian magnets, kitchen items, rosary beads, rosary boxes, tree ornaments, flower vases, and wall decorations.|$|E

This study was done to investigate the factors that affect quality and <b>intensity</b> of <b>labor</b> pain in order to decrease the rate of elective cesarean sections. Method: a prospective randomized study was performed on 208 parturient women in Maternity ward of afzalipour Hospital by using McGill Pain Questionnaire. Results: Mean age of participants was 25. 23 ± 5. 54 years old. Comparison of intensity and quality of pain between stage I and Stage II of labor showed higher pain intensity in stage II (P< 0. 0001). Nuliparous women reported higher pain intensity during stage II (P= 0. 002), whereas multiparous women experienced shorter labor (P< 0. 0001). In stage II of labor with increase of age, a decrease of <b>labor</b> pain <b>intensity</b> was observed (P< 0. 001). There were no significant statistical relationships between labor pain and variables of job, education al level, weight of neonate and number of previous pregnancies in multiparous women. <b>Labor</b> pain <b>intensity</b> in women who had prenatal care in obstetrician's clinics was lower than others.

The present analysis employs a normalized, restricted quadratic profit function approach to estimate lumber supply and Marshallian factor demand elasticities for three Canadian regions. Results indicate that the lumber supply elasticity in the British Columbia coast region may be twice as large as that in the interior or eastern regions. Comparison of Hicksian factor demand elasticities with earlier studies suggests that the own price elasticity of labor demand may be two or more times larger than that for wood. Results also indicate differential time trends in Marshallian lumber output and wood demand elasticities across regions, rising in the British Columbia coast and falling elsewhere over the past two decades.

This locomotive's specific 44-short ton weight was directly related to one of the efficiencies the new diesel locomotives offered compared to their steam counterparts: reduced <b>labor</b> <b>intensity.</b> In the 1940s, the steam to diesel transition was in its infancy in North America, and railroad unions were trying to protect the locomotive fireman jobs that were redundant with diesel units.

However, in agricultural work, where the work environment is poorer and the socio-psychological stress is high due to the high <b>labor</b> <b>intensities</b> of the industry, current research efforts have been scarce, {{and the number of}} available tools is small. In our preliminary studies, which focused on a limited number of body parts and other working elements, we developed separate evaluation tools for the upper and lower extremities. The current study was conducted to develop a whole-body ergonomic assessment tool for agricultural work that integrates the existing assessment tools for lower and upper extremities developed in the preliminary studies and to verify the relevance of the integrated assessment tool. To verify the relevance of the Agricultural Whole-Body Assessment (AWBA) tool, we selected 50 different postures that occur frequently in agricultural work. Our results showed that the AWBA-determined risk levels were similar to the subjective risk levels determined by experts. In addition, as the risk level increased, the average risk level increased to a similar extent. Moreover, the differences in risk levels between the AWBA and expert assessments were mostly smaller than the differences in risk levels between other assessment tools and the expert assessments in this study. In conclusion, the AWBA tool developed in this study was demonstrated to be appropriate for use as a tool for assessing various postures commonly assumed in agricultural work. Moreover, we believe that our verification of the assessment tools will contribute to the enhancement of the quality of activities designed to prevent and control work-related musculoskeletal diseases in other industries...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{agricultural}} investments (LSAIs) {{in general}} and their socio-economic implications in particular have been heavily debated in recent years. While some claim that LSAIs are an important catalyst for development in neglected rural areas, others caution that they pose a risk to rural communities' livelihoods. The extent to which LSAIs provide benefits for local communities is hence still contested. This paper sets out to conceptually understand what effects {{the establishment of a}} large-scale farm has on the rural labor market in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, we empirically address the question of whether large-scale farming as recorded in the Land Matrix creates or destroys employment. We develop a transition matrix to identify several scenarios based on key determinants of the direct employment creation potential of LSAIs, namely the former land use, the crop type and the production model. We empirically assess the actual importance of these scenarios and the employment creation to be expected from this sample of LSAIs based on <b>labor</b> <b>intensities.</b> We further look into the net employment effects for land formerly used by smallholder farmers. Our analysis shows that LSAIs massively crowd out smallholder farmers, which is only partially mitigated through the cultivation of labor intensive crops and the application of contract farming schemes. This holds true for all regions targeted by LSAIs, although regional differences are found in terms of magnitude. The paper concludes that these effects tend to be large on the local scale (i. e., in the immediate surroundings of the investment site) but small in relation to total national employment in agriculture. However, indirect employment creation related to LSAIs, which is discussed but not empirically addressed in this paper, needs {{to be taken into account}} to have the full picture...|$|R
