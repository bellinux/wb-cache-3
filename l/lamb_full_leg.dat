40|$|The {{meniscus}} {{is important}} in many aspects of knee function. The placement of meniscus where been located between the two bones of femur and tibia gives an advantage towards the knee joint. It is when the load been transmitted across the joint {{in order to give}} maximal congruency towards the joint. This study will focuses on two objectives which are to observe the effects towards the knee joint which having various cases of meniscus and also to observe the functionality of the meniscus which is wedges in shape. The method used in this study is a simulation of knee joint which is consisting of three main parts, femur, tibia and meniscus. In order to observe what the effects towards the knee joint, various cases is being simulated which are knee joint with healthy meniscus compared with knee joint with various of torn meniscus and a simulation of <b>full</b> <b>leg</b> with and without knee pad with existence of external impact. The boundary condition of force parameter is calculated from the ball velocity after being kicked where the comparison between the two types of kicking result with instep kicking got high impact force and distributed force than inside kicking. The highest distributed force then is used for the simulation. Simulation result shows that a healthy meniscus transmits load across the joint in a uniform state within the range of 0. 3 MPa and 0. 4 MPa. For torn meniscus, the result shows that it is failed to transmit the load across the joint. Thus an excessive stress is recorded {{across the surface of the}} tibia. The highest stress recorded is 0. 5 MPa. For second simulation, 1000 N is used as an external force exerted to the leg surface. Result shows that the external force applied on the surface of the leg will give an effect towards the internal part of the knee joint where causing the knee joint to bend and meniscus to be compressed. Comparison between the <b>full</b> <b>leg</b> with and without knee pad shows that <b>full</b> <b>leg</b> without knee pad is having large of knee joint bending and meniscus be compressed more than <b>full</b> <b>leg</b> with knee pad. From these to simulation, an observation can be made where the placement of the meniscus between the femur and tibia is to maintain the congruency between the bones and to prevent an excessive stress happen to the joint...|$|R

30|$|Deformities {{around the}} knee should {{be subject to}} a {{systematic}} deformity analysis using standardized <b>full</b> <b>leg</b> standing radiographs [20]. In this sample, a femoral deformity was identified as the origin of the varus of the leg. Each deformity should be corrected at its source otherwise joint-line obliquity will be the result [5, 21]. Accordingly, valgus osteotomies are performed at the tibial level, femoral level or both levels simultaneously depending on the source of the deformity (i.e. a tailored approach) [3]. Joint-line obliquity is to be avoided as it results in increased shear stresses at the cartilage joint surface (even tibiofemoral subluxation) and may hamper subsequent joint replacement surgery.|$|R

40|$|Background: Total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is {{an effective}} and cost-effective treatment for end-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA). During TKA {{it is important that}} correct lower limb alignment is achieved, because malalignment may lead to component loosening, abnormal component wear and patellofemoral problems. It is important to assess lower limb alignment and determine prosthesis alignment after TKA. Computer assisted surgery (CAS) has been developed for this purpose and improves postoperative lower limb alignment and reduces the outliers in malalignment. Pre- and postoperative lower limb alignment used to be determined on conventional <b>full</b> <b>leg</b> radiographs. A new imaging method, the EOS stereography system, is developed to evaluate lower limb alignment in the coronal and sagittal plane in 2 D and 3 D. EOS has several advantages over convential <b>full</b> <b>leg</b> radiographs and CT-scan. The amount of radiation is less compared to <b>full</b> <b>leg</b> radiographs and CT-scan. Moreover, alignment measurements are not affected by flexion and rotation of the lower limb, which is different from <b>full</b> <b>leg</b> radiographs. Other advantages over CT-scan are lower costs and the weight-bearing position during scanning. Previous research showed a significant difference between 2 D and 3 D alignment measurements by the EOS stereography system in patients with and without a knee prosthesis. Objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the concurrent validity and intra- and interobserver reliability of lower limb alignment measurements with the EOS stereography system in patients with before and after TKA. Methods: This study included 20 CAS-TKA’s in 17 patients. Preoperative measurements of 19 lower limbs and postoperative measurements of 16 lower limbs were analyzed. Concurrent validity was assessed by comparing pre- and postoperative measurements of EOS with CAS peroperative. Preoperative lower limb alignment was measured twice by two observers with a standard and extended 3 D reconstruction. Postoperatively two observers measured the lower limb alignment twice with the standard 3 D reconstruction. Intra- and interobserver reliability was determined by means of preoperative measurements with EOS. Lower limb alignment was evaluated by measuring varus/valgus angle (VV), flessum/recurvatum angle (FR), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) and mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA). Paired T-tests, Pearson correlation coefficient and Cohen’s Kappa were used to determine validity. Intra- and interobserver realiability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Bland-Altman analyses were performed for both validity and reliability. Results: For validity, high to very high correlations were found for VV, mLDFA and mMPTA in 2 D and 3 D preoperatively (r= 0. 80 - 0. 98). There was fair to substantial agreement for VV between EOS and CAS (κ= 0. 38 - 0. 73). A significant difference of 1. 92 ° was found for VV 3 D. A bias was found between CAS and EOS, with CAS measuring on average 2. 3 ° more varus. Postoperatively there were moderate correlations for VV in 2 D and 3 D (r= 0. 47 - 0. 54) and poor to slight agreement was found between EOS and CAS (κ= 0. 00 - 0. 07). Bland-Altman analysis showed bias for VV 3 D. Intraobserver reliability was excellent for both observers, with ICCs > 0. 95 and > 0. 95. Interobserver reliability was excellent as well, with ICCs > 0. 94. Significant differences between measurements and observers were < 1 °. Discussion and conclusion: The EOS stereography system and CAS can not be used interchangeably to measure lower limb alignment, since bias exists between measurements with EOS and CAS. Preoperatively CAS measures substantially more varus alignment than 3 EOS. However, the EOS stereography provides reliable measurements of lower limb alignment in patients with end-stage OA and after TKA. ...|$|R
