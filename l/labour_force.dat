The 2011 United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report ranked India 132 out of 187 in terms of gender inequality. The value of this multidimensional indicator, Gender Inequality Index (GII) is determined by numerous factors including maternal mortality rate, adolescent fertility rate, educational achievement and <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation rate. Gender inequality in India is exemplified by women’s lower likelihood of being literate, continuing their education and participating in the <b>labour</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{analytical}} frame of discrimination, the thesis establishes a model of transfer of rural <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> into city, and researches the impact of rural <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> transfer on urban-rural income. The results show that the transfer of rural <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> into city can increase urban-rural income and bridge the income gap between city and village to a certain extent. However, the capital stock of city in China is greatly more than that of the village, so the rural <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> transfer cannot eliminate the urban-rural income gap completely. In order to elevate the rural income level in China and narrow urban-rural income gap, the government should paint a picture with two brushes at the same time: on one hand, the government should promote the transfer of rural <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> into city, and change the status quo of dual urban-rural <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> market structure; on the other hand, the government should increase the input in rural areas and promote the increase of rural capital stock so as to further increase rural residents' income in the process of <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> transfer. <b>Labour</b> <b>forces</b> transfer, Urban-rural income, Income gap, The Economics of Discrimination, China, Agribusiness,...|$|R
