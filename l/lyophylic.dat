40|$|Some years ago, {{the study}} ef systems {{containing}} particles of colloidal size became sufficiently important to warrant {{the recognition of}} a new branch ef chemistry. It seen becameevident that these disperse systems ceuld be placed definitely under one of two classes, lyophobic and <b>lyophylic.</b> The properties of these two classes of disperseids are widelydifferent; the mest important distinction, and one to {{which most of the}} other differences may be ascribed, lies in the mutual attraction between the disperse phase and the dispersion medium. In a system such as a geld hydrosol, where we have reason to believe that little or no affinity evinces itself between disperse phase and dispersion medium, we have an example of a lyophobic sel, or in this case, hydrophobic, since water ferms the continuous phase.
