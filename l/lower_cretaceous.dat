5|$|Mole cricket fossils are rare. A stem group fossil, Cratotetraspinus, {{is known}} from the <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> of Brazil. Two {{specimens}} of Marchandia magnifica in amber {{have been found in}} the <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> of Charente-Maritime in France. They are somewhat more abundant in the Tertiary amber of the Baltic and Dominican regions; impressions are found in Europe and the American Green River Formation.|$|E
5|$|I. dawsoni, {{described}} by Lydekker in 1888, is known from two partial skeletons found in East Sussex, England, {{from the middle}} Valanginian-age <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> Wadhurst Clay. It is now the type species of Barilium.|$|E
5|$|The oldest mayfly {{inclusion}} in amber is Cretoneta zherichini (Leptophlebiidae) from the <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> of Siberia. In the much younger Baltic amber numerous inclusions of several modern families of mayflies {{have been found}} (Ephemeridae, Potamanthidae, Leptophlebiidae, Ametropodidae, Siphlonuridae, Isonychiidae, Heptageniidae, and Ephemerellidae). The modern genus Neoephemera is represented in the fossil record by the Ypresian species N.antiqua from Washington State.|$|E

5|$|Hymenoptera in {{the form}} of Symphyta (Xyelidae) first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Lower Triassic. Apocrita, wasps in the broad sense, appeared in the Jurassic, and had diversified into many of the extant superfamilies by the Cretaceous; they appear to have evolved from the Symphyta. Fig wasps with modern anatomical features first appeared in the <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> of the Crato Formation in Brazil, some 65 million years before the first fig trees.|$|E
5|$|I. anglicus, {{described}} by Friedrich Holl in 1829, {{is the original}} type species of Iguanodon, but, as discussed above, was replaced by I. bernissartensis. In the past, it has been spelled as I. angelicus (Lessem and Glut, 1993) and I. anglicum (Holl, 1829 emend. Bronn, 1850). It is known from teeth from the middle Valanginian-age <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> Grinstead Clay Formation) of Cuckfield, West Sussex, England. It is currently classified in the genus Therosaurus as T. anglicus.|$|E
5|$|I. lakotaensis was {{described}} by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork in 1989. The only well-accepted North American species of Iguanodon, I. lakotaensis {{was described}} from a partial skull from the Barremian-age <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> Lakota Formation of South Dakota. Its assignment has been controversial. Some researchers suggest {{that it was more}} basal than I. bernissartensis, and related to Theiophytalia, but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of I. bernissartensis. Gregory S. Paul has since given the species its own genus, Dakotadon.|$|E

5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{completely}} known dinosaur genera. Fossils of hundreds of individuals have been collected so far, including many complete skeletons. Most age classes are represented, from hatchling through to adult, which has allowed several detailed studies of Psittacosaurus growth rates and reproductive biology. The abundance of this dinosaur in the fossil record has led to the labelling of <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> sediments of east Asia the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Charles Mortram Sternberg {{reported}} {{the presence of}} the footprints of a large, four-footed dinosaur from <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> rocks in British Columbia, Canada. He described a new ichnogenus and species for these tracks, Tetrapodosaurus borealis, and attributed them to ceratopsians. However, in 1984 paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter re-examined the British Columbian Tetrapodosaurus prints and argued that they were made by ankylosaurs rather than ceratopsians. Specifically, Carpenter concluded that these were probably the footprints of Sauropelta. Five years later, large numbers of Tetrapodosaurus tracks were discovered at the Smoky River Coal Mine near Grande Cache, Alberta. This site is considered the most important ankylosaur track site in the world.|$|E
5|$|Many fossil sites {{worldwide}} contain beetles {{from the}} Cretaceous. Most are in Europe and Asia and {{belong to the}} temperate climate zone during the Cretaceous. <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> sites include the Crato fossil beds in the Araripe basin in the Ceará, North Brazil, as well as overlying Santana formation; the latter was near the equator at that time. In Spain, important sites are near Montsec and Las Hoyas. In Australia, the Koonwarra fossil beds of the Korumburra group, South Gippsland, Victoria, are noteworthy. Major sites from the Upper Cretaceous include Kzyl-Dzhar in South Kazakhstan and Arkagala in Russia.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Rockies are {{composed}} of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff {{range in age from}} Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600–145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the <b>lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> (145–66 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east and over top younger rocks during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) on the Isle of Wight, England. The Isle of Wight is {{an island}} and county three miles off the south coast of England in the English Channel. Its geology is complex, with a chalk downland ridge running east to west through its centre and {{important}} fossil beds from the <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> to the Lower Tertiary around the coast. This geology gives rise to many distinct habitats, with strong maritime influences, including chalk grassland, neutral meadows, and broad-leaved woodland. The Isle of Wight has a population of 140,000, {{making it one of the}} country's smaller counties in terms of population.|$|E
5|$|From the Permian, {{numerous}} stem group {{representatives of}} mayflies are known, {{which are often}} lumped into a separate taxon Permoplectoptera (e.g. including Protereisma permianum in the Protereismatidae, and Misthodotidae). The larvae of Permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills, and the adults still had long hindwings. Maybe the fossil family Cretereismatidae from the <b>Lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> Crato Formation of Brazil also belongs as the last offshoot to Permoplectoptera. The Crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern mayfly families or the extinct (but modern) family Hexagenitidae. However, from the same locality the strange larvae and adults of the extinct family Mickoleitiidae (order Coxoplectoptera) have been described, which represents the fossil sister group of modern mayflies, {{even though they had}} very peculiar adaptations such as raptorial forelegs.|$|E

5|$|Protosuchians were small, mostly {{terrestrial}} animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor {{in the form}} of two rows of plates extending from head to tail, and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces, and their bony palates were little developed. The mesosuchians saw a fusion of the palatine bones to form a secondary bony palate and a great extension of the nasal passages to near the pterygoid bones. This allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under the water. The eusuchians continued this process with the interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface, allowing for a ball and socket type joint between the vertebrae, bringing greater flexibility and strength. The oldest known eusuchian is Hylaeochampsa vectiana from the <b>lower</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> of the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It was followed by crocodilians such as the Pristichampsidae, the so-called 'hoofed crocodiles', in the Palaeogene. Spanning the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods is the genus Borealosuchus of North America, with six species, though its phylogenetic position is not settled.|$|E

30|$|Tight oil is most {{prolific}} in North America, South America, Africa, and Russia, mainly in foreland basins, craton basins (Paleozoic strata), and continental rift basins (Mesozoic strata). Tight oil resources mainly accumulate in Upper Silurian–Middle Ordovician, Upper Devonian–Lower Carboniferous, Permian, <b>Lower</b> Jurassic, <b>Cretaceous,</b> and Oligocene–Miocene, which are well {{correlated with the}} six sets of high-quality source rocks globally. Tight reservoirs adjacent to or in the high-quality source rocks are favorable targets for tight oil exploration.|$|R
50|$|Hampshire's geology broadly {{comprises}} a gently folded {{succession of}} sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods. The <b>lower</b> (early) <b>Cretaceous</b> rocks are sandstones and mudstones whilst those of the upper (late) Cretaceous are the various formations which comprise the Chalk Group and give rise to the county's downlands. Overlying these rocks are the less consolidated Palaeogene clays, sands, gravels and silts of the Lambeth, Thames and Bracklesham Groups which characterise the Hampshire Basin.|$|R
