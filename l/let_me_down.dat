5|$|Ultimately, {{given the}} {{negative}} {{reaction to the}} Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> album and this tour, Bowie found himself creatively exhausted and in low critical standing. Bowie {{decided to return to}} making music for himself, and, having been put in touch with Reeves Gabrels through his publicist for the Glass Spider Tour, Bowie formed his band Tin Machine in 1989 and retired his back catalogue of songs from live performance with his Sound+Vision Tour in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Glass Spider is {{a concert}} film by English writer, singer and actor David Bowie. The release was sourced from eight shows {{during the first}} two weeks of November 1987 at the Sydney Entertainment Centre in Australia during the last month of the Glass Spider Tour. The 86-show tour, which also visited Europe, North America and New Zealand, was in support of Bowie's album Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> (1987). Originally {{released}} in 1988 on VHS, the tour was choreographed by Toni Basil, directed by David Mallet, and produced by Anthony Eaton. The VHS was released by MPI Home Video in the US and by Video Collection International in the UK.|$|E
500|$|... "Day-In Day-Out" [...] {{was written}} by Bowie {{at his home in}} Montreux, Switzerland, along with {{most of the rest of}} Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> in mid-1986. It was {{recorded}} in the autumn of 1986 at Mountain Studios in the same city. The singer penned the song out of concern for the treatment of the homeless in the United States, a foray into social commentary that he would further pursue with his grunge-precursor band Tin Machine two years later.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot in 1987, being banned by some stations {{as a result of}} its content, although it was still nominated for a 1987 MTV Video Music award in the category of [...] "Best Male Video". Commercially, [...] "Day-In Day-Out" [...] was the most successful single from Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down,</b> peaking at number 17 in the United Kingdom as well as charting within the top 40 in several other countries.|$|E

Take the rather rummy case, for instance, of dear old Bicky and his uncle, the hard-boiled egg.|$|R

500|$|Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> is {{the seventeenth}} studio album by David Bowie, {{released}} on 20 April 1987 {{on the label}} EMI America. Bowie conceived the album {{as the foundation for}} a theatrical world tour, writing and recording most of the songs in Switzerland. He considered the record a return to rock and roll music. Three singles were released from the album, [...] "Day-In Day-Out", [...] "Time Will Crawl" [...] and [...] "Never Let Me Down", which all reached the UK Top 40.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{was given}} {{a role in the}} 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly {{received}} by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named [...] "Absolute Beginners", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down,</b> where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits [...] "Day-In, Day-Out" [...] (his 60th single), [...] "Time Will Crawl" [...] and [...] "Never Let Me Down". Bowie later described it as his [...] "nadir", calling it [...] "an awful album". Supporting Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down,</b> and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including Britney Spears, Madonna, and U2.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Thunder" [...] is a ballad {{about finding}} the [...] "strength of rising after the fall" [...] and follows the self-empowerment {{theme of the}} album. The song begins with the lyrics [...] "First it was heaven, ev'rything roses and fire," [...] and she later proclaims [...] "I’m coming back with the thunder." [...] Lewis {{projects}} a stance of empowerment as she performs the line [...] "With an empty heart, I am free again" [...] over a [...] "striding" [...] beat accompanied by a piano. Angela Wilson of Vibe described the track as [...] "a celebratory salute to self love" [...] and highlighted the lines [...] "And I won’t wait any longer / When you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>down,</b> I got stronger," [...] as empowering. Will Hodgkinson of The Times thought that [...] "Thunder" [...] was about her former record label boss and friend Simon Cowell, writing that the lyrics [...] "I won’t wait any longer, when you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> I got stronger," [...] was Lewis' way of saying [...] "Check me out now, you high-waisted berk." [...] The song, in the key of B major, has a tempo of 92beats per minute. Lewis' voice spans more than two octaves, from F3 to G5.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought he}} might be useful, uncle," [...] said Miss Garland, coming into the room. [...] "Auntie wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> come <b>down</b> before." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Day-In Day-Out" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by English singer David Bowie, serving as the opening track for his seventeenth studio album, Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> (1987). It was issued as a single on 23 March 1987 ahead of the record's release. The recording was solely written by Bowie, while production was handled by him along with David Richards. An R track, [...] "Day-In Day-Out" [...] criticizes {{the treatment of the}} homeless in the United States at that time, and deals with the depths a young mother has to sink to feed her child.|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{relative}} antiquity by 1970, the song's lyrics lent themselves {{well to the}} themes of spiritual salvation and friendship that define All Things Must Pass, being consistent with the karmic subject matter {{of much of the}} album. In his 1980 autobiography, Harrison explains: [...] "'Isn't It a Pity' is about whenever a relationship hits a down point... It was a chance to realise that if I felt somebody had <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>down,</b> then there's a good chance I was letting someone else down." [...] His lyrics adopt a nonjudgmental tone throughout: ...|$|E
500|$|A year later, {{while working}} with Tin Machine on their second album, he mused on his {{previous}} few albums: [...] "You can tell I was terribly unhappy {{in the late}} '80s. ... I was in that netherworld of commercial acceptance. It was an awful trip. 1983, '84, '85, '86, '87 - those five years were simply dreadful. ... Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> had good songs that I mistreated. I didn't really apply myself. I wasn't quite sure what I {{was supposed to be}} doing. I wish there had been someone around who could have told me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] she lamented; {{and then}} they began to canvas the {{probable}} intention of the manager's note. She held out passionately to the end for the most encouraging interpretation of it, {{but she did not}} feel that it would have any malign effect upon the fact for him to say, [...] "Oh, it's just a way of <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> easy," [...] and it clearly gave him great heart to say so.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Caterina,' he {{answered}} gravely; 'I want you. I have something very particular {{to say to}} you. Will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> sit <b>down</b> with you for half an hour?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> write <b>down</b> plainly what I {{think of}} these matters. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> be at least honest with myself, {{whatever}} self-contradictions I may have been led into by force of my passions. Always I have despised jealousy....|$|R
500|$|Initial {{sales of}} the album were strong but dropped off disappointingly as {{contemporary}} reviews of the album were mixed. Critic Ira Robbins wrote [...] "although this casual loud-rock outing... seems on first blush to be slapdash and slight, the first side is actually quite good, offering provocative pop-culture lyrics delivered with first-take enthusiasm and carefree backing." [...] In 1987, Spin magazine called the album [...] "an inspired and brilliantly crafted work. It's charged with a positive spirit that makes art soul food; imbued with the contagious energy that gives ideas a leg to dance on", but in 1989 a different reviewer for the magazine called the album [...] "disappointing". Rolling Stone magazine called the work an [...] "odd, freewheeling pastiche of elements from all the previous Bowies," [...] "unfocused," [...] and possibly [...] "the noisiest, sloppiest Bowie album ever. ... Being noisy and sloppy isn't necessarily a bad thing, but sad to say, Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> is also something of a mess." [...] Another critic held a general optimism for {{the potential of the}} songs on the album, complaining only that the [...] "oppressive production" [...] ruined the songs. Billboard magazine's 1987 retrospective issue called Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> [...] "arguably the year's most underrated release" [...] and considered the album a [...] "Critic's Choice" [...] for the year.|$|E
500|$|Music critics {{viewed the}} track {{as one of}} the best on Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> and listed it among the most underrated of his career. An {{accompanying}} music video for the single was shot by French director Jean-Baptiste Mondino and similarly received positive response. Commercially, [...] "Never Let Me Down" [...] reached number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. It was aided by a CD release, Bowie's first, and remained the singer's last single to chart within the top 40 in the United States until [...] "Lazarus" [...] (2015).|$|E
500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] was {{released}} in June 1987 by EMI, featuring a cover version Tina Turner's [...] "Girls" [...] (1987) as its B-side. In 2008, a newly-remixed version of the song (the [...] "MM Remix" [...] produced by studio engineer Mario J. McNulty) was included on Bowie's iSelect compilation album, his list of all-time favorites. McNulty removed the original drum track, added new drum overdubs by drummer Sterling Campbell and included further new instrumentation, including a string quartet. At that time, Bowie indicated a desire to improve {{the rest of the}} songs from Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down,</b> but that project never materialized.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Partly that Inglewood {{is crying}} out for the master's eye,' said Louis; 'and partly that my father fancied I looked fagged, and kindly <b>let</b> <b>me</b> run <b>down</b> for a holiday.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Lend me that box,' {{said the}} stock-broker, 'and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> get <b>down</b> on your raft. What is it you've been looking at, {{and what did}} you see in that box?' ...|$|R

500|$|Bowie {{spent the}} middle of 1986 in his home in Switzerland writing the songs with his friend Iggy Pop. Bowie wrote Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> with the {{intention}} of performing the songs in a theatrical show. He then recorded a few demos with Erdal Kızılçay before working on the album with the full band. For the first time since his Scary Monsters album, Bowie played instruments on the record in addition to singing. For some tracks on the album, Bowie played keyboards, synthesizer, rhythm guitar and on two of the album's tracks ("New York's in Love" [...] and [...] "87 and Cry"), he played lead guitar.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{released}} {{three more}} albums– David Bowie (1969), The Man Who Sold the World (1970) and Hunky Dory (1971)– before he eventually made {{it on to}} the UK Albums Chart with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), which peaked at number five. Following the success of Ziggy Stardust, sales of Hunky Dory improved and it eventually peaked at number three in the UK. RCA re-released the 1969 David Bowie [...] under the title Space Oddity (with an updated Ziggy Stardust-era photo) and The Man Who Sold the World, which reached numbers 17 and 26 in the UK respectively. Bowie released nine more studio albums with RCA, all of which reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, of which Aladdin Sane (1973), Pin Ups (1973), Diamond Dogs (1974) and Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) (1980) reached the number one position. He then released three solo studio albums with EMI– Let's Dance (1983), whose title track became his first single to reach number one in both the United Kingdom and the United States, Tonight (1984) and Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> (1987). Let's Dance and Tonight reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, while Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> reached number six. The success of Let's Dance revitalized Bowie's back catalogue: throughout the summer of 1983, he had multiple albums on the UK Albums Chart. This peaked on 16 July that year, with ten entries – a figure bettered only by Elvis Presley.|$|E
500|$|All but {{two songs}} ("Too Dizzy" [...] and [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)") from his album Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> were played live during the tour, {{although}} [...] "Shining Star" [...] {{was among the}} songs rehearsed. Other songs rehearsed but not performed were [...] "Because You're Young" [...] and [...] "Scream Like a Baby", both from Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) (1980). Several songs that Bowie had anticipated playing on the tour were abandoned before rehearsals even started, including [...] "Space Oddity" [...] (from David Bowie (1969)), [...] "Joe the Lion" [...] (from [...] "Heroes" [...] (1977)), [...] "Ricochet" [...] (from Let's Dance (1983)), and [...] "Don't Look Down" [...] (from Tonight (1984)).|$|E
