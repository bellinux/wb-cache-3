5000|$|Rhyzopertha is a {{monotypic}} genus of beetles in {{the family}} Bostrichidae, the false powderpost beetles. The sole species, Rhyzopertha dominica, is known commonly as the <b>lesser</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> American wheat weevil, Australian wheat weevil, and stored grain borer. It is a beetle found nearly worldwide as a pest of stored cereal grains. It is also a major pest of peanuts.|$|E
50|$|Its roots can {{be ground}} into a fine powder {{which is used}} to protect stored grains. Methyl {{salicylate}} is a well-known plant stress signal which often has insect repellent properties. Methyl salicylate constitutes up to 90% of the volatile component of its roots, which is very uncommon in other grains or legume seeds. A mixture of methanol extract and methyl salicylate creates a very effective natural pesticide against weevils and other insects in stored grains. Studies done on grains such as corn and cowpea indicated that after 6 days of exposure to S. longipedunculata, the mortality rate of adult beetles was 100% in an enclosed jar. In addition, when S. longipedunculata powder was applied to grains already infested with weevils, the damage done to the grains was reduced by 65%. The beetles that are most likely to infest stored grains are Sitophilus zeamais (Maize weevil), Rhyzopertha dominica (<b>Lesser</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer),</b> and Prostephanus truncatus (Larger grain borer). Studies suggest that the Maize weevil is able to detect the scent of methyl salicylate and tends to avoid it. It is a repellent for insects as well as a poison, which helps {{to reduce the number of}} female eggs in the grains. As this type of pesticide use is very efficient, it allows storage of the grains for at least 9 months. This discovery provides some small-scale farmers in Africa with a low cost, natural alternative to synthetic pesticides. In some developing countries, it is difficult for poor farmers to access good quality and affordable synthetic pesticides. In addition these can harm the environment if they are not properly implemented. Such indigenous practices require further validation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{laboratory}} {{roller mill}} system was modified {{to measure and}} analyze the electrical conductance of wheat as it was crushed. The electrical conductance of normal wheat kernels is normally low and fairly constant. In contrast, the electrical conductance of wheat kernels infested with live insects is substantially higher, {{depending on the size}} of the larvae and the resulting contact of the crushed larvae between the rolls. This instrument was designed to detect internal insect infestations in wheat that has a moisture content of 13. 5 % or less. The laboratory mill can test a kilogram (kg) of wheat in less than 2 min and 100 g in less than 10 s. Hard red winter and soft red winter wheat containing larvae of rice weevils and <b>lesser</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borers</b> of a variety of sizes were tested. On average, the instrument detected 8. 3 out of 10 infested kernels per 100 g of wheat containing the larger sized insects (fourth instar or pupae). Kernels infested with medium‐sized larvae (second or third instar) were detected at an average rate of 7. 4 out of 10 infested kernels per 100 g of wheat. Finally, kernels infested with the small‐sized larvae (first or second instar) were detected at a rate of 5. 9 out of 10 infested kernels per 100 g of wheat. Under reasonable grain moisture contents there were no false positive errors, or noninfested kernels classified as insect infested. The cost of the mill is low and can lead to rapid and automated detection of infested wheat...|$|R
40|$|The larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> (Prostephanus truncatus) {{has been}} known for many years as a pest of farm-stored maize in Central America, but since the late 1970 s it has spread widely in Africa. In 1981 it was {{identified}} as a new pest causing severe losses to farm-stored maize in the hot, dry Tabora region of Tanzania. It subsequently spread widely within Tanzania and into Southern Kenya, Burundi and recently Malawi. In West Africa, a serious outbreak of the pest was found in 1984 in Togo, and more recently it has been identified in Ghana, Benin, Guinea Conakry, Burkina Faso and Nigeria. It is believed that the larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> has the potential to spread to all the major maize-producing regions in Africa. The larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> is also a major pest of dried cassava. Losses as high as 30 % have been recorded in some cases. Additionally, adults bore into a wide range of foodstuffs and other materials, such as wood. In heavy infestations, wooden storage structures may become damaged and act as reservoirs of infestation from which the new harvest may be attacked. Neither is the larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> restricted to stores: it occurs widely in the natural environment and is dispersed by flight. A leaflet on the larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> has been produced by the Group for Assistance on Systems Relating to Grain After Harvest (GASGA) and the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) and published by CTA. It covers recognition, distribution, life history, damage, control in storage, monitoring and sensible precautions - all succinctly covered in just a few pages. The aim of the leaflet is to create awareness and to provide guidance to extension workers and other professionals concerned with the identification and control of this pest.

Tests with Calliodis showed that although it reduced borer population eventually, it was ineffective until populations were high and damage to the grain had already been done. T. nigrescens on the other hand showed that it was well adapted to its host, its population keeping in step wit-in that of the borer. The beetle can also survive for some time without food, should the borer population be reduced, and will not attack other insects such as bees or silkworms.

40|$|The {{selection}} of grain-hosts {{by the larger}} <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> Prostephanus truncatus was investigated in environments containing both uninfested maize grains and grains previously infested by the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais. The grain-host selection preference of P. truncatus {{was reflected in the}} number of adults in each type of grain and the number of damaged grains. Results showed that P. truncatus individuals were significantly more attracted to uninfested grains than to infested grains. Several densities (according to egg density) of S. zeamais infested maize grains mixed together with uninfested grains were exposed to P. truncatus. The larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> damaged significantly more uninfested grains relative to infested ones. Infested grains seemed to have a deterrent effect on the larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer.</b> We hypothesised that this behaviour was due to larval activity and to deterrent substances deposited on maize by adults of the maize weevil. To verify the first hypothesis, adults of P. truncatus were placed with uninfested grains and infested grains bearing immature stages of S. zeamais. Results showed that the infested grains were preferentially damaged during the first two weeks, while three and four weeks after infestation with S. zeamais the uninfested grains were more damaged by P. truncatus. These observations indicated a close relationship between the development of S. zeamais larvae inside maize grains and the {{selection of}} grain-host by 19 truncatus. To test the second hypothesis, adults of P. truncatus were placed together with uninfested maize grains, and with infested grains that had been cleaned of substances deposited by S. zeamais using different organic solvents (n-hexane, ether-diethylene and methanol).

Tests were conducted in 2000 - 2001, 2001 - 2002, and 2002 - 2003, and data were analyzed separately for each year. Grain mass temperature profiles at depths of 0. 9 and 1. 8 m from the surface in the grain mass showed distinct declines in temperature for each aeration cycle {{during the first two}} years of the study, however, summer aeration did not result in as large of temperature declines in 2002 - 2003, partly because the summer aerated bin was loaded with warmer grain. The effectiveness of summer aeration was estimated using confined insect populations in tube cages placed on the surface of the grain and by sampling the grain for natural insect populations using pitfall probe traps.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The wheat {{industry}} {{is in need}} of an automated, economical, and rapid means of detecting whole wheat kernels with internal insect infestation. The feasibility of the Perten Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS) to detect internal insect infestations was studied. The SKCS monitors compression force and electrical conductance as individual kernels are crushed. Samples of hard red winter (HRW) wheat and soft red winter (SRW) wheat infested with rice weevil [Sitophilus oryzae (L.) ] and <b>lesser</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> [Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) ] were run through the SKCS and the conductance/force signals saved for post-run processing. Algorithms were developed to detect kernels with live internal insects, kernels with dead internal insects, and kernels from which insects have emerged. The conductance signal was used to detect live infestations and the force signal for dead and emerged infestations. Live insect detection rates were 24. 5 % for small-sized larvae, 62. 2 % for medium-sized larvae, 87. 5 % for large-sized larvae, and 88. 4 % for pupae. The predicted, and observed, false positive (sound kernels classified as infested) rate was 0. 01 %. Dead insect detection rates were 60. 7 % for large-sized larvae, 65. 1 % for pupae, and 72. 6 % for kernels where the insect emerged.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} the negative effect of diatomaceous earth (DE) on bulk density and grain flowability, DE was mixed with other insecticides. This paper investigates the efficacy of a mixture of DE and deltamethrin against Sitophilus zeamais, the maize weevil, Rhyzopertha dominica, the <b>lesser</b> <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> and Tribolium castaneum, the red flour beetle. Five mixtures of DE and deltamethrin were prepared in the laboratory containing the same quantity of DE and different concentrations of the active ingredient of deltamethrin. The ratio of DE and deltamethrin in formulations were: DE 1 part: deltamethrin 0. 00025, 0. 00050, 0. 00075, 0. 0010 and 0. 00125 parts. Co-toxicity and Co-efficient values higher than 100 (S. zeamais 170 – 386, R. dominica 188 – 601, and T. castaneum 157 – 285) indicated synergism between DE and deltamethrin...|$|E

40|$|The larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> a beetle pest {{introduced}} accidentally into Africa, is relentlesly spreading through maize growing areas where, if unchecked, it can decimate {{stocks of}} stored maize and dried cassava. Until 1981 the larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> (LGB), Prostephanus truncatus, {{was known as}} a pest of stored maize and dried cassava only in Central America. However in that year the beetle was confirmed as being responsible for the destruction of these crops stored on farms in central Tanzania. Following its accidental introduction into Tanzania, LGB has become firmly established on farms throughout most maize growing regions of the country, where it is now the major storage pest. Losses can be total The beetle is extremely destructive. It exhibits a preference for maize on the cob and dried cassava and, by its continual boring through the food, it reduces them to dust. LGB is also capable of damaging stored wheat, sorghum, sweet potato and groundnuts, and it will even tunnel into wooden utensils and storage structures. Maize grains and dried cassava are often so heavily damaged as to be rendered totally unfit for human consumption. The levels of loss can be exceptionally high; weight losses of 34 % have been recorded in cob maize in a crib after 3 - 6 months of storage and up to 70 % of dried cassava was considered lost after only 4 months' farm storage. Although the beetle is quite capable of flying between individual farm stores, much of its spread has been assisted by the movement of infested maize, dried cassava and perhaps used grain bags in local, regional and international trade. Infestation can be carried to uninfested areas via maize and cassava bought at rural and urban markets. The distance travelled may extend to many hundreds of kilometres along major bus and lorry routes. LGB may be spread from one country to another by similar means: pests do not respect national borders. In some areas there is much local movement of small amounts of grain across borders as head-loads, and passengers travelling on long distance buses and lorries frequently carry small quantities of maize and cassava for gifts or personal consumption. On a larger scale there are commercial export shipments of food, feed or seed maize and, to a lesser extent, dried cassava and other grains. Through various routes LGB has spread over much of Tanzania and across the borders with neighbouring countries to become established in Burundi and parts of Kenya. In 1984, as a consequence of a second accidental introduction, this time into West Africa, LGB became established in Togo. From there it has spread to neighbouring Benin, Ghana and Burkina Faso. Very recently the beetle has also been found in Guinea Conakry. It is now recognized that Prostephanus has the potential to spread to all the major maize-producing regions of Africa. There is now increasing evidence that it may survive outside the storage environment. Containment and control A package of recommendations for maize has been devised which involves shelling dried cob maize as soon as possible after harvest and mixing a suitable insecticide powder with the shelled maize before storage. Following intensive extension campaigns, farmers are now able to combat the pest and to contain the losses. The success of the control programme is dependent upon providing a timely supply of the insecticide and ensuring its correct application. A supplementary approach to control, without employing insecticide, is currently under investigation. This involves the use of another beetle, Teretriosoma niqrescens, which in Central America is a natural predator on Prostephanus. Teretriosoma does not yet occur in Africa but it is hoped that, following the very recent release of the beetle there, the ravages of Prostephanus maybe checked through biological control (see pages 13, 15). International implications To date, the elimination of LGB from infested areas has not proved possible, despite sustained control programmes. One consequence of this problem is the difficulty of trading grain from countries in surplus, where LGB is a recognized pest, to countries not known to have the pest. LGB-infested countries with surplus grain stocks find that they are unable to secure commercial markets for their maize because prospective buyers fear the risk of introducing the beetle. In addition, international organizations involved in financing and distributing 'triangular' food aid in the African region are naturally concerned not to contribute to the risks. A major study of the implications of LGB in ten countries in Eastern and Southern Africa was recently sponsored by the European Commission. A strategy has been proposed which would have two major objectives: firstly, to prevent the distribution of LGB in long-distance commodity movements and secondly to encourage governments, exporters and food aid donors to adopt stricter specifications for the purchase and movement of potentially infested grain. For those countries where LGB is already established, the study makes technical proposals to ensure that exported maize is free from live LGB {{in order to be able}} to reassure potential buyers.

40|$|Based on the {{hydrolysis}} {{of synthetic}} substrates, pH optima for substrate hydrolysis {{and effects of}} potential activators and inhibitors, the identity and occurrence of cysteine proteinases in several major coleopteran families were investigated. The larval midgut of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata contains the cysteine proteinase cathepsin B and H, the aspartate proteinase cathepsin D and leucyl aminopeptidase. Cathepsin B and the serine proteinase trypsin were identified in the larval midgut of the yellow mealworm, Tenebrio molitor. Cathepsin B and the serine proteinase chymotrypsin were identified in the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais. The larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> Prostephanus truncatus, feeds on the same food source as S. zeamais but uses trypsin, chymotrypsin and leucyl and arginyl aminopeptidase and not cysteine proteinases for digestion. Trypsin, leucyl aminopeptidase and arginyl aminopeptidase and not cysteine proteinases were identified in a predacious carabid beetle, Pterostichus corvinus, a predacious tiger beetle, Cicindela sp. and a saprophagous hide beetle, Dermestes maculatus.
