40|$|Abstract—In {{light of}} Japan’s low {{birthrate}} and aging pop-ulation, technology {{is needed for}} facilitating the activities of elderly persons {{as well as their}} caregivers. Wearable assist devices, such as the Smart Suit Lite (SSL) developed at our laboratory, are effective for this purpose. It is important to evaluate such devices from not only physical, but also from psychophysical perspectives. Experiments involving lifting a heavy object with and without SSL were conducted, and SSL was evaluated psychophysically. The muscle activity was mea-sured by surface electromyography. The psychophysiological evaluation was conducted by using the visual analogue scale, in which reductions in load of 22. 01 % for muscles and 19. 74 % for the sense of lumbar load were confirmed. This report proposes the human <b>load</b> <b>sense</b> model based on the sense of weight and the amount of muscular activation. This model is expected to find application in humanoid robots for robust evaluation of power assist devices...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} an innovative electro-hydraulic system developed for automated side loaders. The system {{is based on}} Intelligent Flow Control (IFC), a concept where open circuit electric displacement controlled pumps are coupled with EH directional control valves. IFC was selected {{in order to achieve}} the level of performance required, in terms of efficiency and productivity (i. e. cycle times), and also to provide the best possible control of the side loader arm. The paper describes the system layout and the basics of the controls: from the alghorithms of the arm actuators to the vehicle on board telemetry and diagnostic. The paper reports the comparison between the IFC system (implemented on the vehicle) and a more traditional approach based on a <b>Load</b> <b>Sense</b> Flow Sharing concept. The benefits of the IFC solution are highlighted focusing on the energy efficiency (very important {{especially in the case of}} CNG engines, where the torque available at idle is significantly lower than diesel engines), but also in terms of controlability and response (due to the lack of load sensing signal lines) ...|$|E
40|$|Does context help {{determine}} sense? This question might seem frivolous, even preposterous to anybody sensible. However, our long time research on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) {{shows that in}} almost all disambiguation algorithms, the sense distribution parameter P(S/W), where P is the probability {{of the sense of}} a word W being S, plays the deciding role. The widely reported accuracy figure of around 60 % for all-words-domainindependent WSD is contributed to mainly by P(S/W), as one ablation test after another reveals. The story with human annotation is different though. Our experience of working with human annotators who mark with WordNet sense ids, general and domain specific corpora brings to light the interesting fact that producing sense ids without looking at the context is a heavy cognitive <b>load.</b> <b>Sense</b> annotators do form hypothesis in their minds about the possible sense of a word (‘most frequent sense ’ bias), but then look at the context for clues to accept or reject the hypothesis. Such clues are minimal, just one or two words, but are critical nonetheless. Without these clues the annotator is left in an indecisive state {{as to whether or not}} to put down the first sense coming to his mind. The task becomes all the more cognitively challenging, if the senses are fine grained and seem equally probable. These facts increase the annotation time by a factor of almost 1. 5. In the current paper we explore the dichotomy that might exist between machines and humans in the way they determine senses. We study the various parameters for WSD and also the sense marking behavior of human sense annotators. The observations, though not completely conclusive, establish the need for context for humans and that for accurate sense distribution parameters for machines. ...|$|E

The pump {{is in an}} open circuit topology for load control in a typical excavator, skid-steer or front loader circuit. The active torque generated by the engine is subject to overloads, due to uncontrolled priority and sum of torque requests from hydrostatic transmission, implements and upper-structure control.

The interest {{is focused on the}} analysis and modelling of the whole hydraulic circuit that, beside a <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> variable displacement pump, features a stack of nine proportional directional control valves modules of which seven are of the <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> type. <b>Loads</b> being <b>sensed</b> are the boom swing, boom, stick and bucket, right and left track motors and work tools; instead, the blade and the turret swing users do not contribute to the <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> signal. Of specific interest are the peculiarities that were observed in the stack. In fact, to develop an accurate AMESim modelling, the stack was dismantled and all modules analysed and represented in a CAD environment as 3 D parts. The <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> flow generation unit was replaced on the vehicle by another one whose analysis and modelling have been developed using available design and experimental data. Although both the Hydraulic Component Design library as well as the Planar Mechanical library were used extensively in the process of modelling the entire circuit, some simplifications became necessary and are detailed in the paper. As the modelling phase was developing, a number of field experiments on the vehicle were also performed: these served the purpose of providing reference data to the end of progressing with the validation phase of the AMESim model. Regarding predictive simulation results, these are appropriately consistent with gathered experimental outcomes. The AMESim model will be instrumental for upcoming analyses that foresee the substitution of the original stack with other <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> post-compensated modules so to assess with reasonable confidence the effects on potential energy savings...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the energy {{dissipation}} related to the hydraulic circuit which controls the remote auxiliary utilities of an agricultural tractor. This circuit is a typical hydraulic <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> multi actuators system. This kind of system provides a good control strategy but it is characterized by quite high energy dissipation, especially when several actuators are working together under different variable loads. In this paper, the traditional <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> system is modelled using a lumped parameter approach, and theenergy dissipations are evaluated with reference to an actual duty measured on an agricultural tractor. Then, an alternative and more energy saving circuit architecture is introduced, based on an independent metering concept: in this architecture the single spool auxiliary valve is substituted with two electronically controlled proportional valves. The system has been also equipped with an electronically controlled variable pump; twostrategies to control both the pump and the proportional valves are introduced. The energetic analysis is performed also for the alternative architecture using the same duty cycle, with the aim to identify the advantages, disadvantages and the critical features of this system {{with respect to the}} original one. Significant energy saving percentage characterizes the independent metering architecture, which seems to be a promising alternative to the standard hydraulic <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> system...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies an {{innovative}} working hydraulic system design for mobile applications. The {{purpose is to}} improve the energy efficiency and the dynamic characteristics compared to <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> systems without increasing the complexity or adding additional components. The system analysed in this thesis is referred to as flow control. The fundamental difference compared to <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> systems is that the pump is controlled based on the operator’s command signals rather than feedback signals from the loads. This control approach enables higher energy efficiency since the pressure difference between pump and load is given by the system resistance rather than a prescribed pump pressure margin. High power savings are possible especially at medium flow rates. Furthermore, <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> systems suffer from poor dynamic characteristics since the pump is operated in a closed loop control mode. This might result in an oscillatory behaviour. Flow control systems have no stability issues attached to the load pressure feedback since there is none. Pressure compensators are key components in flow control systems. This thesis addresses the flow matching problem which occurs when using conventional compensators in combination with a flow controlled pump. Flow sharing pressure compensators solve this problem since the pump flow will be distributed between all active functions. A novel control approach where the directional valve is controlled without affecting the cylinder velocity with the objective of optimizing the damping is proposed. In this research, both theoretical studies and practical implementations demonstrate the capability of flow control systems. Experiments show a reduced pump pressure margin and energy saving possibilities in a short loading cycle for a wheel loader application...|$|R

Two configurations of dual-frequency OEOs are proposed and investigated. In the first configuration, a polarization-maintaining phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating (PM-PSFBG) is {{employed in the}} OEO loop to the generation of two oscillating frequencies. The beat between the two oscillating frequencies {{is a function of}} the load applied to the PM-PSFBG, which is used in transverse <b>load</b> <b>sensing.</b> To avoid the frequency measurement ambiguity, a second configuration is proposed by coupling a dual-wavelength fiber laser to the dual-frequency OEO. A single tone microwave signal with the frequency determined by the birefringence of the grating is generated in the OEO and is fed into the fiber ring laser to injection lock the dual wavelengths. The sensitivity and the resolution are measured to be 9. 73 GHz/(N/mm) and 2. 06 × 10 - 4 N/mm, respectively.

40|$|How is <b>load</b> <b>sensed</b> by receptors, {{and how is}} this sensory {{information}} used to guide locomotion? Many insights in this domain have evolved from comparative studies since it has been realized that basic principles concerning <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> and regulation {{can be found in}} a wide variety of animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate. Feedback about load is not only derived from specific load receptors but also from other types of receptors that previously were thought to have other functions. In the central nervous system of many species, a convergence is found between specific and nonspecific load receptors. Furthermore, feedback from load receptors onto central circuits involved in the generation of rhythmic locomotor output is commonly found. During the stance phase, afferent activity from various load detectors can activate the extensor part in such circuits, thereby providing reinforcing force feedback. At the same time, the flexion is suppressed. The functional role of this arrangement is that activity in antigravity muscles is promoted while the onset of the next flexion is delayed as long as the limb is loaded. This type of reinforcing force feedback is present during gait but absent in the immoble resting animal. status: publishe...|$|R
