50|$|Villages {{were divided}} into {{a certain number of}} clan territories or khels.The Naga {{traditionally}} live in villages. The village is a well-defined entity with distinct <b>land</b> <b>demarcation</b> from neighbouring villages. Each has a dialect, which fosters a strong sense of social solidarity within the village. Almost every home rears pigs, as they provide meat with little care needed. The people of the village are held together by social, economic, political and ritual ties. The villages have their own identities, but not in isolation, as there are interdependent relationships with neighboring villages. Modernization is slowly eroding the centrality of villages as a social unit, as large commercial towns are rapidly developing in every region of the Naga hills. This has brought about dramatic changes in the values, lifestyle, and social setup of the people.|$|E
50|$|The 1970s was {{a period}} of <b>land</b> <b>demarcation.</b> Private {{ownership}} of land became the rule and land was consolidated to settle families on individual tracts. Families could no longer depend on small tracts (shambas) in several areas as they had in the past. Consolidation means that a family must now depend on one piece of land to meet its needs. If that piece fails, the family faces hunger. Cooperation between family members has been affected; as nuclear families and their private land has replaced extended families managing larger and more diverse pieces of cornrnunal land. Conflicts have arisen as some acquired land in the most productive areas while others were consolidated on their least productive lands. Environmental degradation has increased as people are forced to cultivate on marginal land and destroy areas of ecological importance.|$|E

50|$|Borama Airport, {{which is}} 2 km long and 200 meters wide, was {{constructed}} in 1988 by former collapsed socialist government. The purpose the airport was built was to enable the region {{to have an access}} to air transport for the movement of goods and people and link the region to the outside world.Current operations of the airport are very limited. Most of passenger, cargo planes and UN aircraft use Hargeisa and Berbera airports due to appropriate airport facilities and services. Moreover, the airport runway is unpaved and rough and its <b>land</b> <b>demarcation</b> is not yet fixed by the local government. Thus, the airport area is being frequently infringed by land grabbers. The airport has no security fence and, consequently, exposed to roaming livestock. Besides, due to absence of the fence, truck drivers use the runway as road and pose unnecessary risks to aircraft. Additionally, the airport is missing some vey essential services and facilities such weather forecasting services, fire trucks, air communication and water supply system.Lack of institutional capacities such shortage of trained staff, budgetary restrictions and lack of transport are some of the constraints hampering Borama Airport operations. If the above challenges are duly addressed, airport operation would probably resume operations.|$|E
5000|$|The chief {{benefit of}} Treelucerne {{is its ability}} to {{increase}} soil productivity roughly 5 times over 5 years and up to 10 times over 10 years, in deep well drained soils mainly limited in Nitrogen such as those found in the Great Rift Valley of East Africa. The 15-28% Tree Lucerne plant protein is converted into other forms of protein such as eggs, milk, white meat (chicken) and red meat (ruminants and cattle). This is mainly done by combining the need for <b>land</b> <b>demarcation</b> (hedgerows and windbreaks) with the ability to produce [...] "high up in the air" [...] (vertical expansion) due to the tree like vertical growth of the Treelucerne hedgerow of 6-10 meters high to where there is available space horisontally. The side of the Hedgerow is then harvested by hand until it forms a plat surface, using a machete for trimming, often standing on step ladders. The 6 meter high Tree Lucerne hedgerows (typically 1-3 meters wide) yield the same nutritional value as normal Alfalfa (which is only 50 cm high). The lack of space for horizontal sideway expansion close to the ground force such land limited farmers to expand vertically, going up in the air, in order to find more space. This [...] "tree lucerne" [...] approach allows them to achieve multiple production benefits and a 5-10 time production increase, over time, due to Nitrogen Fixation, Soil Improvement and Terra Preta bio-char amendments and the physical tree like structure of Tree Lucerne (growing up, and expanding sideways, high up in the air, where there is space for sideway lateral branches, photosynthesis and sideshoot development).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Land</b> <b>demarcation</b> {{systems are}} ancient human {{artifacts}} and are fundamental to property law and property markets. In this chapter we develop an economic framework for examining systems of <b>land</b> <b>demarcation</b> {{and examine the}} economic history of demarcation in the United States and beyond. We focus on metes and bounds and rectangular systems – the two dominate <b>land</b> <b>demarcation</b> methods. We examine the various patterns of demarcation used in the U.

We also show rectangular systems have been adopted in parts of Canada and Australia and cities {{in other parts of the}} world. We consider how a decentralized system of land claiming would generate patterns of land holdings that would be unsystematic and depend on natural topography and the characteristics of the claimant population. We then show how a centralized, rectangular system generates different ownership patterns and incentives for land use, land markets, investment, and border disputes. We illustrate some empirical findings from an analysis of metes and bounds in the Virginia Military District of Ohio...|$|E

Disputes involving different types of appropriation, use and significance of this area have been motivating actions of quite heterogeneous institutions and social organizations.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{analysing}} communal land use management practices and policies towards sustainability and climate resilience. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess rainfall variability, climate change impact, adaptation practices and impediment factors for adaptation on the one hand and, on the other, analysing the pressure, scrutinising the sustainability of institutional practices, and assessing policy setting and its application status in managing communal lands. To conduct the study, a household survey, key informant interviews and group discussions were used. It employed both quantitative and qualitative methods. For analysis, rainfall variability trend analysis, different empirical formulas, Principal Component Analysis and analysis of variance were used. In addition, Qualitative Content Analysis technique and descriptive statistical tools were also used. The study found that there was spatiotemporal rainfall variability. About 18 extreme wet and 8 extreme dry events were depicted out of 194 frequencies of events. The most outstanding manifestations of climate change/variability impacts identified were: water scarcity, migration, severe erosion and feed scarcity. Applying biophysical measures on communal lands, practicing area enclosure and constraction of feeder road were moderately excersised adaptation and mitigation practices while, low level community awareness was the most outstanding barrier for community adaptation. Besides, feed source and fuel biomass energy did not satisfy community demand. Government recognition to support community user groups, the existence of community labour contribution and congruence between government legislation and community by-laws were found moderately strong. Besides, communal land administration and use of legislative setting and instruments to govern land administration were adequately in place to implement communal land use and management. However, workability of by-laws in applying them at the ground was a major weakness. In conclusion, the study revealed that there exist generally a weak communal land use management practices and policy implementation towards enhancing sustainability and climate resilience. Hence, the following recommendations were forwarded: enhancing community awareness, encouraging communities to establish their own private woodlots and grazing areas to reduce the pressure on communal land, applying proper communal land resource use and management plans and certifying communal <b>lands</b> with <b>demarcation</b> and maps should be given due emphasis to enhance sustainability. Moreover, policy and legislation evaluation and revision to improve its application at the ground is fundamental.
