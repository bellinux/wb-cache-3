Both Gullfjellet and the Ulriken - Vidden - Rundemanen massif by Bergen are popular in all seasons. The Ulriken - Vidden - Rundemanen massif also offer easy access through gondola and funicular railway. The leveled plateau between Rundemanen and Ulriken is excellent for skiing in winter, providing the snow stays.|$|R

In such a case, the driver can choose {{one of the following}} ways: hard braking or one of the types of maneuvering, including turning off, turning with straightening or changing a line regarding road surface type (dry asphalt, wet asphalt or snowy asphalt). The article also proposes formulas for calculating road distance the car travels till dead stop. Moreover, the tables display theoretical values taking into account various car speeds and road surfaces. The pictures help with determining the most suitable type <b>of</b> action in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> and weather conditions as well as car speed.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>roads</b> in the UK might be changed {{so as to}} preserve the benefits while minimising energy consumption. It is divided into four sections, these being changes in technology, changes in patterns of use, changes in standards and contracts {{and changes in the}} basis of design. Useful changes in technology and patterns of use are available now, but their use will raise the question {{as to whether or not}} environmental considerations can override conventional financial constraints. Changes in standards and the basis of design are much more long term. Comparisons of road lighting standards used in different countries show significant differences that deserve examination. As for the basis of design, consideration of the importance of light to fatal and personal injury accidents of different types suggests that road lighting should be concentrated where pedestrians are common, not where speeds are highest. Ultimately, considering carefully what problem road lighting is intended to solve and whether or not road lighting is the best answer is the key to minimising the energy consumption of road lighting without diminishing road safety. 1...|$|E

Three sets of data are collected: a) numerical data related to motorcycle dynamics, b) continuous audio-video recordings of the motorcyclist behaviour, c) subjective data collected by self-confrontation interviews of the learners. Several design perspectives are proposed: 1) suggesting a hybrid curriculum which combines traditional training and simulator, 2) reproducing vulnerable situations experienced by novices in real context on the riding simulator, from relevant traffic scenarios, 3) designing training dedicated simulators unlike the current ambition to create all purposes simulator...|$|R

40|$|The view is {{intended}} to calculate the share <b>of</b> <b>light</b> vehicles in total road freight vehicles. The light road freight vehicles are those belonging to the TWO WHEELERS, THRE WHEELERS and LDVS modes, while total road freight vehicle includes also the LARGE ROAD mode (the latter also corresponds to {{the sum of the}} medium duty and heavy duty trucks of the large-freight sub-modes – LFT MDT and LFT HDT). Structure The share <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>road</b> freight vehicles in total road freight is assumed to be a function of the GDP per capita. As in the case of some of the variables of the passenger demand generation module, this function is defined by a curve whose shape across different level of GDP per capita is deduced from historical patterns. The S-Curve is calibrated with base year data. Figure 10. 1 shows the general appearance of the view. Figure 10. 1 Light road freight vehicle shares Detailed description of the view The starting point for the calculation of the share <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>road</b> freight vehicles in total road freight is the definition of a family of S-Curves that represents the pattern followed across different values of GDP per capita and different base year values. The basis for this definition is shown in Figure 10. 2, showing a plot of the share of vehicles with a load capacity lower than 3 t in the total road freight vehicles for European countries. The growing share <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>road</b> freight vehicles shown in Figure 10. 2 mirrors the growth of personal passenger vehicles observed when the average income increases. 1 Share of vehicles with a capacity < 3 t in total road freight vehicles Share of vehicles with a capacity < 3 t in total road freight vehicle...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDifferent {{models of}} outdoor sound {{propagation}} {{can be used}} to predict transportation and industry noise for noise mapping or environmental impact assessment. We present here a comparison of noise attenuations predicted by a) the French engineering model NMPB 2008, designed for railway, road or industrial noise, b) the engineering model elaborated in the European Harmonoise/Imagine projects. The comparison has first been done by comparing the deviations between models for calculated sound attenuation for both homogeneous and downward propagation situations and for 7 experimental site configurations. Some significant deviations can be observed mainly for high frequencies and also for homogeneous propagation conditions. A comparison between calculated and experimental sound attenuations is also presented for each method, on the basis <b>of</b> 5 <b>road</b> noise experimental campaigns, where each site is representative of different common topographies. Some statistically significant deviations between both mean and standard deviation are observed between the two models.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} driver-ride and road-friendliness {{characteristics}} {{of an urban}} bus through model derivation and validation, sensitivity analysis, suspension damping optimisation and field assessments. Part I of the study develops a three-dimensional urban bus model by integrating non-linear models of suspension components and tyres that were derived from laboratory-measured data. The vehicle model is validated through field tests, and employed for sensitivity analyses of different operating parameters, including forward speed, tyre inflation pressure, vehicle load and road roughness. The results demonstrate significant roles of these parameters on the dynamic responses relating to driver ride and road-friendliness, which are coupled in a complex manner. The results suggest that measures related to sustainability of urban infrastructure and vehicle structure, together with {{the health and safety}} of the drivers, are directly coupled in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the <b>road</b> roughness.
