5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the ninth}} century Alfred the Great started to revive {{learning}} and monasticism, and this work was carried on by his grandson, King Æthelstan (924–939). Kings before Edgar (959–975) did not take the view, which was adopted by Æthelwold and his circle, that the only worthwhile religious life was Benedictine monasticism. When Gérard of Brogne reformed the Abbey of Saint Bertin in Saint-Omer in 944, dissident monks found a refuge in England under King Edmund (939–946). Before the tenth-century reform, the <b>lines</b> <b>between</b> secular clergy and monastics were sometimes blurred. There are cases of communities of monks established to provide pastoral care, and clergy in some secular establishments lived according to monastic rules.|$|E

The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. Brigadier Mohammad Usman, the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary arrangements to counter the expected attack.

Of these civilians, about 600 were armed, although only half were trained to undertake a combat role.

The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot.
