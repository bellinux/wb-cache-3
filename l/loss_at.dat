Murray then made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at Wimbledon before making his first final at the US Open. During the tournament in New York, Murray claimed his first win over Nadal. That victory meant that he'd become the first player from Britain since Greg Rusedski in 1997 to reach a major final. In his first Grand Slam final Murray {{suffered a}} straight sets loss to Federer. At the Beijing Olympics, Murray suffered {{one of the worst}} defeats of his career, losing his first round singles match to world No. 77 Yen-hsun Lu of Taiwan in straight sets. That abject defeat was still on his mind in a BBC interview five years later – despite an intervening Olympic gold medal and a head-to-head win – when he met the same player (now ranked 75 in the world) in the 2nd round of Wimbledon 2013.|$|E

5|$|After much speculation, Manning {{announced}} in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL. In the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning's play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and one interception, but a pick-6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed the Broncos to win 19–13. The Broncos {{got off to a}} dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, the streak ended in a <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> Indianapolis, losing 24–27. During that winning streak, and the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played better, putting up over 250 yards in six of the seven games, and he scored nine touchdowns. However, he never had a game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13, and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories.|$|E

The match was not without controversy, as the Burnley players claimed that the second goal should have been disallowed despite the Tottenham goalscorer being onside, maintaining that the whistle had already been blown by the referee.|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{alterations}} {{have been}} recognized as an important event in the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer (GC). We conducted high resolution bacterial artificial chromosome array-comparative genomic hybridization, to elucidate in more detail the genomic alterations, and to establish a pattern of DNA copy number changes with distinct clinical variables in GC. Our results showed some correlations between novel amplified or deleted regions and clinical status. Copy-number gains were frequently detected at 1 p, 5 p, 7 q, 8 q, 11 p, 16 p, 20 p and 20 q, and <b>losses</b> <b>at</b> 1 p, 2 q, 4 q, 5 q, 7 q, 9 p, 14 q, and 18 q. <b>Losses</b> <b>at</b> 4 q 23, 9 p 23, 14 q 31. 1, or 18 q 21. 1 {{as well as a}} gain at 20 q 12 were correlated with tumor-node-metastasis tumor stage. <b>Losses</b> <b>at</b> 9 p 23 or 14 q 31. 1 were associated with lymph node status. Metastasis was determined to be related to <b>losses</b> <b>at</b> 4 q 23 or 4 q 28. 2, as well as <b>losses</b> <b>at</b> 4 q 15. 2, 4 q 21. 21, 4 q 28. 2, or 14 q 31. 1, with differentiation. One of the notable aspects of this study was that the <b>losses</b> <b>at</b> 4 q or 14 q could be employed in the evaluation of the metastatic status of GC. Our results should provide a potential resource for the molecular cytogenetic events in GC, and should also provide clues in the hunt for genes associated with GC...|$|R

5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> hard rudder.|$|E

5|$|Born in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, Foster {{began his}} career as a trainee with the Sheffield Wednesday youth system. He joined Conference National club Scarborough on work {{experience}} in September 2004. Foster made his debut for Scarborough in a 1–0 defeat to Hereford United, coming on as a 76th minute substitute. He started the following match in the club's 2–1 <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> Carlisle United, and went on to make 10 appearances during his loan spell. Foster returned to his parent club, but failed to make any first-team appearances, and was subsequently loaned out to Conference North outfit Alfreton Town in February 2005 until the end of the season. He made his Alfreton debut in the club's 3–0 victory against Woking in the FA Trophy. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–1 loss against Southport, and scored again a week later in Alfreton's 2–1 defeat against Kettering Town. His third and final goal for Alfreton came in the following game, scoring the first goal in the club's 3–0 win at Barrow. He played his last game for the club in the final game of the 2004–05 season, in a 3–1 <b>loss</b> <b>at</b> Stafford Rangers. Foster played in 19 games for the club, scoring three goals.|$|E
