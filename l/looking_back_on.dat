5|$|In 1904, Coolsma {{published}} a {{revised version of}} his grammar. Working with fellow missionary Christiaan Albers, who had also preached in Cianjur, Coolsma {{published a}} Dutch-Sundanese dictionary in 1911; {{this was followed by}} a revised version of his Sundanese-Dutch dictionary in 1913. Coolsma's wife died on 27 September 1917. Her death led him to reduce his workload, although he found time to publish his memoirs, Terugblik op mijn levensweg, 1840–1924 (<b>Looking</b> <b>Back</b> <b>on</b> my Life, 1840–1924), in 1924. He died two years later, on 20 March 1926.|$|E
5|$|Neglected in her {{relationship}} with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars {{to make the case for}} emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the end of}} 1790 {{and summer}} of 1792 Metternich studied law at the University of Mainz, {{receiving}} a more conservative education than at Strasbourg, a city the return to which was now unsafe. In the summers he worked with his father, who had been appointed plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands. In March 1792 Francis succeeded his father Leopold as Holy Roman Emperor and was crowned in July, affording Metternich a reprisal of his earlier role of Ceremonial Marshall. To this he added the honour of opening the accompanying ball alongside Louise of Mecklenburg. In the meantime France had declared war on Austria, beginning the War of the First Coalition (1792–7) and making Metternich's further study in Mainz impossible. Now {{in the employment of}} his father, he was sent on a special mission to the front. Here he led the interrogation of the French Minister of War the Marquis de Beurnonville and several accompanying National Convention commissioners. Metternich observed the siege and fall of Valenciennes, later <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> these as substantial lessons about warfare. In early 1794 he was sent to England on, ostensibly on official business helping Viscount Desandrouin, the Treasurer-General of the Austrian Netherlands, to negotiate a loan.|$|E

25|$|The {{district}} auditors {{operated under}} the control of the Audit Commission, which was a body established by (although operationally independent of) central government. Given the highly politicised fight, there was speculation that the Government was encouraging the Commission. <b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the history, Martin Loughlin noted that the Government did not appear to be formally directing the Commission, but that there was probably extensive consultation. The Commissioners had on 6 June 1985 directed the extraordinary audits of Lambeth and Liverpool, although by that time the district auditors were already planning to take this course. The auditors calculated the loss to the council as being the amount lost from interest payments on the amount paid by the Department of Health and Social Services and the Treasury Valuer which were unable to be paid until a rate was set; Martin Loughlin notes that this interest had instead accrued to the Government and therefore no money was lost to the public purse.|$|E
25|$|In July 2013 it was {{announced}} that Juliet Landau would play a future incarnation of Romana for Big Finish. This version of Romana was introduced in Renaissance, the third chapter of Gallifrey VI, released in October 2013, and was said to come from thousands of years in the future. This version of Romana was later reprised by Landau in the January 2014 audio drama Luna Romana, part of Big Finish's Companion Chronicles line; Landau also performs the role of Romana I in lieu of the now-deceased Mary Tamm in this story, the narrative intending to present Landau's Romana as <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the events of her first incarnation's travels with the Doctor. To avoid confusion with her earlier self, this future Romana volunteers to use the name Lady Trey (taken from one of the middle syllables of her full name). Landau returned to the role once again in Gallifrey: Intervention Earth, a continuation of the Gallifrey series released in January 2015.|$|E
