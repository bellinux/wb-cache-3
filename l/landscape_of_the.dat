5|$|Carboniferous Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the Carboniferous Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Somerset Levels and Moors.

5|$|Due to its {{location}} {{in the middle of}} the trade network of the ancient world, the cultural and social <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city was complex, as the inhabitants had to deal with traders and envoys who brought with them different customs from distant regions.

5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further {{modified}} by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E

5|$|After earning enough money, Kertész quickly {{bought his}} first camera (an ICA box camera) in 1912, despite his family's protests to {{continue}} his career in business. In his free time, he photographed the local peasants, gypsies, and <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding Hungarian Plains (the puszta). His first photograph {{is believed to be}} Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912. His photographs were first published in 1917 in the magazine Érdekes Újság, during World War I, while Kertész was serving in the Austro-Hungarian army. As early as 1914 (for example, Eugene, 1914), his distinctive and mature style was already evident.|$|E
5|$|Agreeing to fund {{half of the}} {{proposed}} £1million budget, the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers became partners in the film's production. Elder brother Sir Run Run Shaw is credited as the presenter of Inseminoid in the opening titles. With a production staff of 75, principal photography commenced on 12 May 1980. John Metcalfe, camera operator for Satan's Slave and Terror, {{assumed the role of}} cinematographer. His former role fell to the less experienced Dick Pope. Three weeks of location filming at the Chislehurst Caves in Kent preceded a one-week indoor session at Lee International Studios at Wembley Park in London. The second unit completed special effects and linking shots in a fifth week, based at Film House in Wardour Street. To simulate the desolate <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alien planet in long shots, the production team departed for the island of Gozo off Malta for a final shoot of two days, capitalising on the strong Mediterranean sun to produce good lighting.|$|E

5|$|In July 1886 an Australian {{prospector}} {{reported to}} the Transvaal government his discovery of an unprecedented gold reef between Pretoria and Heidelberg. The South African Republic's formal proclamation of this two months later prompted the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg, which {{within a few years}} was the largest city in southern Africa, populated almost entirely by uitlanders. The economic <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region was transformed overnight—the South African Republic went from the verge of bankruptcy in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to the Cape Colony's the following year. The British became anxious to link Johannesburg to the Cape and Natal by rail, but Kruger thought this might have undesirable geopolitical and economic implications if done prematurely and gave the Delagoa Bay line first priority.|$|E
5|$|In {{modern times}} the witches {{have become the}} {{inspiration}} for Pendle's tourism and heritage industries, with local shops selling a variety of witch-motif gifts. Burnley's Moorhouse's produces a beer called Pendle Witches Brew, {{and there is a}} Pendle Witch Trail running from Pendle Heritage Centre to Lancaster Castle, where the accused witches were held before their trial. The X43 bus route run by Burnley Bus Company has been branded The Witch Way, with some of the vehicles operating on it named after the witches in the trial. Pendle Hill, which dominates the <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area, continues to be associated with witchcraft, and hosts a hilltop gathering every Halloween.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} times, massive ice sheets {{at least one}} {{kilometer}} thick ravaged the <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state and sculpted its terrain. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. This area {{is known as the}} Driftless Zone for its absence of glacial drift. Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50feet (15m) or more of glacial till left behind as the last glaciers retreated. Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13,000 years ago. Its bed created the fertile Red River valley, and its outflow, glacial River Warren, carved the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling. Minnesota is geologically quiet today; it experiences earthquakes infrequently, {{and most of them are}} minor.|$|E

5|$|Influenced by the Chinese Song and Yuan dynasties, Japanese {{monochrome}} ink painting called suibokuga largely replaced polychrome scroll paintings. By {{the end of}} the 14th century, monochrome landscape paintings (sansuiga) {{became the}} preferred genre for Zen painters, evolving to a unique Japanese style from the Chinese origin. Shūbun, who created Reading in a Bamboo Grove (1446), and his student Sesshū, author of <b>Landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Four Seasons, are the most well known priest-painters of the period. As with most of the early Japanese paintings, these works were created for Buddhist temples. At {{the end of the}} Muromachi period around 1573, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries, and was practised by artists from the Kanō school.|$|E
5|$|Most of her {{commissions}} {{were carried}} out during the 12 years or so {{between the end of}} the First World War and the start of the Great Depression. She took on several major projects, including designing the <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation of Sharp, who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee. From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women’s College to the south) into one cohesive design. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.|$|E
5|$|Of the Cadwgan Circle, {{the most}} notable of their number is Rhydwen Williams, {{the winner of the}} Eisteddfod Crown on two {{occasions}} who used the <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industrial valleys as a basis for much of his work. Writing in the English language Peter George was born in Treorchy and is best known as the Oscar nominated screenwriter of Dr. Strangelove, based on his book Red Alert. Reflecting the lives of the residents of the Rhondda, both Gwyn Thomas and Ron Berry brought a realism to the industrial valleys which was missing in the more rose-tinted writings of Richard Llewellyn.|$|E
