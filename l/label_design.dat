500|$|In 1990, the now {{standard}} black-and-white warning <b>label</b> <b>design</b> reading [...] "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" [...] {{was introduced}} and {{was to be}} placed on the bottom right-hand section of a given product. The first album to bear the [...] "black and white" [...] Parental Advisory label was the 1990 release of [...] "Banned in the USA" [...] by the rap group 2 Live Crew. By May 1992, approximately 225 records had been marked with the warning. In response to later hearings in the following years, it was reworded as [...] "Parental Advisory: Explicit Content" [...] in 1996. The system went unchanged until 2002, when record labels affiliated with Bertelsmann Music Group began including specific areas of concern including [...] "strong language", [...] "violent content", or [...] "sexual content" [...] on compact discs alongside the generic Parental Advisory label. The Parental Advisory label was first used on music streaming services and online music stores in 2011. That year, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) revised its own music censorship policies to incorporate more prominent usage of the warning label.|$|E

5000|$|From {{their early}} years through about 1931, the ornate <b>label</b> <b>design</b> {{was like the}} 1921 label (shown above) with only changes in the {{ownership}} info along the bottom.

Collectors consider this short-lived style highly desirable (and a few good selling gold label issues were pressed using this rarer <b>label</b> <b>design).</b> Later in 1935, the label was changed to a black scroll label with a scroll covering most of the <b>label</b> <b>design.</b> In 1937, the label was changed again to a blue with gold printing and the legend [...] "full range recording" [...] along the top. In 1938 through 1941, the blue label was simplified (see the Armstrong reissue above).|$|E
