5|$|Germanium {{differs from}} silicon {{in that the}} supply {{is limited by the}} {{availability}} of exploitable sources, while the supply of silicon is <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> production capacity since silicon comes from ordinary sand and quartz. While silicon could be bought in 1998 for less than $10 per kg, the price of germanium was almost $800 per kg.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} accuracy {{relative to the}} clock frequency is <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the precision of the arithmetic used to compute the phase. NCOs are phase- and frequency-agile, and can be trivially modified to produce a phase-modulated or frequency-modulated output by summation at the appropriate node, or provide quadrature outputs {{as shown in the}} figure.|$|E
5|$|Not many predators {{challenge}} {{an adult}} black mamba {{although it does}} face a few threats such as birds of prey, particularly snake eagles. Although all species of snake eagle commonly prey on snakes, there are two species in particular that do so with high frequency, including preying on black mambas. These are the black-chested snake eagle (Circaetus pectoralis) and the brown snake eagle (Circaetus cinereus). The Cape file snake (Mehelya capensis), which is apparently immune to all African snake venoms and preys on other snakes including venomous ones, is a common predator of black mambas (<b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the size it can swallow). Mongooses, which also are partially immune to venom, and are often quick enough to evade a bite, will sometimes tackle a black mamba for prey. Humans do not usually consume black mambas, but they often kill them out of fear.|$|E

5|$|The Museum of Curiosity, {{formerly}} titled The Professor of Curiosity, is {{a comedy}} panel game on BBC Radio 4 that was first broadcast on 20 February 2008. It is hosted by John Lloyd (Professor of Ignorance at the University of Buckingham, and later at Southampton Solent University). He {{acts as the}} head of the (fictional) titular museum, while a panel of three guests – typically a comedian, an author and an academic – each donate to the museum an ‘object’ that fascinates them. The radio medium ensures that the suggested exhibits can be absolutely anything, <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the guests’ imaginations.|$|E

25|$|The maximum speeds {{that can}} be {{achieved}} with staging is theoretically <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the speed of light.

25|$|Measurement {{microphones}} {{are generally}} scalar sensors of pressure; they exhibit an omnidirectional response, <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the scattering profile {{of their physical}} dimensions. Sound intensity or sound power measurements require pressure-gradient measurements, which are typically made using arrays {{of at least two}} microphones, or with hot-wire anemometers.|$|E
25|$|The concept {{assumes that}} {{predator}} populations are <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> {{the availability of}} prey. However other factors such as shortage of nesting sites, cannibalism or predation of one predator on another can hold predator populations below the limit imposed by prey biomass, and this would misleadingly reduce the predator–prey ratio.|$|E
25|$|Because supercapacitors operate without forming {{chemical}} bonds, current loads, including charge, discharge and peak currents are {{not limited}} by reaction constraints. Current load and cycle stability can be much higher than for rechargeable batteries. Current loads are <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> internal resistance, which may be substantially lower than for batteries.|$|E

25|$|This time {{constant}} determines the charge/discharge time. A 100F capacitor with an internal resistance of 30mΩ for example, has a {{time constant}} of 0.03 • 100 = 3s. After 3 seconds charging with a current <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> internal resistance, the capacitor has 63.2% of full charge (or is discharged to 36.8% of full charge).|$|E
25|$|If the PID {{controller}} parameters (the {{gains of}} the proportional, integral and derivative terms) are chosen incorrectly, the controlled process input can be unstable, i.e., its output diverges, {{with or without}} oscillation, and is <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> saturation or mechanical breakage. Instability is caused by excess gain, particularly {{in the presence of}} significant lag.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, State Representative Alan Seabaugh {{targeted}} Washington as {{the most}} [...] "notorious" [...] speed trap in the state. He obtained approval of the House Transportation Committee to allow enforcement of traffic laws only if a community had incorporated at least one-half mile of land that extends to each side of an interstate highway, excluding overpasses and ramps. Seabaugh said that he receives many complaints from his constituents in Shreveport and even out-of-state residents who have been ticketed for speeding when exceeding the 75 m.p.h. <b>limit</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> a mile or two.|$|R

25|$|Detritivores {{capitalize}} {{upon this}} energy source, creating an alternate and parallel food web of potentially large importance. This is because carbon fixation into the detrital food web {{is not limited}} by stratification, turbidity or day length, all of which limit photosynthesis. Detrital production occurs continuously, <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> inputs and advection out of the Delta system.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the {{majority}} of ADSL2+ providers use a process of local-loop unbundling (LLU) by connecting a customer's phone line directly into their network, bypassing BT's core network, to provide ADSL2+ lines. The availability is then <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the number of exchanges unbundled by each telecom operator: {{it is not necessary}} to wait for BT Group.|$|E
25|$|As of 2016, {{the wolf}} {{population}} is now nearly extirpated {{with only two}} severely inbred wolves present. The moose population was about 2/3rd of its historical maximum with ample forage and growing rapidly. Absent a new infusion of migrant wolves, or human intervention, the original situation of a high moose population <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> starvation is the prospect.|$|E

25|$|Inertial mass {{is found}} by {{applying}} a known net force to an unknown mass, measuring the resulting acceleration, and applying Newton's Second Law, m = F/a. This gives an accurate value for mass, <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> {{the accuracy of}} the measurements. When astronauts need to be measured in the weightlessness of free fall, they actually find their inertial mass in a special chair called a body mass measurement device (BMMD).|$|E
25|$|By X3, the X-Universe {{consists}} of around 160 sectors connected by two-way jumpgates. The main area of each sector typically contains several stations {{and up to}} four gates. The game is open-ended, allowing the player to go where they like, when they like, doing whatever they like; a player is <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> their in-game status and resources. As such, a driving force {{of the game is}} to acquire credits (the universal currency) and status.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{supplied}} air {{is generally}} supplied by low pressure compressor, and the continuous supply is <b>limited</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the compressor continuing to run effectively, {{and to provide}} air of suitable quality. There is also a reserve air supply, either from a second compressor, or from fairly large high pressure cylinders. Each diver also carries a scuba bailout cylinder, which should carry sufficient gas to safely surface from any point in the planned dive.|$|E
50|$|The reactor pattern {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to debug than a procedural pattern due to the inverted flow of control. Also, <b>by</b> <b>only</b> calling request handlers synchronously, the reactor pattern limits maximum concurrency, especially on Symmetric multiprocessing hardware. The scalability of the reactor pattern is <b>limited</b> not <b>only</b> <b>by</b> calling request handlers synchronously, but also by the demultiplexer.|$|R
