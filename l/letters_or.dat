5|$|Researchers {{have looked}} for {{evidence}} of {{the driving force behind}} the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name <b>letters</b> <b>or</b> name. Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E
5|$|The University of Bristol (abbreviated as Bris. in post-nominal <b>letters,</b> <b>or</b> UoB) is a {{red brick}} {{research}} university located in Bristol, United Kingdom. It received its royal charter in 1909, although like the University of the West of England and the University of Bath, it first started as the Merchant Venturers Navigation School in 1595. Its key predecessor institution, University College, Bristol, had been in existence since 1876.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other authors}} of the genre, Tolkien never favoured signing his works. Owing to his popularity, handsigned copies of his <b>letters</b> <b>or</b> of the first editions of his {{individual}} writings have however achieved high values at auctions, and forged autographs may occur on the market. In particular, the signed first hardback edition of The Hobbit from 1937 has reportedly been offered for $85,000. Collectibles also include non-fiction books with hand-written annotations from Tolkien's private library.|$|E

2500|$|A diacritic – also diacritical mark, diacritical point, or diacritical sign – is a glyph {{added to}} a <b>letter,</b> <b>or</b> basic glyph. The term derives from the Ancient Greek [...] (diakritikós, [...] "distinguishing"), from [...] (diakrī́nō, [...] "to distinguish"). Diacritic is {{primarily}} an adjective, though sometimes used as a noun, whereas diacritical is only ever an adjective. Some diacritical marks, such as the acute (´) and grave (`), are often called accents. Diacritical marks may appear above <b>or</b> below a <b>letter,</b> <b>or</b> in some other position such as within the <b>letter</b> <b>or</b> between two <b>letters.</b>|$|R

5|$|Alliteration is the {{repetition}} of <b>letters</b> <b>or</b> letter-sounds {{at the beginning of}} two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance {{played a key role in}} structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.|$|E
5|$|Mary's biographers, such as Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and John Guy, {{have come}} to the {{conclusion}} that either the documents were complete forgeries, or incriminating passages were inserted into genuine <b>letters,</b> <b>or</b> that the letters were written to Bothwell by some other person or by Mary to some other person. Guy points out that the letters are disjointed, and that the French language and grammar employed in the sonnets are too poor for a writer with Mary's education. However, certain phrases of the letters (including verses in the style of Ronsard) and certain characteristics of style would be compatible with known writings of Mary.|$|E
5|$|People of {{all ages}} played board games pitting two players against each other, {{including}} latrunculi ("Raiders"), a game of strategy in which opponents coordinated the movements and capture of multiple game pieces, and XII scripta ("Twelve Marks"), involving dice and arranging pieces on a grid of <b>letters</b> <b>or</b> words. A game referred to as alea (dice) or tabula (the board), to which the emperor Claudius was notoriously addicted, may have been similar to backgammon, using a dice-cup (pyrgus). Playing with dice {{as a form of}} gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the December festival of the Saturnalia with its carnival, norms-overturned atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the <b>letters</b> <b>or</b> how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} works {{attributed}} to the trobairitz is estimated at thirty-two songs, but ranges anywhere from 23 to 46. There {{are a number of}} reasons why an exact number is not known. In the courtly love tradition it was common for poems to be written as an exchange of <b>letters,</b> <b>or</b> a debate, as in a tenso. Some of these may have been originally written by one poet; however, some were originally an actual exchange of epistles, later gathered together in a manuscript. Some of these were between men, and some were {{between a man and a}} woman. Some modern editors attribute these solely to the man who originated the exchange, and some attribute them to both the man and the woman involved. There is a long history of attributing these solely to men, even when all evidence points to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, <b>letters,</b> <b>or</b> symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E

Recognition of handwritten <b>letter</b> <b>or</b> symbol needs modeling, {{and the model}} of each individual symbol or character can be built by choice of γ and h in (1).

5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by <b>letters</b> <b>or</b> symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.|$|E
5|$|Mellitus {{attended}} a council of bishops held in Italy in February 610, convened by Pope Boniface IV. The historian N. J. Higham speculates {{that one reason}} for his attendance may have been to assert the English Church's independence from the Frankish Church. Boniface had Mellitus take two papal letters back to England, one to Æthelbert and his people, and another to Laurence, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also brought back the synod's decrees to England. No authentic <b>letters</b> <b>or</b> documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury. During his time as a bishop, Mellitus joined with Justus, the Bishop of Rochester, in signing a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the Celtic Church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionary bishops, such as Dagan, refused to eat with the Roman missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was called}} to Cambridge in 1703, where her only {{surviving}} son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with smallpox. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. Sarah was heartbroken {{over the loss of}} her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her <b>letters</b> <b>or</b> doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered bereavement. After the death of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at Kensington Palace to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to St James's Palace in London, which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call Abigail Masham to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself to be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.|$|E
