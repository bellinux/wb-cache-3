40|$|Abstract: Tasks, such {{as those}} in patient care practice, require {{constant}} monitoring of a dynamic context and environment based on best practices in the form of predefined experience-based information or knowledge. These applications could take the form of reactive applications. The problem of incorporating best practices into routines used in such tasks requires advanced approaches and methods for comprehensively managing complex information. This paper presents a generic and unified framework for Complex Information Management (CIM) in domains where best practices need to be incorporated into day-to-day work. The CIM framework is supported by a high level declarative language, called AIM. The approach adopted here uses the combined application of the event-condition-action (ECA) rule paradigm, a temporal mechanism, advanced DBMS features and XML technologies. Furthermore, the paper also presents the conceptual architecture for the complex information management system, AIMS. The main contribution of CIM framework and approach <b>lays</b> in <b>managing</b> the complex information by introducing multiple management planes under a unified framework. ...|$|R

2500|$|After {{his release}} on 3 July, Lays had to undergo the ritual humiliation {{the public was}} {{imposing}} on the [...] "Terrorist actors": {{they were forced to}} sing the anti-Jacobin hymn [...] "Le Réveil du Peuple", which had just been set to music by a tenor from the Théâtre Feydeau, Pierre Gaveaux, and which seemed destined to replace the Marseillaise as the main Republican anthem. Antoine Trial, a colleague of Gaveaux from the Opéra-Comique who was then in his sixties, had been forced to sing the new hymn kneeling on stage to boos, whistles and jeers from the audience, and had never recovered from the experience, eventually taking his own life with poison. Quéruel writes <b>Lays</b> <b>managed</b> to avoid making his return to the stage in Iphigénie en Tauride, in which his character Oreste sang lines which were a little too suggestive coming from an ex-"Terrorist": [...] "J'ai trahi l'amitié, j'ai trahi la nature/Des plus noirs attentats, j'ai comblé la mesure" [...] ("I have betrayed friendship, betrayed Nature/I have gone to the extreme of blackest deeds"). On the other hand, according to the memoirs of Count , it was indeed in the role of Oreste that Lays sought to return to the stage. However, the implacable hostility of the audience prevented him from singing a single note and, after an hour of fruitless efforts, he eventually had to be replaced by an understudy. His actual reappearance then took place in a revival of Sacchini's Œdipe à Colone, in which he sang the far less controversial character of King Theseus. Even then, things did not go smoothly: the audience booed and protested throughout the performance, although this time he was not prevented from completing it. At the end, the leading tenor Étienne Lainez returned onto the proscenium to sing, as usual, Le Réveil du Peuple, but he was shouted down and forced to take refuge in the wings. Lays was rowdily summoned back instead. Lainez accompanied his colleague on stage, hoping they would be allowed to sing together, but he was once more driven off by the furious audience, and Lays had to perform solo. No sooner had he managed to get through a couple of verses, however, than he too was driven off by booing, because the audience thought he was unworthy of the words he was singing. The unfortunate Lainez had to retake the stage for a third time to finish the performance. By the end of September, nevertheless, enthusiasm for such post-Revolutionary reprisals had abated and Lays was able to make a triumphant return as the Genius of Fire in Salieri's Tarare, his debut in the role.|$|R

Today, {{the success of}} an entire financial institution may <b>lay</b> on <b>managing</b> a broad landscape of IT risks. IT risk is a potential damage to an organization's value, resulting from inadequate managing of processes and technologies. IT risk includes the failure to respond to security and privacy requirements, {{as well as many}} other issues such as: human error, internal fraud through software manipulation, external fraud by intruders, obsolesce in applications and machines, reliability issues or mismanagement. The World Economic Forum provides best information about this problem. They rank a breakdown of critical information infrastructure among the most likely core global risks, with 10 - 20 % likelihood over the next 10 years and potential worldwide impact of $ 250 billion. Sustained investment in IT - almost $ 1. 2 trillion or 29 % of 2006 private-sector capital investment in the U. S. alone fuels growing exposure to IT risk.

But he did persevere, and had managed to have one or two good runs. Now it was the fortune of the Runnymede hunt that many of those who rode with the hounds were strangers to the country,--men who came down by train from London, gentlemen of perhaps no great distinction, who could ride hard, but as to whom it was thought that as they did not provide the land to ride over, or the fences to be destroyed, or the coverts for the foxes, or the greater part of the subscription, they ought not to oppose those by whom all these things were supplied. But the Major, knowing where his strength <b>lay,</b> had <b>managed</b> to get a party to support him. The contract to hunt the country had been made with him in last March, and was good for one year. Having the kennels and the hounds under his command he did hunt the country; but he did so amidst a storm of contumely and ill will.|$|R
40|$|Enterprise risk {{management}} (ERM) encompasses {{the spectrum of}} identifying and analyzing risk from an integrated, company-wide perspective in a structured and disciplined approach in aligning strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge with a purpose of evaluating and managing the uncertainties facing the enterprise as it creates value.

However, the neo-classical finance theory (NCFT) postulates that managing the firm’s idiosyncratic risks is irrelevant.

40|$|The lay caregiving role is {{integral}} to advanced cancer care but places carers 2 ̆ 7 health at risk.

A Needs Assessment Tool for Caregivers (NAT-C) was developed for carers to self-complete and use {{as the basis of}} a GP consultation, then tested in a randomised controlled trial. This paper reports a qualitative research study to determine the usefulness and acceptability of the NAT-C in the Australian primary care setting. Convenience samples of 11 carers and 5 GPs were interviewed between September 2010 and December 2011 regarding their experiences with and perceptions of the NAT-C. Open-ended questions were used, and the transcripts were analysed qualitatively to identify themes and patterns. Three major themes were identified: (a) Acceptability of the intervention; (b) Impact of the intervention on the GP-patient relationship; and (c) Place of the intervention in advanced cancer care. This simple checklist was acceptable to carers, although some were uncertain about the legitimacy of discussing their own needs with their GP. Carer-patients could not be certain whether a GP would be willing or equipped to conduct a NAT-C-based consultation. Such consultations were acceptable to most GPs, although some already used a holistic approach while others preferred brief symptom-based consultations. Although the NAT-C was acceptable to most carers and GPs, supportive consultations take time. This raises organisational issues to be addressed so carers can seek and benefit from their GP 2 ̆ 7 s support...|$|R

Objective: To conduct a feasibility study of a three-month, Christian-based intuitive-eating programme in a church. Methods: A total of 18 adults participated. Ethical approval was granted by Coventry University Ethics Committee. Participant and facilitator experience was investigated qualitatively. Results showed participants accepted the programme and engaged well with its spiritual component. <b>Lay</b> facilitators <b>managed</b> to adequately run the programme, although some difficulties identified training needs. Clinical, psychological and spiritual measures were analysed using intention to treat; baseline observation carried forward to input missing data. Mental well-being, anxiety, depression, quality of life, pain/discomfort uncontrolled-eating, emotional-eating, cognitive-restrained-eating, intuitive-eating and Body Mass Index (BMI) improved significantly post-intervention. There were improvements in spiritual well-being, and reductions in energy, fat and saturated fat intake. Between {{the end of the}} intervention and a six-month follow-up, there were no statistically significant changes. However, the extent that weight and BMI returned to baseline levels meant that the reduction from baseline was no longer significant or clinically important. Mean changes in other variables, including uncontrolled eating, emotional eating, mental well-being and anxiety remained statistically improved from baseline. At six-month follow-up, improvements in intuitive eating were fully sustained at this time point and total fat, saturated fat and sugar intake had reduced further even though these values did not reach statistical significance.

The Climate Institute {{is at the forefront}} in examining the assumptions behind such investment decisions {{and the extent to which}} climate risk is or is not integrated. This report aims to inform citizen investors and decision makers on the intersection of business, investment and climate change. It <b>lays</b> out why <b>managing</b> climate risk in the context of superannuation matters to you, why you should ask what your fund is investing in and ensure you are comfortable with how your retirement savings are managed. Climate risk is an area of continued and growing interest for The Climate Institute and we expect to produce more reports on this topic in the coming year. This report consolidates analysis and review of the impact of climate and carbon risks on retirement and superannuation savings, especially in Australia. It builds on work The Climate Institute has undertaken with its partner organisation the Asset Owners Disclosure Project (AODP) in asking the world’s largest funds to disclose how much of their investment is in high versus low-carbon assets. It includes the 2013 - 14 index results, with a focus on the performance of Australian funds.

Given the increasing emphasis on multi-agency inter-professional collaboration, service user involvement and lay advocacy, {{it is important to}} consider and reflect on how both professionals and lay people understand this area of work. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study employed Augusto Boal’s model of Forum Theatre to explore how a variety of professional and lay groups understood, related to and engaged with how the Care Act 2014 defines and describes “adult safeguarding”. Findings - Lay participants responded to the scenario in a variety of ways, upholding the construct validity of “adult safeguarding” and the authority of the social worker. Social care and health practitioners sought orderly, professionalised and sometimes ritualistic solutions to the “adult safeguarding” scenario presented, seeking carefully to structure and to <b>manage</b> <b>lay</b> involvement. Inter-professional collaboration was often problematic. The role of lay advocates was regarded ambiguously and ambivalently. Originality/value - This paper offers a number of practice and research recommendations. Safeguarding practitioners could benefit from more effective and reflexive inter-professional collaboration. Both practitioners and service users could benefit from the more thoughtful deployment of the lay advocates encouraged within the Care Act 2014 and associated guidance...|$|R
40|$|Diet and nutrition, {{particularly}} among low-income groups, {{is a key}} public health concern in the UK. Low levels of fruit and vegetable consumption, and obesity, especially among children, have potentially severe consequences for the future health of the nation. From a public health perspective, the UK government's role is to help poorer families make informed choices within healthy frameworks for living. However, the question is – {{to what extent are}} such policies in accordance with <b>lay</b> experiences of <b>managing</b> diet and nutrition on a low-income? This paper critically examines contemporary public health policies aimed at improving diet and nutrition, identifying the underlying theories about the influences on healthy eating in poor families, and exploring {{the extent to which these}} assumptions are based on experiential accounts. It draws on two qualitative systematic reviews – one prioritizing low-income mothers’ accounts of ‘managing’ in poverty; and the other focusing on children's perspectives. The paper finds some common ground between policies and lay experiences, but also key divergencies. Arguably, the emphasis of public health policy on individual behaviour, coupled with an ethos of empowered consumerism, underplays material limitations on ‘healthy eating’ for low-income mothers and children. Health policies fail to take into account the full impact of structural influences on food choices, or recognize the social and emotional factors that influence diet and nutrition. In conclusion, it is argued that while health promotion campaigns to improve low-income families’ diets do have advantages, these are insufficient to outweigh the negative effects of poverty on nutrition...|$|R
