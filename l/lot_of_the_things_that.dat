On the other hand, Anderson also added that [...] "the only thing about it that lets me down is that I made it sound a little too Seventies. I deliberately made the album sound like it was {{in the context of a}} live performance, rather than have it sound too 'studio.' But looking back on it, I think it should have been a bit more varied".|$|E

I was very much wrapped up in the concept that as kids growing up, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we're presented with have deeper meanings than our parents would like us to see, like Willy Wonka and the Brothers Grimm. So what I was trying to point out was that when our parents hide the truth from us, it's more damaging than if they were to expose us to things like Marilyn Manson in the first place." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Mis//Understanding" [...] {{was officially}} released, {{exclusively}} by ArtistDirect.com as the album's first music video on November 11, 2011. It {{is the first}} of a three part series of music videos for songs off of this album. The videos were filmed in Brooklyn, NY in September, with director Travis Kopach. According to guitarist Joshua Moore, [...] "We actually filmed three music videos. The story you see is actually part one of three. As time goes, we'll release another video and then follow it with the final video. You see this guy running through the woods. There are scenes of him covered in mud, dirt, and grime. He's even running from himself. That's all going on in his mind. He's running away from the darkness that he sees. He's trying to break away and break out from that. It goes along with the lyrics of the song—not understanding a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happen and the negativity that seems mindless. There's no reason for it. Towards the end of the song, Dave Stephens says, 'Don't give up on me. Take comfort in me.' The song is ultimately about figuring out how to fix things within yourself and be happy. That's where it all starts. More or less, the video is the artistic way of expressing that." ...|$|E
5000|$|One {{aspect of}} the rewrite was the song [...] "Dr. Zaius" [...] from the Planet of the Apes musical, which the staff {{consider}} {{to be one of}} the greatest musical numbers ever written for The Simpsons. The two songs in the musical were composed by Alf Clausen, who had worked as a copyist on the original film of Planet of the Apes. Weinstein - who had not seen the film at the time - pitched it in the writer's room as [...] "Rock Me Dr. Zaius", in parody of the 1985 song [...] "Rock Me Amadeus" [...] by Falco. It expanded into a full song primarily concocted by George Meyer, who included [...] "corny" [...] aspects of vaudeville. The line [...] "From chimpan-A to chimpan-Z" [...] in the final song of the musical was written by David X. Cohen. Oakley commented that he has heard the line [...] "all over the world". Several of the staffers have commented on how writing the Planet of the Apes parody generated a great deal of enthusiasm in the writer's room: Oakley described it as [...] "one of those rare bursts of creative brilliance. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> people remember and love on The Simpsons were horrible late-night grinds, whereas this was just a magic visit from the joke fairy".|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} nine months before her death, Amy Wallace said that Irving was [...] "virtually a perfect dad - a wonderful, loving man, {{who did a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> one would expect a mother to do: when I wet the bed {{at three in the}} morning when I was little, he uncomplainingly got up and changed them; he cut out my paper dolls; when I had a nightmare he got up with me, no matter what time, to share a cup of tea and talk about it." ...|$|R

I was very disappointed by a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> she did say in the media and her different interviews. People are kind of aware of her comments and then also of course on the show, those comments were definitely going to get back to me. I was really disappointed and I don't know why she would go that route. And if it was to depict her as the victim and everybody else is the bad guy… I don't really know where all that stems from, but to me it's like she has her situation. And as you guys saw, I congratulated her as I was walking out the door! So it was like I don't have a problem and I don't know why she would have a problem… but she might, I'm not sure." [...] Woods went on during this interview to comment, [...] "I don't have any animosity towards any of the girls. Like things happen for a reason, it's time to move on you know, chapter ends. People are in each other's lives for a reason and a season, as they say! So there's no reason to hold any grudges. Um, however - the way that you present yourself, the actions you take, the comments that you make can lend themselves to having a 'beef' or having animosity." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Save the Last One" [...] {{marked the}} final {{appearance}} of Pruitt Taylor Vince, whose character was killed {{off in the}} episode after Shane shoots him; this subsequently marks {{a turning point for}} him as a false protagonist. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, writer Robert Kirkman explained the reaction of Jon Bernthal to the particular scene:"Jon Bernthal is a tremendous talent and he’s got a lot of professionalism. A lot of the actors came in to the room as we were starting this season and Bernthal was one of those actors. He was aware of a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were coming up and we talked to him about his character and what we had planned for him this season and he was on board with a lot of it. It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a lot of times, think about their characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years. He was all prepared for this."Kirkman expressed that the death of Otis was a [...] "somewhat justifiable homicide", and retorted that [...] "Otis was slowing him down, and Carl's life hangs in the balance." [...] He continued: [...] "It's The Walking Dead and we're existing in that gray area and we're really pushing the boundaries of that. But {{at the end of the}} day, Shane shot that guy and left him for dead and ran off. It's a pretty dark moment and it informs Shane's character and sets up a lot of things that are going to be happening moving forward." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to take}} place in Boston or Chicago but, according to Verhoeven, it proved to be [...] "too difficult" [...] to shoot the film in the United States due to its violent and immoral content as [...] "that would have meant getting more into the direction of Basic Instinct, but a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are important in the movie would probably have been diminished. By bringing it more into a thriller direction, I think it would have lost everything. It would probably have been banal and transparent. The mystery would have gone." [...] Verhoeven then decided to do it in French and used a significant time before production to learn the language, in order to effectively communicate with the predominantly French cast and crew. In September 2014, French actress Isabelle Huppert signed on to star in the film as Michèle. Huppert had expressed interest in a screen adaptation of the book before Verhoeven, whom she described as [...] "one of the best directors in the world for me," [...] joined the production and accepted the part immediately, [...] "I had no doubt about the integrity to the role. Of course if you just circle the story to the rape and a woman being attracted by the man who raped her, I mean, that really makes the whole purpose very, very narrow and limited. I think it's a lot more than this. And she's really interesting character because she's always go against predictable definitions {{of what it means to}} be a woman, what it means to be a man. Obviously, the movie's about a woman. But it's also about men, you know, and the men are sort of fading figures, very weak, quite fragile. So it's really also about the empowerment of a woman." ...|$|E

[...] Screenwriter and producer Rick Jaffa also stated that Rise featured several clues as to future sequels: [...] "I hope that we're building a platform for future films.
