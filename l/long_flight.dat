5|$|Having {{misunderstood}} {{the news}} about an upsurge of piracy in the Indian Ocean, Cartman excitedly tells his friends the classic era of piracy has returned, and asks the boys {{to join him in}} becoming a pirate in what he describes as a responsibility-free life in a warm tropical paradise. Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all, Kyle encourages him to go, even offering to help pay for his ticket. Although Butters, Ike, Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew, an undaunted Cartman uses his mother's credit card to book a trip to Somalia. After a <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> and a 49-hour bus ride, the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates. Once there, however, they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land, the complete opposite of their expectations.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E
5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a <b>long</b> <b>flight,</b> enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E
50|$|The {{programme}} {{carried out}} six manned spaceflights between 1961 and 1963. The <b>longest</b> <b>flight</b> lasted nearly five days, {{and the last}} four were launched in pairs, one day apart. This exceeded Project Mercury's demonstrated capability of just over 34 hours <b>longest</b> <b>flight,</b> and single missions.|$|R

The Houston-Sydney service, at 8,596 miles, will be United's second <b>longest</b> <b>flight</b> following its Los Angeles-Singapore October 2017 launch. Additionally, it will surpass Emirates' Dubai route as the <b>longest</b> <b>flight</b> at IAH.|$|R

25|$|Mike Denness was {{affected}} by a mystery virus thought {{to be caused by}} the <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> to Australia and his vice-captain John Edrich led the MCC, but the match was abandoned due to rain, which became a common occurrence as the Australian summer of 1974-75 was rife with heavy rain and floods.|$|E
25|$|Ef. surinamensis is {{responsible}} for pollinating {{a wide variety of}} orchids and other flora in neotropical regions. Thanks to their <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> ranges, these bees are crucial for the continued reproduction of scattered and uncommon flora throughout tropical forests. Thus deforestation and fragmentation of their habitats not only jeopardizes these bees, but also the entire surrounding ecosystem.|$|E

The city's major art museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, {{is one of the}} largest art museums in the United States. Its <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> of steps to the main entrance became famous after the film Rocky (1976).|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, on 21 June, the Admiralty {{announced}} that HM King had been graciously pleased to award the Distinguished Service Cross to both Wilson and Mills 'for their services on 7 June 1915, when after a <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> in darkness over hostile territory, they threw bombs on the zeppelin shed at Evere near Brussels, and destroyed a zeppelin which was inside. The two officers {{were exposed to}} heavy anti-aircraft fire during the attack' (London Gazette 21 June 1915).|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 1945, SAA {{achieved}} a longtime company goal by operating a route to Europe when an Avro York landed in Bournemouth, England, after the <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> from Palmietfontein near Johannesburg. These {{were replaced by}} the Douglas DC-4 from 1946 onwards, which in turn {{was replaced by the}} Lockheed Constellation on international routes in 1950. Also of note in the post war era was the DC-3 Dakota, of which eight served with SAA, the last example being withdrawn as late as 1970.|$|E

25|$|During his {{imprisonment}} Alcock had {{resolved to}} fly the Atlantic one day, {{and after the war}} he approached the Vickers engineering and aviation firm at Weybridge, who had considered entering their Vickers Vimy IV twin-engined bomber in the competition but had not yet found a pilot. Alcock's enthusiasm impressed the Vickers' team and he was appointed as their pilot. Work began on converting the Vimy for the <b>long</b> <b>flight,</b> replacing the bomb racks with extra petrol tanks. Shortly afterwards Brown, who was unemployed, approached Vickers seeking a post and his knowledge of long distance navigation convinced them to take him on as Alcock's navigator.|$|E
25|$|In October of {{that year}} the unit {{prepared}} {{to take part in}} an exercise with the group in the Pacific area. With the ground echelon setting sail on 13 November 1941, the 9th made ready to fly into Hickam Field, Hawaii, the following month on 7 December 1941. The B-17s had no ammunition so more fuel could be carried on the <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> to Hawaii, and to compensate for the additional fuel stored aft of the center of gravity, the armor had been removed from the crew positions and placed, along with the machine guns, forward in the fuselage to balance the weight of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Sauron {{is shown}} to have bred his own Uruk-hai, known as Black Uruks. They can be seen when Frodo is {{captured}} by the orcs of Cirith Ungol and his mithril shirt leads to a confrontation between Shagrat, a Black Uruk of Mordor, and an orc from Minas Morgul called Gorbag. Gorbag threatens to stab Shagrat if he tries to steal the shirt, but he tosses it aside and throws Gorbag down a <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> of stairs, where he falls on top of several other Uruk-hai. A huge brawl between orcs and Uruk-hai spreads all over the fortress, allowing Sam to enter the tower with ease.|$|E

25|$|By July 1990, {{plans were}} made for Connolly and his band to tour Australia in November. During the <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> to Australia, Connolly's health had {{suffered}} and he was hospitalised in Adelaide Hospital, allegedly for dehydration and related problems. The rest of the band played a show in Adelaide without him. After being released from the hospital, Connolly joined the other band members in Melbourne for a gig at the Pier Hotel, in Frankston. After several other shows, including one at the Dingley Powerhouse, Connolly and his band played a final date at Melbourne's Greek Theatre. It was felt Connolly's health was sufficient reason for the tour not to be extended, {{and some of the}} planned dates were abandoned. Connolly went back to England and his band appeared on The Bob Downe Christmas show on 18 December 1990.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} commission {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} aircraft losing altitude, falling into a sideslip and descending into the ground, first hitting it with the right wingtip. The cause of loss of altitude was unknown, but could either have been part of a sideways banking maneuver or uncontrolled. The varying weather with pockets of good and poor visibility led the commission to believe that the aircraft could have flown into an area with fog and lost sight of the horizon. It reported that the accident took place towards the end of a very <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> and that fatigue could have reduced the pilots' faculties. This could be a decisive pivoting factor in the narrow margins while maneuvering at such low altitudes. The commission found no signs of technical error on the aircraft. It also commented that flying at low altitudes over the sea was common because of the lower wind speeds.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his success}} with Cooper, Brabham {{was sure he}} could do better. He {{considered}} buying Cooper in partnership with Roy Salvadori and then in late 1959 he asked his friend Ron Tauranac {{to come to the}} UK and work with him, producing upgrade kits for Sunbeam Rapier and Triumph Herald road cars at his car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, but with the long-term aim of designing racing cars. Brabham continued to drive for Cooper, but on the <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> back from the 1960 season-opening Argentine Grand Prix, he had a heart-to-heart with John Cooper. John's father Charlie and the designer Owen Maddock had been reluctant to update their car, but although a Cooper had won in Argentina, other cars had been faster before they broke down. Brabham helped design the more advanced Cooper T53, including advice from Tauranac. Brabham spun the new car out of the next championship race, the Monaco Grand Prix, but then embarked on a series of five straight victories. He won from the front at the Dutch, French, and Belgian Grands Prix, where title rival Moss was badly injured in a practice accident that put him out for two months. Two other drivers were killed during the race. At the British Grand Prix, Brabham was closing on Graham Hill's BRM before Hill spun off, leaving Brabham the victory. He then came back from eighth place to second at the Portuguese Grand Prix after sliding off on tramlines and won after race leader John Surtees crashed. Brabham's points total was put out of reach when the British teams withdrew from the Italian GP on safety grounds. Mike Lawrence writes that Brabham's expertise in setting up the cars was a significant factor in Cooper's 1960 drivers' and constructors' titles.|$|E
5000|$|The Brokker {{arrived late}} at the Iford meeting {{and was not}} flown until the final day. Its first launch was not {{successful}} but the next resulted in a flight of over 90 mins ended only by darkness, the third <b>longest</b> <b>flight</b> of the week. [...] The relative steadiness of the heavy Brokker in the strong winds of the last day, compared with all other competitors with their low wing loadings, was noted. Gray received the Royal Aero Club prize of £50 third <b>longest</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|R

[...] Birmingham trailed after the first quarter but rallied to defeat the Portland Storm 30–8 {{in front of a}} below-average 25,621 {{hometown}} fans at Legion Field on October 9. [...] The following week, on October 16, the Americans lost their third game in four weeks, falling 29–25 to the Southern California Sun before a crowd of 25,247 in Anaheim.|$|E
500|$|In 1956, the air force, in {{an effort}} to gain {{political}} support, planned a record flight from Córdoba to Buenos Aires to demonstrate the combat potential of the IAe 33. [...] The Pulqui II would fly 800km, strafe an air force practice range in the Buenos Aires area, and then return to Córdoba using only internal fuel. The only oxygen equipment available for such a <b>long</b> <b>flight</b> was scrounged from a FMA Meteor under repairs. Lt. Balado successfully completed the flight (including the strafing demonstration) at an average cruise speed of around 900km/h, but the oxygen system failed on the return leg. The semi-conscious pilot managed to perform an emergency landing at high speed, but the heavy landing and resulting stress broke the landing gear, with the Pulqui II overrunning the end of the runway, the aircraft being damaged beyond repair.|$|E
