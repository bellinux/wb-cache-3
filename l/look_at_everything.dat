500|$|When {{designing}} Infamous 2, Sucker Punch {{decided to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> {{that could be}} improved, saying [...] "everything was on the table". Due to negative feedback from fans, they redesigned the main character, Cole. Cole initially underwent many changes, {{to the extent of}} making him look like a different character. However, after being [...] "taken aback by the uproar of fan support for the original Cole," [...] Sucker Punch combined elements of the original with the new design. Some of Cole's clothing was changed to suit the new setting of the game. Eric Ladin was also brought in to replace Jason Cottle as the voice of Cole because Sucker Punch felt that they needed someone who could perform Cole's physical reactions as well as his voice with the use of their new motion capture technology.|$|E
500|$|Co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman co-wrote the episode's teleplay, while Pinkner, Wyman, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman co-wrote the story. Executive producer Joe Chappelle served as director. A full season renewal of Fringe was announced on March 24, 2011. They {{had written the}} finale without knowing {{if there would be}} another season, but decided not to make any changes to the script even after hearing of its renewal. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming that we would be on for Season 4. We never for one second entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] In an interview with the New York Post, Pinkner warned that events in the finale will [...] "unfurl in a very unexpected way for the characters and the audience". He also commented that the finale [...] "hopefully will make you sort of revisit and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> that's happened all year through a fresh pair of glasses".|$|E
60|$|And {{his stomach}} {{did not want}} any more brandy. He went doggedly across the fields with his terrier, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> with a jaundiced eye.|$|R
50|$|Formerly, {{during the}} NHL season he hosted Panthers Unrestricted Weekend every Saturday from 9-10am with Florida Panthers play-by-play man Randy Moller where the duo <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> {{revolving}} around the Panthers.|$|R
6000|$|Flora Schuyler nodded. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I would. It's {{quite an}} old trouble. There {{are two ways}} of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything,</b> and other folks have had to worry over them {{right back to the}} beginning." ...|$|R
500|$|Because {{the use of}} {{medicinal}} {{marijuana is}} prominently featured in the episode, Fox had [...] "incredible fears" [...] about it and were very hesitant to have it broadcast. They especially disapproved of {{a scene in which}} Homer smokes marijuana for the first time, since {{they did not want to}} instruct children how to smoke. The staff discussed the scene for a long time with the network until they came up with a compromise. Just before the joint touches Homer's lips, the scene cuts to a psychedelic sequence that transpires from the joint's tip. Despite their concerns, Jean opined that the network gave the staff a [...] "pretty good amount" [...] of creative freedom with the episode. [...] " [...] obviously, the network didn't want us glorifying casual marijuana use", he said in an interview with the music magazine Relix. [...] " [...] like we usually do, we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> from two sides and it's supposed to be a thoughtful look at a serious thing". Despite the modification of the scene, the network and the series' staff members were still worried about how the episode would be received. [...] "Weeks before it aired, we were going 'This is really going to kill everything...'", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
2500|$|... "Nobody's Business" [...] mixes Chicago {{stepping}} {{and house}} styles, featuring strings, piano, and a four-on-the-floor kick drum. Rihanna {{said that the}} song's lyrics show [...] "basically the way I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> regarding my personal life." [...] Lyrically, the couple proclaims their eternal fealty, make out in a Lexus and acknowledge {{the world that the}} romantic relationship between them is only their business.|$|E
2500|$|He remains {{active on}} {{economical}} issues and harshly criticised the International Monetary Fund (IMF) {{of failing to}} show leadership during {{what he described as}} a [...] "historic" [...] global financial crisis. While attending the international business conference at Philippines, Aziz maintained that: [...] "This global institution (IMF) which is supposed to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> going on was not even in the room where meetings are going on". In 2008, Aziz gave vehement criticism to IMF and according to him, the [...] "IMF has played a very negative role" [...] in global crises.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival on 8 August 1942, the new Middle East commander, Harold Alexander, visited Geoffrey Barkas's {{camouflage}} unit at Helwan to assess its ability to implement Bertram. He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> intently, but seemed most interested in the woodworking shop.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only once," [...] {{answered}} the child, [...] "another set came, but they only stayed one day. They <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything,</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me an' Meerta an' laughed very much. An' they ate and drank a good deal, and fought a little; but they took nothing away, {{and never came}} back." ...|$|R

2500|$|Initially the finds {{were put}} in display {{for a short time}} in Vinkovci in the {{condition}} in which they were found. They were later moved to the Archaeological museum in the capital where they are to be conserved and studied. It is intended that they will ultimately be returned to the City Museum in Vinkovci where they will be put on permanent display, possibly in a new building dedicated for that purpose. According to the museum's Hrvoje Vulić, [...] "This will be our kind of Mona Lisa. So you go to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa, but then you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> else. Thus we also hope that this treasure will attract more people to Vinkovci." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Erik Wolpaw {{scored the}} PC version 7.7 out of 10, and {{although}} he was very critical of the trust/fear system and the controls, he concluded [...] "The Thing is kind of short, it's not especially effective at making you feel afraid, its most intriguing gameplay elements are somewhat extraneous, and it suffers from a wonky control scheme. Yet, thanks to some high production values and consistently interesting action scenes, The Thing rises above these flaws. It could have been great, but {{in light of the}} checkered history of movie-licensed games, being good at all is a pretty impressive achievement." [...] Ryan MacDonald scored the PlayStation 2 version 8.4 out of 10, writing [...] "when you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> the game offers in terms of its gameplay, presentation, and story, it's hard not to appreciate The Thing whether you're a fan of the film it's based on or just a fan of the survival horror genre in general." [...] He also scored the Xbox version 8.4 out of 10, calling it [...] "the best of the three, combining sharp graphics similar to those found in the PC version with the superior console-style control found in the PlayStation 2 version." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{sending his}} Historical preface and {{corrections}} for the American edition in February, Darwin thanked Asa Gray for his comments, as [...] "a Review from a man, {{who is not}} an entire convert, if fair & [...] moderately favourable, is in all respects {{the best kind of}} Review. About weak points I agree. The eye to this day gives me a cold shudder, but when I think of the fine known gradations, my reason tells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder." [...] In April he continued, [...] "It is curious that I remember well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, & now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" [...] A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the theological aspects and [...] "had no intention to write atheistically, but could not see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars" [...] – expressing his particular revulsion at the Ichneumonidae family of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of other insects so that their parasitoid young have a ready source of food. He therefore could not believe in the necessity of design, but rather than attributing the wonders of the universe to brute force was [...] "inclined to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton" [...] – referring to Isaac Newton.|$|E
50|$|Sherlock Hemlock is {{an obvious}} parody of Sherlock Holmes and the stereotypical detective. He wears a similar hat and cloak and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> through a {{magnifying}} glass. However, his name {{also seems to be}} a reference to hemlock, the poisonous plant used to kill the philosopher Socrates.|$|R
6000|$|She was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything,</b> with an {{eye that}} denoted clear perception--at her companion, at the two dogs, at the two gentlemen under the trees, at the {{beautiful}} scene that surrounded her. [...] "I've never seen anything so lovely as this place. I've {{been all over the}} house; it's too enchanting." ...|$|R
50|$|Although Hattie's {{work does}} not exactly mirror this list, {{the main reason}} is that the New Zealand study <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> related to education, {{including}} family effects and changes to the curriculum, while the Colorado study <b>looked</b> only <b>at</b> classroom methods. There are, however, no incompatibilities and most of Marzano's top-ten appear high on Hattie's list.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Wyllard. [...] "In fact, I'd like {{to spend}} some hours here and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything.</b> I'd begin at the {{pictures}} and work right around." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Mr. Vigil," [...] {{she said}} earnestly, [...] "things {{would never get}} done. Sometimes I think you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> {{too much in the}} light of the way it ought to be!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, madam," [...] said Wyllard--and {{the word}} rose instinctively to his lips, for {{it seemed to}} him the only fitting way to address her. [...] "In fact, I'd like to spend some hours here and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything.</b> I'd begin at the {{pictures}} and work right round." ...|$|E
5000|$|A twenty-year-old [...] "servant" [...] of Kokonse. Kashii wears {{glasses and}} has a sort of Mohawk styled hair. He has an extreme {{negative}} personality and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> in despair. He is revealed to possess the [...] "Monkey" [...] characteristic of the four types since he couldn't break through the iron bar during the exam.|$|R
60|$|And so it proved; not so {{much for}} the details as for the spirit in which he was aided in <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything,</b> from the mighty {{questions}} which prove the life of the Church by the vehement emotion they occasion, down to the difficulties of theory and practice that harassed himself--not named, perhaps, but still greatly unravelled.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Hall <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Julius. <b>Everything</b> {{that he was}} for {{the moment}} {{incapable}} of saying was eloquent in that look.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay {{just as long}} as it pleases you, and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> you want, though you'll have {{to excuse}} me going round with you to-day," [...] he said. [...] "There's a party of the Directors' city friends coming up, and it's quite likely they'll keep me busy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{one could}} get to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> with as much {{indifference}} as the swinging! But it is all selfishness. It is as easy to be selfish for one's own good as for one's own pleasure; and I dare say, the first is {{as bad as the}} other.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Sir,' I said, 'before {{you send}} me to a madhouse, which I suppose is {{what you mean by}} these words, I trust you will at least examine the evidences of my story. Look at my clothing, look at these coins, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> about me.' And I handed him my purse to see for himself.|$|E
30|$|Researching Google’s culture, {{we would}} know Laszlo Bock, Head of People Operations at Google, the {{equivalence}} of Human Resources (HR) Director at other companies. “People operation” {{is a combination of}} science and human resources where Google <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> from a perspective of data (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2012; Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger 2013). As a result, Google is always in the top companies throughout the last time.|$|R
2500|$|... "It is {{impossible}} to create a perfect system, one that is free of all mistakes, free of all discrimination with respect to race or economic circumstance or geography. To have a consistent, perfect death penalty system, I have concluded, after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> I’ve been given, that that’s impossible in our state. I think it’s the right and just thing to abolish the death penalty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{became so}} much {{interested}} in the operations and constitution of this great horde of soldiers, attendants, animals, vehicles, and ships, that I went about <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> and getting all the information possible. In these days I {{would have been a}} war correspondent, and I did act somewhat in that capacity; for I told Herodotus a great many of the facts which he put into his history of this great campaign." ...|$|R
60|$|While {{we were at}} dinner, I ordered my midshipmen to {{take their}} {{observations}} of every distant object, and to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> with their glasses, which they did, and told me of this lake; but my patron could give no account of it, having never been, as he said before, one step farther that way than where we were.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> here," [...] said Kenyon. [...] "I {{love to have}} {{painters}} see my work. Their {{judgment is}} unprejudiced, and more valuable {{than that of the}} world generally, from the light which their own art throws on mine. More valuable, too, than that of my brother sculptors, who never judge me fairly,--nor I them, perhaps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How funnily you do <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything,</b> Mr. Le Breton,' said Edie. 'It {{would never}} have struck {{me to think of}} a pension from the army in that light. And yet of course it's the right light; only we don't most of us take the trouble to go to the bottom of things, as you do. But what will you do if you don't get the fellowship?' ...|$|E
60|$|They evidently did {{not know}} whether to regard the watch as a {{mechanical}} contrivance or a living creature. In the study of this mysterious thing they were somewhat distracted by the presence of their first love the umbrella, which the lecturer had erected over his head in order to shield his timepiece from the rain. Fred and Grant went about everywhere, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything,</b> and talking, as they best could, to everybody.|$|R
500|$|In February 2015, Harpole {{sat down}} with NewsChannel 10 to show {{hundreds}} of pages of documents that the city reviewed to vet Wallace Bajjali prior to {{doing business with the}} group in 2011. Harpole defended the city's decision at the time, saying, [...] "They <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything</b> they could to say are these people reasonable, can they perform and [...] have they been honest in their past dealings. Every one of these (documents) says to move ahead".|$|R
500|$|With {{help from}} a team of ex-military officers, {{including}} Ed Snyder, a former commander of the battleship , Thompson produced a story which aired on 60 Minutes in November 1989. The story, conducted by Mike Wallace, heavily criticized the findings of Milligan's investigation. The story contained an interview in which Milligan defended his conclusions, saying, [...] "Mike, {{there is no other}} cause of this accident. We have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>everything.</b> We've ruled out everything. This was a deliberate act, most likely done by Petty Officer Hartwig." ...|$|R
