25|$|The June 27, 1988, shock {{occurred}} {{with a maximum}} intensity of VI (Strong). Its effects included broken windows in <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos,</b> and other light damage in Holy City, where increased flow was observed at a water well. Farther away from the Santa Cruz Mountains, pieces of concrete fell from a parking structure at the Sunnyvale Town Center, a two-level shopping mall in Santa Clara County. More moderate damage resulted from the August 8, 1989, shock (intensity VII, Very strong) when chimneys were toppled in Cupertino, <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos,</b> and Redwood Estates. Other damage included cracked walls and foundations and broken underground pipes. At {{the office of the}} <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> City Manager, a window that was cracked had also been broken in the earlier shock. Also in <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos,</b> one man died when he exited a building through a window and fell five stories.|$|E
25|$|State Route 85 roughly {{marks the}} {{northern}} {{boundary of the}} town, although a few pockets of homes to its North are included. Highway 9 (Los Gatos-Saratoga Road) from the coast terminates at Highway 17. Downtown <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos,</b> the area on and around Santa Cruz Avenue and Main Street, {{is located in the}} southwest quadrant of town. A left exit on northbound Highway 17 becomes the south end of South Santa Cruz Avenue, leading into downtown. The area around <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> Boulevard, east of Highway 17, is much more typically suburban than downtown, with medium-sized shopping centers clustered at major intersections of the multilane boulevard. Although the town has generally a quiet setting, its principal noise generators are State Route 17 and <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> Boulevard. Sound levels within one hundred and fifty feet of <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> Boulevard exceed 60 CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level), a generally unacceptable range for residential living.|$|E
25|$|Downtown <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> has {{retained}} and restored {{many of its}} Victorian-era homes and commercial buildings. Other notable buildings are the Forbes Mill annex, dating to 1880 and now housing a history museum; <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> High School which dates from the 1920s; and the Old Town Shopping Center, formerly the University Avenue School (the school was established in 1882; the current buildings date to 1923).|$|E
25|$|Transport by rail was {{an early}} aspect of <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos.</b> The South Pacific Coast Railroad, a popular narrow-gauge line from Alameda (and San Francisco via ferry) to Santa Cruz in the late 19th century, stopped in <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos.</b> Southern Pacific took over this line in 1887. <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> was also near the Southern Pacific resort town of Holy City, along the rail line in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The last Southern Pacific {{passenger}} train to Santa Cruz left <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> in March 1940. In town, the rail line used to run along the shore of Vasona Reservoir to the present-day location of the Post Office, following the path {{of what is now}} a continuous string of parking lots between Santa Cruz Ave. and University Ave. There was also a streetcar-type rail line with service to Saratoga and San Jose. Streetcar service via the Peninsular Railway started about 1905 and ended about 1933. San Francisco commuter trains continued into downtown until 1959, and Vasona Junction until 1964. The site of the old railroad station is now occupied by Town Plaza and the post office.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Willys I. Peck, the <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> Telephone Company was {{the first}} company to offer telephone service in town. Later, the Western California Telephone Company provided service to <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> and to Novato, Morgan Hill, and Kenwood. In the 1970s, the utility was acquired by General Telephone and Electronics, which {{changed its name to}} GTE, and merged with Bell Atlantic in 2000 to become Verizon Communications. Verizon still serves these four areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{settlement}} that {{was established in}} the 1860s was originally named for the mill, but the name was changed to <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> after the Spanish land grant. The town was incorporated in 1887 and remained an important town for the logging industry in the Santa Cruz Mountains {{through the end of the}} 19th century. In the early 20th century, the town became a thriving agricultural town with apricots, grapes and prunes being grown in the area. By the 1920s, the <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> area had a local reputation as an arts colony, attracting painters, musicians, writers, actors and their bohemian associates as residents over the years. The violinist Yehudi Menuhin lived there as a boy; the actresses Joan Fontaine and Olivia de Havilland (sisters) were graduates of <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> High School, John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath there (the location is now located in Monte Sereno), and Beat hero Neal Cassady lived there in the 1950s. Along with much of the Santa Clara Valley, <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> became a suburban community for San Jose beginning in the 1950s, and the town was mostly built-out by the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos,</b> an {{explosion}} of bands emerged including Luis Alberto Spinetta's Almendra, the most influential band of the late 1960s, and Manal, the first successful blues-oriented group in Spanish. The three are considered {{the founders of the}} Argentine rock movement. None of these groups would have an extended history: in fact most disbanded by the early 1970s. The early Argentine rock scene was characterised by a lot of line-up changes in bands, and even member swapping between bands, or members of different bands meeting and forming new groups. However, the shuffles provided for a lot of experimentation and creativity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> {{is served}} by three central offices. Historically, these were called the Six Office, the Four Office, and the Mountain Office. The first two of these designations come from the {{historic}} exchange names when the town converted from manual to dial service. Phone numbers in these two offices were ELgato-6 and ELgato-4 numbers, respectively (dialed as ELx-xxxx.) As the area migrated to seven-digit numbers, these changed to 356- and 354-numbers. In their earlier life, all numbers for the segment of town served by each office had the respective prefix or office code related to that office.|$|E
25|$|SR 9 descends {{from the}} {{mountains}} heading east into Saratoga as Congress Springs Road. In Saratoga, SR 9 turns southeast and becomes Saratoga-Los Gatos Road. At Fruitvale Avenue in Saratoga, SR 9 briefly becomes a four-lane highway with a large center divider. However, as the road enters Monte Sereno, it again becomes a two-lane road. This particular narrowing has caused backups in the past; however, they have become more infrequent since the completion of SR 85. SR 9 resumes being a four lane road through downtown <b>Los</b> <b>Gatos</b> until its terminus at the junction with SR 17.|$|E
