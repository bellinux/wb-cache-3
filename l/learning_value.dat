Less is known about how dopamine shapes the relative impact of positive and negative outcomes to guide value-based choices. We combined administration of the dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist amisulpride with functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy human volunteers. Amisulpride did not affect initial reinforcement learning. However, in a later transfer phase that involved novel choice situations requiring decisions between two symbols based on their previously <b>learned</b> <b>values,</b> amisulpride improved participants' ability to select the better of two highly rewarding options, while it had no effect on choices between two very poor options. During the learning phase, activity in the striatum encoded a reward prediction error. In the transfer phase, {{in the absence of any}} outcome, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) continually tracked the <b>learned</b> <b>value</b> of the available options on each trial. Both striatal prediction error coding and tracking of <b>learned</b> <b>value</b> in the vmPFC were predictive of subjects' choice performance in the transfer phase, and both were enhanced under amisulpride.

40|$|Introduction Workplace-based {{assessment}} (WBA) {{has been}} the subject of much debate since its introduction; it remains unclear whether the intended <b>learning</b> <b>value</b> of these tools has been realised. The purpose of this thesis to establish what is the role and value of workplace-based assessment in learning in postgraduate medical education? Methods A retrospective cohort study was designed to establish how WBA has been implemented in six Irish training bodies and to explore the value of the documented information. This was followed by a phenomenological study of trainers’ and trainees’ experiences of WBA and how their perceptions of the <b>learning</b> <b>value</b> of WBA have been shaped. The value of WBA in identifying and/or remediating underperformance was explored using the Best Evidence in Medical Education (BEME) systematic review methods. Results The cohort study revealed a familiar picture of WBA as a ‘tick-box’ exercise. The <b>learning</b> <b>value</b> associated with WBA proved complex to elicit, however trainees associated WBA with training value and a justifiable way to ask for feedback and time with trainers. The BEME review identified 20 relevant studies but could not definitively establish the optimal implementation conditions for identifying or remediating underperformance. Discussion The findings suggest that it is the practice of formative assessment that is of <b>learning</b> <b>value</b> to trainees and not the individual WBA tools. The study also demonstrated that there is a potential <b>learning</b> <b>value</b> in affirmation of good practice and that ‘learning’ is a complex concept. Determining effectiveness of WBA in identifying or remediating underperformance was limited by lack of high quality prospective studies. Conclusion The value of WBA to its users is influenced by experience and is complex to articulate.

40|$|Background: Various {{feedback}} characteristics {{have been}} suggested to positively influence student learning. It {{is not clear how}} these feedback characteristics contribute to students' perceived <b>learning</b> <b>value</b> of feedback in cultures classified low on the cultural dimension of individualism and high on power distance. This study was conducted to validate the influence of five feedback characteristics on students' perceived <b>learning</b> <b>value</b> of feedback in an Indonesian clerkship context. Methods: We asked clerks in Neurology (n = 169) and Internal Medicine (n = 132) to assess on a 5 -point Likert scale the <b>learning</b> <b>value</b> of the feedback they received. We asked them to record whether the feedback provider (1) informed the student what went well, (2) mentioned which aspects of performance needed improvement, (3) compared the student's performance to a standard, (4) further explained or demonstrated the correct performance, and (5) prepared an action plan with the student to improve performance. Data were analyzed using multilevel regression. Results: A total of 250 students participated in this study, 131 from Internal Medicine (response rate 99 %) and 119 from Neurology (response rate 70 %). Of these participants, 225 respondents (44 % males, 56 % females) completed the form and reported 889 feedback moments. Students perceived feedback as more valuable when the feedback provider mentioned their weaknesses (beta = 0. 153, p < 0. 01), compared their performance to a standard (beta = 0. 159, p < 0. 01), explained or demonstrated the correct performance (beta = 0. 324, p < 0. 001) and prepared an action plan with the student (beta = 0. 496, p < 0. 001). Appraisal of good performance did not influence the perceived <b>learning</b> <b>value</b> of feedback. No gender differences were found for perceived <b>learning</b> <b>value.</b> Conclusions: In Indonesia, we could validate four out of the five characteristics for effective feedback. We argue that our findings relate to culture, in particular to the levels of individualism and power distance. The recognized characteristics of what constitutes effective feedback should be validated across cultures...|$|E

This paper analyses the impact of both plagiarism and effective assessment in the <b>learning</b> <b>value</b> chain. Effective assessment is the positive outcome. Plagiarism negates or breaks the chain. Anecdotal evidence suggests the incidences of plagiarism are increasing in faculties across the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), and where every subject/unit outline includes a statement and warning to students of the penalties of this activity, deterrence tools do not overcome the harmful impact of plagiarism on the teacher/student learning relationship.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Progress tests (PT) {{are used}} to assess {{students}} on topics from all medical disciplines. Progress testing is usually one of the assessment methods of the cognitive domain. There is limited knowledge on how positioning of the PT in a program of assessment (PoA) influences students' PT scores, use of PT feedback and perceived <b>learning</b> <b>value.</b> METHODS: We compared PT total scores and use of a PT test feedback (ProF) system in two medical courses, where the PT is either used as a summative assessment or embedded in a comprehensive PoA and used formatively. In addition, an interview study was used to explore the students' perception on use of PT feedback and perceived <b>learning</b> <b>value.</b> RESULTS: PT total scores were higher, with considerable effect sizes (ESs) and students made more use of ProF when the PT was embedded in a comprehensive PoA. Analysis of feedback in the portfolio stimulated students to look for patterns in PT results, link the PT to other assessment results, follow-up on learning objectives, and integrate the PT in their learning for the entire PoA.

Although {{it is known}} that physical salience and goal-relatedness both influence attentional priority, it is unknown whether or how attentional capture by a salient stimulus is modulated by its associated value. Here we show that a physically salient, task-irrelevant distractor previously associated with a large reward slows visual search more than an equally salient distractor previously associated with a smaller reward. This magnification of salience-based attentional capture by <b>learned</b> <b>value</b> extinguishes over several hundred trials.
