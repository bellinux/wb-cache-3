40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} participation levels in sport across socio-demographic groups, {{specifically for the}} period 2008 - 14, {{in the context of}} austerity measures taken by central government resulting in <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>income</b> and expenditure reductions. Participation levels over time were analysed using data from the Active People Survey (APS) which was the preferred method for measuring participation by Sport England until its replacement in 2015. Budgetary constraints in local authorities, have subsequently resulted in an expenditure decrease for non-discretionary services including ‘sport development and community recreation’. This area of expenditure forms one component of sport-related services and primarily focuses on raising participation in ‘hard-to-reach’ groups. The study found policy goals associated with raising and widening participation were not met to any significant degree between 2008 and 2014 as participation levels have changed little for lower-income ‘hard-to-reach’ groups. It is claimed that this outcome is in part due to austerity measures impacting on local authority expenditure. This study has implications for policy-makers and practitioners as it illustrates both the challenges faced in setting and delivering policy aimed at raising participation levels in ‘hard-to-reach’ groups, particularly in the context of austerity, and the difficulties associated with measuring participation...|$|E

This revenue leakage caused some data not current property holdings that include the holding of property owners who pay less than the proper value. One of the causes of recent data is not the holding of property due to shortage of staff to visit the site to get the latest data. Solution to this problem is to implement the integration of Geographic Information System (GIS) with the image of Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV) in the management of assessment review. By using this method, the analysis of property-related holdings that have made extension can be done easily and quickly. Based on data holdings with additional property tax value assessment, site visits should not be done in the whole area but just holding property that has been identified only.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of Natal, 2000. Housing {{built by}} <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> for low <b>income</b> housing has {{gone a long}} way towards {{providing}} a range of housing options for the varying needs of those who are forced through circumstances to rely on the public sector for their housing. Selling off the rented housing stock to sitting tenants has enabled large numbers of families to become homeowners. The sale of rental housing stock has been long viewed by theorists with much scepticism. Therefore much research has gone into, amongst other things the government policy of "load-shedding" in order to decrease the welfare burden of the state. Few studies however have been able to capture the perceptions and attitudes of the beneficiary families. A major thrust of the National Housing Policy is to increase the access of housing to previously disadvantaged individuals. One such method is that of privatisation and the sale of public rental stock to sitting tenants. The study will attempt to investigate the process of privatisation as adopted by the Metropolitan Council and resistance that it has faced. Pages 87 - 92 missing in original print copy...|$|R

This is notwithstanding the fact that <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> are {{at the forefront of}} local development efforts. In Ghana, the central government is enjoined by the country’s constitution to devolve at least five percent of the national revenue to <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> annually. For many <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> this has become the main source of finance. Though there are other sources of finance available to the <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> these have been de-emphasised by most <b>local</b> <b>authorities.</b> The paper postulates that the land resources of the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> provide a veritable source of local revenue which has not been fully tapped by the authorities.

Further, as <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> funding is related to the number of children in school <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> have a perverse incentive to force home educated children into schools. That <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> often act outside the law when dealing with home educators and given that the [...] "large majority" [...] of <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> (all except 30) provide misleading information on their websites in relation to home education (page 23 of The Education Committee's report to Parliament), home educators remain wary of and opposed to any additional powers being awarded to <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> who many see as anti-home education.|$|R
