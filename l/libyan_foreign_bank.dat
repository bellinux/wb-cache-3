40|$|Under {{the radical}} {{leadership}} of Mu ammar al-Qadhafi, Libya has constantly {{been the focus}} of international attention. This is attributable to its reputation as a rogue state, a transgressor of international codes of conduct, and for the foreign policies of its eccentric leader. <b>Libyan</b> <b>foreign</b> policy is often seen as erratic, devoid of coherent rationale, and tending to undergo sudden, inexplicable changes of direction. For those unacquainted with Libyan politics, recent developments in the country s foreign policy, such as abandoning its nuclear weapons programme and improved relations with the West, only serve to support such notions. The overall perception is that <b>Libyan</b> <b>foreign</b> policy is motivated exclusively by an ideological and revolutionary doctrine, subject to the caprices of a maverick dictator. The thesis is an analysis of <b>Libyan</b> <b>foreign</b> policy under the current regime. I chronicle three and a half decades of foreign relations as they pertain to the Arab world, the Maghreb, Sub-Saharan Africa and the West. The analysis is conducted mainly within the realm of three International Relations theories; Classical Realism, and Defensive and Offensive Neo-Realism. In addition, the role of ideology has been a central one in the analysis due to the regime s emphasis on it. By examining the empirical evidence provided in this thesis I have been able to determine what factors have been decisive in <b>Libyan</b> <b>foreign</b> policy behaviour and how they relate to the above-mentioned theories. I have done so by monitoring the behaviour of Libya during each decade and identifying the main trend(s) in foreign policy in each of the examined regions. Then I have discussed why these approaches were taken. The conclusion summarizes the motivations for the general trends previously identified and reveals the core objective of <b>Libyan</b> <b>foreign</b> policy in general...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} impact of <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> {{penetration}} on the competitive structure of domestic banking sectors in host emerging economies. We focus our analysis on Asia and Latin America during the period 1997 - 2008. Using bank-level panel data to identify <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> and to estimate measures of banking competition, we are able to provide robust empirical evidence that an increase in <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> penetration enhances competition in these host countries' banking sectors. We find that this positive <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> penetration and banking competition link is associated with a spillover effect from <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> to their domestic counterparts. This spillover effect becomes stronger when more efficient and less risky <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> enter into less concentrated host country markets.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} policies toward <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry on commercial bank net interest margins. Do countries that impede the entry of <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> induce a bigger gap between the interest expense paid to depositors and the interest income received from borrowers after controlling for bank-specific characteristics, mac-roeconomic conditions, {{and the structure of}} the economy’s banking industry? In exploring this issue, the paper provides information on the efficiency effects of regulatory restrictions on <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry. The paper goes farther, however, and assesses whether there is something special about <b>foreign</b> <b>banks.</b> Regulatory restrictions on <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry may be highly correlated with regulatory restric-tions on domestic bank entry. If this is the case, then information on <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> may simply proxy for entry restrictions in general, rather than providing information on <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> in particular. To exam-ine the independent impact of restrictions on <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry, I simultaneously control for restrictions on domestic bank entry. The paper also distinguishes between impediments to <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry and the fraction of the domestic banking industry owned by for-eign banks. Some researchers focus on the degree of <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> own-ership (Clarke, Cull, and Martínez Pería, 2001).

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{examine how the}} {{protection}} of creditors' rights influence {{the way in which}} <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry affects the access to credit of firms. Using a sample of more than 6000 firms in 22 transition countries I find that as bankruptcy proceedings become more inefficient <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry is more likely to crowd-out small and opaque firms. Conversely, as the protection of creditors' rights improve, the positive association between <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> and firms' credit constraints diminishes. These results are robust to controls for endogeneity of <b>foreign</b> <b>banks.</b> The interaction of <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> and the protection of creditors rights would explain the disparity of results obtained by previous studies: In countries with an adequate protection of creditor rights <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry may benefit all firms; By contrast, in countries with weak protection of creditor rights <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> entry is likely to result in a credit crunch.

We show that the relative importance of <b>foreign</b> <b>bank</b> subsidiaries has increased considerably during recent years. However, in Hungary and Poland <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> were also important during the first transition years, as they provided substantial amounts of cross-border credit. We do not find evidence of <b>foreign</b> <b>banks</b> deserting CEE during financial crises or economic downturns.
