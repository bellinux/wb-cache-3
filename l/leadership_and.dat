40|$|Concepts such as {{positive}} youth development, <b>leadership</b> self-efficacy, <b>and</b> social intelligence are salient to understanding how transformational leadership behaviors manifest in adolescents. The primary investigator created the Youth Transformational Model {{to establish the}} positive relationship that leadership exposure (leadership experience and/or having a formal leadership role), <b>leadership</b> self-efficacy, <b>and</b> social intelligence have with transformational leadership skills (i. e. inspirational motivation and individualized consideration). High school-aged members of a youth leadership organization (N = 142) completed a survey on <b>leadership</b> factors <b>and</b> social intelligence. <b>Leadership</b> self-efficacy was the central component {{to the relationship between}} <b>leadership</b> exposure <b>and</b> behaviors. While having a formal leadership role w{{as positive}}ly associated with <b>leadership</b> experience <b>and</b> self-efficacy, only <b>leadership</b> experience was related to leadership self-efficacy, social intelligence, <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> skills. <b>Leadership</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> social intelligence partially mediated <b>leadership</b> experience <b>and</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> skills’ relationship. These findings suggested that acquiring formal titles and power did not automatically translate to being a considerate and motivational leader. Furthermore, although female participants possessed more positive <b>leadership</b> experiences <b>and</b> higher transformational <b>leadership</b> skills compared to males, the literature did not reflect the current findings. Transformational <b>leadership</b> experience <b>and</b> training has encouraged young people not to lead forcibly or from a distance, but to lead by example, care about others’ needs, be motivational, and {{bring out the best in}} people. Results highlighted the importance of <b>leadership</b> opportunities <b>and</b> training programs for adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{reveals a}} number of confusions within the area of project {{management}} {{regarding the use of}} terminology and differing interpretations, concerning <b>leadership</b> competencies <b>and</b> <b>leadership</b> styles. In project management literature, many empirical studies have examined the influence of leadership competencies or styles, but yet any substantial review study has rarely been conducted to differentiate between <b>leadership</b> competencies <b>and</b> styles. This study aims to differentiate between <b>leadership</b> competencies <b>and</b> <b>leadership</b> styles in project management literature. This study found that the project manager's leadership terms including competence, competency, competencies, and styles have frequently been used in project management literature. Furthermore, literature has been synthesized to provide more familiarity <b>and</b> understanding on <b>leadership</b> competencies <b>and</b> styles. Findings indicate that <b>leadership</b> competencies <b>and</b> styles are two different things but a few characteristics are common between both the terms. Furthermore, leadership competencies are more suitable for task-oriented activities <b>and</b> <b>leadership</b> styles are more appropriate for relationship-oriented factors. This study has implications for the future directions to identify differences between project manger's average and superior performance through comparison of <b>leadership</b> competencies <b>and</b> styles...|$|R
