5|$|One <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> {{southbound}} Virginia Route 123 in Tysons Corner {{was closed}} for a two-year period, starting on February 22, 2010, for construction of the McLean Metro station. The distance impacted was two blocks, from Scotts Crossing Road to the Capital Beltway.|$|E
5|$|From West Main Street to South Avenue, {{the bridge}} {{supports}} were largely built with concrete while the supports on the section between Brown Street and West Main Street were mostly built with steel. Unlike the concrete supports, the steel supports flexed throughout the year, creating holes and {{gaps in the}} pavement on the deck above. The city of Rochester, which owns and maintains the section of NY31 within the city, closed the outer northbound <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> West Broad Street (westbound NY31) between Brown and Main Streets in June 2008 for this reason.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the following list of awards and nominations, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures named Changeling one of the 10 best films of 2008, as did the International Press Academy, which presents the annual Satellite Awards. Several critics included the film on their lists of the top 10 best films of 2008. Anthony <b>Lane</b> <b>of</b> The New Yorker named it second best, Empire magazine named it fourth best, and Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald named it joint fourth best with Eastwood's Gran Torino. Japanese film critic Shigehiko Hasumi listed the film {{as one of the}} best films of 2000-2009.|$|E
50|$|The Abraham Lincoln Bridge {{opened on}} December 6, 2015, and is {{parallel}} to the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge upstream and now carries five <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> northbound I-65 traffic, eventually carrying six <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> northbound I-65 traffic. Pedestrian and bicycle lanes were in the original plans, but have since been removed. The existing I-65 John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge, completed in 1963, is being renovated for six <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> southbound traffic. On October 10, 2016, five <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the Kennedy Bridge reopened, at which time the Lincoln Bridge began carrying only northbound traffic after several months <b>of</b> carrying three <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> traffic in both directions. Both spans opened, with six <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> traffic in each direction, in December 2016. Tolling on both spans began on December 30, 2016.|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{terminus}} of I-44 {{was changed}} when the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge opened in February 2014, rerouting I-70 {{over the river}} along a more northern alignment. I-44 now takes the old I-70 alignment through the below-grade section of roadway in St. Louis, making the new eastern terminus being the interchange with I-70 near Cass Avenue. The eastbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> I-44 meets the westbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> I-70, and the eastbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> I-70 meets the westbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> I-44.|$|R

5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} {{over a three-year}} period from 1925. The project was not originally planned to take as long, but there were delays due to problems with a contractor, and industrial action. The bridge was designed to carry the Mildura railway line over the Murray River and into New South Wales, to service significant cross-border traffic arising from the fruit-growing industry, but the line was never extended beyond the terminus at Yelta. The bridge currently carries a single <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> road controlled by traffic lights.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the roundabouts was controversial from the outset. The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT even though both the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn much controversy from local residents because they remove a <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY376) from a four-lane road to a divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing traffic patterns. A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed traffic calming measures on these parallel roads prior to the {{construction of}} the Fulton Avenue roundabout.|$|E
5|$|The crossing's {{development}} {{started in}} the late 1930s, but was interrupted due to the Second World War and resumed in the 1950s. The original tunnel catered for a single <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> traffic in each direction, but rising traffic levels required the second tunnel to be built. The M25 connected to the tunnels at both ends when completed in 1986, and this increased traffic {{put pressure on the}} tunnels' capacity. A Private Finance Initiative scheme was started in 1988 to build the bridge. The combined crossing now handles four lanes of traffic in each direction.|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{of a new}} bridge {{parallel}} to the existing bridge, which would carry four northbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the Connecticut Turnpike; the existing bridge would then be rehabilitated and reconfigured to carry four <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> southbound traffic.|$|R
50|$|During construction, the two {{southbound}} <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the new bridge {{were completed}} first and carried northbound traffic while the old bridge carried two <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> southbound traffic until the northbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the new bridge were completed. When the northbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the new bridge opened the old bridge was demolished, but a 0.75-mile (1.2 km) {{section on the}} Newport News side was retained {{for use as a}} fishing pier. Now known as the James River Pier, it is the longest fishing pier on the East Coast. Due to severe corrosion of the metal beams that supported the deck of the 86 year old bridge structure, the James River Pier was demolished and rebuilt of concrete in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Ernfold is {{a village}} located between the <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the Trans-Canada Highway in the Canadian {{province}} of Saskatchewan. At first alongside the original highway, {{the village was}} enclosed by the opposing <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the newly-divided Trans-Canada in 1973. At its peak, the village's population was 300.|$|R
5|$|The new Indian River Inlet Bridge {{opened to}} {{southbound}} traffic on January 20, 2012. Delaware Governor Jack Markell, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, and DelDOT Secretary Shailen Bhatt rode {{in the first}} car across the bridge. On January 30, 2012, one northbound <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> the new bridge opened. On May 6, 2012, the Indian River Inlet Bridge was officially dedicated in a public ceremony in which visitors were able to walk across the bridge. All remaining lanes of the four-lane bridge {{as well as its}} pedestrian and bicycle walkway opened that day.|$|E
5|$|The new bridge {{soon became}} a major {{transport}} artery and today carries the A202 across the Thames. Originally built with tram tracks, New Vauxhall Bridge {{was the first in}} central London to carry trams. Initially it carried horse-drawn trams, but shortly after the bridge's opening it was converted to carry the electric trams of London County Council Tramways; it continued to carry trams until the ending of tram services in 1951. In 1968 Vauxhall Bridge and Park Lane became the first roads in London to have bus lanes; during weekday evening rush hours, the central <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> the bridge was reserved for southbound buses only.|$|E
5|$|The only {{significant}} alteration {{to the structure}} of the bridge itself since the addition of the sculptures in 1907 came in 1973, when the Greater London Council (GLC) decided to add an extra traffic lane by reducing the width of the pavements. To counter the increased load of extra traffic, the council announced the replacement of the cast-iron balustrades with low box-girder structures. Despite formal objections from both Lambeth and Westminster Councils, the GLC ignored the objections. In 2015, the extra <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> motor traffic was removed in favour of a kerb-protected two-way cycle track, on the north-east side of the bridge. This forms part of Cycle Superhighway 5.|$|E
25|$|At {{its north}} end, Riverside Drive merges with the {{northbound}} <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the Henry Hudson Parkway. In 2005, the retaining wall of Castle Village collapsed onto both Riverside Drive and the northbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the Henry Hudson Parkway. The wall was repaired and the roadway reopened in March 2008.|$|R
50|$|The old swing bridges {{previously}} accommodated four <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> traffic, two on each bridge, with a counterflow {{system for}} peak hours. The new bridge carries three <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> general-purpose traffic in each direction, {{as well as}} one eastbound lane for slower-moving trucks accessing the Canadian Pacific intermodal yard at Kennedy Road.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{bridge was}} {{proposed}} in 1991 and, on 16 July 1996, it was opened to traffic. The main (central) bridge carries six <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> automobile traffic and two <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> motorcycle and bicycle traffic as it crosses the river. Two adjacent two-lane bridges carry motorcycle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic only.|$|R
5|$|Three ties {{resulted}} in medals being shared between athletes, increasing the medal count of various nations. These include ties between Francis <b>Lane</b> <b>of</b> the United States and Alajos Szokolyi of Hungary, {{for the third}} place in the 100metres; between Evangelos Damaskos and Ioannis Theodoropoulos of Greece in the pole vault; and between Konstantinos Paspatis of Greece and Momcsill√≥ Tapavicza of Hungary, in singles tennis.|$|E
5|$|Due to its sharp {{turns with}} {{restricted}} headroom, high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> the western tunnel, {{so it was}} not possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. On 20 April 2007 the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.|$|E
5|$|If one interprets each 1-cell in Rule 184 as {{containing}} a particle, these particles behave {{in many ways}} similarly to automobiles in a single <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> traffic: they move forward at a constant speed if there is open space in front of them, and otherwise they stop. Traffic models such as Rule 184 and its generalizations that discretize both space and time are commonly called particle-hopping models. Although very primitive, the Rule 184 model of traffic flow already predicts some of the familiar emergent features of real traffic: clusters of freely moving cars separated by stretches of open road when traffic is light, and waves of stop-and-go traffic when it is heavy.|$|E

50|$|The route was {{originally}} part of Pre-1927 Route 9 from 1916 until 1927, {{when it became}} part of U.S. Route 22 and Route 28. The Route 28 designation was removed from this portion of road in 1953. When I-78 was being built between Exits 11 and 13 in the 1950s and 1960s, {{it was decided that}} part of U.S. Route 22 would be used for the new highway. The eastbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> US 22 became the westbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the new highway, the eastbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the new highway were newly constructed, and the westbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> US 22 were turned into a two-lane road. In 1969, US 22 was moved to the alignment of Interstate 78 between Greenwich Township and Clinton Township and Route 173 was designated along most of the former alignment of U.S. Route 22.|$|R
5|$|The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was {{appointed}} {{to carry out the}} rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the damage}} from the Gorda Basin {{earthquake}} was considered light, there were some exceptions. In Eureka, effects included broken windows and dishes, fallen chimneys, and merchandise that fell from store shelves. In Fields Landing, King Salmon, Loleta, and Big Lagoon areas, the strongest effects included surface cracks on the ground, soil liquefaction, small landslides and rockfalls, and numerous slumps along the Eel River. Similar effects occurred along the Old Coast Highway near Trinidad and Moonstone, where the roadway was reduced to one <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> travel in some areas. Several homes were knocked off their foundations and a highway overpass collapsed in Fields Landing. Seismic wave amplification, poor design, or inadequate construction style {{may have contributed to}} losses there.|$|E
5|$|A westward freeway {{extension}} of MD 177 was under construction from MD 3 (Glen Burnie Bypass) east to MD 2 by 1963. The freeway opened as MD 177 in 1964 with intermediate interchanges at MD 174 and Oakwood Road. In 1966, the freeway was extended slightly east to terminate at Mountain Road at an intersection {{at the site}} of today's ramps to and from westbound MD 100. By 1967, an {{extension of}} the freeway east to beyond Jacobsville was proposed. The eastward freeway extension opened in 1971; however, the extension and the freeway west to MD 3 were designated MD 100. MD 177 was expanded to a divided highway from MD 2 to MD 10 when the latter freeway was extended south from MD 648 to MD 100 between 1987 and 1989. The divided highway was extended east to Lipin's Corner in 1997. Since the late 1970s, heavy traffic on MD 177 east of MD 100 has spurred efforts to build a bypass of the Lake Shore section or widen the highway, projects that have been opposed by residents who fear increased development on the peninsula. Congestion on the highway was eased significantly when lane use signals were added to allow the center <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> the highway to become a travel lane during rush hours in July 1999.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel {{is divided}} into two tubes, each {{carrying}} five <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> one-way traffic flanked by two emergency <b>lanes.</b> Each <b>of</b> the two tubes can carry up to 16,000 vehicles per hour..|$|R

5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E
5|$|Junction 28 of the M5 {{lies within}} the parish of Cullompton {{and a short}} {{distance}} from the town centre. Other major road links are the A373 to Honiton and the former A38 to Exeter which runs through the town, and is now the B3181. In 2001 61.6% of people living in Cullompton travelled to work by car or van and 83% of households had at least one car. In October 1969 a bypass was completed but after only five years this was upgraded to form part of the M5. Since this time traffic coming from the south of Cullompton to the M5 junction has had to pass through the centre of the town. There are now problems with air quality in the town and Mid Devon District Council have made the whole of the built up area in Cullompton an Air quality management area. Traffic on the exit slip road leaving the M5 northbound often backed up onto the motorway, so the Highways Agency and Devon County Council made junction improvements by widening roads, introducing traffic lights and reopening the left hand <b>lane</b> <b>of</b> the northbound slip road, at a cost of ¬£1.3m. This cost was covered by businesses moving to Cullompton.|$|E
