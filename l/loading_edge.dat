This paper reports on an experimental investigation on the possibility of more 	simple way of tension test for cement mortar by splitting 4 x 4 x 16 cm specimens 	(which is used for bending and compression test of cement) instead of cube or 	cylinder. The strength and its standard deviation were investigated in the 	following test methods. 	A) Split of a half of 4 x 4 x 16 cm (obtained from bending test) in longitudinal 	direction. <b>Loading</b> <b>edge</b> is flat (breadth: 2 mm). 	B) Split of 4 x 4 x 16 cm in transverse direction. <b>Loading</b> <b>edge</b> is f 1 at (breadth: 	 2 mm).

30|$|Another {{difference}} between {{the results of the}} linear elastic and non-linear analyses can be seen on the Figs.  7 and 10, displaying the location of the peak shear strain in the adhesive layer after the linear elastic and non-linear analyses respectively. It must be noted that the location of the peak shear strain has a different meaning in each type of analysis. Whereas in the linear elastic analyses it represents the point of first yield of the adhesive layer, in the non-linear analyses it represents the point of first failure of the adhesive layer. Comparing these locations in both types of analyses show that for the joint designs consisting of one or several plates, J 1, J 2 s and J 2 r, the point of first yield (Fig.  7 a–c respectively) corresponds to the point of first failure (Fig.  10 a–c respectively), and is located at the corners of the <b>loading</b> <b>edge</b> of the adhesive overlap. For the joint designs consisting in a central joint piece completely surrounding the member, J 3 s and J 3 r, the point of first yield (Fig.  7 d, e respectively) is located on the <b>loading</b> <b>edge</b> of the adhesive layer, whereas the point of first failure (Fig.  10 d, e respectively) is located on the “free edge” of the adhesive layer, i.e. the opposite side from the <b>loading</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
30|$|Traditional ply-based failure criteria, such as Tsai-Wu and Tsai-Hill, {{consider}} a yarn-matrix {{system as a}} whole and, therefore, they are not suitable to predict whether the failure occurs inside a yarn, a matrix, or at their interfaces (Tolosana et al. 2012). When characterising failure of composites, researches focus on their homogeneity rather than anisotropic nature. This is inappropriate since internal unique structures of composites influence their properties and failure character (Paris and Jackson 2001). Moreover, the polynomial criteria may be not suitable in design, particularly for bi-axial tensile <b>loading</b> (<b>Edge</b> 2002).

The class began with a presentation demonstrating this by an example. Earlier work [2], [5], [4], [6] had shown that FIFO is unstable at rates exceeding. 85,. 83,. 749 and. 5 respectively, under an adversarial queueing model. In [7] the authors show that an adversarial injection protocol with an arbitarily low rate r, for a network of size Õ(1 r) can be constructed, that makes FIFO unstable.

30|$|It must {{be noted}} that in all joint designs, except J 1, a part of the {{adhesive}} layer orthogonal to the loading direction was modelled (on the <b>loading</b> <b>edge</b> side for J 2 s and J 2 r, on the free edge side for J 3 s and J 3 r). These regions were modelled for convenience, as it was easier to model an adhesive layer than to create contact interactions between the member and the central joint piece. In practice, having adhesive in these regions should be avoided as much as possible, because it would be loaded in tension and fail at a lower load than the regions of the adhesive layer loaded in shear, thereby initiating cracks that could propagate through the “shear regions” and cause the joint to fail prematurely (as opposed to having adhesive loaded in shear only). As a result, the extraction of values from both the linear elastic and non-linear analyses do not take these regions into account.|$|E

40|$|Modal, dynamic, {{and wave}} {{propagation}} behavior of three-dimensional (3 D) functionally graded (FG) solids is studied using explicit (serial and parallel) finite element method, developed in-house, {{within the framework}} of linear elasticity. Modal analysis of 3 D FG beams is obtained using finite element method (FEM) and Rayleigh-Ritz method. The natural frequencies obtained vary considerably with material gradation, more so for the lower modes than for the higher modes. Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio considerably affects the torsional natural frequencies of the graded beams. The effect of sampling material properties at the element centroid than at the Gaussian integration point on the natural frequencies affects only certain type of graded beam. Transient dynamic behavior of a 3 D homogeneous cantilever beam under sinusoidal loading is verified using the explicit FEM. Material gradation is found to considerably affect the dynamic response of the beam. Three numerical examples are studied to obtain the effects of gradation on the wave propagation behavior of 3 D FG solids and to verify the explicit parallel FEM. In the first example, wave propagation in a 3 D FG bar under impact is studied. Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio and boundary conditions affect the stress behavior of the 3 D homogeneous and FG bars. The second example is a three-point bending beam made of epoxy and glass phases under low velocity impact. Bending stress history for the beam with higher values of material properties at the <b>loading</b> <b>edge</b> is consistently higher than that of the homogeneous beam and the beam with lower values of material properties at the <b>loading</b> <b>edge.</b> Larger bending stresses for the former beam may indicate earlier crack initiation time which was proven by experiments performed by other researchers. The third example is that of an uncracked graded Kalthoff and Winkler plate under velocity impact. The stress evolution for the homogeneous plate compares reasonably well with the results obtained using a commercial software package ABAQUS. Dynamic stress behavior differs considerably for the three types of material gradation considered. Transient thermal stress analysis of a 3 D homogeneous plate under 1 D temperature loading is verified using an implicit FEM developed in-house. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been made to {{determine}} the dynamic stability of an imperfect circular cylindrical shell subject to a step loading in the axial direction. In the analysis, the radial displacement of the shell is approximated by a finite degree of freedom system. To assure that the created model is proper, its static buckling behavior was studied. It was found that the model gives the proper imperfection sensitivity behavior. The dynamic analysis includes not only the effect of the radial inertia, but also that due to the axial inertia in an approximate manner. The critical loads are determined by numerical integration of the equation of motion. In addition a study is carried out to consider the effects of wave number of the radial mode shape, mass on the loaded edge of the shell and damping of the axial motion. Compared with the static case, there is a significant reduction of the dynamic buckling load for the high wave numbers of the radial modes. Also, there is a critical clamping value, above which the dynamic buckling load is close to the static buckling load. The dynamic buckling load approaches half of the static buckling load with increasing mass on the <b>loading</b> <b>edge.</b> Through the parametric studies of the wave number, mass, and damping factor it is concluded that due to frequency coupling between axial and radial motions, the axial inertia plays an essential role in characterizing the dynamic instability of a finite length shell. ...|$|E
40|$|Wear {{and fatigue}} of {{polyethylene}} acetabular cups {{have been reported}} {{to play a role in}} the failure of total hip replacements. Hip simulator testing under a wide range of clinically relevant loading conditions is important. Edge loading of hip replacements can occur following impingement under extreme activities and can also occur during normal gait where there is an offset deficiency and/or joint laxity. This study evaluated a hip simulator method that assessed wear and damage in polyethylene acetabular liners that were subjected to edge loading. The liners tested to evaluate the method were a currently manufactured crosslinked polyethylene acetabular liner and an aged conventional polyethylene acetabular liner. The acetabular liners were tested for five million standard walking cycles and following this five million walking cycles with edge <b>loading.</b> <b>Edge</b> loading conditions represented a separation of the centres of rotation of the femoral head and the acetabular liner during the swing phase, leading to loading of the liner rim on heel strike. Rim damage and cracking was observed in the aged conventional polyethylene liner. Steady state wear rates assessed gravimetrically were lower under edge loading compared to standard loading. This study supports previous clinical findings that edge loading may cause rim cracking in liners where component positioning is sub-optimal or where material degradation is present. The simulation method developed has the potential to be used in the future to test the effect of ageing and different levels of severity of edge loading on a range of crosslinked polyethylene materials...|$|E

The experimental analysis {{of three different}} configuration of bolted connection with one bolt has been conducted with the tension test. The distance between {{the center of the}} hole and the <b>loaded</b> <b>edge</b> of the composite plate is the only changing parameter, where the rest are all constant. Additionally, we checked the current equations, which are in use by the company Fiberline to design one bolt FRP connections. The introduction of the thesis discusses the basic of the FRP materials with their composition, mechanical characteristics, production methods together with standards and guidelines for design of structural elements and connections made of FRP materials. This is followed by the detailed description of the specimen and the test setup itself. The distance between the <b>loaded</b> FRP plate <b>edge</b> and the center of the bolt hole with the diameter of d is for the first series of specimens 1. 5 *d, for the second is 3. 5 *d and for the last one is 7 *d. Each series contained 4 specimens. During the experiment conduction the force and the relative displacement of the steel bolt have been recorded. Due to the bearing stress of the bolt the specimens have experienced different failure mechanisms in relationship to the distance between the center of the bolt hole and the <b>loaded</b> <b>edge</b> of the composite plate. As expected, the worst behaviour of the tested connections has shown the connection with the shortest distance (1. 5 *d). This type of connections has no post fracture load bearing capacity after the first recorded damage and represents brittle failure. For the other two configurations of specimens with longer distance between center of the bolt hole and the <b>loaded</b> <b>edge</b> of the FRP plate we observed ductile behaviour and good post fracture behaviour.

However, studies on the mechanical behavior of screw connections with double-layer gypsum sheathing are still limited. In this study, 200 monotonic tests of screw connections with single- or double-layer gypsum sheathing at both ambient and elevated temperatures were conducted. The failure of screw connections with double-layer gypsum sheathing in shear was different from that of single-layer gypsum sheathing connections at ambient temperature, and it could be described as the breaking of the <b>loaded</b> sheathing <b>edge</b> combined with significant screw tilting and the <b>loaded</b> sheathing <b>edge</b> flexing fracture.

Out {{of a total of}} 26 laboratory shear tests, 5 were performed on non-reinforced specimens. The remaining 21 tests were performed on specimens reinforced by means of self-tapping screws. All laboratory tests were conducted under monotonic quasi-static loading. The distance between the dowel and the <b>loaded</b> <b>edge</b> of the timber element was considerably smaller than the minimum distance suggested by building codes. The influence of both i) the placement and ii) the diameter of the reinforcing screws on the load-slip behaviour of the joint was studied. The study shows that the scatter in test results is considerably reduced when reinforcing screws are used. The study also shows that the reinforcing screws prevent the joint to fail due to premature splitting. Thus, due to the presence of the reinforcing screws, no reduction of load-carrying capacity of the dowel caused by the short distance between dowel and <b>loaded</b> <b>edge</b> of the timber element needs to be applied.

The crown is modeled as a rectangular laminated composite plate subjected to a second degree parabolic variation of axial stresses in the longitudinal direction. A varying tension-compression- tension axial stresses are induced in the crown of the stiffeners due to bending.

As the initial pre-buckling stress distributions within an element are highly non-uniform in nature for a given <b>loading</b> and <b>edge</b> conditions, the critical loads are evaluated by dynamic approach. Towards this, a nine-node heterosis plate element and a compatible three-node beam element are developed by employing the effect of shear deformation for both the plate and the stiffeners respectively.

Additionally, the Hertzian theory successfully captures principal curvature trends of the edge torus on the influence of maximal contact pressure and obtains the appropriate edge radius range for lower maximal contact pressure. This work elucidates the methods of applying classical contact theory to design the edge radius of hip bearings to better resist severe <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> contact stresses and reduce the stripe wear...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the state of plane strain in an elastic material with voids occupying a curvilinear strip as an arch-like region described by R:a<r<b, 0 <h<x, where r and θ are polar coordinates and a, b, and ɷ (< 2 π) are prescribed positive constants. Such a curvilinear strip is maintained in equilibrium under self-equilibrated traction and equilibrated force applied {{on one of the}} edges, whereas the other three edges are traction free and subjected to zero volumetric fraction or zero equilibrated force. In fact, we study the case when one right or curved <b>edge</b> is <b>loaded.</b> Our aim is to derive some explicit spatial estimates describing how some appropriate measures of a specific Airy stress function and volume fraction evolve with respect to the distance to the <b>loaded</b> <b>edge.</b> The results of the present paper prove how the spatial decay rate varies with the constitutive profile. For the problem corresponding to a <b>loaded</b> right <b>edge,</b> we are able to establish an exponential decay estimate with respect to the angle θ. Whereas for the problem corresponding to a <b>loaded</b> curved <b>edge,</b> we establish an algebraical spatial decay with respect to the polar distance r, provided the angle ɷ is lower than the critical value π√ 2. The intended applications of these results concern various branches of medicine as for example the bone implants...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} manifestly gauge {{covariant}} description of fluctuations of a relativistic extended object {{described by the}} Dirac-Nambu-Goto action with Dirac-Nambu-Goto <b>loaded</b> <b>edges</b> about a given classical solution. Whereas physical fluctuations of the bulk lie normal to its worldsheet, those on the edge possess an additional component directed into the bulk. These fluctuations couple in a non-trivial way involving the underlying geometrical structures associated with the worldsheet of the object and of its edge. We illustrate the formalism using as an example a string with massive point particles attached to its ends. Comment: 17 pages, revtex, to appear in Phys. Rev. D 5...|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{response}} of sheathed cold-f ormed steel (CFS) structures is highly {{influenced by the}} shear behaviour of panel-to-steel framing connections. Therefore, an experimental campai gn aiming at characterizing the shear behaviour of different sheathing-to-CFS profiles connections has been planed. In particular, the following objectives have been selected: to co mpare the {{response of}} different panel typologies (cement, wood and gypsum–based panels); to {{examine the effect of}} the <b>loaded</b> <b>edge</b> distance; to investigate the outcome of different cyclic loading protocols. This paper presents and discusses the main results of this experimental investigation carried out on cement-based sheathing- to-stud connections...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{theoretical}} analysis {{of the influence of}} imperfections on the stability and carrying capacity of axially compressed cold-formed rectangular steel tubes filled with concrete, which use as bearing structures in the structural engineering, bridges, underground subway systems and tunnels. The behavior of the mentioned above composite structures under load were presented by numerical modelling in software ABAQUS. The support conditions of <b>loaded</b> <b>edges</b> of the steel section were considered as clamped in the models. The results of the analysis were shown the influence of imperfections on the stability and carrying capacity of the composite columns...|$|R
40|$|Wear {{and fatigue}} of {{polyethylene}} acetabular cups {{have been reported}} {{to play a role in}} the failure of total hip replacements. <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> of hip replacements can occur where there is sub-optimal component positioning and/or joint laxity. Wear resistance can be improved by crosslinking but the manufacturing process of these materials involves post-irradiation thermal treatments to recombine free radicals and to stabilise the materials. Stabilisation can also be achieved by adding antioxidants. Material degradation due to oxidation and manufacturing process can result in rim cracking and/or fracture due to a reduction in mechanical properties and this has been observed in vivo. A requirement for pre-clinical hip simulator testing under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions for all of these materials has therefore been identified. This thesis describes the development and evaluation of a hip simulator <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol using accelerated aged conventional UHMWPE acetabular liners as positive controls and commercially available crosslinked UHMWPE acetabular liners as negative controls. The <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol was then used to evaluate antioxidant stabilised liners in hip simulator tests. Explanted UHMWPE acetabular liners were evaluated for wear and damage mechanisms and compared with the damage observed on the hip simulator tested liners and new methodologies were developed to measure and analyse these explanted liners. The <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol produced cracking and subsurface damage in the aged UHMWPE liners but not in the non-aged crosslinked liners. Rim deformation was observed on all liners and the volume change produced was reduced under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions for both types of UHMWPE liner. The antioxidant liners performed as well as the commercially available crosslinked liner in hip simulator tests and the rim deformation that was observed on explanted liners was replicated under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions in the hip simulator tests. The <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol can be used in the future to test a range of UHMWPE materials, including aged materials, and explant analysis using the methodologies developed in this study can be used to inform the design of future simulator tests...|$|R
