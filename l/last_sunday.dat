5|$|One unique {{feature of}} the ELCA {{calendar}} {{is that it has}} given congregations the options of two dates for the Transfiguration. Following most other Western Churches, the ELCA moved the Transfiguration from its August 6 date to the <b>Last</b> <b>Sunday</b> after Epiphany (the Sunday immediately preceding Ash Wednesday) as an option to the traditional <b>Last</b> <b>Sunday</b> after Epiphany in an effort to encourage a wider observance of the Transfiguration within congregations. However, the traditional date of August 6 was left on the calendar. Congregations were given the option of observing Transfiguration on the <b>Last</b> <b>Sunday</b> after the Epiphany and August 6, thus leaving open the possibility that the Transfiguration could be commemorated twice within a calendar year. In Sweden, Transfiguration Day is celebrated on the seventh Sunday after Trinity Sunday, which is the eighth Sunday after Pentecost.|$|E
5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year. Since 1996, European Summer Time {{has been observed}} from the <b>last</b> <b>Sunday</b> in March to the <b>last</b> <b>Sunday</b> in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the <b>last</b> <b>Sunday</b> in October, and Congress retains the right {{to go back to the}} previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to invite Bach {{was made by}} the council on 15 January 1723. The council seemed to have preferred Bach and Graupner because they were invited to show two cantatas each, while other candidates were requested to show only one. Two candidates even had to present their work in the same service. Graupner's performance took place on the <b>last</b> <b>Sunday</b> after Epiphany, 17 January 1723. Two days before the event, the town council already agreed to offer him the position.|$|E
5|$|The current choir is {{composed}} {{of about a dozen}} semi-professional adults. They sing on Sundays at the 11.00 am Choral Eucharist, Wednesdays at the 6:15 pm Choral Evensong, monthly at the 3.00 pm Choral Evensong held on the <b>last</b> <b>Sunday</b> of the month, as well as at a number of midweek feast days held during the year. In January, during the summer holiday period, St James' presents three full orchestral Masses during which liturgical music by composers such as Mozart, Haydn and Schubert is used for its original purpose and incorporated into the service. On these occasions, the choir is joined by a small orchestra.|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} Daylight Saving Time before the longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the United States and Europe. This unequal split is an energy saving measure. For example, in the U.S. the period of Daylight Saving Time {{is defined by the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for Daylight Saving Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the <b>last</b> <b>Sunday</b> in October to the first Sunday in November.|$|E
5|$|Municipal {{elections}}, {{during which}} mayors are elected, take place every four years; they take place {{one year before}} presidential elections (since 2008) in the <b>last</b> <b>Sunday</b> of October. Candidates must comply a number of requisites in order {{to run for mayor}} of Pichilemu; those include: to have completed secondary education (Enseñanza Media), to be a citizen, literate, to have resided in the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region {{for at least two years}} before the election, and to have their military status regularized. The mayor is usually sworn in on the 6 December following the election. The next election for the mayor will be in 2016. Municipal elections originally elected three mayors, called primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde, and a number of regidores. For example, the results of the first elections in Pichilemu, for the term between 1894 and 1897, showed José María Caro Martínez, Pedro Nolasco de Mira, and Francisco Reyes elected as the first primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde of Pichilemu, respectively. The role of the primer alcalde equals that of the current mayor of Pichilemu. However, voting was not popular: only taxpayers and landowners could vote. According to the Decree #5655 of 4 December 1945, regidores were popularly elected, and they had the faculty to vote for the mayor that would rule for the local government three-year term. The 1973 Chilean coup d'état interrupted Washington Saldías Fuentealba's mayoral term, hence terminating possibilities of new elections. The military regime of Augusto Pinochet appointed seven mayors, who held the office in a period of nineteen years. Following the Chilean transition to democracy, the D'Hondt method of proportional representation was used in the municipal elections of 1992, 1996, and 2000: all candidates run in a single list, the most voted candidate becomes the mayor and other five/six become councilors, according to the aforementioned method. For the municipal elections beginning in 2004, candidates for mayor and councilor run in separate lists, and mayors are elected by simple majority of votes.|$|E
