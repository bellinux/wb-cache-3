50|$|A {{graphite}} <b>lined</b> <b>stamp</b> is a {{postage stamp}} on which vertical lines of electro-conductive graphite are printed on the reverse. Graphite <b>lined</b> <b>stamps</b> {{were used in the}} United Kingdom from 1957 to 1960 as an experiment in the automation of mail sorting.|$|R

50|$|Graphite <b>lined</b> <b>stamps</b> {{have become}} very {{collectable}} and often command high prices.

50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{graphite}} {{lines were}} used exclusively on five stamps of the Wilding series from December 1957. They appear as {{one or two}} black lines printed vertically under the gum. The two <b>lined</b> <b>stamps</b> were to identify fully paid mail, which eventually became first class mail, while stamps with only one line paid the printed matter rate, or second class mail as it eventually became. On the two <b>lined</b> <b>stamps,</b> the bands are usually found widely spaced so that one appears at {{either side of the}} stamp, but they may also be found close together due to printing errors on the one and a half pence stamp. Several other errors of misplaced graphite lines are also known and not all are included in the Stanley Gibbons catalogue.|$|R
5000|$|From November 1959, {{graphite}} <b>lined</b> <b>stamps</b> {{were issued}} with phosphor bands {{printed on the}} front of the stamp.

It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate customers in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its original product <b>line</b> (rubber <b>stamps)</b> was something other than paper, and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, divers found {{the remains of}} a {{shipwreck}} in Cape Gelidonya, off the coast of Turkey. The remains included a substantial amount of copper oxhide ingot material: 34 in full, five in half, 12 corners, and 75 kg of random fragments. Twenty-four full copper oxhide ingots have stamps on their centers—usually of a circle containing intersecting <b>lines.</b> These <b>stamps</b> were likely made when the metal was soft. In addition, the ship contained numerous complete and incomplete copper bun-shaped ingots, rectangular tin bars, and Cypriot agricultural tools made of scrap bronze. Radiocarbon dating of brushwood from the ship gives an approximate date of 1200 BC.|$|R

40|$|Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray {{scattering}} (GISAXS) {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the replica quality of polymer gratings prepared by thermal nanoimprint lithography (NIL). Here it is shown using GISAXS experiments that a series of NIL polymer gratings with different line quality present characteristic features that can be associated with the level of defects per <b>line.</b> Both <b>stamps</b> and NIL polymer gratings exhibit characteristic semicircle-like GISAXS patterns. However NIL polymer gratings with defective lines exhibit GISAXS patterns with an excess of diffuse scattering as compared to those of the corresponding stamps. In a first approach, this effect is attributed to a reduction of the effective length of the lines diffracting coherently as the number of defects per line increases. © 2014...|$|R
