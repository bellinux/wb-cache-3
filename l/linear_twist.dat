40|$|Here, {{we present}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the wing kinematics and wing deformations of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria, Forskål) flying tethered in a wind tunnel. We filmed them using four high-speed digital video cameras, and used photogrammetry to reconstruct the motion of more than 100 identified points. Whereas the hindwing motions were highly stereotyped, the forewing motions showed considerable variation, consistent with a role in flight control. Both wings were positively cambered on the downstroke. The hindwing was cambered through an ‘umbrella effect’ whereby the trailing edge tension compressed the radial veins during the downstroke. Hindwing camber was reversed on the upstroke as the wing fan corrugated, reducing the projected area by 30 per cent, and releasing the tension in the trailing edge. Both the wings were strongly twisted from the root to the tip. The linear decrease in incidence along the hindwing on the downstroke precisely counteracts the linear increase in the angle of attack that would otherwise occur in root flapping for an untwisted wing. The consequent near-constant angle of attack is reminiscent of the optimum for a propeller of constant aerofoil section, wherein a <b>linear</b> <b>twist</b> distribution allows each section to operate at the unique angle of attack maximizing the lift to drag ratio. This implies tuning of the structural, morphological and kinematic parameters of the hindwing for efficient aerodynamic force production...|$|E
40|$|The initial {{energy density}} {{distribution}} and fluctuation in the transverse direction lead to anisotropic flows of final hadrons through collective expansion in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Fluctuations along the longitudinal direction, {{on the other}} hand, can result in decorrelation of anisotropic flows in different regions of pseudo rapidity (η). Decorrelation of the 2 nd and 3 rd order anisotropic flows with different η gaps for final charged hadrons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is studied in an event-by-event (3 + 1) D ideal hydrodynamic model with fully fluctuating initial conditions from A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model. The decorrelation of anisotropic flows of final hadrons with large η gaps are found to originate from the spatial decorrelation along the longitudinal direction in the AMPT initial conditions through hydrodynamic evolution. The decorrelation is found to consist of both a <b>linear</b> <b>twist</b> and random fluctuation of the event-plane angles. The agreement between our results and recent CMS data in most centralities suggests that the string-like mechanism of initial parton production in AMPT model captures the initial longitudinal fluctuation {{that is responsible for}} the measured decorrelation of anisotropic flows in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC.

The process began by creating a baseline design which combined the dynamic design of the original Active Twist Rotor and the aerodynamic design of a high lift rotor concept. The baseline model was used to conduct a series of parametric studies to examine the effect of <b>linear</b> blade <b>twist</b> and blade tip sweep, droop, and taper on active-twist performance.

In this paper, a simplified morphing blade is introduced, which has a <b>linear</b> <b>twist</b> distribution along the span and a shape that can be controlled by adjusting the twist of the blade's root and tip. To evaluate the performance of wind turbine blades, a numerical code based on the blade element momentum theory is developed and validated. The blade of the NREL Phase VI wind turbine is taken as a reference blade and has a fixed pitch. The optimization problems associated with the control of the morphing blade and a blade with pitch control are formulated. The optimal results show that the morphing blade gives better results than the blade with pitch control in terms of produced power. Under the assumption that at a given site, the annual average wind speed is known and the wind speed follows a Rayleigh distribution, the annual energy production of wind turbines was evaluated for three types of blade, namely, morphing blade, blade with pitch control and fixed pitch blade.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} tailored couplings in {{rotor blades}} to reduce vibratory hub loads was studied through design, structural and aeroelastic analysis, fabrication, and {{wind tunnel test}} of Mach scale articulated composite rotors with tailored flap-bending/torsion couplings. The rotor design was nominally based on the UH- 60 BLACK HAWK rotor. The 6 -foot diameter blades have a SC 1095 profile and feature a <b>linear</b> <b>twist</b> of - 12 deg. The analysis of composite rotor was carried out using a mixed cross-section structural model, and UMARC. Five sets of composite rotor were fabricated, including a baseline rotor without coupling, rotors with spanwise uniform positive coupling and negative coupling, and rotors with spanwise dual-segmented coupling (FBT-P/N) and triple-segmented coupling. The blade composite D-spar is the primary structural element supporting the blade loads and providing the desired elastic couplings. Non-rotating tests were performed to examine blade structural properties. The measurements showed good correlation with predictions, and good repeatability for the four blades of each rotor set. All rotors were tested at a rotor speed of 2300 rpm (tip Mach number 0. 65) at different advance ratios and thrust levels, in the Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel at the University of Maryland. The test results showed that flap-bending/torsion couplings {{have a significant effect}} on the rotor vibratory hub loads. All coupled rotors reduced the 4 /rev vertical force for advance ratios up to 0. 3, with reductions ranging from 1 to 34 %. The mixed coupling rotor FBT-P/N reduced overall 4 /rev hub loads at advance ratios of 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3. At a rotor speed of 2300 rpm and an advance ratio of 0. 3, the FBT-P/N rotor achieved 15 % reduction for 4 /rev vertical force, 3 % for 4 /rev in-plane force and 14 % for 4 /rev head moment. The reductions in the 4 /rev hub loads are related to the experimentally observed reductions in 3 /rev and 5 /rev blade flap bending moments.
