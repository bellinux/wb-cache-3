50|$|The {{long strip}} of {{holographic}} film was placed between the <b>loose</b> <b>glass</b> sheet {{and the front}} of the camera, and the entire camera box was then almost filled with Johnson's Baby Oil. This unusual element to the high tech array of equipment and processes came about after the exhaustive testing of the refractive index of countless varieties of commercially available oils, and to the surprise of the holographers concerned, none could surpass the efficacy of this product. The function of the oil inside the camera was to act as an agent to cause the camera to flatten the film between the two glass surfaces. As the oil slowly seeped out between the film's surface and the two glass sheets the natural viscosity of the oil maintained an ultra-thin but cohesive layer that had the effect of gradually pulling the two glass sheets together with a level of force sufficient to flatten the film to within the tolerance level that allowed a consistent interference pattern to be recorded on the H1 master.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Seismoelectric {{phenomena}} in sediments arise from acoustic wave-induced fluid {{motion in the}} pore space, which perturbs the electrostatic equilibrium of the electric double layer on the grain surfaces. Experimental techniques and the apparatus built to study the conductivity dependence of the electrokinetic (EK) effect are described and outcomes for studies in <b>loose</b> <b>glass</b> microspheres and medium-grain sand are presented. By varying the NaCl concentration in the pore fluid, we measured the conductivity dependence of two kinds of EK behavior: (1) the electric fields generated within the samples by the passage of transmitted acoustic waves, and (2) the electromagnetic waves produced at the fluid–sediment interface by the incident acoustic wave. Both phenomena are caused by relative fluid motion in the sediment pores—this feature is characteristic of poroelastic (Biot) media, but not predicted by either viscoelastic fluid or solid models. A model of plane-wave reflection from a fluid–sediment interface using EK–Biot theory leads to theoretical predictions that compare well to the experimental data for both <b>loose</b> <b>glass</b> microspheres and medium-grain sand.

40|$|International audienceThe {{internal}} pore {{surface area}} per unit mass of solid (specific area) {{is an important}} parameter for the physical study of sound wave propagation in porous media. It is shown that this parameter can be evaluated with a reasonable accuracy from {{the integration of the}} water extraction curve (volume of water extracted versus applied pressure). This method is nonacoustic, modelless and well adapted to acoustic materials. It is a complementary method to the standard BET (Brunauer, Emmet, Teller) technique, generally used for powders in chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry. Experiments are made on <b>loose</b> <b>glass</b> beads of a few hundred microns diameter and results are compared to theoretical values. Results on heterogeneous materials used in civil engineering and in noise control are also given. The parameters necessary for the description of modem acoustic materials are estimated from the specific area measured by this method...|$|E

40|$|Acrylic resin {{has been}} the most popular denture base {{material}} for several decades. However, there are still some shortcomings with using such materials. These include dimensional changes and mechanical failure, which may lead to denture breakage. Accordingly, denture repair may be required. The strength and dimensional accuracy of denture repair materials are important concerning the durability and fit of dentures. Many attempts have been directed towards reinforcement of acrylic resin. Of these, the addition of glass fibers specifically improved fracture resistance and esthetics. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to investigate the effect of adding 1 and 2 wt% short-cut silane treated or untreated glass fibers on the transverse strength of heat-cured and chemically-cured acrylic resins. The chemically-cured material showing the optimum transverse strength was evaluated as a repair material for both non-reinforced and reinforced heat and chemically-cured resins as regards its transverse strength and dimensional stability. A heat-polymerizing denture base resin, Supracryl and a self-curing repair resin, Duracryl, were utilized. Short-cut, silanated or unsilanated glass fibers, were used to reinforce both types of acrylic. Five groups (n= 20) of rectangular specimens (60 X 10 X 2. 5 mm) were prepared for each acrylic; group 1 : non-reinforced group with no glass fiber addition (0 %), group 2 : reinforced with 1 wt% <b>loose</b> <b>glass</b> fibers (1 %), group 3 : reinforced with 1 wt% silanated glass fibers (1 % S), group 4 : reinforced with 2 wt% <b>loose</b> <b>glass</b> fibers (2 %) and group 5 : reinforced with 2 wt% silanated glass fibers (2 % S). Transverse strength was measured under three point loading utilizing a universal testing machine. The twenty fractured specimens of each group were subdivided into two subgroups: the first repaired using the non-reinforced autopolymerizing acrylic resin (control) and the second was repaired using the autopolymerizing reinforced acrylic that showed the highest transverse strength. The results showed that maximum transverse strength values were obtained when the non-reinforced and reinforced heat or chemically-cured acrylic resins were repaired utilizing the 1 % S reinforced material. However, these values were still significantly lower than the original strength of each repaired acrylic. Generally, the after repair percentage shrinkage versus time curves followed the same pattern. A significant increase in the percentage shrinkage was observed up to 24 hours. This was followed by a significant reduction in the calculated values up to 8 weeks. However, these curves were lower when repair was done utilizing the chemically-cured acrylic resin reinforced with 1 wt% silanated fibers. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|During recent curatorial {{activities}} in our Calliphorid collection I {{came across the}} type-series of Calliphora nigribarbis Snellen van Vollenhoven, 1863. The series consists of four specimens, which had been labelled as syntypes by me at an earlier occasion. They belong unmistakably to one lot, although only two bear identical, original, printed labels reading "V. Siebold/Japan". All four have a second handwritten label with the scientific name, "Calliphora nigribarbis v. Voll. ", and a last printed line "Coll. F. M. v. d. Wulp". These latter labels were also put on by me, in 1965, when rearranging the Diptera collection of our museum and {{are nothing more than}} an indication that the specimens concerned came from one of the old cabinets originating from, at least, the times of F. M. van der Wulp. These cabinets contained wooden drawers with <b>loose</b> <b>glass</b> covers with the label and specimen pins forced straight into the bare wooden bottom, no soft bottom-plates being present. Specimens in this old collection were placed below blackrimmed labels bearing the specific name, while names of higher categories (genera and families) were written on separate, hand-written, red-rimmed labels. Thus the actual specimen pins were unlabelled — a very archaic and unsatisfactory situation —, while some of the specimens had no label at all, because in the case of longer series only the first and last specimens had a locality-label. When transferring the specimens to modern drawers I provided every specimen with a new identification label, so as to preserve their then identification. The four syntypes of Calliphora nigribarbis apparently comprise the complete material of this species. Snellen van Vollenhoven (1863 : 17 - 18) mentions only four specimens from Japan, collected by Von Siebold. The fou...|$|E

40|$|Using {{molecular}} dynamics at constant pressure, {{the relationship between}} the excess of low frequency vibrational modes (known as the boson peak) and the glass transition is investigated for a truncated Lennard-Jones potential. It is observed that the quadratic mean displacement is enhanced by such modes, as predicted using a harmonic Hamiltonian for metastable states. As a result, <b>glasses</b> <b>loose</b> mechanical stability at lower temperatures than the corresponding crystal, since the Lindemann criteria are observed, as is also deduced from density functional theory. Finally, we found that the average force and elastic constant are reduced in the glass due to such excess of modes.

Typically, elaborate hydraulic or vacuum systems have been employed to compress holographic film during the exposure process. However this function was achieved at Australian Holographics by the construction of what was referred to as 'the camera'.

60|$|Up to {{the moment}} of the arrival of man in the {{archipelago}} the whole population, animal and vegetable, consisted entirely of these waifs and strays, blown out to sea from Europe or Africa, and modified more or less on the spot in accordance with the varying needs of their new home. But the advent of the obtrusive human species spoilt the game at once for an independent observer. Man immediately introduced oranges, bananas, sweet potatoes, grapes, plums, almonds, and many other trees or shrubs, in which, for selfish reasons, he was personally interested. At the same time he quite unconsciously and unintentionally stocked the islands with a fine vigorous crop of European weeds, so that the number of kinds of flowering plants included in the modern flora of my little archipelago exceeds, I think, by fully one-half that which I remember before the date of the Portuguese occupation. In the same way, besides his domestic animals, this spoil-sport colonist man brought in his train accidentally rabbits, weasels, mice, and rats, which now abound {{in many parts of the}} group, so that the islands have now in effect a wild mammalian fauna. What is more odd, a small lizard has also got about in the walls--not as you would imagine, a native-born Portuguese subject, but of a kind found only in Madeira and Teneriffe, and, as far as I could make out at the time, it seemed to me to come over with cuttings of Madeira vines for planting at St. Michael's. It was about the same time, I imagine, that eels and gold-fish first got <b>loose</b> from <b>glass</b> globes into the ponds and water-courses.|$|R
40|$|Bioactive {{glasses are}} capable of {{reacting}} with physiological fluids to form a hydroxy-apatite (HA) layers. This layer, with similar composition than the mineral part of the bone, leads to firm bond between the glass and the tissue. Silicate based bioactive glasses commonly convert slowly and incompletely to HA due to their non-congruent dissolution. It was found in previous clinical studied that typical bioactive glass re-mains at the surgical site even 14 years’ post-surgery. The dissolution and reaction mechanism, leading to the precipitation of a HA layer is mainly due to the bioactive <b>glass</b> <b>loose</b> structure. However, such loose structure also inhibits any hot forming of the glass. Indeed, sintering of commercial bioactive glasses led to scaffolds with very low mechanical properties and partially to fully crystallized scaffolds. The surface crystallization of these glasses decreased their bioactivity. This thesis uses the glass S 53 P 4 as a reference as it is well studied and commercially available. As for all commercially available silicate bioactive glasses, glass S 53 P 4 cannot be hot formed without crystallization and does not convert fully into HA. Thus, glasses with partial to almost full substitution of the SiO 2 with B 2 O 3 were developed. The aim is to define new glass composition that have thermal and structural properties allowing for heat sintering while converting faster to HA. In general, the addition of boron within the silicate glass led to a material more prone to dissolve in aqueous so-lution. The reaction of the glass and its conversion into hydroxyapatite was also faster. The glass labelled B 25, B 50 and B 75 {{were found to be}} the most suited to be sintered into porous scaffolds. Scaffold were processed using three particles size (500 µm). The porosity was found to decrease with decreasing the particles size (at similar sintering temperature) and increasing the sintering temperature (at constant particle size). All the scaffolds produced were found to be amorphous. Scaffolds (par-ticle size 250 – 500 µm) with 50 % overall porosity were immersed in SBF for up to 168 h. The compression strength decreased with increasing the immersion time. All the scaffold maintained their ability to precipitate a HA layer at their surface. The newly developed glasses were found to be suitable for future, more sophisticated scaffold manufacturing for tissue engineering...|$|R
