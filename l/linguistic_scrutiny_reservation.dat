He fervently defends linguists' right to contribute to the study of poetry and demonstrates the aptitude of the modern linguistics to the most insightful investigation of a poetic message. The legitimacy of [...] "studies devoted to questions of metrics or strophics, alliterations or rhymes, or to questions of poets' vocabulary" [...] is hence undeniable (23). Linguistic devices that transform a verbal act into poetry range [...] "from the network of distinctive features to the arrangement of the entire text" [...] (Jakobson 23).|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the Nienburg {{fragment}} from about 1180 is under <b>linguistic</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> The three eastern provinciae of the Nienburg Monastery {{situated in the}} historical eastern Lusatia are differentiated with help of linguistic methods according to particular paragraphs of the document. Special attention is given to some toponyms which {{could not have been}} attributed to definite places yet. It is presented a proposal to associate the place names to still existing geographical objects. Furthermore some geographical names are discussed and interpreted in a new way in contrast to former explanations. Thus characteristic feature of the Nienburg fragment becomes obvious: The Latin written document has preserved the Slavonic proper names in a graphic variant very closely to their original forms without reduction or any other influence of the German language on it...|$|R
40|$|The author {{analyses}} the clumsy {{character of}} Susan Mayer, an illustrator of children’s books, from the American TV series Desperate Housewives (2004 -present), produced by ABC. More precisely, the author examines Susan’s conversational style and interactional behaviour towards the plumber Mike Delfino and the estate agent Edie Britt {{in a scene}} from the pilot show (2004). Through the linguistic theoretical frameworks of conversation analysis, pragmatics and stylistics, and through feminist television studies, the author tries to demonstrate that this scene describes her as a stereotypical female protagonist — the powerless woman in need of advice and guidance. This feature may be effective from a narrative and comical standpoint, but <b>linguistic</b> <b>scrutiny</b> shows that it has negative and clichéd connotations and, most importantly, is far from being an instance of an unbiased representation of a female figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} of the six seasons of HBO’s Sex and the City (1998 - 2004), Miranda Hobbes, a {{successful}} Harvard-educated attorney, and a cynical and pragmatic woman, establishes an unstable relationship with bartender Steve Brady; a son, Brady Hobbes, is born to the couple in the fourth season. After his birth, Miranda meets Mary Brady, Steve’s mother, who is a working-class woman, of Irish origin, in her sixties. In this article, through the linguistic tools of conversation analysis, pragmatics and stylistics, and through feminist television studies, the author examines the first conversation which Mary participates in (season 5, episode 2, 2002), and tries to identify the linguistic features through which her female figure and Irish working-class identity are constructed as stereotypical. <b>Linguistic</b> <b>scrutiny</b> testifies {{to the fact that the}} clichéd representation of Mary’s non-American, non-middle-class identity is built against Miranda’s socioeconomic and cultural representation, and that the two female characters are constructed as antithetical. Nevertheless, since it is the American woman, not the Irish woman, who is one of the four protagonists of the TV series, the audience is likely to share both that woman’s viewpoint, which therefore becomes dominant, and her negative judgment on Mary, which becomes final...|$|R
40|$|In HBO’s Sex and the City (1998 - 2004), {{such topics}} as sex, love and {{friendship}} are discussed by four Manhattan-based white middle-class women in their late thirties who typify varied and contrasting role models. In this article, through conversation analysis, pragmatics and stylistics, the author examines {{the text of the}} final conversation among the four characters, which occurs in the penultimate episode of the last season (2004). The objective is to identify the linguistic features through which the four protagonists’ different personalities and ideologies are delineated, to study whether their identities and worldviews on sex, love and life have changed since the 1997 pilot show, and to reveal how and why their distinct value systems have altered over time. <b>Linguistic</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> validated by a more extensive consideration of the text of the entire TV series, uncovers that Carrie, throughout the six seasons, evolves from an open-minded inquisitive nature to a value-laden traditionally female dramatis persona. What is more, the fact that even the ideologically groundbreaking figures of Samantha and Miranda, along with Charlotte and Carrie, are finally provided with a regular partner and family and with a standard white middle-class lifestyle clearly conveys that, over time, the text of Sex and the City has gradually incarnated a mainstream value system and has increasingly come to represent more stereotypically female characters...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{discourse}} {{is viewed as}} a specific object of linguistic analysis in light of cognitive-discursive paradigm. Categories are integral parts of the scientific discourse, yet there is no full list of such categories. Insufficient studies of the category of inclusiveness, as one of the categories that has not come under <b>linguistic</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> specifically, in modern English scientific discourse, call for investigating this category and its elements. The paper deals with the analysis of the metaphors of inclusive semantics to convey the category of inclusiveness. Empirical material of our study involves Anglo-American articles in the field of information and communication technologies, as this research domain deals with the latest cutting-edge technologies that influence virtually all spheres of human life due to the potential of such technologies to dramatically reshape information society in the age of digital revolution. We have outlined the following types of inclusive metaphors in the language of science: the metaphor of CONTAINER that is expressed through a bunch of linguistic devices (nouns: container, envelope, family, house; verbs: to house, to wrap up); the metaphor of CIRCLE (nouns: circle; verbs: to circle, compass, to compass, to encircle, to enclose, to surround, set phrase: to range from?to); and the metaphor of CONTENTS. The obtained results have shown that the metaphor of CONTAINER is the most frequently used one...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} on “Women and Witches in Scot’s The Discoverie of Witchcraft and in James I’s Daemonologie”. When editing the Italian {{edition of the}} city comedy The Devil Is an Ass by Ben Jonson and {{analysing}} the characters of devils and witches in Jacobean drama, the author consulted Elizabethan, Jacobean and Caroline treatises on demonology and witchcraft. In particular, she referred to two influential works, namely The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584) by the sceptical scholar Reginald Scot, and Daemonologie (1597) by James I Stuart. Despite the contrasting viewpoints conveyed in Scot’s and James’ works, the author concludes that their descriptions of women and witches are not very different, since the picture that both authors paint of the female figure and of female nature is more stereotypical than real. In her article, the author examines the two writers’ representations of women and witches and the ideology behind them by selecting a passage from each text and studying these extracts from a linguistic perspective through structural and functional grammar, pragmatics, stylistics and the newer approach of feminist linguistics. <b>Linguistic</b> <b>scrutiny</b> reveals the main dissimilarity between the misogynous descriptions of the female figures in the two treatises. Whilst James simply hints at their alleged moral and intellectual defects, Scot also considers their supposedly weak physical appearance. On the one hand, James effectively manages to persuade his readers of his viewpoint, and achieves his perlocutionary goal without referring to {{the bodies of the}} alleged witches. On the other hand, Scot’s repeatedly mentioning their bodies in a derogatory fashion constantly infringes the Gricean maxims of Quantity and Relevance, since those remarks are dysfunctional to his discourse. It is thus notable that Scot, an author sceptical about witchcraft, who is presupposed by his Elizabethan and modern reader as regarding alleged witches as helpless victims, hence with pity and compassion, depicts them even more chauvinistically and conventionally than James, a renowned believer in the black arts...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{research}} on the social meaning of varieties insists on studying the different functions of the <b>linguistic</b> variants under <b>scrutiny</b> in performing social action (Jaffe 2009). Social meanings are thus {{not considered to be}} stable indexes, but rather as fleeting interactional moves through which speakers take stances and make ideological moves (Bucholtz  2009). Set against this background, this contribution aims to get a better grip on the way in which youngsters from Limburg, the easternmost region of Flanders, construct social meaning in their everyday interaction through their use of a contemporary urban vernacular and on how these meaningsinaction are connected to a larger social and ideological scale. Previous analyses of survey and perceptional data (Author 1 et al. forthc.) have shown that some linguistic variants of this urban vernacular have become enregistered (Agha 2007), constituting a multilayered indexical field (indexing,  among others,  local identity,  ethnicity,  social class). This paper will complement these analyses with interactional data, in order to verify how users of the vernacular pick up different social meanings, depending on their experiences and on the larger ideological values they relate to. The data (collected between 20112013) consist of spontaneous interactions by  15  youngsters,  focus groups and media representations...|$|R
40|$|Addressing the {{interdisciplinary}} area {{of language and}} gender as applied to television and media studies, this book analyses a number of extremely popular contemporary TV series — Sex and the City, Desperate Housewives, The Simpsons, Nip/Tuck — and two equally significant cultural products, namely, the film When Harry Met Sally…and the novel Bridget Jones’s Diary. With all their specificities, these TV series, film and novel share a reinvention of the codes of romance, by representing an up-to-date, somehow fashionable version of the traditional, and traditionally female, genre of romance geared to postfeminist consumer culture. While the femininities and sexualities enacted in these cultural narratives {{may appear to be}} unsparingly and humorously critical of conventionally female linguistic and cultural stereotypes, and could therefore be regarded as radical feminist embodiments, despite all their ironic and hyperbolic approach they are in fact not only romantic and mainstream, but also ideologically biased, preserving a normative white middle-class status quo, and restoring a challenged/contested patriarchal value system. A close <b>linguistic</b> and critical <b>scrutiny</b> thus lays bare the textual and discursive strategies by which feminism has switched to postfeminist romance, and in so doing has yielded to postfeminist backlash...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of ‘the Pictish language’ {{has been discussed}} for over four hundred years, and for well over two centuries {{it has been the}} subject of ceaseless and often heated debate. The main disagreement focusing on its linguistic categorisation – whether it was Celtic, Germanic (using modern terminology) or whether it belonged to some more exotic language group such as Basque. If it was Celtic then was it Brittonic or Goidelic? The answer to such questions was of some importance in ascertaining to whom the Scottish past belonged. Was it to immigrant Irish, conquering Germanic peoples or native Britons? The twentieth century saw the normalising of the view that it was closely related to Brittonic with some erudite scholars maintaining that another, non-Celtic language, was also spoken in Pictland. The debate subsequently shifted to focusing on just how close was the relationship between Pictish and Neo-Brittonic. Was Pictish simply a northerly dialect variant of the latter or was it indeed a more distinct and perhaps conservative form, evolving independently in an area outwith Roman power and linguistic influence? Recently, as the field of Pictish studies was subjected to both <b>linguistic</b> and historical <b>scrutiny,</b> discussions have become significantly more sophisticated, but the core question remains, as to whether Pictish distinctiveness merits the label ‘dialect’ or ‘language’, as the Venerable Bede himself stated. This thesis will investigate this core issue by providing an overview of previous thinking and scrutinising the evidence for early divergence. It is intended as groundwork for much needed further studies into this field...|$|R
40|$|CFP Euralex “Queer(ing) Lexicography: towards truly {{inclusive}} dictionary-making?” Eva Nossem & Łukasz Pakuła We invite abstract submissions for {{papers on}} the topic of “Queer(ing) Lexicography” for the Euralex 2018 conference in Ljubljana, 17 - 21 July 2018 The role of dictionaries in society at large has been theorized and critiqued also with respect to hidden ideologies (e. g. Kachru & Kahane, 1995). Due to the fact that Unidentified Authorising Dictionaries (Moon, 1989) are often drawn on to legitimize and naturalize discriminatory discourses, they have been subjected to critical <b>linguistic</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> While feminist critique has yielded somewhat satisfactory results (Hoem Iversen, 2005), insights into constructions of sexuality are scarce (Pakuła, 2018). The few studies exploring non-heterosexual aspects of macro- and megastructures point to the inherent positioning of heterosexuality as an unquestioned norm and thus – in the educational context – might inhibit language learning, {{as is the case with}} textbooks and in-class interactions (see Pavlenko, 2004; Nelson, 2009). Somewhat disappointingly, there seems to be little resonance between what is done in the field of critical applied linguistics and metalexicography, as each camp preaches to the already converted (cf. Russell, 2012). This panel sets out to bridge these two (seemingly distant) worlds. “’Queer’ is one of a handful of terms in English that establish references by opposition and exclusion, not just by simple description. That is, instead of identifying properties that the object under discussion contains, calling something ‘queer’ suggests that it is out of place in some sense, that is excessive and overextended, that it disrupts and subverts an otherwise tranquil domain. ” (Leap 1996 : 101). The tranquil domain queer aims at disrupting and subverting in this panel is lexicography and the related disciplines involved in the mono- and interlingual dictionary-making. This panel on “Queer(ing) Lexicography” (Nossem 2018) aims at showcasing possibilities to overcome the apparent opposition between the anti-normative ‘queer’ that resists definition and can be seen as a “linguistic experiment, namely as a signifier without a stable signified” (Barrett 2002 : 27), and the theory and practice of lexicography, with its focus on definitions and classifications (Nossem 2018). In accordance with Motschenbacher, who explains that “Queer Linguistics transfers ideas from Queer Theory to linguistics” (2011 : 6), we aim at further developing the field of Queer Lexicography by uniting ideas and concepts from Queer Theory and Queer Studies, and lexicography, i. e. by integrating an interdisciplinary heteronormativity research in the field of lexicography. By introducing queer approaches, and in the spirit of action research (Burr, 1995) we want to question normalized practices in lexicography, metalexicography, lexicology, semantics, corpus linguistics, and other linguistic fields, especially in their relation to dictionary-making. We propose to examine the linguistic manifestation of heteronormativity and, connected with it, binary gender and sexual identity discourses (Bing & Bergvall 1996 in Motschenbacher 2011 : 21) as well as the instrumental use of dictionaries in public and media discourses with view of appreciating the multitude of sexual and gender identities of dictionary users (and compilers). Papers which address the following topics are most welcome: - Queer Studies and lexicography - Gender Studies and lexicography - Sexuality Studies and lexicography - Critical heteronormativity research in lexicography - (Anti-) normative approaches in lexicography - Manifestation of dominant and minority discourses in dictionaries - Dictionaries as authoritative tools - Power and ideology in dictionaries - Critical analysis of normative meaning definitions in mono-and interlingual dictionaries - Queer approaches to semantics in relation to dictionary making - Queer approaches to corpus linguistics in relation to dictionary making - Dictionaries in public and media discourses of non-normativities Please send abstracts no longer than 300 words (excluding references) to Eva Nossem (e. nossem@mx. uni-saarland. de) and Łukasz Pakuła (l. pakula@gmail. com) by 26 November 2017.
