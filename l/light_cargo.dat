5|$|Under Samuel Doe the Coast Guard was retitled the Liberian Navy in 1986 {{through the}} passage of The Liberian Navy Act of 1986. The Aviation Unit was founded in 1970 with the {{delivery}} of three Cessna U-17C light aircraft. An Aviation Unit aircraft crashed at Spriggs-Payne in 1984. In 1985 it operated three fixed-wing aircraft from Spriggs Payne Airport in Monrovia, including Cessna 172s. Their duties included reconnaissance and transport of <b>light</b> <b>cargo</b> and VIPs. The Aviation Unit was expanded in the 1980s with the delivery of more Cessna aircraft: three 172s, a 206, 207 and two single engined turboprop 208s.|$|E
25|$|There {{has always}} been a need for small tender boats for {{transporting}} goods and personnel to and from anchored sailing ships. Together with other smaller work craft such as fishing and <b>light</b> <b>cargo,</b> small inshore craft have always been in evidence. Charles II of England had a private sailing boat presented to him when he returned from exile to England in the 17th century, and he sailed for recreation and competition.|$|E
25|$|After NOAA {{decommissioned}} Townsend Cromwell, the U.S. Government transferred {{her to the}} Government of American Samoa {{in accordance}} with Public Law 106-555, Section 204. As MV Townsend Cromwell, she arrived at Pago Pago, American Samoa, in November 2002. The government of American Samoa hoped to use her to carry passengers and <b>light</b> <b>cargo</b> between Manu'a and Tutuila, {{but she was not}} certified to perform such services. In January 2003, the American Samoan government announced that it wanted to sell Townsend Cromwell or exchange her for a more suitable vessel for service to Manu'a.|$|E

50|$|A schuyt is a {{flat-bottomed}} {{sailing boat}} {{used in the}} Netherlands, originally for fishing or carrying <b>light</b> <b>cargoes.</b> In the 17th century, they were rigged with two masts like a ketch, but by the 19th century, had adopted a single mast like a sloop.|$|R
25|$|First class {{passengers}} had {{quarters in}} the midship {{house on the}} bridge and shelter decks with access to a saloon lighted by a skylight and dinging room. Some rooms had private lavatories, but lavatories for men and another for women were located aft of the engine casing on the shelter deck with another set {{in the center of}} the bridge deck accommodations. The upper deck was fitted for either <b>light</b> <b>cargo</b> or steerage passengers and, in the event of Chinese steerage passengers, had provision for a Chinese galley and wash area.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Mooney Airplane Company of Kerrville, Texas, {{designed}} a six-seat pressurised light aircraft, {{powered by a}} single 360hp (268kW) piston engine, which they designated the Mooney 301. On 7 April 1983, the prototype 301 conducted its maiden flight. During 1985, the Mooney Aircraft Company was acquired by new French owners, who promptly {{took an interest in}} the further development of the fledgling 301. Coinciding with the company's acquisition, French light aircraft manufacturer SOCATA, who had identified a vacant market position for a purpose-built optimised single-engine aircraft capable of fast personal transport and <b>light</b> <b>cargo</b> duties, identified the piston-powered 301 as a potential starting point to satisfy this niche.|$|E
25|$|The Caproni Ca.193 was {{the last}} {{aircraft}} the Caproni company designed and built in Milan. It was a four-seat, twin-engine <b>light</b> <b>cargo</b> and liaison aircraft. The single prototype was designed, built and first flown {{in the second half}} of the 1940s, while the company was facing a period of deep crisis; it was tested by the Aeronautica Militare, Italy's newly formed Air Force, which bought the prototype but refused to place orders for mass production. The only Ca.193 kept flying for the Italian Air Force until 1952, then passed to the Aero Club Trento, where it remained in service until 1960, and finally relocated to the Caproni Museum in Vizzola Ticino. It was moved to Trentino again in 1988, and underwent an extensive and difficult restoration process in 1991.|$|E

25|$|Further {{requirements}} for the prospective light helicopter included a flight endurance of one hour along {{with the potential for}} carrying <b>light</b> <b>cargos</b> such as fuel and tools as well as stretcher-bound wounded troops. An initial request for a rear-facing observer's seat was present early on, but was discarded in later revisions. At this time, newly developed gas turbines were beginning to appeal both to helicopter designers and to prospective operators, the British Army made the use of such an engine one of its requirements.|$|R

2500|$|When used {{to refer}} to sailing boats, a cutter is a utility vessel, single-masted and with a small crew (as few as two but often five or more) fore-and-aft rigged, with two or more {{headsails}} and often a bowsprit.

2500|$|Colonel Armond Peterson was {{acquired}} and converted by the United States Navy and redesignated as <b>Light</b> <b>Cargo</b> Ship Palm Beach (AKL-45) on 18 June 1966. She was {{converted to a}} Banner class environmental research ship at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and reclassified as AGER-3. The Palm Beach was commissioned on 13 October 1967 and served two years as an ELINT/SIGINT ship, deploying in the Mediterranean and in the North Sea. She was decommissioned and later struck on 1 December 1969. [...] She was sold to a private owner, then resold to a Panamanian company and renamed MV Oro Verde. The ship was eventually involved in drug smuggling and ran aground in the Cayman Islands. She was sunk by the Cayman Islands government as a SCUBA dive wreck.|$|E
50|$|Soon after Lincoln's {{proclamation}} blockade-runners {{were being}} produced, lighter vessels {{specifically designed to}} evade and outrun Union ships on blockade patrol. Many of the vessels were built in English ship yards and were designed {{to be used as}} fast transports for dispatch purposes, carrying important (often business) correspondence and <b>light</b> <b>cargoes.</b> Inbound vessels carried general mail and other correspondence and typically imported firearms, military ordnance, and paper, a simple commodity that was scarce throughout the agrarian south and badly needed by the Confederate government and general population.|$|R

60|$|By {{a law of}} Calcutta, if {{anything}} happens to a vessel before she gets to sea, the people retain the two months' advance it is customary to give them. This rule brought us into difficulty. The Hopping Castle cleared for Bombay, with a <b>light</b> <b>cargo.</b> We had dropped down the river, discharged the pilot, and made sail on our course, when a fire suddenly broke up out of the fore-hatch. A quantity of grass junk, and two or three cables of the same material, were {{in that part of the}} ship, and they all burnt like tinder. I went with the other officers and threw overboard the powder, but it was useless to attempt extinguishing the flames. Luckily, there were two pilot brigs still near us, and they came alongside and received all hands. The Hopping Castle burnt to the water's edge, and we saw her wreck go down. This was a short career for so fine a ship, and it gave us all great pain; all but the rascals of Lascars. I lost everything I had in the world in her, but a few clothes I saved in a small trunk. I had little or no money, Calcutta being no place for economy. In a country in which it is a distinction to be a white man, and called a Christian, one must maintain his dignity by a little extravagance.|$|E
