5|$|Wetherall {{was born}} in Sheffield. He was capped by England at schoolboy level, and in 1989, when he left school, he signed for Sheffield Wednesday under the {{management}} of Howard Wilkinson. Wetherall had attended Rotherham sixth form college where he achieved four A-levels at grade A, and chose to study for his BSc in chemistry at the University of Sheffield, {{so that he could}} <b>live</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> with his parents and combine his education with playing for Sheffield Wednesday's reserve team. He graduated with a first-class honours degree in 1992, becoming the first Premier League player to achieve such a qualification. In 1990, he was part of a British squad which travelled to Italy for the world student five-a-side football championship, and represented Great Britain as they won the association football bronze medal at the 1991 World Student Games hosted in Sheffield.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the hardships}} and {{relatively}} low pay, Barham's 1841 {{investigation into the}} Cornish mining industry found that bal maidens generally enjoyed their work, and that {{those who had been}} in other jobs tended to prefer work at the mines. Mining had shorter hours than domestic service and was less affected by seasonal variations than farm working, the other two jobs employing significant numbers of women, and it was far easier for workers to <b>live</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and travel to work each day, rather than lodging in their master's house or on a remote farm. Outdoor work was considered healthier than work in enclosed and smoky mines and factories, and it was sometimes believed that women who had worked as bal maidens from a young age were healthier than they would otherwise have been. From the 1780s onwards Cornwall suffered severe unemployment and poverty, and there were always large numbers of women and girls volunteering for work at the mines. The practice of giving preference to the wives, widows and children of dead or invalid miners allowed families to remain in their local area and to avoid destitution following the loss of the family's main breadwinner; work as a bal maiden also provided an opportunity for girls and young women to escape workhouses and gain financial independence. (As well as the benefits to the community of giving work to the families of invalid or dead miners, recruitment from within mining families benefited the mine owners also. The wives and children of miners could be expected to understand mining terminology and techniques, and would generally have been regular visitors to the mines delivering food to their husbands and thus be familiar with the mine's layout.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Left nearly alone, Marie Ogden {{continued}} to support herself by publishing {{the newspaper and}} by teaching piano lessons {{to the children of}} Monticello. In 1949, Ogden sold The San Juan Record. She eventually moved into the San Juan Nursing Home in Blanding, where she died in 1975.

2500|$|The {{predominant}} {{religion in}} Benghazi is Islam. Practically {{all of the}} city's inhabitants are Sunni Muslims. During Islamic holidays such as Ramadan, most abstain from food; restaurants are usually empty during the day, {{with the exception of}} some expatriates and tourists. Alcohol is banned by law in Benghazi and throughout Libya in accordance with Islamic principles. The conservative Islamic nature of Benghazi creates a strong sense of family life in the city – [...] practically all teenagers and young adults <b>live</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> until they get married. Many Muslims in Benghazi adhere to the traditional Maliki school of religious law, however much less so than in decades past. In recent years, more people are beginning to practice Salafism with the spread of literalist inclined Islamic television channels. It is not uncommon therefore to see woman wearing black niqabs and men with full beards in Benghazi because of the existence of such schools, although not exclusively for that purpose. The Senussi order from which the royal dynasty sprang has traditionally enjoyed strong support in Benghazi and the Cyrenaica.|$|E
2500|$|The 2/21st Battalion {{began its}} {{training}} in September 1914 at Flodden Road, at Ruskin Park and on Wimbledon Common, {{with a few}} rifles borrowed from the affiliated cadet corps at Dulwich College. Meanwhile, the men continued to <b>live</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and wore civilian clothes until uniforms gradually became available. In January 1915 the battalion joined 2/6th London Brigade in billets at Redhill, Surrey, where training included digging trenches at Merstham Hill {{as part of the}} London Southern Defence Scheme. During February, [...]256-in Japanese Ariska rifles were issued. By March the 2/2nd London Division was sent to the St Albans area to replace 1/2nd London Division in Third Army, Central Force, and provided drafts to bring the 1st-Line units up to strength for overseas service. The men who had only signed up for Home Service became the nucleus of the 3/21st Bn forming at Flodden Road. The 2/21st was billeted first at St Albans, then at Sawbridgeworth. After camping during the summer, it spent the winter of 1915–16 billeted at Coggeshall.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{arguing that}} Austen's novels have feminist elements, {{scholars}} have still noted {{that women are}} frequently represented as confined in Austen's novels {{and that there are}} few depictions of female authority figures. Women are literally confined in small spaces but are constrained even more effectively by social factors such as [...] "miseducation" [...] and [...] "financial dependency". Gilbert and Gubar argue that women [...] "must acquiesce in their own confinement, no matter how stifling" [...] because [...] "they are too vulnerable in the world at large". For example, in Persuasion Anne Elliot describes the differences between men and women: [...] "We <b>live</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions." [...] Butler points out that Austen's novels lack depictions of female mentors or authority figures. In the novels, Butler argues, women do not progress from ignorance to knowledge, for example, {{and many of them are}} [...] "oddly and even unnaturally ineffective". Instead, they marry authority figures. As Gilbert and Gubar put it, [...] "becoming a woman means relinquishing achievement and accommodating oneself to men and the spaces they provide". For example, in Persuasion, as Mary and Louisa grow up they lose their independence and become reliant on those around them.|$|E
