40|$|Multifractal {{modeling}} of geochemical map data {{can help to}} explain the nature of frequency distributions of element concentration values for small rock samples and their spatial covariance structure. Useful frequency distribution models are the lognormal and Pareto distributions which plot as straight lines on logarithmic probability and <b>log-log</b> <b>paper,</b> respectively. The model of de Wijs is a simple multiplicative cascade resulting in discrete logbinomial distribution that closely approximates the lognormal. In this model, smaller blocks resulting from dividing larger blocks into parts have concentration values with constant ratios that are scale-independent. The approach can be modified by adopting random variables for these ratios. Other modifications include a single cascade model with ratio parameters that depend on magnitude of concentration value. The Turcotte model, which is another variant of the model of de Wijs, results in a Pareto distribution. Often a single straight line on logarithmic probability or <b>log-log</b> <b>paper</b> {{does not provide a}} good fit to observed data and two or more distributions should be fitted. For example, geochemical background and anomalies (extremely high values) have separate frequency distributions for concentration values and for local singularity coefficients. Mixtures of distributions can be simulated by adding the results of separate cascade models. Regardless of properties of background, an unbiased estimate can be obtained of the parameter of the Pareto distribution characterizing anomalies in the upper tail of the element concentration frequency distribution or lower tail of the local singularity distribution. Computer simulation experiments and practical examples are used to illustrate the approach...|$|E

The translational velocity of the ring at the eight-diameter distance (6. 0 cm) {{was used for the}} calculation of the Reynolds number. First, the graphs of the translational velocity vs. distance traveled by the ring plotted on semi -log paper indicate that in the later stage of the motion there exists an exponential type of dependence of the velocity on the distance, v" - exp (- k y), the value of k depending on the Reynolds number, with k decreasing as the Reynolds number increases. Next, from the relation between the velocity and time elapsed plotted on <b>log-log</b> <b>paper,</b> it is found that when the power law approximation, v - t ^, is adopted for the later part of the motion, the value of bapproximately equals to 1 for each ring regardless the Reynolds number.

40|$|Ephemeral {{gully erosion}} in {{cultivated}} land {{is an important}} source of sediment that is frequently being overlooked and not accounted for in soil erosion studies. Furthermore, {{little is known about the}} factors controlling ephemeral gully erosion. In this paper the available information on the initiation and location of (ephemeral) gullies is summarised, focusing on the relationship between the upslope drainage area (A) and the critical slope gradient (S-cr) for ephemeral gully initiation. By plotting the non-linear relationship between critical slope gradient (measured immediately upstream of the incision head) and drainage area (at the incision head) for gullied sites it was possible to draw a straight line on <b>log-log</b> <b>paper</b> through the lower-most points for each of the available datasets, representing a critical slope-area relationship for incision. Consequently, below this line no incision occurs. This line or critical relation can also be written as a power function between critical slope and area. Although many factors vary between the different datasets, the exponent of the drainage area relationship (- 0. 4) showed very little variation. The observed critical slope-area relationship can be related to a simple model of channel initiation by overland flow. Furthermore, this relationship can be used to identify potentially unstable sites where control measures should be undertaken. status: publishe...|$|E

Students will use the slopes of various curves plotted on <b>log-log</b> graph <b>paper</b> to classify stellar objects as binary stars, supernovae, or active galaxies.

It provides an opportunity for students to apply the knowledge of plotting data and obtaining a slope using a log-log coordinate system, determine the line of best fit from a set of data obtained from X-ray astronomy satellites, and discover the relationship between slope and the classification of stellar objects. By displaying the data in a graphic, the relationship of the dependent variable on the independent variable can be seen. The most powerful form of display is when the result is a straight line - which can always be converted quickly into a mathematical equation.

So far we have used Cartesian (named for French mathematician Ren√© Descartes) graphs (see lab # 3).

However, not all graphs produce straight lines! The curves at the right are drawn from relationships between y and x called power laws.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 149 - 158 The use of {{statistical}} techniques to investigate machinery failure data {{is one of}} the most powerful troubleshooting tools available to the turbomachinery engineer. This analysis tool can provide a great deal of information and insight concerning causes of failures and the probability of future ones. Using a graphical technique known as a hazard analysis or Weibull analysis, failure data of the type commonly available in the field can be analyzed to determine failure modes, the mean time to failure, the effects of different failure modes and the probability of future failure. The graphical procedure described in this paper is very simple to use, and requires only elementary math. The technique uses such readily available parameters as running hr or installed time of the subject under investigation and can easily handle incomplete or censored data. The method used to construct and interpret a hazard, or Wei bull chart, using either special Wei bull <b>paper</b> or simple <b>log-log</b> graph <b>paper</b> is presented.

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} in atmospheric corrosion to fit the power-law function as a 'model' to help predict longer term corrosion loss or maximum pit depth. This function {{is also known as}} the 'log-log model' since it plots as a straight line on <b>log-log</b> <b>paper.</b> It used extensively including for aluminium alloys. A review of the relatively few data sets for long-term corrosion of aluminium shows systematic variation from the log-log power law model. Instead, in many cases the data can be interpreted as consistent with the multi-phase model previously proposed for steel corrosion in marine exposure conditions. Consideration is given to why the multi-phase model appears to be applicable also to long-term corrosion of aluminium alloys. This includes the important effect of corrosion products on oxygen diffusion, even though corrosion products of aluminium tend to occur in localized areas, that almost always involves pitting rather than general or uniform corrosion. It is proposed that the build-up of corrosion products forces a change to the chemical reactions responsible for aluminium corrosion, specifically forcing a change from cathodic oxidation and polarization in the shorter term to cathodic hydrogen reduction and polarization in the longer-term. The greater possible rate of outward diffusion of hydrogen compared to inward diffusion of oxygen is primarily responsible for the bi-modal character of corrosion loss or maximum pit depth as a function of exposure time...|$|E
40|$|The lung {{has been}} satisfactorily {{modelled}} as a fractal, {{and change in}} lung structure due to disease is assumed to change the fractal dimensionality of the lung. It is hypothesized that those changes in fractal dimension affect perceptually relevant elements (perceived texture) of the lung, and therefore the fractal dimension {{may prove to be}} a predictor of diagnosis. If the fractal dimensionality reflects structure in ways more accurately reflecting changes in lung structure than can be achieved by nuclear medicine physicians, then it may also prove useful as a diagnostic tool. Fractal dimension is linearly related to the slope of the power spectrum (SPS) as plotted on <b>log-log</b> <b>paper,</b> and the SPS was used as the metric reflecting the fractal dimension. Seventy-two cases were selected that were either normal, had congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pulmonary embolism (PE). Five of the cases had both CHF and COPD. The lung scans from these cases were digitized, with appropriate corrections for linearization, edge artifacts, target nonuniformities and film gamma. Fast Fourier Transforms provided the power spectrum from which the SPS was calculated. Four nuclear medicine physicians read the original lung scans and rated their certainty about the presence of two texture elements, the extensiveness of disease involvement, and presence of the three diseases used (CHF, COPD, and PE). The results found the SPS to be significantly related to both texture ratings and diagnostic certainty, but inferior as a predictor of disease to either texture rating or diagnostic certainty. This study reveals the SPS to be a promising but incomplete candidate for machine-algorithm generated diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{consists}} of collecting and analyzing experimental data {{to determine the}} Darcy-Weisbach friction factor for 6 -inch and 4 -inch PERMASTRAN¬Æ pipes and the head losses due to RING-TITE filament-wound 6 -inch 90 ¬∞ elbows, a 6 x 6 -inch tee under several modes of operation, and a 6 x 6 x 4 -inch tee with the flow entering a 6 -inch branch and leaving through the 4 -inch branch. The test program consisted of 8 series of individual tests with each series giving data for flow rates for each series ranging from 150 gpm to either 1200 gpm or 1500 gpm depending upon the series. The analyses of data to determine the friction factors head losses in both the 6 -inch and 4 -inch PERMASTRAN¬Æ pipe indicate that the values fall on a hydraulically smooth curve of the Moody diagram for the range of Reynolds numbers tested. The same friction factors exist for the PVC pipe used in the tests because each has the same polyvinylchloride inside wall material. Head losses for these 6 -inch and 4 -inch pipes over a range of Reynolds numbers are given in Table 8. The coefficient of head loss due to the 6 -inch RING-TITE filament-wound 90 ¬∞ elbow equals 0. 5 and this value is constant over the range of Reynolds numbers of the tests. The average coefficient of head loss caused by the 6 x 6 x 6 -inch RING-TITE filament-wound tee when operating as a 90 ¬∞ elbow (i. e. with the pipe in one ‚Äústraight through‚Äù branch plugged) equal 1. 5 with slightly larger values at smaller Reynolds numbers. The average coefficient of head loss caused by the 6 x 6 x 4 -inch RING-TITE filament-wound tee when operating in this same mode (flow leaving through 4 -inch branch) equals 1. 6 when based on the velocity head in the 4 -inch pipe and 6. 9 when based on the velocity head in the 6 -inch pipe. The head losses in the 6 x 6 x 6 -inch tee were also measured with the tee operating to separate the flow coming {{into one of the}} ‚Äústraight through‚Äù branches into two outflows. The head loss coefficients which measure the head loss between the two ‚Äústraight through‚Äù branches plot against Reynolds number as a straight line on <b>log-log</b> <b>paper.</b> The head loss coefficients which measure the head loss between the ‚Äústraight through: inlet and the branch 90 ¬∞ therefrom are larger than the previous coefficients and tend toward constant values at the higher Reynolds number of the tests. A summary of these head loss coefficients is given on Fig. 15. In addition the head losses in the 6 x 6 x 6 -inch tee were measured with the flow coming into two branches of the tee and being combined into a single outflow from one branch. The combined outflow was passes through one of the ‚Äústraight through: branches with the inflows coming into the other ‚Äústraight through‚Äù branch and the branch at 90 ¬∞ therefrom. In this mode of operation the tee becomes a simple two branch manifold. The several head loss coefficients for this mode of operation to combine the flows are summarized on Fig. 16, but also vary with Reynolds number...|$|E

40|$|An experiment, utilising a {{condensing}} fluid as {{the heat}} source, {{was performed to}} determine the heat flux vs. temperature difference curve for transition pool boiling from a horisontal surface. The boiling cure was determined {{as a function of}} surface roughness, material, and cleanliness for n-pentane at atmospheric pressure. The results of the experiment show that the liquid contacts the solid heating surface in transition boiling. The burnout heat flux and the film boiling curve are independent of surface properties. For commercial heating surfaces, and probably provided that the combination of surface energies which exist do not result in spreading of the liquid on the solid heating surface, the location of the minimum point is independent of surface properties. It is concluded that transition boiling is a combination of unstable nucleate and unstable film boiling alternating at a given location on the heating surface. The heat transfer data in the transition region was found to be correlated by a straight line on <b>log-log</b> graph <b>paper</b> which connects the burnout point and the minimum point. The bubble spacing and growth rates in film pool boiling from a horizontal surface are shown to be determined by Taylor Hydrodynamic Instability for temperature differences near the minimum.
