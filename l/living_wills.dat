Section 1233 merely allows doctors {{to be paid for}} their time. However, between 30 percent and 45 percent of Americans believed in the death panel story. According to PolitiFact, private health insurance companies already ration health care by income, by denying health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions and by caps on health insurance payments. Rationing exists now, and will continue to exist with or without health care reform.|$|E

Nearly all scholars and societies around the world agree that voluntarily donating organs to sick people is ethically permissible. Although nearly all scholars encourage organ donation, fewer scholars believe that all people are ethically required to donate their organs after death. Similarly, nearly all religions support voluntary organ donation as a charitable act of great benefit to the community, although a few small groups, like the Roma (gypsies), oppose organ donation on religious grounds. Issues surrounding patient autonomy, <b>living</b> <b>wills,</b> and guardianship make it nearly impossible for involuntary organ donation to occur.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>living</b> <b>will</b> usually {{provides}} {{specific directives}} about {{the course of}} treatment healthcare providers and caregivers are to follow. In some cases a <b>living</b> <b>will</b> may forbid the use of various kinds of burdensome medical treatment.

The <b>living</b> <b>will</b> is used only if the individual has become unable to give informed consent or refusal due to incapacity. A <b>living</b> <b>will</b> can be very specific or very general. An example of a statement sometimes found in a <b>living</b> <b>will</b> is: [...] "If I suffer an incurable, irreversible illness, disease, or condition and my attending physician determines that my condition is terminal, I direct that life-sustaining measures that would serve only to prolong my dying be withheld or discontinued." ...|$|R

2500|$|Emanuel {{said that}} legalizing euthanasia, {{as was done}} in the Netherlands, might be counterproductive, in that it would {{decrease}} support for pain management and mental health care. However, Emanuel does support the use of Medical Directives to allow patients to express their wishes when they can no longer communicate. Ezekiel, and his former wife Linda Emanuel, an M.D. Ph.D. bioethicist and geriatrician, created the Medical Directive, which is described as more specific and extensive than previous <b>living</b> <b>wills</b> and is a third generation Advance Directive. He claims the Hippocratic Oath debunks the theory that opposition to euthanasia is modern. Emanuel said that {{for the vast majority of}} dying patients, [...] "legalizing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide would be of no benefit. To the contrary, it would be a way of avoiding the complex and arduous efforts required of doctors and other health-care providers to ensure that dying patients receive humane, dignified care." [...] Emanuel said that a historical review of opinions on euthanasia from ancient Greece to now [...] "suggests an association between interest in legalizing euthanasia and moments when Social Darwinism and raw individualism, free markets and wealth accumulation, and limited government are celebrated." ...|$|E

[...] An article on Time.com said that Emanuel [...] "was only addressing extreme cases like organ donation, where there is an absolute scarcity of resources ... 'My quotes were just being taken out of context.'" [...] A decade ago, when many doctors wanted to legalize euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, Emanuel opposed it. Emanuel said the [...] "death panel" [...] idea is [...] "an outright lie, a complete fabrication.

He said that Rush Limbaugh, Virginia Foxx, Newt Gingrich, Charles Grassley and other Republicans defended the death panel story only after Betsy McCaughey's editorials, and that some people at town hall meetings even wanted to [...] "keep government out of their Medicare," [...] a government run program.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that Luis Kutner (1908 - 1993) played an {{important}} role in the development of the <b>living</b> <b>will</b> (advance directive, Patientenverfügung). But it is not clear when he developed his concept. We have screened the Luis Kutner Papers,deposited at the Hoover Institution Archives at Stanford University to answer this question. We found out that in the second half of 1967, Kutner dealt intensively with the issue of euthanasia. On December 7, 1967, he delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the Euthanasia Society in New York and presented the concept of the <b>living</b> <b>will</b> to the audience. So Kutner surely was a pioneer in this field, but further research is necessary to clarify, if he (or maybe Elsa W. Simon or Abraham L.
