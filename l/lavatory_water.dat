The work time in this area is relatively short, causing the work pressure higher than other areas. It is not surprising that accidents and incidents are more potential to happen here. By identifying the hazard and risk, and then doing a risk analysis, the level of risk can be known using a qualitative method referring to the Australian/New Zealand Standard or AS/NZS 4360 : 2004. It is clear that the highest risks of ramp activities are noise, being struck by operational vehicles, and being squeezed by GSE equipment.

Kitchen sinks, tubs and showers usually have supply tubes built onto their valves which then are soldered or 'fast joint'ed directly onto the water supply pipes.|$|R

50|$|A {{large part}} of the ethos of the {{community}} is ecological sustainability. To this end, the new abbey was built with numerous features to enable and assist sustainable living. The buildings feature high grade insulation to minimise heat loss; the heating is powered by a biomass fuelled boiler. Electrical power is provided in part by photovoltaic panels, and solar water heating panels reduce the use of the boiler during the summer months. In addition to harnessing solar energy, the new buildings also harvest rain water, which is stored in a 5000 litre tank and is used to flush the <b>lavatories</b> and <b>water</b> the kitchen garden; there is a further 45000 litres available for fire-fighting. The wastewater from the site is treated in a bio-digester and consequently the buildings are not connected to the sewage network. Much of the community's vegetables are grown onsite in the kitchen garden, and once the orchard has developed, it will further reduce the need to buy in fruits and vegetables. Both the kitchen garden and orchard are managed using eco-friendly means.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} {{were made to}} the Naval Offices during Commonwealth ownership. February 1933 plans included the addition of a first floor rear verandah with an enclosed laundry and new stairs from the side yard. At the same time the first floor was converted into a residence for the Senior Naval Officer, and the large space was partitioned into domestic rooms. The internal stairway from the main ground floor hall was removed, so the upstairs residence could only be accessed from the old Brigade Entrance or the new rear verandah. Two sets of French doors plus a single door were installed between the verandah and the residence. A [...] "typiste" [...] (typists) room was added to the north-west end of the original ground floor rear verandah, and a new lavatory was added behind the strong room. Further additions in late 1939 resulted in a new office, <b>lavatory</b> and <b>water</b> closet (WC) being built behind the strong room, replacing the 1933 lavatory. Two other WCs were also built sometime between 1933 and 1939 on and adjacent to the rear verandah.|$|R

According to Claims Magazine in August 2000, broken water pipes ranked second to hurricanes in terms of both the number of homes damaged and the amount of claims (on average $50,000 per insurance claim) costs in the US.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Parasitic {{diseases}} {{are one of}} the major hygienic and economic problems in most of the developing countries and dealing with them {{is one of the most}} important parts of the national development programs in these countries. In the current study, the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection, determination of its affecting factors in primary and secondary school students in Qom city, and providing necessary solutions to prevent it, were investigated. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 2410 students (age, 7 - 14 years) in primary and secondary girls and boys schools in Qom City. Data gathering tool included School Health Assessment Questionnaire and a questionnaire containing demographic data of the students and their parents' education level and occupation. Data were analyzed using Fisher and chi-square tests. The level of significance was set at p< 0. 05. Results: Of 2140 students, 48. 54 % were female and the rest were male. The Overall prevalence of parasitic diseases in Qom city was estimated to be 11. 99 %, which was 12. 86 % in the primary school students and 10. 71 % in secondary school students, and was higher in boys compared to girls. The type of parasitic infection in 42. 56 % of caseswas Entamoeba coli, 37. 37 % Giardia, 6. 23 %, Entamoeba histolytica, 4. 5 % Enterobius vermicularis, and 2. 08 % Hymenolepis nana.
