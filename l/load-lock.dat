5000|$|The discs pass, {{one at a}} time, {{into the}} metaliser, a small chamber at {{approximately}} 10−3 Torr (130 mPa) vacuum. The process is called 'sputtering'. The metaliser contains a metal [...] "target" [...] — almost always an alloy of (mostly) aluminium and small amounts of other metals. There is a <b>load-lock</b> system (similar to an airlock) so the process chamber can be kept at high vacuum as the discs are exchanged. When the disc is rotated into the processing position by a swivel arm in the vacuum chamber, a small dose of argon gas is injected into the process chamber and a 700 volt DC electric current at up to 20 kW {{is applied to the}} target. This produces a plasma from the target, and the plasma vapor is deposited onto the disc; it is an anode - cathode transfer. The metal coats the data side of the disc (upper surface), covering the pit and lands. This metal layer is the reflective surface which can be seen on the reverse (non label side) of a CD. This thin layer of metal is subject to corrosion from various contaminants and so is protected by a thin layer of lacquer.|$|E

The sys-tem is compact, making it capable of being mounted onto and de-mounted from an SEM through the specimen-exchange chamber (<b>load-lock)</b> without breaking the high vacuum of the SEM. This ad-vance avoids frequent opening of the high-vacuum chamber, thus, incurs less contamination to the SEM, avoids lengthy pumping, and significantly eases the exchange of end effectors (e. g., nanoprobes and nanogrippers). The system consists of two independent 3 -DOF Cartesian nanomanipulators driven by piezomotors and piezoac-tuators. High-resolution optical encoders are integrated into the nanomanipulators to provide position feedback for closed-loop control.

The substrates were then transported to the second deposition chamber for the TiB{sub 2 } and Ti-B-C-N depositions. In the second deposition chamber, two 5 inch x 20 inch TiB{sub 2 } targets were mounted on both sides. For the TiB{sub 2 } deposition, argon was introduced into the chamber.

The system con-sists of a growth chamber evacuated by a turbomolecular pump ~TMP!, a dry pump ~DRP!, and a <b>load-lock</b> chamber. The base pres-sure of the growth chamber is about 1 3 1028 Pa. The substrates were heated using a halogen lamp for infrared heating, and the tem-perature was monitored and controlled by an optical pyrometer whose output signal was coupled to the control unit of the heating lamp system. The temperature monitored by the pyrometer was cali-brated using a Pt-Pt Rh ~ 13 %! thermocouple.
