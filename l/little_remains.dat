5|$|The {{estate was}} requisitioned by the War Ministry from 1940–1945 {{as a local}} command, training, and {{ordnance}} centre. <b>Little</b> <b>remains</b> at the estate from World War II, except the hole created by a bomb dropped by the Luftwaffe. It was enlarged and is now used for swimming and canoeing.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{destruction}} after 1789, very <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of the Bastille in the 21st century. During the excavations for the Métro underground train {{system in}} 1899, {{the foundations of}} the Liberté Tower were uncovered and moved to the corner of the Boulevard Henri IV and the Quai de Celestins, where they can still be seen today. The Pont de la Concorde contains stones reused from the Bastille.|$|E

5|$|Minor {{alterations}} {{were made}} by the Caliphs Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1009 and Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah in 1125. The Caliph al-Hafiz (1129–1149) made significant further changes, adding a fourth arcade with keel arches, and a dome with elaborate carved stucco decorations in front of the transept. Since then, the mosque has been greatly enlarged and modified over the years. Of the original building <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> other than the arcades and some of the stucco decoration.|$|E
5|$|Nordberg Station {{was located}} in the steep road named Borgestadveien, that passed the station in a level crossing. The station served the local senior center named Nordberghjemmet, and was the most used of all {{stations}} among residents living in Nordberg. After the 1992 closure, very <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> from the station, aside from a pedestrians' underpass.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known fortifications in Malta are defensive walls {{built around}} Bronze Age settlements. The Phoenicians, Romans and Byzantines built {{a number of}} defensive walls around important settlements, but very <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of these survive today. By the late medieval period, the main fortifications on Malta were the capital Mdina, the Cittadella on Gozo, the Castrum Maris and a few coastal towers or lookout posts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Little</b> now <b>remains</b> of {{the castle}} other than the massive earthworks.|$|R

5|$|Walter {{established}} Tintern Abbey as a Cistercian monastery on 9 May 1131, {{the second}} Cistercian monastic {{house to be}} endowed in Britain. The monks for the establishment came from L'Aumône Abbey in France. Although the ruins of Tintern were {{the subject of a}} poem by William Wordsworth and a painting by J. M. W. Turner, these ruins are not Walter's original buildings, as <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of them.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only about}} half of Volubilis has been excavated, a number of {{prominent}} public buildings are still visible and some, notably a basilica and a triumphal arch, have been reconstructed. Many private buildings, including the mansions of the city's elite, have also been uncovered. They are especially notable for the fine mosaics that have been discovered in a number of buildings and which are still in situ in the houses where they were laid. The buildings were mostly made from locally quarried grey-blue limestone. Very <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of the original Punic settlement, as it lies under the later Roman buildings.|$|E
5|$|Ashbrook has {{compared}} the surviving autograph scores of L'ange de Nisida and La favorite to determine precisely how much material L'ange {{provided for the}} latter. While the events in L'ange are set in 1470 in Nisida and Naples, La favorite is set in Santiago de Compostela and Castile, both in Spain, prior to 1350. Donizetti made fundamental changes to {{the first half of}} La favorite and <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of L'ange. The central conflict of the story involving the marriage and subsequent death is essentially the same from one opera to the other, and some of the character names are also similar or identical.|$|E

5|$|British anti-invasion {{preparations}} of the Second World War entailed {{a large-scale}} division {{of military and}} civilian mobilisation {{in response to the}} threat of invasion by German armed forces in 1940 and 1941. The British army needed to recover from the defeat of the British Expeditionary Force in France, and 1.5 million men were enrolled as part-time soldiers in the Home Guard. The rapid construction of field fortifications transformed much of the United Kingdom, especially southern England, into a prepared battlefield. The German invasion plan, Operation Sea Lion, was never taken beyond the preliminary assembly of forces. Today, <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of Britain's anti-invasion preparations; only reinforced concrete structures such as pillboxes are commonly found.|$|E
5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>remains</b> of {{the eastern}} walls, but in the {{north-east}} corner several towers still remain largely intact, including Polymond tower, a powerful drum tower largely reconstructed during the Victorian period. Further west is the Bargate; this was originally a simple archway but was expanded with drum towers and arrow slits in the early 14th century, and then expanded again in the early 15th century with battlements and parapets, before being heavily restored in the 19th century. The Bargate remains an elaborate building, taking military symbolism and combining it with rich civic heraldry and decoration above the gateway.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other of}} the endemic species of Rodrigues became extinct after the arrival of man, so the {{ecosystem}} of the island is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> today due to deforestation. The Rodrigues solitaire lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the Rodrigues rail, the Rodrigues parrot, Newton's parakeet, the Rodrigues starling, the Rodrigues owl, the Rodrigues night heron, and the Rodrigues pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise, the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise, and the Rodrigues day gecko.|$|E

5|$|The inner ward is {{guarded by}} four large {{circular}} towers. Over time these acquired various names: in 1343, clockwise from the north-east, {{they were called}} Le Prisontour, Turris Ultra Gardinium, Le Wedercoktour and Le Chapeltour, but by 1564 they had been renamed the Debtors', Mortimer, Bronwen and Armourer's Towers respectively. Le Prisontour incorporated a dungeon and the Le Chapeltour may have contained an artillery workshop in the 16th century. Several ranges of buildings were built around the inner ward, including a chapel, kitchen, service buildings, a granary and a great hall. The battlements may originally have been built with triple finials {{in a similar fashion}} to Conwy, although <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of these in the modern era.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.|$|E

50|$|Lochlea 1 & 2 collieries were {{situated}} {{in the vicinity of}} the farm and operated from 1949 to 1973. <b>Little</b> visible <b>remains</b> survive.|$|R
5|$|Very <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of the {{installations}} {{along the}} former inner German border. At least 30public, private and municipal museums along the old line present displays {{of equipment and}} other artifacts relating to the border. Among the preserved sites are several dozen watchtowers, short stretches of the fence and associated installations (some {{of which have been}} reconstructed), sections of the wall still in situ at Hötensleben and Mödlareuth, and a number of buildings related to the border, such as the GDR crossing point at Marienborn.|$|E
5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the U.S. ice trade {{employed}} an estimated 90,000 people in an industry capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms), using ice houses capable of storing up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) each; Norway exported a million tons (910 million kg) of ice a year, drawing on a network of artificial lakes. Competition had slowly been growing, however, in the form of artificially produced plant ice and mechanically chilled facilities. Unreliable and expensive at first, plant ice began to successfully compete with natural ice in Australia and India during the 1850s and 1870s respectively, until, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, more plant ice was being produced in the U.S. each year than naturally harvested ice. Despite a temporary increase in production in the U.S. during the war, the inter-war years saw the total collapse of the ice trade around the world. Today, ice is occasionally harvested for ice carving and ice festivals, but <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> of the 19th-century industrial network of ice houses and transport facilities.|$|E
