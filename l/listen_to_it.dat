5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

He has a wonderful, {{beautiful}} face, a high forehead, prominent over the eyes; a long delicate nose, with little, red, nostrils; a strange mouth, never still & quite elusive; a square chin, slightly cleft in the middle — the whole face pale; the eyes grey-blue; the hair golden-brown, and curling in soft wavy crinkles.

25|$|A {{million people}} in our country and abroad like songs like Kalinka, Katyusha, Smuglyanka and the other songs of the {{military}} years as well as The Day of the Victory, Dark Eyes, Vecherny zvon and Podmoskovnye vechera. All these songs are known because of the Alexandrov folk song and dance company and {{people want to hear}} these songs at every concert. They are not just part of our history; they are great masterpieces.

Those audiences <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> standing up and it touches their hearts and souls.|$|E
25|$|The {{recording}} of its follow up, Play, {{took place during}} 1998 in Moby's Mott Street home studio in Manhattan, New York. At the time, Moby planned on making the album his last before ending his career. When he finished recording, {{there was no sign}} that the album would perform any differently than Animal Rights. According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label (from Warner Bros. to Sony to RCA) and was rejected every time. After V2 finally picked it up, his publicist sent the record to journalists, many of whom declined to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> According to manager Eric Härle in an interview with HitQuarters, their original goal was to sell 250,000 copies, which was what Everything Is Wrong, Moby's biggest-selling album at the time, had sold.|$|E

500|$|A {{powerful}} ballad; [...] Stephen Schwartz is a genius. You {{have to be}} a {{child of}} God to understand the depth of this song. Mariah and I did it as we felt it.

500|$|When {{asked what}} caused the {{explosion}} of the popularity of rock 'n roll {{that took place in the}} 1950s, with him and a handful of others, mainly him, Berry said, [...] "Well, actually they begin to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> you see, because certain stations played certain music.

500|$|Trademarks and {{characteristics}} that define Meshuggah's sound and songwriting include polyrhythms, polymetered riff cycles, rhythmic syncopation, rapid key and tempo changes and neo-jazz chromatics. Hagström notes that [...] "it doesn't really matter {{if something is}} hard to play or not. The thing is, {{what does it do}} to your mind when you <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>it?</b> Where does it take you?" [...] A trademark of Thordendal is jazz fusion-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a [...] "breath controller" [...] device. Haake is known for his cross-rhythm drumming with [...] "jazzlike cadence".

500|$|Lou Reed, {{who wrote}} the {{majority}} of the album's lyrics, never intended to write about such topics for shock value. Reed, a fan of poets and authors such as Raymond Chandler, Nelson Algren, William S.

An English major who studied for a B.A. at Syracuse University, Reed {{said in an interview that}} he thought joining the two (gritty subject matter and music) was [...] "obvious".
