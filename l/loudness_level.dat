2500|$|This {{practice}} (excessive compression, {{dynamic range}} reduction, <b>loudness</b> <b>level</b> enhancement, etc.) has been condemned by several recording industry professionals including Alan Parsons, Geoff Emerick (noted {{for his work}} with the Beatles from Revolver to Abbey Road), and mastering engineers Doug Sax, Steve Hoffman, and many others, including music audiophiles, hi-fi enthusiasts, and fans. Musician Bob Dylan has also condemned the practice, saying: [...] "You listen to these modern records, they're atrocious, they have sound all over them. There's no definition of nothing, no vocal, no nothing, just like—static." [...] The compact disc editions of Dylan's more recent albums Modern Times and Together Through Life are examples of heavy dynamic range compression, although Dylan himself {{might not have been}} responsible for it.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{effects on}} task {{performance}} and annoyance by aircraft and road traffic noise and attitudes towards these noise sources were {{addressed in a}} lab-setting. On day 1 of the study, participants performed a 3 -back working memory task in silence and with noise samples played over a headphone at four different <b>loudness</b> <b>levels.</b> On day 2, they filled out questionnaires on aircraft/road traffic-related attitudes and noise sensitivity. We hypothesized that attitudes would only affect task response times for noise samples with recognizable sources. For this reason unrecognizable noise samples were generated from the sound characteristics of an Airbus 320 flyover and of a road traffic recording and were used next to the original noise samples. Preliminary results showed no differences of attitudes on annoyance. For participants with negative attitudes towards the noise source, response times were rising with increasing <b>loudness</b> <b>levels</b> during recognizable samples, whereas response times decreased during unrecognizable samples when <b>loudness</b> <b>levels</b> rose. For the group with positive attitudes towards the noise source, reaction times seemed fairly stable across conditions. These results indicate that attitudes towards noise sources may mediate the effect of noise on cognitive tasks...|$|R

The airframe was pre-shaped to achieve a target ground under-track loudness of 76. 4 PLdB at cruise using an adjoint-based design optimization process. Aircraft and inlet performance characteristics were obtained by solution of the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Isolated cruise inlet performance including total pressure recovery and distortion were computed and compared against installed inlet performance metrics. Evaluation of vehicle near-field pressure signatures, along with under- and off-track propagated <b>loudness</b> <b>levels</b> is also reported. Results indicate the integrated axisymmetric spike design offers higher inlet pressure recovery, lower fan distortion, and reduced sonic boom. The vehicle with streamline-traced inlet exhibits lower external wave drag, which translates to a higher lift-to-drag ratio and increased range capability...|$|R
40|$|Methods of calculating steady {{loudness}} were examined. Loudness {{has been}} characterised as a psychoacoustic metric that closely matches {{the perception of}} sound intensity. Seven loudness model and four types of frequency filtering were considered, via the <b>loudness</b> <b>levels</b> of 80 dB tones over a range of frequencies. The <b>loudness</b> <b>levels</b> obtained from all combinations of the loudness models and filtering techniques were compared with the values from ISO 226 - 2003, an equal-loudness level standard.

The criticality of setting full-scale sound pressure levels as close to the measured levels as possible was demonstrated. Jury tests were performed for product sounds, in which both loudness and overall acceptability were evaluated.

P 1 peak latency significantly increased at soft and loud levels, and N 1 and P 2 latencies increased at all three levels {{in the presence of}} noise, compared with the quiet condition. P 1 amplitude was significantly larger in quiet than in noise conditions at the loudest level. N 1 amplitude was larger in quiet than in noise for the soft level only.

5000|$|According to Stevens' definition, a {{loudness}} of 1 sone {{is equivalent}} to the loudness of a signal at 40 phons, the <b>loudness</b> <b>level</b> of a 1 kHz tone at 40 dB SPL.

Rather, the loudness in sones is, at least very nearly, a power law function of the signal intensity, with an exponent of 0.3.

An analysis of physical features is generally {{used to analyze}} sound properties; however, human beings not only analyze but also emotionally connect to sounds.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} notion in our society {{that many of us}} are losing our hearing and that a primary cause may be {{exposure}} to loud sounds (Elias, 1991). The Journal of the American Medical Association (Noise and Hearing Loss, 1990) reported that of 28 million Americans who experience a hearing loss, approximately 10 million obtained the loss from exposure to loud sounds. Of particular concern are teenagers and others who listen to popular music styles; the contention is that many are listening to rock music at <b>loudness</b> <b>levels</b> that can damage hearing. The effects of high <b>loudness</b> <b>levels</b> may also be exacerbated by the use of headphones (Feldman & Grimes, 1991; Goldstein & Newman, 1994).
