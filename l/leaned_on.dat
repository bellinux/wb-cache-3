5|$|In foreign policy, the Vaasa Senate <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> the German Empire for {{military}} and political aid, in order to defeat the Finnish Red Guards, end the influence of Bolshevist Russia in Finland, and expand Finnish territory to Russian/East Karelia, which held geopolitical significance, and was home to people speaking Finno-Ugric languages (Irredentist campaigns/Heimosodat). The weakness of Russia induced an idea of Greater Finland among the expansive factions of both the right and left; the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed {{on the need to}} take over eastern Karelia and for German weapons, but opposed German intervention in Finland. Mannerheim recognized the lack of combat skills of the Finnish Red Guards, and he <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> the high military skills of the Finnish Jägers. As a former Russian army officer, Mannerheim was well aware of the demoralization of the Russian army. He co-operated with White Russian officers in Finland and Russia.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship {{underwent}} a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.|$|E
5|$|The monarchists <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> the Swedish regime's year 1772 monarchist constitution, belittled the Declaration of Independence 1917 and {{proposed}} a modernized monarchist constitution for Finland. The republicans {{argued that the}} 1772 law, accepted by Russia in 1809, lost validity in the February Revolution, the might of the Russian Czar was assumed by the Finnish Parliament on 15 November 1917 and Finnish republic was accepted on 6 December. The republicans were able to postpone processing of the monarchists' proposal in the parliament, {{and in the end}} a new monarchist constitution was not accepted in Finland. The monarchists responded by applying directly the 1772 law to select a new monarch for the country.|$|E

5|$|In {{foreign policy}} Red Finland <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> Bolshevist Russia. A Finnish-Russian Red treaty and peace {{agreement}} was signed on 1 March 1918. The negotiations for the treaty revealed, that, as in World War I in general, nationalism {{was more important}} for both sides than the principles of international socialism. The Red Finns did not accept alliance with the Bolsheviks and major disputes appeared e.g. over demarcation of the border between Red Finland and Soviet Russia. The bargaining sides exchanged land areas; an artillery base, Ino, located in the Karelian Isthmus, was transferred to Russia, while Finland received Petsamo in north-eastern Lapland. The significance of the Russian-Finnish Treaty evaporated soon, due to {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Bolsheviks and the German Empire on 3 March 1918.|$|E
5|$|The ninth day {{of racing}} {{resulted}} in a bunch sprint that was won by Sørensen. The next stage of the race was a forty-two kilometer individual time trial. Race leader Rominger won the leg by one minute and twenty-four seconds and increased his overall lead to three minutes over Casagrande, who was in second place overall. Enrico Zaina and Nelson Rodríguez Serna were the first two riders to reach the stage's final climb of Il Cioccio and the two stayed out in front until the finish which saw Zaina win the race to the line. With four kilometers left in the stage, Ugrumov and Berzin attempted to crack Rominger by attacking him repeatedly. After several attacks where the riders moves were marked, the riders agreed to ride to the finish together. The twelfth stage of the race saw the peloton arrive at the finish together ready for a bunch sprint. Cipollini originally won the stage but was relegated to last place on the stage after having {{been found to have}} <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> Mario Manzoni during the dash to the line. Ján Svorada, who had come in second, was then made the stage winner.|$|E

25|$|Dorsiflexion: In {{order to}} stretch the {{anterior}} muscles of the lower leg, crossover shin stretches work well. This motion will stretch the dorsiflexion muscles, mainly the anterior tibialis, extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus, by slowly causing the muscles to lengthen as body weight is <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> the ankle joint by using the floor as resistance against {{the top of the}} foot. Crossover shin stretches can vary in intensity depending on the amount of body weight applied on the ankle joint as the individual bends at the knee.

25|$|When Porter's friend Ulysses S. Grant became {{president}} in 1869, he appointed Philadelphia businessman Adolph E. Borie as Secretary of the Navy. Borie {{had no knowledge}} of the navy and little desire to learn, so he <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> Porter for advice that the latter was quite willing to give. In a short time, Borie came to defer to him even on trivial routine matters. Porter used his influence with the secretary to push through several policies to shape the navy as he wanted it; in the process, he made a new set of enemies who either were harmed by his actions or merely resented his blunt methods. Borie was strongly criticized for his failure to control his subordinate, and after three months he resigned. The new secretary, George Robeson, promptly curtailed Porter's powers.|$|E
25|$|Both guns {{have their}} own handles which are a mix between a pistol grip and a more usual shovel-handle type used in Maxim machine guns. Each handle has a trigger {{operated}} with a forefinger. Support bars protruded {{from the rear of}} the weapon that the gunner <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> to bear the weapon on target. The weapon was used on a 135cm high cone mount M/31 which, while it worked, was heavy and cumbersome to move. The sight was typical ring sight of the era, with an oval-shaped front sight with two consentric rings while the rear sight was a small peg surrounded by a protective ring. In action the anti-aircraft machine gun had an intended crew of six: commander, gunner, two loaders and two ammunition handlers. Equipment included a transport case for the weapon, spare barrels, locks and springs, toolkit and a wooden transport case for ten spare belt boxes.|$|E
25|$|In the 1810s, the town's churches {{intensified}} their {{discrimination against}} their black parishioners, culminating in Bethel Methodist's 1817 {{construction of a}} hearse house over its black burial ground. 4,376 black Methodists joined Morris Brown in establishing Hampstead Church, the African Methodist Episcopal church now known as Mother Emanuel. State and city laws prohibited black literacy, limited black worship to daylight hours, and required a majority of any church's parishioners be white. In June 1818, 140 black church members were arrested and eight of its leaders given fines and ten lashes; police raided the church again in 1820 and <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> it in 1821. In 1822, {{members of the church}} led by Denmark Vesey, a lay preacher and carpenter who had bought his freedom after winning a lottery, planned a uprising and escape to Haiti—initially for Bastille Day—that failed when one slave revealed the plot to his master. Over the next month, the city's intendant (mayor) James Hamilton Jr. organized a militia for regular patrols, initiated a secret and extrajudicial tribunal to investigate, and hanged 35 and exiled 35 or 37 slaves to Spanish Cuba for their involvement. In a sign of Charleston's antipathy to abolitionists, a white co-conspirator pled for leniency from the court on the grounds that his involvement had been motivated only by greed and not by any sympathy with the slaves' cause. Governor Thomas Bennett Jr. had pressed for more compassionate and Christian treatment of slaves but his own had been found involved Vesey's planned uprising. Hamilton was able to successfully campaign for more restrictions on both free and enslaved blacks: South Carolina required free black sailors to be imprisoned while their ships were in Charleston Harbor though international treaties eventually required the United States to quash the practice; free blacks were banned from returning to the state if they left for any reason; slaves were given a 9:15pm curfew; the city razed Hampstead Church to the ground and erected a new arsenal which later formed the Citadel's first campus. The AME congregation built a new church but the city banned it and all black worship services in 1834, following Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion in Virginia. The estimated 10% of slaves who came to America as Muslims never had a separate mosque, although they were sometimes permitted beef rations in place of pork.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, the duo reunited {{again for}} three songs during Simon's two-night {{engagement}} at New York's Beacon Theatre. This led to meetings in 2008 and a reunion tour of Asia and Australia in June 2009.

[...] "I was terrible, and crazy nervous. I <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> Paul Simon and the affection of the crowd," [...] he told Rolling Stone several years later. Garfunkel was diagnosed with vocal cord paresis, and the remaining tour dates were postponed indefinitely. His manager, John Scher, informed Simon's camp that Garfunkel would be ready within a year, which did not happen, leading to poor relations between the two. Despite tensions, Simon continued to publicly wish his old friend Artie better health and gave him praises for his then angelic voice. Garfunkel regained his vocal strength {{over the course of the}} next four years, performing shows in a Harlem theater and to underground audiences.|$|E
500|$|Living {{near the}} Shawangunks during her college years, Hill pioneered many new free {{climbing}} routes. In 1984 at The Gunks she performed an on-sight first ascent of Yellow Crack (5.12c) and Vandals (5.13a); Vandals {{was the most}} difficult route on the East Coast at the time and the area's first climb of its grade. Her lead of Yellow Crack was a very dangerous ascent, her climbing partner at the time Russ Ruffa calling it [...] "one of the boldest leads I've ever seen... I had tried leading it. I knew you had to totally commit to doing the moves, otherwise the chance of surviving would be minimal. Those are the moments that really stand out—when you see someone totally on the edge." [...] It was her climb of Vandals that led Hill to reconsider her climbing style; rather than begin the climb again every time she fell or <b>leaned</b> <b>on</b> the rope for support, she hung on the rope in her harness to gain more information about the climb. As she writes in her autobiography, [...] "In one moment I had, to some degree, thrown out years of climbing philosophy... The subtle advantage of hanging on the rope to figure out the crux moves gave me the added information that helped me learn and eventually succeed on the route. The old style of climbing suddenly seemed rigid, limited, and contrived." [...] That year, she performed a series of impressive feats, leading Tourist Treat on-sight with only one fall, [...] "perhaps the most difficult first ascent in the north country at the time". She was arguably [...] "the best climber in the Gunks", as local climbing legend Kevin Bein called her, and [...] "no man was climbing significantly better" [...] than her.|$|E
