40|$|AbstractRetromode imaging with {{infrared}} lasers {{is a novel}} {{imaging method}} which has been {{made possible by the}} newly introduced confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Retromode imaging uses a <b>laterally</b> <b>deviated</b> confocal aperture with a central stop, which creates a shadow and allows deep retinal and retinal pigment epithelium changes to be visualized as pseudo- 3 -dimensional images. Its clinical value coupled with its simple, rapid, and noninvasive nature is increasingly appreciated. The combination of retromode imaging with conventional imaging methods such as fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography can help to precisely and comprehensively evaluate pathophysiologic features of retinal disorders. This review summarizes basic principles of imaging and retromode findings in various retinal disorders and is expected to guide future investigations of retromode imaging...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to reveal}} cutting {{characteristics}} of a 0. 5 mm thickness polycarbonate sheet subjected to a straight punch/die shearing. The punch/die clearance was varied to be 2 ∼ 20 % of the worksheet thickness. Also, the feed velocity of the punch was adjusted ranging from 0. 05 ∼ 1. 0 mm·s- 1. From experimental results, a crack initiated {{in the vicinity of}} a cutting tool corner was observed to be largely propagated into the bulk of the worksheet. This <b>deviated</b> <b>propagation</b> seemed to be affected by an in-plane/lateral unbalanced stress state in the worksheet. The variation of the feed velocity had almost no effect on the pattern of crack initiation and its propagation. In addition, the shearing problem was numerically studied by using a two dimensional FEM simulation to discuss about the crack propagation and the dependency of the cutting characteristics on the punch/die clearance...|$|R

40|$|Maritime {{traffic safety}} and {{capacity}} raise enormous attention nowadays, especially in ports and inland waterways with {{high traffic density}} and restricted waterway geometry. However, {{a limited number of}} factors is considered in existing maritime models. Especially influences of external factors (wind, visibility and current), vessel encounters and human factors on vessel behavior (speed, course and lateral position) have not been investigated. In order to provide insight into vessel behavior {{for the development of a}} new maritime traffic model, possible impacts from current and vessel encounters are investigated using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. In this paper, equidistant cross sections approximately perpendicular to the navigation direction are used to extract vessel speed, course and position from AIS data. These vessel behavior data together with corresponding data on external conditions, including wind, visibility and current from the Port of Rotterdam, form the basic data set of this analysis. Vessel behavior under weak external influences is defined as unhindered (or reference) behavior. Vessel behavior under strong current is compared to unhindered behavior to investigate the influence of current. In addition, encounters including overtaking and head-on, are investigated to study the influence of other vessels. Statistical analysis is carried out to investigate changing of vessel speed and lateral position during encounters. Analysis results show that current only has impact on vessel speed. Both vessels involved in overtaking change their speeds and deviate in lateral direction to avoid collision. However, vessels only <b>laterally</b> <b>deviate</b> without speed changing in head-on cases. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Halluces are long, broad and medially deviated, while the other toes are <b>laterally</b> <b>deviated</b> and remarkably short with hypoplastic phalanges. She also showed developmental delay, seizures, lack of eye contact, stereotypic and repetitive hand movements and sleep disturbances with breath holding. Prenatal and three independent postnatal karyotypes were normal. Array-CGH analysis allowed us to identify and characterize a "de novo" 2 q interstitial deletion of about 10. 4 Mb, involving segment between cytogenetic bands 2 q 24. 3 and 2 q 31. 1. The deletion was confirmed by quantitative PCR. About 30 children with 2 q interstitial deletion have been reported. The deletion described here is overlapping with 15 of these cases. We have attempted to compare the clinical features of our patient with 15 overlapping cases. The emerging phenotypes include low birth weight, postnatal growth retardation, mental retardation and developmental delay, microcephaly, and peculiar facial dysmorphisms. Peculiar long and broad halluces with an increased distance {{between the first and}} the second toe are ("sandal gap" sign) present in most of the described patients. The gene content analysis of the deleted region revealed the presence of some genes that may be indicated as good candidates in generating both neurological and dysmorphic phenotype in the patient.

There is an angulation of the great toe away from the midline of the body, which may ride under or over the lesser digits. Root described HAV has a progressive subluxation of the first metatarsoªphalangeal joint in which the first metatarsal inverts relative to the hallux, followed by subluxation of the hallux into valgus. Abduction of the hallux is followed by subluxation of the first ray and adduction of the first metatarsal, increasing the inter metatarsal angle Mann and Coughlin described HAV as a static subluxation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, with medial deviation of the first metatarsal and lateral deviation of the great toe. Gerbert defined HAV as a hallucal relationship to the first metatarsal head, encompassing deviations of the entire MPJ, in all three planes. HAV is, in fact, a triplanar deformity lying on the frontal, transverse and sagittal planes. • Frontal plane: valgus rotation of the hallux rotated so that its plantar aspect is more prominent laterally. • Transverse plane: hallux is <b>laterally</b> <b>deviated</b> toward lesser toes. • Sagittal plane: hallux is rotated with dorsal or plantar deviation.

We describe a new lacrimal sac anomaly of lacrimal intrasaccal cyst, {{which has not}} yet been reported. A 31 -year-old woman was referred for epiphora in her left eye for 17 years. She also presented with a 10 -year his-tory of a palpable mass below the medial canthal tendon. The lacrimal system was patent on irrigation. In computed tomographic (CT) dacryocystography (DCG), a soft ovoid mass of 25 mm was found in the lacrimal sac fossa, and the lacrimal passage was compressed and deviated anteri-orly (Fig. 1 A and 1 B). DCG revealed a patent but <b>laterally</b> <b>deviated</b> lacrimal drainage passage (Fig. 1 C). After subcili-ary incision, an enlarged lacrimal sac was identified and dissected. After lacrimal sac incision, serous fluid gushed out from a blind sac on the periosteal side of the lacrimal sac. The internal common punctum and the lateral lacri-mal sac wall were identified after excision of the lateral wall of the cyst. The cyst and the lacrimal sac shared a common wall along the entire length between them. Exter-nal dacryocystorhinostomy was performed after cyst exci-sion.

40|$|International audienceTo {{understand}} social interactions, we must decode dynamic social {{cues from}} seen faces. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) {{to study the}} neural responses underlying the perception of emotional expressions and gaze direction changes as depicted in an interaction between two agents. Subjects viewed displays of paired faces that first established a social scenario of gazing at each other (mutual attention) or gazing <b>laterally</b> together (<b>deviated</b> group attention) and then dynamically displayed either an angry or happy facial expression. The initial gaze change elicited a significantly larger M 170 under the deviated than the mutual attention scenario. At around 400 ms after the dynamic emotion onset, responses at posterior MEG sensors differentiated between emotions, and between 1000 and 2200 ms, left posterior sensors were additionally modulated by social scenario. Moreover, activity on right anterior sensors showed both an early and prolonged interaction between emotion and social scenario. These results suggest that activity in right anterior sensors reflects an early integration of emotion and social attention, while posterior activity first differentiated between emotions only, supporting the view of a dual route for emotion processing. Altogether, our data demonstrate that both transient and sustained neurophysiological responses underlie social processing when observing interactions between others...|$|R

We suggest that the knee should be fully extended for imaging. Moreover, quadriceps should be at rest as the muscle contraction may impact TT-TG measures. If the knee is not fully extended this should be taken in account. Data in adults indicate that as the knee is flexed the TG <b>deviates</b> <b>laterally</b> in relation to the starting point when the knee is in extension (Iranpour et al. 2010).

Those trajectories called knuckleballs are also observed on volleyball and baseball. We study experimentally indoor knuckleballs for different balls varying from soccer balls to smooth spheres. We show that knuckle effect doesn't derive from ball deformations at foot impact or ball seams. Actually, aerodynamic lift forces on a smooth sphere are fluctuating and are responsible for knuckleballs.

40|$|Este trabalho {{experimental}} propõe uma nova e eficiente técnica para in-trodução de parafuso no processo articular cervical, com menor risco. Utilizando um novo dispositivo e determinando o comprimento efetivo médio do parafuso. Foram usadas cinco colunas cervicais de esqueleto humano de C 3 a C 7, num total de 25 vértebras e 50 perfurações. Foram selecionados dois grupos de vértebras: um de C 3 a C 6, outro de C 7. No primeiro grupo, o ponto inicial do parafuso situou-se a 2 mm. mediais e caudais do ponto central do processo articular, dirigindo-se a ponta do parafuso a 21, 5 º no sentido cranial. No outro grupo, o ponto inicial foi localizado a 2 mm. da linha média vertical, logo abaixo da superfície articular superior, dirigindo-se a ponta do parafuso a 16, 5 º no sentido caudal. Em ambos os grupos, o parafuso foi desviado lateralmente a 42, 5 º. Concluímos que a nossa técnica é eficiente e segura porque: 1) utiliza um dispositivo que mede o ângulo de introdução do parafuso, bloqueando-o após a ultrapassagem da cortical anterior, introduzindo somente o comprimento ideal para cada processo articular, diminuindo o risco de lesão; 2) não causa lesão da artéria vertebral e da raiz nervosa; 3) apresenta baixa incidência de violação da superfície articular, 7, 5 % nas vértebras C 3 a C 6 e 0 % nas C 7; 4) apresenta um comprimento efetivo do parafuso de 10, 7 mm. para ambos os grupos vertebrais oferecendo boa fixação óssea e boa margem de segurança, em relação às estruturas anatômicas importantes. This experimental paper {{presents a}} new and efficient technique to insert a screw in the cervical lateral mass with the less risk of damaging the vertebral artery, the nerve root and the articular facet. This procedure is carried out by using a new device which measures the screw insertion angle and lock the screw after it goes through the posterior cortical area. This paper also aims at determining the effective screw length {{to be used in}} this technique. Five human lower cervical spines from C 3 to C 7 - were used. Two holes were made in both sides of these 25 vertebrae. Therefore 50 holes were made. Two vertebrae groups were selected: C 3 -C 6 and C 7. In the C 3 -C 6 group the start point of the screw was placed in a medial and caudal position 2 mm. in relation to the central point of the articular prossece; the screw tip was directed to the half of the lateral vertebral line at a 21, 5 ° angle in the cranial direction; for the C 7 vertebrae the screw initial point was placed at a 2 mm. medial position in the vertical mean line just below the upper articular level; the screw tip was directed to the half of the lateral vertebral line at a 16, 5 ° angle in the caudal direction. In both vertebral groups the screw was <b>laterally</b> <b>deviated</b> at a 42, 5 ° angle. The conclusion is that this new technique is efficient and safe because: 1) it utilizes a new device to guide and measure the screw insertion and lock the screw after it goes through the posterior cortical area; the in-sertion is thus adequate for each specific lateral mass and decreases the risk of damage to the vertebral artery and to the nerve root; in fact it did not occur in both vertebral groups; 2) it presents a low rate of articular facet violation; 3) it presents a 10, 7 mm. screw length which is effective for both vertebral groups; 4) therefore there occurs a good bone fixation and the important anatomic structures are preserved...|$|R

For instance, during prism exposure, which <b>deviates</b> <b>laterally</b> our visual field, we progressively correct movement errors by combining sensory feedback with forward model sensory predictions. However, very often we project our actions to the external environment without physically interacting with it (e. g., mental actions). An intriguing question is whether adaptation will occur if we imagine, instead of executing, an arm movement while wearing prisms. Here, we investigated prism adaptation during mental actions. In the first experiment, participants (n =  54) performed arm pointing movements before and after exposure to the optical device. They were equally divided into six groups according to prism exposure: Prisms-Active, Prisms-Imagery, Prisms-Stationary, Prisms-Stationary-Attention, No Conflict-Prisms-Imagery, No Prisms-Imagery. Adaptation, measured by the difference in pointing errors between pre-test and post-test, occurred only in Prisms-Active and Prisms-Imagery conditions. The second experiment confirmed {{the results of the}} first experiment and further showed that sensorimotor adaptation was mainly due to proprioceptive realignment in both Prisms-Active (n =  10) and Prisms-Imagery (n =  10) groups.

The present results are the first demonstration of prism adaptation by mental practice under prism exposure and they are discussed in terms of internal forward models and sensorimotor plasticity...|$|R

Even where the magnitude of lateral displacement of the vehicle is small (i. e. ‘drift’ rather than ‘pull’) such a condition would be considered unacceptable by manufacturers and customers. Steering ‘drift’ during braking can be caused by several factors, some of which relate to vehicle design and others to external influences such as road conditions. The study presented here examines the causes and effects of steering drift during straight-line braking. A comparative analysis is made between two types of vehicle model: one built with rigid suspension components and the other with flexible components. In both the cases, the vehicle behaviour is simulated during braking in a straight line, and responses including lateral acceleration, yaw rate, and lateral displacement of the vehicle are predicted and analysed under fixed steering control. Suspension/steering geometry characteristics, namely toe steer and caster angle, have been studied to understand how the effect of variations in these parameters differs in models with rigid or flexible components drift during straight-line braking. Results from both vehicle models show that differences between rigid and flexible components can affect the predicted steering drift propensity. The differences between the two models have emphasized the importance of using flexible (compliant) components in vehicle handling simulations to achieve better correlation between prediction and experiment...|$|R

In each propagation direction, the bulk waves propagate in isotropic materials with equal velocity at each angle of propagation. But in anisotropic materials, elastic waves propagate with a velocity which depends on direction. There are various studies on modelling of elastic waves in transversely isotropic composites.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracture}} initiation {{and near}} wellbore propagation {{is governed by}} complex failure mechanisms, especially in cased perforated wellbores. Various parameters affect such mechanisms, including fracturing fluid viscosity and injection rate. In this study, three different fracturing fluids with viscosities ranging from 20 to 600 Pa. s were used to investigate the effects of varying fracturing fluid viscosities and fluid injection rates on the fracturing mechanisms. Hydraulic fracturing tests were conducted in cased perforated boreholes made in tight 150 mm synthetic cubic samples. A true tri-axial stress cell was used to simulate real far field stress conditions. In addition, dimensional analyses were performed to correspond the results of lab experiments to field-scale operations. The results indicated that by increasing the fracturing fluid viscosity and injection rate, the fracturing energy increased, and consequently, higher fracturing pressures were observed. However, when the fracturing energy was transferred to a borehole at a faster rate, the fracture initiation angle also increased. This resulted in more curved fracture planes. Accordingly, a new parameter, called fracturing power, was introduced to relate fracture geometry to fluid viscosity and injection rate.

Methods:Fundus photographs of 4 eyes of 2 patients taken in retro-mode on the Nidek F- 10 SLO were graded independently by 6,experienced, masked fundus graders {{for the presence of}} retinal drusen, and compared to stereo colour fundus photographs taken with a Topcon TRC- 50 DX camera. Results:The mean number of retinal drusen detected in retro mode was 142. 96 +/- 60. 8, range 63 - 265, and on colour fundus photography mean of 66. 6 +/- 32. 6, range 26 - 177. All observers independently detected approximately twice as many drusen on retro-mode than colour fundus photography (p< 0. 0001, Student’s paired t-test). The statistical significance of interobserver variation in drusen detection was p= 0. 07 on colour fundus photography, and p= 0. 02 on retro mode (ANOVA). Conclusions:The retro-mode of the F- 10 camera uses infrared laser and an aperture with a modified central stop, with the aperture <b>deviated</b> <b>laterally</b> from the confocal light path. This forms a pseudo - 3 D image which is a new means of detecting abnomalites in the deeper retinal layers. Retro-mode imaging of retinal drusen using the F- 10 Nidek SLO is a highly sensitive technique for detecting and quantifying retinal drusen, and detected twice as many drusen than colour fundus photography. This small pilot study suggests that this novel type of imaging may have a role in the future detection and analysis of retinal drusen, a field that is likely to become increasingly important in future AMD prevention studies...|$|R

Two electroconductive rubber sensors were used to measure the dynamic changes of the length of the anterior transverse arch during walking. On the dorsum of the foot, one of the sensors was attached in the space between the 1 st and 2 nd metatarsal head (medial part), and another between the 2 nd and 5 th metatarsal head (lateral part). The subjects were asked to walk in barefoot and with the experimental shoes of different heel heights. The peak expansion of the medial part and the ground reaction force were compared with the barefoot walking and walking with the shoes. The point of the lateral component coinciding with time of the maximum peak of the medial part showed significant increase in amplitude when the heel was 6 cmor more indicating the lateral component acting medially. Two different types were observed in the dynamic changes of the medial part walking with shoes. One group (seven subjects) showed increase in peak expansion when the heel height was 6 cm or more. Whereas in the other (eight subjects) no such change was observed. Based on these findings, it is suggested that when the heel height is 6 cm or more, the counteraction of the lateral component of ground reaction force as well as type B feet together act on the big toe to <b>deviate</b> <b>laterally</b> and as a resultant hallux valgus deformity may develop in the long run...|$|R

We have studied the steps involved {{in the development of}} topographically-aligned maps of visual and auditory space in the ferret superior colliculus. Injections of fluorescent beads into the superficial layers showed that the projection from the contralateral retina displays topographic order on the day of birth (PO). Recordings made from these layers at the time of eye opening, approximately 1 month later, revealed the presence of an adult-like map of visual space. In contrast, the auditory space map in the deeper layers emerged gradually over a much longer period of postnatal life. In adult ferrets in which one eye had been <b>deviated</b> <b>laterally</b> just before eye opening, the auditory spatial tuning of single units recorded in the contralateral superior colliculus was shifted by a corresponding amount, so that the registration of the visual and auditory maps was maintained. Chronic application of the NMDA-receptor antagonist MK 801 disrupted the normal development of the auditory space map, but had no effect on the visual map in either juvenile or adult animals, or on the auditory map once it had matured. These findings indicate that visual cues may play an instructive role, possibly via a Hebbian mechanism of synaptic plasticity, in the development of appropriately tuned auditory responses, thereby ensuring that the neural representations of both modalities share the same coordinates. Changes observed in the auditory representation following partial lesions of the superficial layers at PO suggest that these layers may provide the source of the visual signals responsible for experience-induced plasticity in auditory spatial tuning...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an innovative methodology of describing propagation path of hydraulically induced fractures {{in the presence}} of pore pressure anomalies. Pore pressure anomalies can occur in different geological settings such as mud volcanoes, magmatic dykes, hydrothermal vents or fluid in faults. Also, many different physical processes may cause local non-uniform pore pressure distribution. The effect of non-uniform pore pressure (pressure anomaly) on propagation behaviour of single and multiple fractures is investigated by using a fully coupled poroelastic numerical model. A new technique, named mean rotation angle (MRA) is used to study the impact of evolved shear stresses on mixed-mode fracturing. MRA is a measure of potential deviation angle evaluated based on the average of normal and shear stresses at nodes located within a specified area near the fracture tip. The tempo-spatial variation of evolved shear stress which represents alteration of original orientation of principal stresses is correlated to the curvature characteristics of the pressure source. It is shown that minimum shear stress variation is consistently correlated to the minimum principal curvature of the pore pressure in semi- 3 D superficies. From the results of this thesis it is concluded that presence of induced or in-place pore pressure anomalies in a medium can change the stress state such that the dominant direction of <b>propagation</b> <b>deviates</b> from the straight course. In the case of single fracture, a closely spaced circular zone of anomalous pore pressure is considered. Non-uniform variation of pore pressure results in alteration of original stress state at the fracture tip and prompts fracture deviation. Finally, the concept of pore pressure induced stress reorientation is evaluated in the case of closely spaced multiple transverse fractures. Three distinct flow patterns and three associated shear stress patterns have been identified during simultaneous pressurization of a pair of parallel fractures. These patterns are clearly exhibited three distinct trends of the calculated mean rotation angle representing different fracture deviation tendency. The results show the significance of considering the spatial distribution pattern of pore pressure in evaluation of local stress reorientation. These implications can lead to development of next generation of hydraulic fracturing techniques which could control the propagation path of hydraulic fractures by inducing desirable local stress conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{rails and}} wheels {{subjected}} to severe rolling/sliding contact, large plastic deformations accumulate {{in the surface}} layer. This decreases the fatigue resistance of components and makes this layer prone to formation of common rolling contact related defects. In pearlitic steel railway components, accumulated plastic deformations result in microstructural changes which, in turn, lead to anisotropic characteristic of properties like fracture toughness. The aim of the thesis is to investigate the influence of material anisotropy on damage mechanisms of pearlitic rail steels subjected to rolling/sliding contact. The interaction between the pearlitic microstructure and cracks in the surface layer of rail samples is studied. Based on microstructural investigations, an anisotropic fracture surface model is proposed {{to account for the}} directional dependence of resistance against crack propagation. The fracture surface model is employed in a computational framework where propagation of planar cracks is simulated. The simulation results show that the degree of anisotropy in the surface layer has a significant influence on the crack propagation path. In particular isotropic material characteristics will result in crack propagation towards the surface. This is a fairly benign type of fracture as compared to the transversal rail breaks that may result if the <b>propagation</b> <b>deviates</b> into the bulk material. To include large plastic deformations and the resulting anisotropy in simulations, a hybrid micro-macromechanical material model for pearlitic steels is proposed. Results from High Pressure Torsion (HPT) tests were used to calibrate the model. In HPT tests, samples are deformed under similar loading conditions to that of the rail-wheel contact i. e. a high compressive force and simultaneous large torsional straining. The HPT deformation procedure is simulated in the commercial finite element package ABAQUS. Numerical results agree well with experimental data demonstrating the high potential of the proposed material model in analyses including large deformations of pearlitic steel. In addition, the influence of different homogenization techniques in the material model is investigated. Two models proposed for a pearlitic colony are calibrated against micro-compression test data. The macroscopic response of a 3 D model of pearlitic steel during simple shear deformation is compared with the response predicted by the developed hybrid material model. The hybrid model was found to give stress-strain responses that are qualitatively similar, but around 12 % lower in stress magnitudes compared to the other two models. This should be contrasted towards the superior computational performance of the hybrid model...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims at {{systematically}} {{studying the}} possibilities of minimising devastatingconsequences of high-speed derailments by appropriate measures and features in thetrain design, including the running gear. The course of events immediately afterderailments is studied with respect to whether the train stays upright and close to thetrack centre line or <b>deviates</b> <b>laterally</b> with probably serious consequences. There is abelief in the railway community that some trains can better cope with derailment thenothers, although this superiority is apparently hard to quantify. Firstly, an empirical database has been established containing as much relevantinformation as possible of past incidents and accidents occurred at higher speeds due tomechanical failure close to the interface between the running gear and the track, as wellas other causes that ultimately brought the train into a derailed condition. Although nevertwo derailments are the same, certain patterns appeared to crystallise after analysing thecourse of events immediately after the failure based on the descriptions available in eachincident or accident report. Ultimately, this led to that several critical vehicle parameterscould be distinguished as capable to influence {{the outcome of a}} derailment. Secondly, two of the critical vehicle features found in the first stage have been subject todetailed analysis by means of multi-body system (MBS) simulations. The first phase ofthe computer simulation program focused on studying the tendency of a wheelset toderail {{as a result of an}} axle journal failure on the outside of the wheel. The prederailmentcomputer simulation model has been validated with good results for twoauthentic Swedish events of axle journal failure. Thereafter, one of the newly found critical vehicle feature, the wheelset mechanicalrestrictions relative to the bogie frame, have been extensively studied on an X 2000 power unit and trailer car model. The results show that a vertical mechanical restrictionof the wheelset relative to the bogie frame of approximately 50 to 60 mm is capable ofkeeping the wheelsets on the rails after an axle journal failure, for the studied conditions. An axle mounted brake disc constitutes the second critical vehicle feature that has thepotential to favourably influence the sequence of events in cases of wheel flangeclimbing. A minimal range of geometrical parameters for which the rail would safely fillthe gap between the brake disc and the wheel has been calculated. The third and last part of the thesis establishes the prerequisites necessary in order tostudy the remaining of the critical vehicle parameters found in the first part, whichrequires complete MBS simulations of derailed vehicles rolling on track structures, i. e. concrete sleepers. To accomplish this task, hysteresis data for the force as function ofconcrete material indentation, are aimed to be acquired by means of finite element (FE) simulations. Therefore, the intended FE model of wheel-concrete sleeper impact issubjected to a tentative validation procedure. A good agreement is observed whencomparing the FE model results with an authentic accident in terms of concrete sleeperindentation. Furthermore, preliminary results in terms of a wheelset tendency to reboundafter concrete sleeper impact are presented. QC 2010112...|$|R
40|$|This {{review is}} written in honor of Max L. Williams who not only started this International Journal of Fracture (the author’s Ph. D. advisor. Originally the Journal was called International Journal of Fracture Mechanics) but who had a seminally {{fundamental}} influence on the course of fracture mechanics in general, and specifically as applied to the time dependent failure of elastomers/polymers. In view of that background this article reviews developments over more than 50 years, as colored by my own experiences in regard to this topic. It seems appropriate to include a historical perspective that starts during pre-journal times and addresses the need for understanding time dependent processes governing fracture in rate sensitive materials. To the largest extent, the rate dependence is important where polymers are involved, though under more limited conditions metals and igneous solids as well as ligneous ones exhibit time dependent fracture characteristics. Such facts notwithstanding, the major discussion in this contribution is devoted here to the time dependent fracture of polymeric materials, and elastomeric ones in particular. The emphasis will be thus on time dependent issues governed primarily by the fracture processes in elastomeric solids, which have evolved largely in parallel to problems devoted to the more rigid polymers. Because consideration of fracture of the rigid polymers has often, if not usually, minimized the time dependence, only cursory {{attention is paid to}} these, {{in spite of the fact}} that they constitute a very important class of materials in the modern engineering community. From an engineering perspective this review is motivated also by an exposition of a persistent lack of knowledge concerning time dependent fracture issues. Most of the work attached to the notion of viscoelastic fracture is—intentionally or by omission—associated with the phenomenon of crack growth under steady state conditions with the expectation that this understanding leads implicitly to resolution of problems governed by transient loadings. Besides reviewing the historical evolution of the knowledge in this field over the past half century, it is a main purpose of this paper to offer information that has either been ignored or has not been explored (this includes the work of the author), but which contradicts this “popular” perception. It is thus an intentionally large part of this presentation which documents compelling motivation for addressing fracture aspects, that are generally important from an engineering design and analysis point-of-view: specifically, it is intended to illustrate the remarkable degree by which the steady state solution to crack <b>propagation</b> <b>deviates</b> from experimental information when transient conditions prevail, and the large range of time scales over which this failure behavior is observed...|$|R
