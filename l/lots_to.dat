5|$|Chambers {{continued}} {{to work as a}} surveyor in the 1840s while also engaging in land speculation. By 1850, he was promoted to district surveyor; he had, by then, acquired 10,000 acres of land in Navarro and Johnson counties. He devoted some of the land to farming, but also donated some <b>lots</b> <b>to</b> Johnson County for the erection of the county seat, in Cleburne. He became a lawyer in 1860, but never developed a sizable law practice. Chambers married three times: first in 1852 to Susan Wood, who died the next year; secondly in 1854 to Emma Montgomery, who died in childbirth the next year; and finally in 1861 to Harriet Killough. Chambers had no children who survived infancy with the first two wives, but with his third wife he would have three children: Mary, Patrick, and Isabella.|$|E

The military post far {{north of the city}} at Fort Bellefontaine moved nearer to the city to Jefferson Barracks in 1827, and the St. Louis Arsenal was built in south St. Louis the same year. The 1830s included dramatic population growth: by 1830, it had increased to 5,832 from roughly 4,500 in 1820. By 1835, it reached 8,316, doubled by 1840 to 16,439, doubled again by 1845 to 35,390, and again by 1850 to 77,860.|$|E
5|$|The Master Apartments' name {{derives from}} the Master Institute of United Arts, an art {{institute}} founded in 1920 by Nicholas and Helena Roerich. The institute's name, in turn, may have come either from Master Morya, a non-corporeal spiritual leader from whom Helena Roerich received guidance via automatic writing, or from Nicholas Roerich, a theosophist master. In 1925, wealthy financier Louis L. Horch, who funded the Roeriches' institutes and some other expenses, began purchasing <b>lots</b> <b>to</b> build the apartment building, and in 1928, secured a bond to fund its construction. Harvey Wiley Corbett; Helmle, Corbett & Harrison; and Sugarman & Berger constructed the Master Apartments, which opened in 1929 to generally positive acclaim. As built, the building's lower floors consisted of a museum; a school for the fine and performing arts; and an international art center.|$|E

The tunnel then turns south under 12th Street Northwest and enters the lower level of the Metro Center station. After Smithsonian station, the tunnel turns east under D Street Southwest and then southeast under Pennsylvania Avenue Southeast. At Potomac Avenue station, the tunnel briefly travels under G Street Southeast and then turns northwest under Potomac Avenue with a turn to the north to travel under 19th Street Southeast for the Stadium-Armory station. The tunnel then travels under the RFK Stadium parking <b>lots</b> <b>to</b> surface near Benning Road. The elevated tracks follow Benning Road across the Anacostia River and then split from the Blue and Silver lines. There is a pocket track just west of this split.|$|E
5|$|CenturyLink Field is {{bordered by}} the {{junction}} of Interstates 5 and 90 {{to the east and}} State Route 99 to its west. The State Route 519 corridor connects I-90 to the neighborhood. Local governments compromised with both the Seahawks and Mariners on the location of new ramps over the train tracks that run along the east sides of CenturyLink and Safeco Fields. An overpass for S Royal Brougham Way, the road that borders the south edge of the CenturyLink Field complex, to improve access and safety was completed in May 2010. The stadium has 2,000 parking spaces in its parking garage and 8,400 in the surrounding <b>lots</b> <b>to</b> accommodate automobile traffic. Beginning in December 2011, construction of the Stadium Place mixed-use development project replaced much of the north lot. The developer must replace the 500 lost parking spots and turn over parking revenue to the Public Stadium Authority per an agreement with King County.|$|E

Danielle Riendeau (Polygon) liked Monacos {{gameplay}} stating {{that it was}} fun with other people, but {{it seemed that the}} single-player mode needed work.

He stated that due to the gameplay and mechanics, {{it was one of the}} most unique and addictive games released in 2013. Scott Nichols (Digital Spy) said that the game contains <b>lots</b> <b>to</b> discover, but is best done cooperatively. Jeff Grubb (VentureBeat) praised the fact that the game works as both an arcade and a strategic game but said to skip it if the user wasn't planning on playing it cooperatively. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) liked the multiplayer mode more, but also praised the single-player mode calling it surprisingly compelling.|$|E

5|$|The 'Land Question', as it {{pertains}} to the history of Prince Edward Island, Canada, related {{to the question of the}} system of ownership of land on the island. Proprietors, the owners of the land parcels on Prince Edward Island, favoured a system of renting to tenants, whilst the tenants preferred a system of freehold. In 1767 the British government divided all land in Prince Edward Island into <b>lots</b> <b>to</b> be owned by 'proprietors' who would collect rent from the settlers, or 'tenants'. Problems soon arose with this scheme, and low numbers of tenants resulted in proprietors collecting little rent, which in turn led to many proprietors defaulting on their quitrents. An attempt at compulsorily acquiring the land by the Prince Edward Island government from rent defaulters in 1781 resulted in Colonial Office intervention in 1783. In 1786, Governor Walter Patterson, who set in motion the compulsory acquisition, was removed from office.|$|E
