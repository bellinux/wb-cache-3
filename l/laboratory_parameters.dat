50|$|Patients {{with asthma}} have higher eNO levels than other people.

50|$|Another {{subset of}} {{individuals}} who are persistently infected with HIV-1, but show no signs of disease progression for over 12 years and remain asymptomatic are classified as Long Term Non-Progressors (LTNP). In these individuals, it seems that HIV-infection has been halted with regard to disease progression {{over an extended period}} of time. However, the term LTNP is a misnomer as that progression towards AIDS can occur even after 15 years of stable infection. LTNP are not a homogeneous group regarding both viral load and specific immune responses against HIV-1. Some LTNPs are infected with HIV that inefficiently replicates whilst others are infected with HIV that is virally fit and replicates normally, but the infected individual has had a strong and broad set of HIV-specific humoral and cell-mediated responses that seems to delay the progression to AIDS. In some cohorts, individuals who experience signs of progression, but whose clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameters</b> remain stable over long periods of time, are classified as Long Term Survivors (LTS).|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{series on}} whole blood {{viscosity}} issues {{has been trying}} to elucidate the sensitivity, specificity and usefulness of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameter</b> in clinical practice. The postulation has been that since antiplatelet is used in the management of stasis, of which blood viscosity is an index, the latter would be useful laboratory indication and/or contraindication. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} observe whether blood level of acetylsalicylic acid differs with the level of whole blood viscosity. Patients and Methods: Out of the ten years database, 538 cases that were concomitantly tested for haematocrit, total proteins and blood level of salicylate were selected for this study. A separate nine cases of positive faecal occult blood tests were audited for blood viscosity and reviewed. Results: A statistically significant difference is observed with lower blood viscosity being associated with higher salicylate level in comparison of the former between the highest vs. lowest quartiles (p < 0. 002). This observation demonstrates the effect of aspirin in lowering blood stasis. Reviewing the positive faecal occult blood cases indicate that gastrointestinal bleeding is characterized by relative hypoviscosity and that hyperviscosity is not present during bleeding complications. Conclusion: The findings affirm that whole blood viscosity is a valid clinical <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameter</b> for evidence-based contraindication, indication and monitoring of antiplatelet medication. It calls for better appreciation and clinical utility of whole blood viscosity, which (in the absence of viscometer) can now be extrapolated from haematocrit and total proteins...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundDengue {{hemorrhagic fever}} (DHF) is {{considered}} to be associated with secondary dengue infection. This study was conducted to note frequency of primary and secondary dengue infection in DHF patients. Additionally these patients were compared in terms of age, gender, <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameter,</b> diseases severity and outcome. Materials and methodsIn this cross sectional observational study DHF patients fulfilling DHF criteria of Dengue Expert Advisory Group (DEAG) were included and divided into groups based on dengue specific IgG positivity and ratio of IgM to IgG. Group I, patients with secondary dengue infection were IgG positive or their ratio of IgM to IgG was 1. 2. The two Groups were compared for statistically significant association in terms of age, gender, <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameter</b> (at admission hematocrit [HCT], platelet, white blood cell [WBC] counts, alanine aminotransferase [ALT] value), severity (DHF or dengue shock syndrome), and outcome (recovered or expired). ResultsTwo hundred thirty-four DHF patients were included. 66. 2 % was male and 33. 8 % female. Mean patient age was 28. 8 ± 12. 4 years. Based on dengue markers results, 61. 5 % patients were categorized to Group I, and 38. 5 % to Group II. Statistically significant association between the two Groups was noted in terms of at admission platelet count, and ALT value, P value < 0. 05.

40|$|SummaryGlobalization has {{increased}} both {{the number of}} emergent diseases and the diversity of co-infections, which could in turn mutually influence the pathogenesis of well-known infectious diseases. Here, we report the first series of chronic human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) patients co-infected with the dengue fever virus. As both of these diseases are immuno-mediated, we anticipated interference {{in the development of}} both diseases, with atypical clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameter</b> results. All the patients had classic dengue fever, and the main outstanding abnormality was leukopenia associated with lymphopenia.

40|$|Background: Malnutrition {{is common}} among {{patients}} with inflammatory bowel disease. The present study aimed {{to investigate the}} nutritional status of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in Isfahan, Iran. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive analytical cross-sectional study, between Dec 2011 and Jun 2012, 99 patients with UC were randomly selected and evaluated. Age, sex, duration of disease, body mass index (BMI) and <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameters</b> recorded for all patients. Nutritional risk index (NRI) was calculated and its association with patients′ variables was assessed with regard to UC disease severity. Results: Twelve patients out of 99 patients had mild UC and 87 patients had moderate to severe UC. Based on the NRI, 90. 9 % were not malnourished and 9. 1 % were at moderate to severe risk for malnutrition. Among <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameters</b> only, serum potassium level in patients with moderate to severe UC {{was significantly higher than}} those with mild UC (P = 0. 017). Other <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameters</b> were similar between patients stratified by US status. Patients age s significantly correlate with serum vitamin D, immunoglobulin a (IgA) and potassium level (P > 0. 05), also duration of disease was significantly correlate with Phosphorus (P = 0. 024) among <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameters.</b> Conclusion: In studied UC patients, malnutrition risk was based on degree of disease severity. Patients with moderate to severe UC were more at risk for malnutrition compared to the patients with mild UC. Furthermore, among <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameters</b> only serum potassium level was higher among patients with moderate to severe UC compared to others...|$|E

40|$|Most risk-stratification {{instruments}} {{that have been}} developed to predict outcome after myocardial infarction do not make use of <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameters,</b> although several <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameters</b> have, been shown to be predictors of adverse outcome. To assess the prognostic value of routine admission laboratory tests, we studied a sample of 264 of 3, 746 patients with myocardial infarction from a coronary care unit database of 12, 043 patients for differences between survivors and nonsurvivors at 30 days. In multivariate analyses, higher white blood cell count, higher levels of serum creatinine, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase, and lower platelet count were identified as independent risk factors for 30 -day mortality. The model that incorporated these risk factors (added <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameters</b> model) had a 17 % higher predictive power than did the model that contained only conventional risk factors (conventional risk factor model). The added <b>laboratory</b> <b>parameters</b> model showed better discriminative ability than the conventional risk factor model according,to the area under the curve (0. 87 vs 0. 80). In conclusion, routine admission laboratory tests hold significant prognostic information, with value in addition to conventional risk factors. Incorporating these tests in risk-stratification instruments will further improve risk assessment of patients with myocardial infarction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
