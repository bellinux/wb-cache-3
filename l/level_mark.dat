5000|$|Canonized {{novels in}} British {{literature}} {{often do not}} recognize the historic context of their setting. In Wide Sargasso Sea, Jean Rhys {{draws attention to the}} colonialism and slave trade by which both Mr. Rochester and Antoinette made their fortunes. The novel does not shy away from uncomfortable truths about British history that had been neglected in Bronte’s narrative. Trevor Hope remarks that the “triumphant conflagration of Thornfield Hall in Wide Sargasso Sea may at one <b>level</b> <b>mark</b> a vengeful attack upon the earlier textual structure”. The destruction of Thornfield Hall occurs in both novels; however, Rhys epitomizes the fire as a liberating experience for Antoinette. If, then, Thornfield Hall represents domestic ideas of Britishness, then Hope suggests Wide Sargasso Sea is “taking residence inside the textual domicile of empire in order to bring about its disintegration or even, indeed, its conflagration.” ...|$|E

50|$|Following Tipu's {{death in}} 1799, the kingdom came under direct British rule in 1831.

He made Bangalore the capital and divided the princely state into 4 divisions, each under a British superintendent. The state was further divided into 120 taluks with 85 taluk courts, with all lower level administration in the Kannada language. The Amildar was in charge of a taluk to whom a Hoblidar, the caretaker of a Hobli comprising a few villages, reported. The office of the commissioner had eight departments; revenue, post, police, cavalry, public works, medical, the animal husbandry, judiciary and education. The judiciary was hierarchical with the commissioners' court at the apex, followed by the Huzur Adalat, four superintending courts and eight Sadar Munsiff courts at the lowest <b>level.</b> <b>Mark</b> Cubbon is credited with the construction of over one thousand miles of roads, hundreds of dams, coffee production and improvements in the tax and revenue systems.|$|E

50|$|The {{location}} {{of the city was}} then forgotten, and Phalasarna appears in Venetian records only as a lost city. The site was rediscovered in the 19th century by British explorers Robert Pashley and Captain T. A. B. Spratt. Spratt, of the Royal Navy, noted in 1859 that the former harbor of the deserted site was now 100 yards from the sea, and that the ancient sea coast must have risen at least twenty four feet. Modern excavation has confirmed this judgment, and also has shown that the harbor rapidly silted up after the Roman attack. Radiocarbon dating of fossil algae along the ancient sea <b>level</b> <b>mark</b> on the cliffs around Phalasarna estimates the sudden sea level change at some time more than sixteen centuries ago. A probable event was the great earthquake and tsunami of 21 July A.D. 365, which wreaked catastrophic damage on all the coasts of the eastern Mediterranean and was recorded by Ammianus Marcellinus and others. An ancient fish basin with two flights of steps carved into the coastal rocks near the harbor entrance has been cracked in half, probably during the same earthquake.|$|E

40|$|Large punctuational {{contribution}} of speciation to evolutionary divergence {{at the molecular}} <b>level.</b> <b>Mark</b> Pagel,* Chris Venditti, Andrew Meade (2006). Science, 314 (5796) 119 - 121. RAE 2008 A long-standing debate in evolutionary biology concerns whether species diverge gradually through time or by punctuational episodes {{at the time of}} speciation. We found that approximately 22 % of substitutional changes at the DNA level can be attributed to punctuational evolution, and the remainder accumulates from background gradual divergence. Punctuational effects occur at more than twice the rate in plants and fungi than in animals, but the proportion of total divergence attributable to punctuational change does not vary among these groups. Punctuational changes cause departures from a clock-like tempo of evolution, suggesting that they should be accounted for in deriving dates from phylogenies. Punctuational episodes of evolution may play a larger role in promoting evolutionary divergence than has previously been appreciated. Peer reviewe...|$|E
