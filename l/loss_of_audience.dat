5000|$|In the 1940s two new {{broadcast}} media, FM {{radio and}} television, began to provide extensive {{competition with the}} established broadcasting services. The AM radio industry suffered a serious <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> and advertising revenue, and coped by developing new strategies. Network broadcasting gave way to format broadcasting: instead of broadcasting the same programs all over the country, stations individually adopted specialized formats which appealed to different audiences, such as regional and local news, sports, [...] "talk" [...] programs, and programs targeted at minorities. Instead of live music, most stations began playing less expensive recorded music. However, the ongoing development of alternative, and superior, transmission systems, including Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), satellite radio, and HD (digital) radio, continued {{the decline of the}} popularity of the traditional broadcast technologies. These new options, including the introduction of Internet streaming, particularly resulted in the reduction of shortwave transmissions, as international broadcasters found ways to more easily reach their audiences.|$|E

Musicnet feared <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> due to the Metallica concert and after several days of negotiation, Metallica were booked to headline the second day of the FM4 Frequency festival.

Even Musicnet thanked the audience for being disciplined as they were and not panicking when they were stuck in the masses. According to many guests the situation was critical during a rain shower, when the audience was seeking shelter under the tent. It is rumoured that financially the festival was more of a break-even business than a success and Musicnet has refused to supply any information regarding this.|$|E

40|$|The {{argument}} of this thesis is that Finnegans Wake is a peculiarly appropriate text {{for an investigation}} of the academic discipline of English, and that the issue of readership {{is the best way to}} approach the Wake. The thesis, which is organised into three main sections, shows that both Finnegans Wake and the discipline of English Studies are similarly engaged in problems <b>of</b> defining <b>audiences.</b> The opening section shows that the Wake has long been seen as a limit to literature, and as a defining text of literary study. Reception theory proves unable to cope with a study <b>of</b> historical <b>audiences.</b> Finnegans Wake was written over a period roughly concomitant with the rapid professionalisation of English studies and underwent a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>audiences</b> except for its critical reviewers. The extended third chapter sets out in some detail the growth of English studies, both in itself and more specifically as a context for the name of Joyce in the 1930 s and beyond. This also includes analysis of the passage of the Wake in university syllabi. The second section considers post-structuralist claims that the Wake disrupts or subverts the space of the academy. It analyses a wide range of poststructuralist and other reactions to the Wake, and proceeds to a study of inscriptions of readership in the work of Derrida, and explores Derrida's idea <b>of</b> <b>audiences</b> for Joyce. The third section presents two readings of key elements of Finnegans Wake. Analysis of the letters, and of some of Joyce's sources, stresses the important role of the professor figures, which is indicative of the extent to which Joyce's last work was influenced by the professionalisation of literary study. Textual analysis proceeds with the Four, who function as an internal interpretive community. A brief conclusion sums up the {{argument of}} the thesis. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} rise of {{embedded}} branding (‘branded content’) since the early 2000 s, a funding model in which sponsors are integrated into media content. It examines its implications for {{the functioning of the}} media as a cultural public sphere. Located within the political economy approach, the research takes a critical perspective, arguing that ‘branded content’ is, in Habermasian terms, an act of manipulation. Two case studies of British and Israeli reality television shows were used to explore three questions: 1. How does the ‘branded content’ market work? 2. Are we witnessing a new phase of content commercialisation and if so, what are its characteristics? 3. What are the implications for the media’s functioning as a cultural public sphere and, consequently, how should regulators and policy makers cope with the phenomenon? The findings uncover a niche market in which branded content agents facilitate formal agreements between sponsors and producers. As both sides have the need to look for alternative funding models in a growingly fragmented reality, these co-operations typically start as ‘synergetic’, however their implementation often becomes rife with conflict. The data further suggests sponsors influence media content in two key ways. First, through ‘deep integration’: brands appearing through abstract and surreptitious representations in programming (rather than ‘classic’ product placement). Second, through ‘continuous integration’: the tendency of these agreements to encompass multiple platforms, and predominantly the Internet, which enables personal data collection. Embedded branding therefore should be seen as a new commercialisation phase, typical of the digital age, in which brands gain omnipresence in the cultural public sphere. The two main potential harms caused by these developments are first, the saturation of the media with manipulative messages by sponsors, which distorts the editorial process and threatens freedom of expression. The second relates to the gradual <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> trust in the media as a platform for public debate, which is the gravest threat ‘branded content’ presents {{to the role of the}} media in democracies...|$|E
40|$|After {{approximately}} 100 {{years of}} radio, {{it is inevitable}} that radio in Western countries not only survives but also develops, despite fierce competition with visual media. However, having competed with other media for more than 15 years, radio in Vietnam is experiencing a significant <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> (especially the youth, the well-educated, and the people in urban areas). It should be noted that due to a 30 year war and 20 years of embargo by the US and other Western countries, information about Western countries in general, and journalism in particular, was in short supply in Vietnam. For this reason, gaining experiences from radio's developments and its adaptability in Western countries - in order to apply these to Vietnamese radio - is an imperative need. However, at present, radio in Western countries has reached a significant turning-point, when a number of terminologies - which are used according to the radio's variants, including web radio, digital radio, and visual radio - have challenged the perceptions of radio which have been accepted for almost a century. The questions 'What is radio?', 'Is web radio 'radio'?' and 'Does web radio enhance radio development?' are contentious issues which have been discussed for some time without a conclusion. On the other hand, web radio has a significant impact on Vietnamese radio {{in the sense that it}} brings radio to the Internet community who are generally believed to be the young, well-educated and people in urban areas who listen to traditional radio the least. It is suggested that web radio is potential way to capture the neglected traditional radio listeners in Vietnam. From an historical point of view, this thesis will investigate the changes of radio in terms of technology, radio programming and ways of listening, in order to understand the development of radio from its inception to date. Moreover, radio will be placed in the context of the competition and interplay between mass media. This will be done in order to explore the contention that the existence and development of each medium depends not only on its own characteristics, but also on its ability to adjust itself to a new technological environment - as well as the ability to adapt methods and tools from other media to strengthen its position. It is contended that web radio is the product of the competitive and interactive environment in which it operates: and its characteristics can only be clarified with reference to those relationships between mass media systems. Having investigated the political, historical, sodo-economical and cultural contexts of radio and web radio in Vietnam, the thesis explores the ways in which modem radio theories and practices from Western countries can be applied to Vietnamese radio, and examines if web radio is a means to capture new audiences, particularly the groups who have neglected traditional radio. In order to achieve this aim, three major research methods will be applied: historical and secondary data; online and offline surveys and in-depth interviews of radio listeners, non-radio listeners, and web users about their habits of consuming media, the impact of the Internet on their habits, and their needs towards web radio also will be undertaken...|$|E

50|$|For a {{brief time}} in fall 2009, NBC {{followed}} a significantly different model in September 2009, following severe <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> for its scripted dramas. Jay Leno, formerly the host of NBC's long-running Tonight Show franchise, had moved his show to 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time, ahead of the local newscasts on most stations in a time slot that competes with CBS's and ABC's prime time programming (though Fox affiliates would have cut to post-primetime news or sitcom reruns by this time). Beginning in September 2009, Leno hosted The Jay Leno Show, which was mostly similar to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno with a few adjustments. This made way for Conan O'Brien (formerly the host of Late Night, another long-running NBC late night franchise) to take over The Tonight Show, while Jimmy Fallon has assumed hosting duties for Late Night. The remaining late night programs (Poker After Dark and Last Call with Carson Daly) remained as is, and NBC warned its affiliates not to preempt or delay Leno for local news. After affiliates' fears of significantly lower ratings for local news were in fact realized, NBC announced it would indeed cancel its 10:00 p.m. experiment and move Leno back to his traditional start time of 11:35 (originally by moving The Jay Leno Show, before rejoining as host of the latter show outright after O'Brien negotiated out of his contract with NBC due to problems over the network's original plan to shift Tonight a half-hour later {{to make room for}} Leno).|$|R

The term Jangam has been derived from the movable emblem of Lord Shiva. Jangam is a sub-caste of the Lingayat (Veerashaiva) community called Lingayath religion. The Jangams migrated from Karnataka and Andra Pradesh states of India in order to disseminate the Shaivaite cult and to act as priests {{for those who do}} not avail the services of Brahmans for performing religious rites in Lord Shiva temples. While performing Jangam dance, the dancers recite verses on the mythological marriage of Siva and Parvati. The recitation is done in a ritualistic hypnotic monotone.

Their dramatic presence is heightened by their headgear, a brass band with the image of a snake and peacock feathers flashing in the air.

5000|$|Mainstream {{pornography}} did {{not arrive}} in Japan until {{the advent of}} Pink film. Erotic films were called [...] "pink film" [...] because the color pink carries erotic and feminine connotations with the Japanese who associate pink with a woman's vagina.

Nudity and sex officially entered Japanese cinema with Satoru Kobayashi's controversial and popular independent production Flesh Market (Nikutai no Ichiba, 1962), which is considered the first true pink film.
