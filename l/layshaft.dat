25|$|The Range Rover used {{permanent}} four-wheel drive, {{rather than}} the switchable rear-wheel/four-wheel drive on Land Rover Series vehicles, and had a lever for switching ratios on the transfer box for off-road use. Originally, the only gearbox available was a four-speed manual unit, until Fairey overdrive became an option after 1977. A three-speed Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic gearbox became an option in 1982, which was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF box in 1985, coupled to an LT230 transfer box. The other major transmission upgrade in the Range Rover's lifetime was the switch from the LT95 combined four-speed manual gearbox and transfer box to the LT77 five-speed gearbox and separate LT230 transfer box in 1983. The LT230 was later used on both the Defender and Discovery models, but was replaced on the Range Rover by a Borg Warner chain-driven transfer box incorporating an automatic viscous coupling limited slip differential - earlier transmissions had a manual differential lock (operated by a vacuum servo on the LT95 and mechanically on the LT230). The LT77 had two major design changes: first an upgrade to larger bearings for the <b>layshaft</b> and new ratios around 1988, then a newly designed synchro hub for third and fourth gear and double synchros for first and second. This {{is also known as}} the suffix H gearbox or LT77s.|$|E
50|$|The {{driving shaft}} carries the input power into the gearbox. The driven shaft is the output shaft from the gearbox.

50|$|The term <b>layshaft</b> {{originates}} with watermill machinery. The <b>layshaft</b> is the gear-carrying shaft {{that links}} the wallower (the small spur gear driven at increased speed by the waterwheel) to any upright shafts that carry the millstones. The term, <b>layshaft,</b> {{was also used}} by millwrights, in both wind- and watermills, {{to refer to a}} shaft that drove secondary machinery such as sack hoists, rather than the main milling machinery.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>layshaft</b> {{was also}} applied to back-geared lathes. These were lathes with a slow-speed {{mechanism}} {{in addition to}} their usual belt drive. This used two gears on a <b>layshaft</b> behind the headstock, giving a double reduction gear.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the layout}} of the gearbox, the <b>layshaft</b> is {{normally}} mounted low-down in the gearbox casing below the other shafts. The gear lever enters through the top of the casing and so it is more convenient for the sliding components of the dog clutches to be mounted on the driven shaft, rather than the <b>layshaft.</b> The <b>layshaft</b> gear cluster is thus often a simple one-piece component, typically cast iron gears running in bearings on a fixed steel shaft. The bearings may be plain phosphor bronze bushes, or for high-load applications needle rollers.|$|E

5000|$|Chegworth mill is {{probably}} not the Domesday mill recorded at Ulcombe. The first reference to Chegworth occurs in 1200. The first definite reference to this mill was in 1317, when the mill was held by John de Cheggeworth. John de Chageworth was recorded at the mill in 1324. The mill was in the ownership of Sir Cheney Culpeper in 1657. It was then known as the Lower Mill. The previous owners were Thomas Hatche and Richard Austen, who had recently sold the mill at that date. John Pecke was the miller. Seventeenth century millers in Ulcombe include Willia Pettit (1612), Percival Austen (1669), Thomas Sylliborne (1673) and John Baker (1682). It is not known which mill each was at, there being two watermills and a windmill in Ulcombe during this period. William Taylor was the miller in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1702, John Feverstone was the miller. The mill was known as Pendmill in 1745 when the miller was recorded as John Feverstour the Elder. John Feverstone the older was the miller in 1766, when the lease was renewed. Richard Tilbe being the owner at this time. Thomas Willett leased the mill in 1792 and in 1800 Chegworth Mill, otherwise Pendmill was mortgaged by Willett. The mill was recorded as Checqworth Mill on the 1801 Ordnance Survey map. John Taylor was the miller in 1847, followed by G Craddock in 1852, J Gilbert, William and Thomas Taylor in 1854, Mrs M Cradduck, J Gilbert and Thomas Taylor 1855 - 1861, Charles Wicks in 1874, Alfred Wick 1895 - 1907, Frederick James Potter 1930 - 1934. The last miller was Ted Uren, who started at the mill in 1961, and took over from Harold Potter. The mill was house converted c.1990.The present mill was a corn mill and worked until the late 1960s. It has an overshot waterwheel of 10 ft diameter and 7 ft wide, made by Weeks of Maidstone. The axle is cast iron and 7+1/2 in square. The pit wheel is cast iron with 96 lignum vitae cogs.

50|$|Where {{large numbers}} of gear ratios, six or more, are to be {{provided}} then these will require a third or more gear clusters on the <b>layshaft.</b> To maintain the proportions of the overall gearbox as more compact, rather than becoming long and thin, these gearboxes may use twin layshafts. This requires an additional driven gear for each <b>layshaft,</b> but the mechanism is otherwise very similar. The use of multiple layshafts also developed into the multiple clutch gearbox, used for some buses, where each ratio has its own <b>layshaft</b> and separate plate or hydraulic clutches, rather than dog clutches, are used to select between them.|$|E

50|$|The FS5W71C {{gearboxes}} {{had different}} ratios {{to all other}} S13/S14. A key change was the <b>layshaft</b> gear which changed from 22/31 to 21/32, thus running the <b>layshaft</b> slower and at higher torque. This gearbox is considered weaker than other S13/S14 gearboxes. The front of the SR20DET gearbox with bell housing can be removed and a CA18DET bell housing fitted to allow the gearboxes to be swapped.|$|E

50|$|De Groene Molen is {{what the}} Dutch {{describe}} as an Spinnenkop met Stelling. It is a hollow post mill with a roundhouse on a single storey base. The stage is at first floor level 4.20 m above ground level. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The buck and roof are covered in horizontal boards. The sails are common sails. They have a span of 13.10 m. The sails are carried on a wooden windshaft. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 39 cogs. This drives the wallower (19 cogs) {{at the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft is the crown wheel (see photo of engine below). Since the last restoration the Archimedes' screw can be driven by either the Lister engine or by wind power. The crown wheel at the bottom of the upright shaft drives a <b>layshaft</b> which is connected by belt to a second <b>layshaft.</b> The driving gear on the end of this <b>layshaft</b> has 16 teeth; it drives a gear with 64 teeth on the axle of the Archimedes' screw, which is inclined at 19°. A second belt is used to drive this <b>layshaft</b> by the Lister engine.|$|E

50|$|Like other {{transmission}}s, {{a manual}} transmission has several shafts with various gears and other components attached to them. Typically, a rear-wheel-drive transmission has three shafts: an input shaft, a countershaft and an output shaft. The countershaft {{is sometimes called}} a <b>layshaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|The BSA C15G was {{produced}} from 1966 to 1967 {{and was the}} last version of the C15 engine with the ball bearing timing side main bearing, roller drive side and strengthened crankcases, larger oil pump and needle roller gearbox <b>layshaft</b> bearings.|$|E
50|$|Where a power {{take-off}} is required, usually {{for industrial vehicles}} to drive winches, hydraulic pumps etc., this is often driven {{from one end of}} the <b>layshaft,</b> as this is more accessible shaft than the main shafts, already in use by the drivetrain.|$|E
50|$|For {{gearboxes}} in general, gear clusters {{mounted on}} a <b>layshaft</b> may either turn freely on a fixed shaft, or {{may be part of}} a shaft that then rotates in bearings. There may be multiple separate clusters on a shared shaft and these are allowed to turn freely relative to each other.|$|E
50|$|The {{overshot}} waterwheel {{was some}} 12 ft diameter by 6 ft wide and was {{carried on a}} wooden axle. it drove a cast iron pit wheel 10 ft diameter with 112 wooden cogs. A 5 in square cast iron <b>layshaft</b> was driven which powered at least two pairs of millstones.|$|E
50|$|Designed {{around an}} unusual crank {{in which the}} central {{flywheel}} had a narrow section but large diameter, the new engine gained a reputation for oil leaks and unreliability.

50|$|Only {{the cast}} iron hub of this wheel remains, {{on a wooden}} axle of some 18 in{{diameter}}. The wheel had eight wooden spokes per side. This breast shot wheel was 13 ft diameter by 6 ft wide, with 48 floats mounted on a cast iron rim. This wheel drove three pairs of millstones by a <b>layshaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>layshaft</b> is an {{intermediate}} shaft within a gearbox that carries gears, {{but does not}} transfer the primary drive of the gearbox either {{in or out of}} the gearbox. Layshafts are best known through their use in car gearboxes, where they were a ubiquitous part of the rear-wheel drive layout. With the shift to front-wheel drive, the use of layshafts is now rarer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{synchronizer}} has {{to overcome}} {{the momentum of the}} entire input shaft and clutch disk when it is changing shaft rpm to match the new gear ratio. It can be abused by exposure to the momentum and power of the engine, which is what happens when attempts are made to select a gear without fully disengaging the clutch. This causes extra wear on the rings and sleeves, reducing their service life. When an experimenting driver tries to [...] "match the revs" [...] on a synchronized transmission and force it into gear without using the clutch, the synchronizer will make up for any discrepancy in RPM. The success in engaging the gear without clutching can deceive the driver into thinking that the RPM of the <b>layshaft</b> and transmission were actually exactly matched. Nevertheless, approximate rev. matching with clutching can decrease the difference in rotational speed between the <b>layshaft</b> and transmission gear shaft, therefore decreasing synchro wear.|$|E
50|$|With the {{popularity}} of front-wheel drive from the 1960s, the all-indirect gearbox has become common. These {{have been used for}} both transverse engine layouts, where the offset of two shafts is more convenient than the in-line arrangement of a <b>layshaft</b> gearbox, and for longitudinal transaxle designs, such as many Renaults, where the requirement was to have both driven and driving shafts at the same end of the gearbox.|$|E
5000|$|These additions, {{coupled with}} an {{increased}} 10.2:1 compression ratio, increased power from [...] Getrag provided a six-speed manual transmission shared with the Mini Cooper S. This transmission was a twin <b>layshaft</b> design and included a dual mass flywheel to eliminate vibration and transmission noise. Other changes to complete the package included sharper steering through an increased boost ratio in the steering rack, larger disc brakes on all four corners, and stiffened suspension with a slightly larger rear anti-roll bar.|$|E
