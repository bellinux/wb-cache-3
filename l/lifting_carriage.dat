50|$|The jack is {{rigid and}} robust. The upright column is {{fabricated}} and welded to the cast steel Gear Box. The elevating screw {{is provided with}} buttress thread supported with single-acting thrust ball-bearing having a spherical seating {{at the top and}} self-aligning ball-bearing at the bottom. This imparts self-aligning properties to the screw under loaded condition. The elevating screw is under tension when loaded and hence there is no chance of distortion due to buckling.While lifting the load, the Jack rests firmly on its base. For movement from one place to another, the <b>lifting</b> <b>carriage</b> is to be lowered by pressing the yoke which lifts the base and the Jack rests on the three wheels with a ground clearance of 20 mm.|$|E
40|$|In modern storing {{technology}} High-Bay Warehouses are {{of great}} importance due to their large capacity by combining relatively small floor area with random access on all units, a large band-width with respect to weight and measurement of the storage good and the simplicity of integration in the logistical peripheries. The storage and retrieval operations are usually performed by automated rail-bound storage at retrieval machines, or types of manual floor-travelling fork-lifts for High-Bay Warehouses. Particularly by automated high-bay warehouse systems, {{a high degree of}} positioning accuracy is a basic requirement for sufficient reliability. The aim of this work is to investigate the essential elements required for improving the positional accuracy with reference to the various influential parameters. The influential parameters are wearout, tolerance, static and dynamic deformation of the storage and retrieval machine, as well as the tolerance and static deformations of the rack structure or travel and guide rails. Another basic parameter is the positional aberation at the centring location. To study the qualities of positioning systems, an experimental model was conceived and constructed allowing the emulation of the vibration of the wing unit of storage and retrieval machines. Theoretical calculations as well as the experimental results show that both the vibration level of the column of signle mast machines and the vertical vibrations of the <b>lifting</b> <b>carriage</b> can be simulated with adequate precision. Various arrangements of positioning systems were compared with respect to the expected qualities. One arrangement based upon a laser positional transducer was chosen, built, and investigated {{with the help of the}} developed experimental model. A high positioning accuracy of this positioning system was verified-which was almost independent of all the enumerated influential parameters. (orig.)

5000|$|Watervliet Arsenal {{designed}} {{the gun and}} built the barrels. For several years, difficulties were encountered in building a disappearing carriage for the 12-inch gun. One alternative was the M1891 gun <b>lift</b> <b>carriage,</b> with the gun mounted on a large steam-powered elevator. Only one battery of this type was built, Battery Potter at Fort Hancock, New Jersey. When this proved to be too complex, guns were mounted on low-angle M1892 or M1897 barbette carriages. The M1897 carriage was actually an [...] "altered gun lift" [...] carriage, functionally equivalent to the barbette carriage. Eventually, the guns were mounted on M1896, M1897, or M1901 disappearing carriages designed by Bethlehem Steel; when the gun was fired, it dropped behind a concrete or earthen wall for protection from counter-battery fire. Bethlehem later built barrels as well.|$|R

40|$|Forty-five women {{participated in}} a 24 -week {{physical}} training program designed to improve <b>lifting,</b> load <b>carriage,</b> and run-ning performance. Activities included weightlifting, running, backpacking, lift and carry drills, and sprint running. Phy-sicians documented by passive surveillance all training-re-lated injuries. Thirty-two women successfully completed the training program. Twenty-two women (48. 9 %) suffered at least 1 injury during training, but only 2 women had {{to drop out of}} the study because of injuries. The rate of injury as-sociated with lost training time was 2. 8 injuries per 1, 000 training hours of exposure. Total clinic visits and days lost from training were 89 and 69, respectively. Most injuries were the overuse type involving the lower back, knees, and feet. Weightlifting accounted for a majority of the lost train-ing days. A combined strength training and running pro-gram resulted in significant performance gains in women. Only 2 out of 45 participants left the training program be-cause of injuries...|$|R

50|$|The station's roof is {{a single}} span wrought iron truss {{structure}} 550 ft long with a span of 210 ft, and was 90 ft high at its apex above the railtracks. Glass covered the middle section, timber (inside) and slate (outside) covered the outer quarters. The end screens were glazed with timber boarding surrounding the outer edges. It was constructed by Andrew Handyside and Co. The substructure and masonry partition were provided by Robert Neill and Sons of Manchester. Underneath the train shed is a large brick undercroft with intersecting tunnel vaults, above which were six platforms above street level which exited the station onto viaducts and bridges. The undercroft was used for storage and connected to the adjacent goods sidings by a <b>carriage</b> <b>lift.</b> The station's two-storey south wall has 15 bays separated by brick pilasters.

5000|$|While Maria Amalia had {{accepted}} the crown unwillingly, she regarded it her duty to keep it after it had once been given to her by God. During the Revolution of 1848, Maria Amalia made {{an attempt to get}} Louis-Philippe {{to take control of the}} troops, rally the National Guard, subdue the riots on the streets and defend his crown with his life. Reportedly, he did not answer her, but only asked her to trust his judgement. When a mob marched toward the Tuileries, Louis Philippe was convinced by his ministers to flee, and he signed his abdication in favor of his grandson against the consent of Maria Amalia. When the family left the palace, Maria Amalia reportedly turned to minister Thiers and commented: [...] "Ah Monsieur, you were not worthy of such a good king!" [...] The family left under somewhat chaotic circumstances, and Maria Amalia reportedly fainted and had to be <b>lifted</b> into her <b>carriage.</b> The couple were accompanied by their son Antoine, Duke of Montpensier; their daughter-in-law the Duchess of Nemours; their daughter Princess Clementine and her spouse, as well as six grandchildren.

50|$|In {{the period}} of the early 1950s new {{technological}} motive power was introduced onto Queensland Railways, when the first diesel-electric locomotives (DEL) arrived from the General-Electric Company. The new motive power was revolutionary and did not require the labour-intensive maintenance and preparation, nor produce the dirty environment of steam locomotives. The first DELs to be shedded at Rockhampton were in 1966, for use on export coal traffic. Prior to this DELs were worked through on the main line from Brisbane to Cairns. Diesel-electric locomotives were serviced at a separate location in the Rockhampton yard. With the introduction of the new technology, withdrawals of steam locomotives took place. The final steam locomotive was overhauled in Rockhampton Workshops in 1969. The roundhouse was officially closed to steam traction on 29 September 1969.Following closure as a steam depot the roundhouse was then used as a wagon repair and maintenance centre from 1969 until 1988 for wooden bodied vehicles. The roof was completely rebuilt in 1976-8 with hardwood timber being used to replace original pine framing. In 1982-3 in several stalls old concrete slabs were replaced with mass concrete, following complaints from employees. <b>Carriage</b> <b>lifting</b> gear and machinery was also installed at this time, as a partial modernisation of the working environment. In 1983 an office for subforemen was also built into one of the stalls in the roundhouse. In 1988 one of the bays was converted into a store area for breakdown equipment. The roundhouse was utilised as a wagon repair shop until 1990. In 1992-3 as part of a $20 million redevelopment of the Rockhampton Workshops, an administration complex was inserted into two bays of the south- eastern axis of the roundhouse, adjacent to the entry/exit road.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1836 Major-General Sir George Elder left England, {{having been}} {{selected}} {{to serve on}} the staff at Madras. On 3 December, just one week after he arrived in Madras, he died in a horse riding accident: The demise of this gallant officer took place on the 3rd December, about half-past five o'clock. It appears that Sir George was mounted on a very spirited horse, and called at Waller's stables for the purpose of giving some directions to Mr. Waller. Immediately on leaving the stables, the horse went off at score up the Mount-road, and when opposite the road leading to the Commander-in-Chiefs house the horse attempted to turn, which Sir George tried unsuccessfully to prevent, when both rider and horse came with great violence against a tree, and it is supposed that this concussion was the cause of death to the gallant General, who had maintained his seat fill that moment. After the concussion the horse stopped short, kicked up, and threw his rider off forwards. Captain Deas, 6th Madras Light Cavalry, happened to be passing at the time in Mr. Scott's carriage, and was instantly at Sir George's side; he never spoke; and on being <b>lifted</b> into the <b>carriage,</b> appeared quite dead. The body was taken to Dr. 0'Neil's house, which was not far from the spot where the fatal accident occurred, All the injuries the General received were {{on the left side of}} the body; several of the ribs were broken; the heart and left lobe of the lungs torn Open, and the spleen lacerated. The extensive injuries received in the chest must have caused instantaneous death. The head was but very slightly injured; the left arm was broken. Sir George landed at Madras on November 27th, exactly a week before his funeral.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{believe it}} was the violent mental agitation, the {{reaction}} from a state of exultation and joy in which I had been walking among the stars so many months; and the grief, anxiety, the struggle, the talking, all coming on me {{at a moment when}} the ferocious heat had made the body peculiarly susceptible; but one afternoon I went down to the Trollopes, had sight of the famous Ducal orders about bombarding Florence, and came home to be ill. Violent palpitations and cough; in fact, the worst attack on the chest I ever had in Italy. For two days and two nights it was more like angina pectoris, as I have heard it described; but this went off, and the complaint ran into its ancient pattern, thank God, and kept me only very ill, with violent cough all night long; my poor Robert, who nursed me like an angel, prevented from sleeping for full three weeks. When there was a possibility I was <b>lifted</b> into a <b>carriage</b> and brought here; stayed two days at the inn in Siena, and then removed to this pleasant airy villa. Very ill I was after coming, and great courage it required to come; but change of air was absolutely a condition of living, and the event justified the risk. For now I am quite myself, have done crying 'Wolf,' and end this lamentable history by desiring you to absolve me for my silence. We have been here nearly a month. My strength, which was so exhausted that I could scarcely stand unsupported, is coming back satisfactorily, and the cough has ceased to vex me at all. Still, I am not equal to driving out. I hope to take my first drive in a very few days though, and the very asses are ministering to me--in milk. All the English physicians had found it convenient (the beloved Grand Duke being absent) to leave Florence, and Zanetti was attending the Piedmontese hospitals, so that I had to attend me none of the old oracles--only a Prussian physician (Dr. Gresonowsky), a very intelligent man, of whom we knew a little personally, and who had a strong political sympathy with me. (He and I used to sit together on Isa Blagden's terrace and relieve ourselves by abusing each other's country; and whether he expressed most moral indignation against England or I against Prussia, remained doubtful.) Afterwards he came to cure me, and was as generous in his profession as became his politics. People are usually very kind to us, I must say. Think of that man following us to Siena, uninvited, and attending me at the hotel two days, then refusing recompense.|$|R
6000|$|At Lichfield, {{he formed}} an {{intimacy}} with several persons, who afterwards rose to much distinction. Of these, {{the most remarkable}} were Mr. Edgeworth, whose skill in mechanics made him acceptable to Darwin; Mr. Day, a man remembered to more advantage by his writings, than by the singularities of his conduct; and Anna Seward, the female most eminent in her time for poetical genius. The {{manner in which the}} first of these introduced himself shall be told in his own words, as they convey a lively description of Darwin's person and habits of life at this time. [...] "I wrote an account to the Doctor of the reception which his scheme" [...] (for preventing accidents to a carriage in turning) [...] "had met with from the Society of Arts. The Doctor wrote me a very civil answer; and though, as I afterwards found out, he took me for a coach-maker, he invited me to his house: an invitation which I accepted in the ensuing summer. When I arrived at Lichfield, I went to inquire whether the Doctor was at home. I was shewn into a room where I found Mrs. Darwin. I told her my name. She said the Doctor expected me, and that he intended to be at home before night. There were books and prints in the room, of which I took occasion to speak. Mrs. Darwin asked me to drink tea, and I perceived that I owed to my literature the pleasure of passing the evening with this most agreeable woman. We talked and conversed upon various literary subjects till it was dark; when Mrs. Darwin seeming to be surprised that the Doctor had not come home, I offered to take my leave; but she told me that I had been expected for some days, and that a bed had been prepared for me: I heard some orders given to the housemaid, who had destined a different room for my reception from that which her mistress had upon second thoughts appointed. I perceived that the maid examined me attentively, but I could not guess the reason. When supper was nearly finished, a loud rapping at the door announced the Doctor. There was a bustle in the hall, which made Mrs. Darwin {{get up and go to}} the door. Upon her exclaiming that they were bringing in a dead man, I went to the hall. I saw some persons, directed by one whom I guessed to be Doctor Darwin, carrying a man who appeared to be motionless. 'He is not dead,' said Doctor Darwin. 'He is only dead drunk. I found him,' continued the Doctor, 'nearly suffocated in a ditch: I had him <b>lifted</b> into my <b>carriage,</b> and brought hither, that we might take care of him to-night.' Candles came; and what was the surprise of the Doctor and of Mrs. Darwin, to find that the person whom he had saved was Mrs. Darwin's brother! who, for the first time in his life, as I was assured, had been intoxicated in this manner, and who would undoubtedly have perished had it not been for Doctor Darwin's humanity. During this scene I had time to survey my new friend, Doctor Darwin. He was a large man, fat, and rather clumsy; but intelligence and benevolence were painted in his countenance: he had a considerable impediment in his speech, a defect which is in general painful to others; but the Doctor repaid his auditors so well for making them wait for his wit or his knowledge, that he seldom found them impatient. When his brother was disposed of, he came to supper, and I thought that he looked at Mrs. Darwin as if he was somewhat surprised when he heard that I had passed the whole evening in her company. After she withdrew, he entered into conversation with me upon the carriage that I had made, and upon the remarks that fell from some members of the Society to whom I had shewn it. I satisfied his curiosity; and having told him that my carriage was in the town, and that he could see it whenever he pleased, we talked upon mechanical subjects, and afterwards on various branches of knowledge, which necessarily produced allusions to classical literature; by these, he discovered that I had received the education of a gentleman. 'Why! I thought,' said the Doctor, 'that you were a coach-maker!' 'That was the reason,' said I, 'that you looked surprised at finding me at supper with Mrs. Darwin. But you see, Doctor, how superior in discernment ladies are even to the most learned gentlemen: I assure you that I had not been in the room five minutes before Mrs. Darwin asked me to tea!'" ...|$|R
