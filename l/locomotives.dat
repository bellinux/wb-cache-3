5|$|Amtrak {{ordered a}} total of 150 SDP40Fs, in two batches. The first order, placed on November 2, 1972, was for 40 <b>locomotives,</b> {{at a cost of}} $18 million. A second order, for 110 <b>locomotives</b> at $50 million, {{followed}} on October 12, 1973. These orders were Amtrak's first for new-build <b>locomotives.</b> Amtrak deployed the original 40 <b>locomotives</b> on long-distance trains in the Western United States. The first <b>locomotives</b> entered revenue service on June 22, 1973, hauling the Super Chief from Chicago to Los Angeles over the tracks of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. SDP40Fs were also used on the Burlington Northern Railroad. The arrival of the second order enabled Amtrak to deploy the SDP40Fs throughout the country, displacing the inherited E-units.|$|E
5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined <b>locomotives</b> Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} <b>locomotives</b> was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined <b>locomotives</b> were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 <b>locomotives</b> were painted thus.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the new features, such as the Bulleid chain-driven valve gear, sixty <b>locomotives</b> were rebuilt by British Railways during the late 1950s.

50|$|It {{was also}} in 1992 that the {{railroad}} acquired its first diesel <b>locomotive.</b> Previously, the railroad had solely operated the steam <b>locomotive</b> that Billy had discovered in San Francisco in 1939.

5|$|The 2-6-4 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was not in}} common use in Great Britain at this time, as many railway companies operated routes that required <b>locomotives</b> with greater fuel capacity, or short branch lines that necessitated smaller <b>locomotives.</b> The 2-6-4 tank engine design had only been used once before for standard gauge <b>locomotives</b> in Britain, on the Great Central Railway's 1Bclass freight <b>locomotives</b> of 1914. However, the configuration was ideal for the SECR, because of its shorter mainlines, and allowed for a long wheelbase with a leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on track curves. The tightness of the curves on the former LCDR mainlines had constrained the size of <b>locomotives</b> operating on the SECR, {{as they had been}} hastily erected during the nineteenth century to compete with those of the South Eastern Railway (SER). The longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than a 4-4-0, giving sufficient power to avoid double-heading of <b>locomotives</b> on heavier trains.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan Railway {{was unhappy}} with the {{performance}} and safety of the D Class <b>locomotives</b> and sold them between 1916 and 1922. With much of their route close to London now electrified the MR had surplus steam <b>locomotives,</b> and two Metropolitan Railway A Class <b>locomotives,</b> numbers 23 (built 1866) and 41 (built 1869), were transferred to the route. Built by Beyer, Peacock and Company from 1864, the A Class {{had been the first}} <b>locomotives</b> owned by the Metropolitan (in 1863, the first year of operation, the MR had used engines loaned from the GWR). Although the most advanced <b>locomotives</b> regularly to work the route, the A Class predated all other rolling stock on the Tramway. The two <b>locomotives</b> operated for a week at a time. Occasionally, the MR substituted other similar <b>locomotives.</b>|$|E
5|$|The N class {{principles}} {{applied to}} the U class design aided mass production, and incorporated several features found on the GWR 4300 Class <b>locomotives</b> designed by Churchward. An order made in 1926 for a second batch of 20 K class <b>locomotives</b> was delayed until 1928, when the specification was revised to construct U class <b>locomotives.</b> It was intended to replace several elderly 4-4-0 classes within the former SECR's running fleet, and attempted to standardise and ease maintenance of <b>locomotives</b> by sharing parts with other Maunsell designs. The style of the new locomotive reflected the Midland Railway influence of another of Maunsell’s assistants, the ex-Midland Railway engineer James Clayton. The addition of a tender increased the operating range of the U class over its K class predecessors, and the wheel arrangement {{applied to the}} former K class <b>locomotives</b> improved the locomotive’s stability when operational.|$|E
40|$|<b>Locomotive</b> {{scheduling}} {{problem is to}} assign <b>locomotive</b> to all the trains on the train working diagram with the fewest costs. <b>Locomotive</b> operation optimization is of great significance to the benefits of railway transportation. The study proves that the a feasible solution of <b>locomotive</b> scheduling can be transformed into {{the form of the}} <b>locomotive</b> routing’s sequential connection by analyzing its characteristics. Accordingly, a two-stage heuristic algorithm is designed. The first stage is to solve the optimum <b>locomotive</b> routing connection on one station and the second stage to deal with <b>locomotive</b> deadheading and optimize the <b>locomotive</b> routing on all the stations synthetically. Compared with the actual <b>locomotive</b> scheduling in the railway operation practice, the results point out that the two-stage heuristic algorithm is an effective and efficient method to solve the <b>locomotive</b> {{scheduling problem}}...|$|R

5|$|The U {{class was}} {{designed}} in the mid-1920s for production {{at a time when}} more obsolete 4-4-0 <b>locomotives</b> were withdrawn, and derived from Maunsell’s earlier SECR K (“River”) class 2-6-4 tank <b>locomotives.</b> The first 20members of the U class were rebuilds of the K class <b>locomotives,</b> one of which was involved in the Sevenoaks railway accident. A further 20U class <b>locomotives</b> were built in 1928 to fill the gap in cross-country and semi-fast express passenger services after the withdrawal of the K class. The design also continued the standardisation of the Southern Railway locomotive fleet by using parts designed to be interchangeable with other Maunsell-designed classes.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{financial}} difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more <b>locomotives</b> until six 4-4-0 <b>locomotives</b> {{were built in}} 1876 by Neilson's, partly to replace the Deeside <b>locomotives.</b> These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous <b>locomotives</b> and {{were the first to}} be built with cabs. The next twelve <b>locomotives</b> had rounded splashers over the trailing driving wheels, meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the firebox, copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the firebox and boiler. After James Manson became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson & Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885. The railway had inherited most of its tank engines from the Deeside, Morayshire and Banffshire Railways and these needed replacing, so six arrived in 1884 and three slightly larger the following year. The first tank engines in the country to be fitted with doors on the cabs, these worked on the suburban services and one was fitted with a cowcatcher to work the St Combs Light Railway at Fraserburgh. In 1887 two <b>locomotives</b> were built at Kittybrewster works. Although there was only space for four <b>locomotives</b> in the cramped repair shops the board expected to save £300 to £400 by building the <b>locomotives</b> themselves. Nine express <b>locomotives</b> with six-wheeled tenders were built by Kitsons in 1888 and these were followed by six more with eight-wheeled tenders built by Stephenson & Co, one of which was successfully trialled in 1914 with a superheater. Most of Manson's later <b>locomotives</b> were subsequently fitted with superheaters, the eight-wheeled tenders being replaced in most cases with six-wheeled tenders during the rebuild.|$|E
