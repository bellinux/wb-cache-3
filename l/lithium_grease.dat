It has also been revealed recently that ZrP nanoplatelets are effective in reducing friction in both aqueous and non-aqueous mediums, which is mainly because of the nanoplatelet-induced viscosity modification of the liquid mixtures and the absorption of lubricating molecules on the surfaces of the 2 D nanoplatelets [31, 32].|$|R

40|$|Dust boot is {{the part}} which {{prevents}} entering the foreign bodies (such as water, dust etc.) in to the tie rod ends. Dust boot can lose its elasticity according to working condition. The boot fails and contaminants, resulting in corrosion and wear and causing excessive deflection in the socket assembly, loose steering and alignment to angle changes. Increasing trends in the problems of difficulty in control on the road curve, and skid due to the looseness in the connecting points to the steering system can be seen. In this study physical tests are applied to the dust boot.

40|$|In this paper, {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} particle migration in lubricating grease flow are presented. The rheology of three <b>lithium</b> <b>greases</b> with NLGI (National Lubricating Grease Institute) grades 00, 1 and 2 respectively are considered. The grease is modeled as a single-phase Herschel–Bulkley fluid, and the particle migration {{has been considered}} in two different grease pockets formed between two concentric cylinders where the inner cylinder is rotating and driving the flow. In the wide grease pocket, {{the width of the}} gap is much smaller compared to the axial length scale, enabling a one-dimensional flow. In the narrow pocket, the axial and radial length is of the same order, yielding a three-dimensional flow. It was found that the change in flow characteristics due to the influence of the pocket lateral boundaries when going from the wide to the narrow pocket leads to a significantly shorter migration time. Comparing the results with an existing migration model treating the radial component contribution, it was concluded that a solution to the flow in the whole domain is needed together with a higher order numerical scheme to obtain a full solution to the particle migration. This result is more pronounced in the narrow pocket due to gradients in the flow induced by the lateral boundaries...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of base oil type and viscosity on the frictional behaviour of lithium-thickened bearing greases. A series of model <b>lithium</b> <b>greases</b> were manufactured by systematically varying viscosity and type of base oil, so that {{the influence of}} a single base oil property could be studied in isolation. In addition, selected greases were blended with oleic acid, with the purpose of evaluating its effectiveness in further reducing grease friction. Friction coefficient and film thickness were measured in laboratory ball-on-disc tribometers over a range of speeds and temperatures. For a specific oil type, the influence of base oil viscosity on friction was found to be closely related to its effect on film thickness: greases formulated with PAO oils covering a wide range of viscosities gave very similar friction at the same nominal film thickness. For a given base oil viscosity, base oil type was found to have a strong influence on grease friction under all test conditions. PAO-based greases generally produced lower friction than mineral- and ester-based greases. Addition of oleic acid to the test greases did not significantly affect friction within the range of test conditions employed in this study. The results provide new insight into the frictional behaviour of greases, which may be used to help inform new low-friction grease formulations for rolling bearing applications...|$|R

Polyurethane materials, which show excellent properties as abrasion resistance, flexibility and needle pressure stability, can be used as dust boots in tie rod ends.

In the experiment materials, named as Elastollan-C 60 A and Elastollan-C 70 A, are used as dust boots. During physical tests to be applied to the dust boot are as followed; hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, recovery, compression set at 70 0 C/ 24 h, density, volume, weight, adhesive resistance, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter.

40|$|Pavement thermal {{property}} plays {{a vital role}} in forming Urban Heat Island effect that influences the comfort level and the environment. While other pavement properties are relatively easy to acquire using field instruments, thermal conductivity needs to be obtained using laboratory measurements. A method to measure the thermal conductivity was developed by Arizona State University (ASU). In this study, this method which utilizes cylindrical specimen geometry was validated for its feasibility and accuracy. However, the effectiveness of the thermal interface filler materials used to fill the air gap between the heat source and testing pavement materials has not been thoroughly evaluated. Four different types of filler materials were selected and evaluated: high pressure <b>lithium</b> <b>grease,</b> Moly-lithium grease, petroleum jelly, and Omega paste. The test results indicate that Omega paste, a silicone-based thermal grease commonly used in electronic devices, gave the highest thermal conductivity of the asphalt and concrete samples tested. This is due to its higher thermal conductivity (2. 3 W/m-K) as compared to the other three filler materials tested even though the workability of Omega paste was not as good as the other three. The Omega paste was confirmed as a suitable filler by conducting tests on a material with a known thermal conductivity. For the ASU method to be accurate, the thermal conductivity of the selected filler material needs to be higher than the top and bottom insulation of the test piece, due to the one-dimensional steady-state heat flow in the test piece...|$|E

Hydrocarbon chain {{is one of}} the major factors resulting in loss of the base fluid quality by formation of products having negative effects on the physicochemical properties in particular the total acid number and dynamic viscosity. Antioxidants are major ingredients that protect the quality of lubricating grease by retarding oxidation reactions.

40|$|The {{rheology}} of soap thickened greases {{has been}} investigated in a cone and plate rheometer and a model that includes base oil viscosity and temperature has been suggested and fitted to the results. With {{the use of a}} bouncing ball apparatus, the pressure coefficient of the limiting shear stress of the greases was determined. It is related to friction in EHL and the results verified the friction reducing properties of the soap thickeners of the grease. Film thickness in EHL of a grease lubricated point contact was measured in a ball and disc apparatus. The initial film thickness was thicker than the film thickness given by the base oil. After some seconds of running the film thickness dropped far below the base oil film thickness, because of insufficient replenishment. Replenishment was studied by looking at the distribution and flow of lubricant around the contact in the ball and disc apparatus. Primary reservoirs and primary bands close to the track of the contact, on the ball and the disc, contained small amounts of grease that constituted a potential supply of lubricant to the inlet of the contact. The majority of the grease was pushed away from the contact initially and seemed no to participate in the lubrication. Soap thickener formations were observed entering the contact in the ball and disc apparatus and cause a local increase in the film thickness that disturbed the normally horseshoe-shaped film thickness map. For <b>lithium</b> <b>greases,</b> the amount and size of the film disturbances were found to be connected with the manufacturing process of the grease and the soap thickener content. A method to evaluate the pressure fluctuations induced by the film thickness disturbances was proposed. The method was verified by comparing film thickness measurements from an oil lubricated contact and the pressure profile calculated from that, with the results from a fully numerical solution. Good agreement was found. The method was applied to a grease lubricated contact and showed significant variations in the pressure, caused by the soap thickener formations.
