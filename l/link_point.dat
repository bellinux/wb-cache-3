40|$|Abstract—Dynamic {{location}} referencing {{method is}} an important technology to shield map differences. These method references objects of the road network by utilizing condensed selection of its real-world geographic properties stored in a digital map database, which overcomes the defections existing in pre-coded location referencing methods. The high attributes completeness requirements and complicated reference point selection algorithm are the main problems of recent researches. Therefore, a dynamic location referencing algorithm combining intersection points selected at the extremities compulsively and road link points selected according to link partition principle was proposed. An experimental system based on this theory was implemented. The tests using Beijing digital map database showed satisfied results and thus verified the feasibility and practicability of this method.

40|$|Abstract—Steganography is a {{technique}} for secret data communication in an appropriate multimedia medium such as video, audio, image and text files. In this paper, a digital image steganography method provided by the Contourlet domain. In this approach contourlet coefficients within each block separately use a permutation genetic algorithm optimization for hiding the data as a mapping function. The optimal pixel adjustment process (OPAP) is applied after embedding the message to improve the hiding capacity with low distortions. The simulation {{results show that the}} quality factor in this method outperform other methods in Contourlet domain, moreover it has high resistance to important steganalysis methods in the Contourlet domain. Thus the proposed approach is also a secure method of steganography. II. CONTOURLET DOMAIN Contourlet transform was proposed in [12]. The contourlet transform provides a multi-scale and multi-directional image expansion.

40|$|Diffusion is a {{fundamental}} process that {{can have an impact}} on numerous technological applications, such as nanoelectronics, nuclear materials, fuel cells, and batteries, whereas its understanding is important across scientific fields including materials science and geophysics. In numerous systems, it is difficult to experimentally determine the diffusion properties over a range of temperatures and pressures. This gap can be bridged by the use of thermodynamic models that <b>link</b> <b>point</b> defect parameters to bulk properties, which are more easily accessible. The present review offers a discussion on the applicability of the cBΩ model, which assumes that the defect Gibbs energy is proportional to the isothermal bulk modulus and the mean volume per atom. This thermodynamic model was first introduced 40 years ago; however, consequent advances in computational modelling and experimental techniques have regenerated the interest of the community in using it to calculate diffusion properties, particularly under extreme conditions. This work examines recent characteristic examples, in which the model has been employed in semiconductor and nuclear materials. Finally, there is a discussion on future directions and systems that will possibly be the focus of studies in the decades to come...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} of {{the motion of the}} center of mass (CoM) of linkages as being a stationary or invariant point at one of its links. This is of importance for the design of inherently shaking force balanced mechanisms, static balancing, and other branches of mechanical synthesis. For this purpose Fischer's mechanism is investigated as being a composition of pantographs. It can be shown that linkages that are composed of pantographs and of which all links have an arbitrary CoM can be inherently balanced for which Fischer's method is a useful tool. To calculate the principal dimensions for which linkages have their CoM at an invariant <b>link</b> <b>point,</b> an approach based on linear momentum is proposed. With this approach it is possible to investigate each degree-of-freedom individually. Equivalent Linear Momentum Systems are proposed to facilitate the calculations in order to use different convenient reference frames. The method is applied to planar linkages with revolute joints, however it also applies to linkages with other types of joints. As a practical example a shaking force and shaking moment balanced 2 -DoF grasper mechanism is derived. [...] -...|$|E
