A theoretical understanding of such heuristic programming, however, is still very much wanting." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the field}} of {{avalanche}} warning and avalanche protection, the usage of free area (non-avalanche-secured terrain) is of high importance and was hardly estimated so far. During the winter 2004 - 05 different methods to survey and to count people in the free area were tested in the Davos area. Two methods prove to be rather efficient surveys: the <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> and the voluntary registration boards. During the winter 2005 - 06, two <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> and three voluntary registration boards were operated at four different sites in Davos, Switzerland. These surveys provided a good dataset, the first of this type for the Alps. They are {{the basis of our}} investigations regarding the behavior of backcountry and off-piste recreationists. This study showed a high sensitivity of the backcountry recreationists to the avalanche danger level. Off-piste recreationists were more sensitive to good snow conditions than backcountry recreationists. Our surveys about the usage of free area enable us to calculate the risk of an avalanche accident more precisely. The individual risk of an avalanche accident for off-piste snow sport was calculated as 7 x 10 - 5 and for backcountry snow sport as 3 x 10 - 5 per year, which is both slightly smaller than the risk of driving by car. The surveys will be continued in the future to study the variability between different years...|$|R

50|$|Grass or turf roofs {{have been}} around since the Viking times if not far earlier and make for a {{decorative}} and durable roof covering. Green roofs have been made by depositing topsoil or other growth media on flat roofs and seeding them (or allowing them to self-seed as nature takes its course). Maintenance in the form of simple visible inspection and removal of larger rooting plants has allowed these roofs to be successful in that they provide an excellent covering and UV <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> for the roof waterproofing membrane. With some systems, the manufacturer requires that a root barrier membrane be laid above the waterproofing membrane. If well planned and fitted, the mass of the soil or growth medium can provide a good heat buffer for the building - storing the heat of the sun and releasing it into the building at night and thus keeping inside temperatures more even. Sudden cold spells are also buffered from the building.|$|E

5000|$|Warp drive {{velocity}} in Star Trek {{is generally}} expressed in [...] "warp factor" [...] units, which—according to the Star Trek Technical Manuals—correspond to {{the magnitude of}} the warp field. Achieving warp factor 1 is equal to breaking the <b>light</b> <b>barrier,</b> while the actual velocity corresponding to higher factors is determined using an ambiguous formula. Several episodes of the original series placed the Enterprise in peril by having it travel at high warp factors; at one point in [...] "That Which Survives" [...] the Enterprise traveled at a warp factor of 14.1. In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode [...] "The Most Toys" [...] the crew of Enterprise-D discovers that the android Data may have been stolen while on board another ship, Jovis. At this point the Jovis, which has a maximum warp factor of 3, has had a 23-hour head start, which the Enterprise-D figures puts her anywhere within a 0.102 light year radius of her last known position. However, the velocity (in present dimensional units) of any given warp factor is rarely the subject of explicit expression, and travel times for specific interstellar distances are not consistent through the various series.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{reports on}} two 40 × 40 μm 2 {{high-speed}} pnp phototransistors {{built in a}} standard 0. 18 μm CMOS process without modifications.
