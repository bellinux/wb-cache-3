5|$|Bluebells are {{a species}} of {{deciduous}} woodland over much of their range, flowering and <b>leafing</b> early before the canopy closes in late spring. They may also be found growing under bracken or Japanese knotweed, perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as Mercurialis perennis. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through {{a thick layer of}} leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a host species for the parasitic fungus Uromyces muscari, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of H.non-scripta to take up phosphorus from the soil is greatly enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.|$|E

40|$|Field pea is an {{important}} annual crop due to its contribution to soil fertility and other rotational benefits. However, weeds and ascochyta blight limit pea yield, particularly in organic systems. <b>Leafed</b> and semi-leafless pea types differ in lodging resistance, and may affect weeds and disease through differences in canopy light penetration and air flow. Mixtures of the two leaf types may improve weed and disease suppression and yield compared with monocultures of the same cultivars. To test this hypothesis, replicated field experiments were conducted under organic and conventional management in Saskatoon and Vonda, SK, in 2011 and 2012. Mixtures of a <b>leafed</b> and semi-leafless cultivar, CDC Sonata and CDC Dakota, were sown in ratios of 0 : 100, 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25, and 100 : 0 <b>leafed</b> to semi-leafless pea, at target seeding rates of 88 and 132 plants m- 2. Conventionally managed plots were inoculated with ascochyta blight-infested pea straw and received overhead irrigation to encourage disease. Mixtures of 50 % or more semi-leafless pea adopted the greater lodging resistance and weed suppression of the semi-leafless cultivar. Mixtures comprised of 25 % <b>leafed</b> and 75 % semi-leafless pea increased both seed and biomass yield compared with either cultivar grown alone. Yield enhancement was attributed to the <b>leafed</b> cultivar, whose seed yield was 76 % higher in mixture than expected based on monoculture yield. Ascochyta blight epidemics were of moderate severity, and <b>leafed</b> and semi-leafless monocultures reached 36 and 43 % necrosis in 2011, and 33 and 38 % necrosis in 2012, respectively. The disease reaction of mixtures fell between the two component cultivars. At disease onset in 2012, lower light interception and shorter moisture durations coincided with the lower ascochyta blight severity of <b>leafed</b> monocultures. In 2011 and the later phase of the 2012 epidemic, disease severity was negatively associated with vine length, and positively associated with number of nodes and tissue senescence. Despite the advantages of <b>leafed</b> and semi-leafless pea mixtures, the limited selection of <b>leafed</b> cultivars impedes adoption of this technique by growers. For pea breeders, developing mixtures of pea lines isogenic for leaf type may increase yield compared with single cultivars. ...|$|R

6000|$|Every {{one must}} have noticed how certain {{individual}} trees regularly put forth and shed their leaves earlier or later than {{others of the}} same species. There is a famous horse-chestnut in the Tuileries which is named from <b>leafing</b> so much earlier than the others. There is also an oak near Edinburgh which retains its leaves to a very late period. These differences have been attributed by some authors {{to the nature of}} the soil in which the trees grow; but Archbishop Whately grafted an early thorn on a late one, and vice versa, and both grafts kept to their proper periods, which differed by about a fortnight, as if they still grew on their own stocks. (10/158. Quoted from Royal Irish Academy in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1841 page 767.) There is a Cornish variety of the elm which is almost an evergreen, and is so tender that the shoots are often killed by the frost; and the varieties of the Turkish oak (Q. cerris) may be arranged as deciduous, sub-evergreen, and evergreen.

60|$|Bud-variation, {{which was}} fully {{discussed}} {{in a former}} chapter, shows us that variability may be quite independent of seminal reproduction, and likewise of reversion to long-lost ancestral characters. No one will maintain that the sudden appearance of a moss-rose on a Provence-rose {{is a return to}} a former state, for mossiness of the calyx has been observed in no natural species; the same argument is applicable to variegated and laciniated leaves; nor can the appearance of nectarines on peach-trees be accounted for on the principle of reversion. But bud-variations more immediately concern us, as they occur far more frequently on plants which have been highly cultivated during a length of time, than on other and less highly cultivated plants; and very few well- marked instances have been observed with plants growing under strictly natural conditions. I have given one instance of an ash-tree growing in a gentleman's pleasure-grounds; and occasionally there may be seen, on beech and other trees, twigs <b>leafing</b> at a different period from the other branches. But our forest trees in England can hardly be considered as living under strictly natural conditions; the seedlings are raised and protected in nursery-grounds, and must often be transplanted into places where wild trees of the kind would not naturally grow. It would be esteemed a prodigy if a dog-rose growing in a hedge produced by bud-variation a moss-rose, or a wild bullace or wild cherry- tree yielded a branch bearing fruit of a different shape and colour from the ordinary fruit. The prodigy would be enhanced if these varying branches were found capable of propagation, not only by grafts, but sometimes by seed; yet analogous cases have occurred with many of our highly cultivated trees and herbs.|$|E
6000|$|The bushes {{differ in}} their manner of growth, being erect, or spreading, or pendulous. The periods of <b>leafing</b> and {{flowering}} differ both absolutely and relatively to each other; thus the Whitesmith produces early flowers, which from not being protected by the foliage, as it is believed, continually fail to produce fruit. (10/122. Loudon's 'Gardener's Magazine' volume 4 1828 page 112.) The leaves vary in size, tint, and in depth of lobes; they are smooth, downy, or hairy on the upper surface. The branches {{are more or less}} downy or spinose; [...] "the Hedgehog has probably derived its name from the singular bristly condition of its shoots and fruit." [...] The branches of the wild gooseberry, I may remark, are smooth, with the exception of thorns at the bases of the buds. The thorns themselves are either very small, few and single, or very large and triple; they are sometimes reflexed and much dilated at their bases. In the different varieties the fruit varies in abundance, in the period of maturity, in hanging until shrivelled, and greatly in size, [...] "some sorts having their fruit large during a very early period of growth, whilst others are small, until nearly ripe." [...] The fruit varies also much in colour, being red, yellow, green, and white--the pulp of one dark-red gooseberry being tinged with yellow; in flavour; in being smooth or downy,--few, however, of the Red gooseberries, whilst many of the so-called Whites, are downy; or in being so spinose that one kind is called Henderson's Porcupine. Two kinds acquire when mature a powdery bloom on their fruit. The fruit varies in the thickness and veining of the skin, and, lastly, in shape, being spherical, oblong, oval, or obovate. (10/123. The fullest account of the gooseberry is given by Mr. Thompson in 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 1 2nd series 1835 page 218 from which most of the foregoing facts are taken.) ...|$|E

60|$|Right {{opposite}} our house, on our Mount Clear, {{is an old}} oak, {{the apostle}} of the primeval forest. Once, when this place was all wildwood, {{the man who was}} seeking a spot for the location of the buildings of Phillips Academy climbed this oak, using it as a sort of green watchtower, from whence he might gain a view of the surrounding country. Age and time, since then, have dealt hardly with the stanch old fellow. His limbs have been here and there shattered; his back begins to look mossy and dilapidated; but after all, there is a piquant, decided air about him, that speaks the old age of a tree of distinction, a kingly oak. To-day I see him standing, dimly revealed through the mist of falling snows; to-morrow's sun will show the outline of his gnarled limbs--all rose color with their soft snow burden; and again a few months, and spring will breathe on him, and he will draw a long breath, and break out once more, for the three hundredth time, perhaps, into a vernal crown of leaves. I sometimes think that leaves are the thoughts of trees, and that if we only knew it, we should find their life's experience recorded in them. Our oak! what a crop of meditations and remembrances must he have thrown forth, <b>leafing</b> out century after century. Awhile he spake and thought only of red deer and Indians; of the trillium that opened its white triangle in his shade; of the scented arbutus, fair as the pink ocean shell, weaving her fragrant mats in the moss at his feet; of feathery ferns, casting their silent shadows on the checkerberry leaves, and all those sweet, wild, nameless, half-mossy things, that live in the gloom of forests, and are only desecrated when brought to scientific light, laid out and stretched on a botanic bier. Sweet old forest days!--when blue jay, and yellow hammer, and bobalink made his leaves merry, and summer was a long opera of such music as Mozart dimly dreamed. But then came human kind bustling beneath; wondering, fussing, exploring, measuring, treading down flowers, cutting down trees, scaring bobalinks--and Andover, as men say, began to be settled.|$|E
