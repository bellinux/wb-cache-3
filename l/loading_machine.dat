50|$|Optical {{microscopy}} {{is usually}} used for structural {{characterization of materials}} in a narrow range of magnification, a small region of interest (ROI), and without changes during microscopy. But many crucial processes of damage initiation and propagation take place dynamically in a timescale ranging from 10âˆ’3 s to 103 s and distance scales from micrometers (solitary defects places) to centimeters (for correlated linked networks of defects). Multiscale Image and Video Processing (MultiscaleIVideoP) is designed to process the recorded changes in materials under mechanical deformation in a <b>loading</b> <b>machine</b> (e.g., a diamond anvil cell). The calculations include many parameters of the physical process (e.g., rate, magnification, illumination conditions, and hardware filters) and image processing parameters (e.g., size distribution, anisotropy, localization, and scaling parameters); thus, the calculations are very slow, requiring more powerful computational resources. Deploying this application on a grid computing infrastructure, utilising hundreds of machines at the same time, allows harnessing sufficient computational power to perform image and video processing {{on a larger scale}} and in a much shorter timeframe.|$|E

We removed the bone-patella tendon-bone grafts, the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, the quadriceps tendon-bone grafts, the Achilles tendons, and the peroneus longus tendons from each lower extremity. We tested the tendon grafts with five different types of fixation devices: surgical thread (Premicron 3), general mounting clamp, wire mesh, cement fixation, and a modified clamp for an INSTRON <b>loading</b> <b>machine.</b> The mean failure load in case of surgical thread fixation was (381 N Â± 26 N).

Easy slippages of the ends of the tendons from the cement encasements were observed (253 N Â± 18 N). We then began to use Shiâ€™s clamp that could produce 977 N Â± 416 N peak force.

In this paper, an {{experimental study of}} rock-like materials by uniaxial compression tests is presented using {{a new type of}} high stiff <b>loading</b> <b>machine.</b> Four kinds of rocks were selected, namely, Oya-stone (green tuff), Kobe-tuff, cement mortar and marble stone. Three differrent loading procedures were employed, i. e., static loading, incrementally cyclic loading and cyclic loading in post-failure region (see Fig. 4). The machine used in these experiments has high stiffness about 312 ton/mm, and is capable of controlling either deformation or load of the specimen by mechanical action of the wedges under steel blocks installed in parallel with a specimen. This <b>loading</b> <b>machine</b> is very practical and efficient to obtain complete stress-strain curve of geologic materials. Main results are summarized as follows: (1) Obtained stress-strain curves are resolved into four characteristic regions due to the progress of fracturing, namely, intact, crack, fracture, and flow regions. The strains corresponding to each region are related to the strength, or the fablic of materials. (2) Tests of incrementally cyclic loading show that the envelop of unloading and reloading curve is coincident with the statical loading curve. (3) Relationship between plastic strain and total strain on incrementally cyclic loading are distributed by Weibull's probability.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from IOP Publishing via the DOI in this record. This paper presents a sandwiched piezoelectric transducer (SPT) for energy harvesting in large force environments with increased load capacity and electric power output. The SPT uses (1) flex end-caps to amplify the applied load force so as to increase its power output and (2) a sandwiched piezoelectric-substrate structure to reduce the stress concentration in the piezoelectric material so as to increase the load capacity. A coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element model (CPC-FEM) was developed, which is able to directly predict the electric power output of the SPT connected to a load resistor. The CPC-FEM was used to {{study the effects of}} various parameters of the SPT on the performance to obtain an optimal design. These parameters included the substrate thickness, the end-cap material and thickness, the electrode length, the joint length, the end-cap internal angle and the PZT thickness. A prototype with optimised parameters was tested on a <b>loading</b> <b>machine,</b> and the experimental results were compared with simulation. A good agreement was observed between simulation and experiment. When subjected to a 1 -kN 2 -Hz sinusoidal force applied by the <b>loading</b> <b>machine,</b> the SPT produced an average power of 4. 68 mW. The application of the SPT as a footwear energy harvester was demonstrated by fitting the SPT into a boot and performing the tests on a treadmill, and the SPT generated an average power of 2. 5 mW at a walking speed of 4. 8 km per hour.
