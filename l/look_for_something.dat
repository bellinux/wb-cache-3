25|$|In 1970, he {{was given}} his first parish assignment, the obscure barrio of Banay-banay. He {{was told by the}} other priests not to stay long there because there was nothing much to do there, to which he replied “I will <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> to do.” He visited {{practically}} every house in his parish, meeting with everyone in the process. Up to now, the people in the place which he served for two-and-a-half years remember the tall, kindly priest.|$|E

Why do the excellent people have to be nice?" [...] He prepared to move on and consider more scripts. Two days later his manager persuaded him to reconsider and <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> he liked that he could shape the film into. He took the job, giving Finerman extensive notes on the script and laying out a detailed vision for the film.|$|E
500|$|When {{he began}} {{recording}} Confessions in 2003, Usher claimed {{he did not}} want to work with any new producers. Production began between Usher and Jermaine Dupri, who produced his last two albums, My Way (1997) and 8701 (2001). In spite of his vision, Usher stated, [...] "With this album I chose some new producers who I figured would definitely allow me to really articulate myself in a different way... Every album you gotta grow. You gotta <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> different." [...] Dupri also invited his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox. The album features productions by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Just Blaze, R. Kelly, and Usher's brother James Lackey.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia, {{joined by}} Chief Justice William Rehnquist, dissented, {{accepting}} the Act's stated purpose of [...] "protecting academic freedom" [...] as a sincere and legitimate secular purpose. They construed the term [...] "academic freedom" [...] {{to refer to}} [...] "students' freedom from indoctrination", in this case their freedom [...] "to decide for themselves how life began, based upon a fair and balanced presentation of the scientific evidence". However, they also criticized the first prong of the Lemon test, noting that [...] "to look {{for the sole purpose}} of even a single legislator is probably to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> that does not exist".|$|E
2500|$|However, recent surveys suggest there is, on the contrary, a {{resurgence}} of home music making. In the radio program [...] "Amateurs Help Keep Chamber Music Alive" [...] from 2005, reporter Theresa Schiavone cites a Gallup poll showing {{an increase in the}} sale of stringed instruments in America. Joe Lamond, president of the National Association of Music Manufacturers (NAMM) attributes the increase to a growth of home music-making by adults approaching retirement. [...] "I would really look to the demographics of the [...] boomers", he said in an interview. These people [...] "are starting to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> that matters to them... nothing makes them feel good more than playing music." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{grew up in}} Urbana three houses {{down from}} the Sanderson family -- Milton and Virginia and their boys Steve and Joe. My close friend was Joe. His bedroom was filled with aquariums, terrariums, snakes, hamsters, spiders, and {{butterfly}} and beetle collections. I envied him like crazy. After college he hit the road. He never made a break from his parents, but they rarely knew where he was. Sometimes he came home and his mother would have to sew $100 bills into the seams of his blue jeans. He disappeared in Nicaragua. His body was later identified as a dead Sandinista freedom fighter. From a nice little house surrounded by evergreens {{at the other end}} of Washington Street, he left to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> he needed to find. I believe in Sean Penn's Christopher McCandless. I grew up with him." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 26, the searchers {{found the}} group's {{abandoned}} and badly damaged tent on Kholat Syakhl. The campsite baffled the search party. Mikhail Sharavin, {{the student who}} found the tent, said [...] "the tent was half torn down and covered with snow. It was empty, and all the group's belongings and shoes had been left behind." [...] Investigators said the tent had been cut open from inside. Eight or nine sets of footprints, left by people who were wearing only socks, a single shoe or were even barefoot, could be followed, leading down {{toward the edge of}} a nearby woods, {{on the opposite side of}} the pass, [...] to the north-east. [...] However, after [...] these tracks were covered with snow. At the forest's edge, under a large cedar, the searchers found the visible remains of a small fire, along with the first two bodies, those of Krivonischenko and Doroshenko, shoeless and dressed only in their underwear. The branches on the tree were broken up to five metres high, suggesting that one of the skiers had climbed up to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something,</b> perhaps the camp. Between the cedar and the camp the searchers found three more corpses: Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin, who seemed to have died in poses suggesting that they were attempting to return to the tent. They were found separately at distances of 300, 480 and 630 metres from the tree.|$|E
6000|$|Deringham laughed. [...] "To <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> {{for supper}} in the bush, I believe," [...] he said. [...] "I also fancy {{if there is}} {{anything}} eatable in the vicinity he will find it." ...|$|E
60|$|On Tuesday morning, Pepper chanced {{to go to}} a bureau-drawer {{in which}} he kept his collars, cuffs, neckties and jewelry. He {{commenced}} to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> and ended by turning out everything in the compartment.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, be serious," [...] she announced. [...] "Let's <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> really good.

60|$|Sylvia sat {{silent for}} a few moments, because she understood.

[...] "In a very little while it is exhausted, and then you <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> {{different}} in your wife. You look for friendship and companionship, confidence, consolation in your sorrows, sympathy with your success. Beside all that, the sexual love sinks into nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{at length}} {{we reached the}} outspan I asked the Hottentot, Klaus, who was {{assisting}} me to drive the team, where his master was, for I could not see him anywhere.

60|$|Aaron {{was told}} {{he could have a}} little back room and pension terms for fifteen lire a day, if he stayed at least fifteen days. The {{exchange}} was then at forty-five.

It was decided he should <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> cheaper next day.|$|E
