5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens {{on the outside of}} the carriages were moved from the center of the carriages to next to the doors. There are also differences with the <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the end, a bus {{shows up}} outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward {{claiming}} that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching {{the description of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> on and off.|$|E

At night when the building is closed, the lights are turned off and the flushing action stops.|$|E
25|$|As {{the city}} {{attempted}} {{to mediate the}} dispute, Hunkin-Conkey officials accused the union of featherbedding.

This solution proved acceptable to the union, and workers returned to the site on August 5.|$|E

25|$|Some CFLs will flash {{every few}} seconds even when the room <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is off. This caused by {{a small amount of}} current {{bypassing}} the switch either through a switch pilot light or through the capacitance of the two conductor cable connected between the switch and the CFL or the capacitance between this cable and other mains wiring. A few tens of microamps of current is enough to charge the storage in the CFL power supply up to a voltage sufficient for the CFL to light briefly, discharging the storage and starting the process again.|$|E
25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a <b>light</b> <b>switch)</b> in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This can happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|E

500|$|Head VI was {{the first}} of Bacon's {{paintings}} to reference Velázquez, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of [...] "screaming popes", a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works. Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon's work. The hanging object, which may be a <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> or curtain tassel, can be found even in his late paintings. The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985–86 masterpiece Study for a Self-Portrait—Triptych.|$|E
500|$|During {{one scene}} at the art show, a {{character}} named Orin {{stands in front of}} a blank canvas and stares straight ahead without moving. This style of art exhibition {{is similar to that of}} Marina Abramović, a Yugoslavian performance artist who sits or stands silently and immobile at some of her art exhibits. After seeing herself as a goddess in Jerry's painting, Leslie starts responding when people nickname her Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, beauty and sexuality. While speaking to Ben, Tom describes his seduction ritual with women as turning the lights off with the Clapper, a sound-activated electrical <b>light</b> <b>switch,</b> and then putting on music by Boyz II Men, an R vocal group. This was previously demonstrated in the second-season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", when the group's song [...] "On Bended Knee" [...] was playing while Tom has his girlfriend at his apartment.|$|E
500|$|The {{figure is}} clearly {{identifiable}} as a pope from his clothing. It seems trapped and isolated within {{the outlines of}} an abstract three-dimensional glass cage. This framing device, described by Sylvester as a [...] "space-frame", was to feature heavily throughout the artist's career. A cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case, falling {{just in front of}} the pope's face and partially covering his eyes. It is too indistinctly drawn to identify with certainty, but given the presence of similar objects in Bacon's later works, may be either the end of a hanging <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> or the tassel of a curtain; the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist. Apart from its symbolic meaning, it has a compositional function, framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines. Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973 Triptych, May–June 1973, where it is clearly a dangling light bulb. For Bacon, these elements were intended to make the figure waver in and out of sight for the viewer, alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off, curtains open or closed.|$|E

Sarah, now {{convinced}} of the Dark Presence, helps Alan and Barry to find Cynthia Weaver, a hermit that fears the Dark Presence. She shows them to the [...] "Well-Lit Room" [...] and to a weapon that is able to defeat the Dark Presence: the Clicker, a simple <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> that has been infused {{with the power of}} Alan's writings. Alan returns to Cauldron Lake alone to face the Dark Presence, using his newfound ability to affect reality with his thoughts aided by the Clicker. The Dark Presence is dispelled but {{there is no sign of}} Alice, and Alan believes that to maintain balance, he must give himself to the lake. As Alan sinks below the waters, Alice climbs safely out of the lake. Within the depths of the lake, Alan finds himself in the cabin, and realises that Departure is not yet finished, and turns back to the typewriter to continue the story and write his own means to be free of the lake. He comments to himself that [...] "It's not a lake—it's an ocean." ...|$|E
2500|$|A toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is a switch, most {{commonly}} used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. The toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "click" [...] noise when a person's finger manually flips the toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> into the on/off position. The design for the toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook, New York.|$|E

This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example to drill through studs from a <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> box without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is drilling still remains.|$|E
