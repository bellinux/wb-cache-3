5|$|Sanford's {{opponent}} in the 1992 election was <b>Lauch</b> Faircloth, a former Democrat turned Republican who had served as state Highway Commissioner in Sanford's gubernatorial administration. Enjoying substantial backing from Sanford's Senate colleague, Jesse Helms, Faircloth accused Sanford of being a tax-and-spend liberal bound to special interests. While initial polls showed that Sanford had a comfortable lead over his rival, he lost supporters after an operation for an infected heart valve kept him from campaigning for much of October and raised doubts {{as to whether he}} was capable of serving another term. On November 3, 1992, Faircloth won the election by a 100,000-vote margin.|$|E
