The company applied for an order of prohibition to bar the Director-General from proceeding to recover a sum of $130,241.30 by deducting it from several bankers' guarantees that had been lodged with Customs as security.

50|$|In {{the prior}} version, {{the rules were}} divided into four categories, but the 11 pre-defined terms of Incoterms 2010 are {{subdivided}} into two categories based only on method of delivery. The larger group of seven rules may be used regardless of the method of transport, with the smaller group of four being applicable only to sales that solely involve transportation by water where {{the condition of the}} goods can be verified at the point of <b>loading</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ship. They are therefore not to be used for containerized freight, other combined transport methods, or for transport by road, air or rail.|$|E

To increase {{the capability of}} the smart card software to support more and more services, smart card operating systems have evolved from “dedicated monolithic execution platforms” to more “standard ” operating system architectures that support dynamic code loading. This paper presents real time issues in a particular smart card operating system named Camille which support features like: dynamic code <b>loading,</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> type verification, on board just in time compilation, and operating system component dynamic loading. More generally, it discusses on the difficulties to support real time extensions according to the exo-kernel principles...|$|E

In addition the nearby coast was very rocky and inhospitable.|$|R
