5|$|Coumaphos, an organophosphate, is <b>lipophilic,</b> and so accumulates in wax. Increased {{levels of}} {{compound}} in wax {{have been shown}} to decrease survivorship of developing queens.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} <b>lipophilic</b> and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions, {{they are expected to}} become so hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (<b>lipophilic).</b> In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin {{and other}} pelagic birds are {{excellent}} bioindicators {{of the environment}} as they occupy a high trophic level. Heavy metals and other pollutants are concentrated through the food chain and, as fish are the primary food source for Atlantic puffins, there is great potential for them to bioaccumulate heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic. Measurements can be made on eggs, feathers or internal organs and beached bird surveys, accompanied by chemical analysis of feathers, can be effective indicators of marine pollution by <b>lipophilic</b> substances as well as metals. In fact these surveys {{can be used to}} provide evidence of the adverse effects of a particular pollutant, using fingerprinting techniques to provide evidence suitable for the prosecution of offenders.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More <b>lipophilic</b> derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{penetration}} across the blood–brain barrier, <b>lipophilic</b> beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol {{are more likely than}} other less <b>lipophilic</b> beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances such as insomnia and vivid dreams, and nightmares. Dreaming (rapid eye movement sleep, REM) was reduced and increased awakening.|$|E
25|$|Like all unconjugated steroid hormones, {{progesterone}} is <b>lipophilic</b> and hydrophobic.|$|E
25|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} propranolol therapy {{are similar to}} other <b>lipophilic</b> beta blockers.|$|E
25|$|Other 7-modified CPT analogues are silatecans and karenitecins. They are potent inihibitors on topo I {{and both}} have alkylsilyl groups in {{position}} 7 which make them <b>lipophilic</b> and more stable. Silatecans or 7-silylcampthothecins have shown reduced drug-HSA interactions which contributes to its blood stability and they can also cross the blood brain barrier. DB-67 is a 10-hydroxy derivative and {{is among the most}} active silatecans. BNP1350 which belongs to the series of karenitecins exhibits cytotoxic activity and ability to overcome drug resistance. Still another route to make CPT’s <b>lipophilic</b> is to introduce <b>lipophilic</b> substituents, such as iminomethyl or oxyiminomethyl moieties. One of the most potent compounds is the oxyiminomethyl derivative ST1481 that has the advantage to overcome drug resistance caused by transport systems.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline is {{a highly}} <b>lipophilic</b> {{molecule}} having a log D (octanol/water, pH 7.4) of 3.0, while the log P of the free base was reported as 4.92. Solubility in water is 9.71mg/L at 24°C.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>lipophilic</b> {{thiamine}} derivative to {{be discovered}} was allithiamine, which was isolated from garlic (Allium sativum) in 1951. Allithiamine is an allyl disulfide derivative. After the discovery of allithiamine, several additional derivatives were synthesized {{with the hope that}} they would have better pharmacokinetic properties than thiamine. Thiamine is unable to diffuse across plasma membranes because it has a positively charged thiazole moiety. Instead, it must be transported across plasma membranes by high affinity carriers, and the rate of transport is low. Sulbutiamine overcomes the poor oral bioavailability of thiamine because it is highly <b>lipophilic.</b> The synthesis of sulbutiamine was reported by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Bromazepam binds to the GABA {{receptor}} GABAA, {{causing a}} conformational change {{and increasing the}} inhibitory effects of GABA. Bromazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine and is <b>lipophilic</b> and metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. It does not possess any antidepressant or antipsychotic qualities.|$|E

Neuroimage 49:303-315.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lipophilic</b> second {{messenger}} molecules {{are derived from}} lipids residing in cellular membranes; enzymes stimulated by activated receptors activate the lipids by modifying them. Examples include diacylglycerol and ceramide, the former required for the activation of protein kinase C.|$|E
25|$|The {{values in}} the {{following}} table are from the Dortmund Data Bank. They are sorted by the partition coefficient, smallest to largest (acetamide being hydrophilic, and 2,2',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl <b>lipophilic),</b> and are presented with the temperature at which they were measured (which impacts the values).|$|E
25|$|While {{studies using}} {{semi-permeable}} membrane devices {{have found that}} triclosan does not strongly bioaccumulate, methyl-triclosan is comparatively more stable and <b>lipophilic</b> and thus poses {{a higher risk of}} bioaccumulation. The ability of triclosan to bioaccumulate is affected by its ionization state in different environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Most CB1 antagonists {{reported}} so far {{are close}} analogs or isosteres of rimonabant. A general CB1 inverse agonist pharmacophore model can be extracted from the common features of these analogs, diarylpyrazoles (Figure 4). This pharmacophore contains a cyclic core, C, (e.g. pyrazole in rimonabant) substituted by two aromatic moieties, A and B. A hydrogen bond acceptor unit, D, connects C with a cyclic <b>lipophilic</b> part, E. In some cases unit E directly connects to C. In Figure 4 rimonabant is used as an example. Unit A represents a 4-chlorophenyl group and unit B a 2,4-dichlorophenyl ring. Unit C is the central pyrazole ring and unit D represents the carbonyl group which serves as the hydrogen bond acceptor. Unit E represents a <b>lipophilic</b> aminopiperidinyl moiety.|$|E
25|$|They are {{commonly}} but inaccurately {{referred to as}} dioxins for simplicity, because every PCDD molecule contains a dibenzo-1,4-dioxin skeletal structure, with 1,4-dioxin as the central ring. Members of the PCDD family bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife because of their <b>lipophilic</b> properties, and may cause developmental disturbances and cancer.|$|E
25|$|When {{administered}} orally, ketoconazole is best absorbed at highly acidic levels, so antacids {{or other}} causes of decreased stomach acid levels will lower the drug's absorption. Absorption {{can be increased}} by taking it with an acidic beverage, such as cola. Ketoconazole is very <b>lipophilic</b> and tends to accumulate in fatty tissues.|$|E
25|$|A {{study that}} {{investigated}} the pharmacokinetics of topical progesterone using a hydrophilic (gel), <b>lipophilic,</b> or emulsion-type base {{found that in}} all three cases the time to peak concentrations was around 4nbsp&hours and the elimination half-life was {{in the range of}} 30 to 40nbsp&hours. The venous blood levels observed were very low.|$|E
25|$|Abstral dissolves {{quickly and}} is absorbed through the sublingual mucosa to provide rapid analgesia. Fentanyl {{is a highly}} <b>lipophilic</b> compound, which is well absorbed sublingually and {{generally}} well tolerated. Such forms are particularly useful for breakthrough cancer pain episodes, which are often rapid in onset, short in duration and severe in intensity.|$|E
25|$|Propranolol is {{a highly}} <b>lipophilic</b> drug {{achieving}} high concentrations in the brain. The duration of action of a single oral dose is longer than the half-life and may be up to 12 hours, if the single dose is high enough (e.g., 80mg). Effective plasma concentrations are between 10 and 100mg/l. Toxic levels are associated with plasma concentrations above 2000mg/l.|$|E
25|$|Then {{the polar}} {{carboxyl}} group {{was replaced with}} a more <b>lipophilic</b> tetrazole group {{in order to increase}} oral bioavailability and duration of action further and the compound thus formed was named losartan. This development took place in 1986 and losartan became the first successful Ang II antagonist drug, approved as such in the United States in 1995 and was marketed by Merck.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine is a thiopurine {{linked to}} a second {{heterocycle}} (an imidazole derivative) via a thioether. It is a pale yellow solid with a slightly bitter taste and a melting point of 238–245°C. It is practically insoluble in water and only slightly soluble in <b>lipophilic</b> solvents such as chloroform, ethanol and diethylether. It dissolves in alkaline aqueous solutions, where it hydrolyzes to 6-mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precautions}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Benzodiazepines including oxazepam are <b>lipophilic</b> drugs and rapidly penetrate membranes, so rapidly crosses over into the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines in late pregnancy, especially high doses, may result in floppy infant syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Glutathione (GSH) {{participates in}} {{leukotriene}} synthesis {{and is a}} cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. It is also important as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to <b>lipophilic</b> toxins and waste in the liver during biotransformation before they can {{become part of the}} bile. Glutathione is also needed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxin produced as a byproduct of metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Several {{research}} groups have studied six-membered ring pyrazole bioisosteres. For example, one 2,3-diarylpyridine derivative {{was shown to}} be potent and selective CB1 inverse agonist. The structure of this compound demonstrates {{the possibility that the}} amide moiety of rimonabant could be split into a <b>lipophilic</b> (benzyloxy) and a polar (nitrile) functionality. Other six-membered ring analogs are for example pyrimidines and pyrazines.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit of}} most species of Capsicum {{contains}} capsaicin (methyl-n-vanillyl nonenamide), a <b>lipophilic</b> chemical {{that can produce}} a strong burning sensation (pungency or spiciness) {{in the mouth of}} the unaccustomed eater. Most mammals find this unpleasant, whereas birds are unaffected. The secretion of capsaicin protects the fruit from consumption by insects and mammals, while the bright colors attract birds that will disperse the seeds.|$|E
25|$|In the {{inactive}} state of CB1 rimonabant binds within the transmembrane-3-4-5-6 aromatic microdomain. The binding of rimonabant involves direct aromatic stacking interactions between its 2,4-dichlorophenyl ring and the Trp279/Phe200/Trp356 residues {{on the one}} side and the para-chlorophenyl ring and the Tyr275/Trp255/Phe278 residues on the other side. The <b>lipophilic</b> piperidinyl moiety fits nicely in a cavity formed by the amino acid residues Val196/Phe170/Leu387 and Met384 (Figure 4).|$|E
25|$|Most cannabinoids are <b>lipophilic</b> (fat soluble) {{compounds}} that are easily stored in fat, thus yielding a long elimination half-life {{relative to other}} recreational drugs. The THC molecule, and related compounds, are usually detectable in drug tests from 3 days up to 10 days according to Redwood Laboratories; long-term users can produce positive tests {{for two to three}} months after ceasing cannabis use (see drug test).|$|E
25|$|Although lipid rescue {{mechanism}} of action is not completely understood, the added lipid in the blood stream may act as a sink, allowing {{for the removal of}} <b>lipophilic</b> toxins from affected tissues. This theory is compatible with two studies on lipid rescue for clomipramine toxicity in rabbits and with a clinical report on the use of lipid rescue in veterinary medicine to treat a puppy with moxidectin toxicosis.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{protease}} inhibitors {{include the}} family of lipocalin proteins, which {{play a role in}} cell regulation and differentiation. <b>Lipophilic</b> ligands, attached to lipocalin proteins, have been found to possess tumor protease inhibiting properties. The natural protease inhibitors are {{not to be confused with}} the protease inhibitors used in antiretroviral therapy. Some viruses, with HIV/AIDS among them, depend on proteases in their reproductive cycle. Thus, protease inhibitors are developed as antiviral means.|$|E
25|$|Pleckstrin {{homology}} domain (PH) : PH domains bind phosphoinositides {{with high}} affinity. Specificity for PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 {{have all been}} observed. Given the fact that phosphoinositides are sequestered to various cell membranes (due to their long <b>lipophilic</b> tail) the PH domains usually causes recruitment of the protein in question to a membrane where the protein can exert a certain function in cell signalling, cytoskeletal reorganization or membrane trafficking.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{effects of}} triazolam {{are similar to}} those of most other benzodiazepines. Triazolam does not generate active metabolites. Triazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine, is <b>lipophilic,</b> and is metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. The main pharmacological effects of triazolam are the enhancement of the neurotransmitter GABA at the GABAA receptor. The half-life of triazolam is only 2 hours making it a very short acting benzodiazepine drug. Triazolam has anticonvulsant effects on brain function.|$|E
25|$|Sulbutiamine (brand name: Arcalion) is a {{synthetic}} derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1). As a dimer of two modified thiamine molecules, it is a <b>lipophilic</b> compound that crosses the blood–brain barrier {{more readily than}} thiamine and increases the levels of thiamine and thiamine phosphate esters in the brain. Sulbutiamine was discovered in Japan {{in an effort to}} develop more useful thiamine derivatives since it was hoped that increasing the lipophilicity of thiamine would result in better pharmacokinetic properties.|$|E
25|$|Rivastigmine {{tartrate}} is a {{white to}} off-white, fine crystalline powder that is both <b>lipophilic</b> (soluble in fats) and hydrophilic (soluble in water). It comes {{in a variety of}} administrations including a capsule, solution and a transdermal patch. Like other cholinesterase inhibitors, it requires doses to be increased gradually over several weeks; this is usually referred to as the titration phase. Oral doses of rivastigmine should be titrated with a 3mg per day increment every 2 to 4 weeks.|$|E
