40|$|The {{boundary}} condition at the solid surface {{is one of}} the important problems for the microfluidics. In this paper we study the effects of the channel sizes on the {{boundary condition}}s (BC), using the hybrid computation scheme adjoining the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the continuum fluid mechanics. We could reproduce the three types of boundary conditions (slip, no-slip and locking) over the multiscale channel sizes. The slip lengths are found to be mainly dependent on the interfacial parameters with the fixed apparent shear rate. The channel size has little effects on the slip lengths if the size is above a critical value within a couple of tens of molecular diameters. We explore the <b>liquid</b> <b>particle</b> distributions nearest the solid walls and found that the slip boundary condition always corresponds to the uniform <b>liquid</b> <b>particle</b> distributions parallel to the solid walls, while the no-slip or locking boundary conditions correspond to the ordered liquid structures close to the solid walls. The slip, no-slip and locking interfacial parameters yield the positive, zero and negative slip lengths respectively. The three types of boundary conditions existing in "microscale" still occur in "macroscale". However, the slip lengths weakly dependent on the channel sizes yield the real shear rates and the slip velocity relative to the solid wall traveling speed approaching those with the no-slip boundary condition when the channel size is larger than thousands of liquid molecular diameters for all of the three types of interfacial parameters, leading to the quasi-no-slip boundary conditions.

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} effect of nanometer-sized aircraft-induced aqueous sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O) {{particles}} on atmospheric ozone as a function of temperature.

We confirm large scale model results that at temperatures T> 210 K additional ozone loss – mainly caused by hydrolysis of BrONO 2 and N 2 O 5 – scales in proportion with the aviation-produced increase of the background aerosol surface area. However, at lower temperatures (< 210 K) we isolate two effects which efficiently reduce the aircraft-induced perturbation: (1) background particles growth due to H 2 O and HNO 3 uptake enhance scavenging losses of aviation-produced <b>liquid</b> <b>particle...</b>|$|E

Lidar experiments are {{well suited to}} observe and classify polar stratospheric clouds. On 5 January 2005 a PSC was observed simultaneously on {{the east and west}} sides of the Scandinavian mountains by ground-based lidars. This cloud was composed of <b>liquid</b> <b>particles</b> with a mixture of solid particles in {{the upper part of the}} cloud. Multi-colour measurements revealed that the <b>liquid</b> <b>particles</b> had a mode radius of r? 300 nm, a distribution width of ?? 1. 04 and an altitude dependent number density of N? 2 ? 20 cm ? 3. Simulations with a microphysical box model show that the cloud had formed about 20 h before observation. High HNO 3 concentrations in the PSC of 40 ? 50 weight percent were simulated in the altitude regions where the <b>liquid</b> <b>particles</b> were observed, while this concentration was reduced to about 10 weight percent in that part of the cloud where a mixture between solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>particles</b> was observed by the lidar. The model simulations also revealed a very narrow particle size distribution with values similar to the lidar observations. Below and above the cloud almost no HNO 3 uptake was simulated. Although the PSC shows distinct wave signatures, no gravity wave activity was observed in the temperature profiles measured by the lidars and meteorological analyses support this observation. The observed cloud must have formed in a wave field above Iceland about 20 h prior to the measurements and the cloud wave pattern was advected by the background wind to Scandinavia. In this wave field above Iceland temperatures potentially dropped below the ice formation temperature, so that ice clouds may have formed which can act as condensation nuclei for the nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles observed at the cloud top above Esrange...|$|R
