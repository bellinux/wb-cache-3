Bacteriol. 86 : 898 – 903. 1963. —The extracellular polysaccharide {{produced by}} the “Jackson-mucoid” strain of <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus</b> was isolated and purified by three different procedures. The component sugars of the polysaccharide were identified by paper chromatography and confirmed by infrared analysis. Galacturonic acid, galactose, glucose, and 6 -deoxy-talose were identified. Contrary to a previous report from this laboratory, fucose was {{not found to be}} a component of this polysaccharide...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} susceptibility {{of infants}} fed on cows' milk preparations has been attributed, {{at least in}} part, to differences {{in the nature of}} the large-bowel content—owing to the acidity of the faeces and their high content of <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus.</b> In an attempt to mimic these features of the breastfed infant in one who is fed artificially, a breast milk substitute was devised which resembles breast milk in several important ways.

40|$|Cell-free {{extracts}} of 17 {{strains of}} Bifidobacterium bifidum (<b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus)</b> were examined {{for the presence}} of aldolase, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, and fructose- 6 -phosphate phosphoketolase. All strains turned out to lack aldolase, an enzyme unique to glycolysis, and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, characteristic of the hexosemonophosphate pathway. In all strains, fructose- 6 -phosphate phosphoketolase could be demonstrated. It can be concluded that bifidobacteria ferment glucose via a pathway which is different from those found in members of the genus Lactobacillus. The results strengthen the previous suggestions that classification of the bifidobacteria in the genus Lactobacillus is not justified...|$|E
40|$|The first {{organism}} of the bifidobacteria {{was isolated}} from the feces of breast fed infants by Tissier (1) who called it Bacillus bifidus. Since that time bifidobacteria have been supposed {{to play an important}} role in nutrition and resistance to infection in breast fed infants. These organisms are also found in the human adult intestine, vagina, and mouth, and in the alimentary tract of various kinds of animals. In the past much confusion existed regarding the taxonomy of the bifidobacteria, partly because of the incomplete methods. available for identifi-cation of organisms, and partly because of their pleomorphism. During the past dec-ade, however, significant progress has been made in this field, facilitating a more defin-itive speciation of the bifidobacteria (2 - 11). This paper proposes to review briefly some recent advances in the knowledge of the taxonomy of the bifidobacteria and to pres-ent research on some aspects of the ecolog-ical relationships of bifidobacteria. Classification For many years bifidobacteria were in-cluded in the genus <b>Lactobacillus</b> as Lacto-bacillus <b>bifidus,</b> but they are now classified in a separate genus Bifidobacterium as sug-gested by Orla-Jensen (12) on the basis of their characteristic morphology, biochemi-cal characters, cell wall constituents, and DNA base composition (13 - 16). In the past, several workers recognized only one species in the genus Bifidobacter-ium (12, 14, 17), but Reuter (3) has pro-posed on the basis of carbohydrate fermen-tation eight species and several biotypes for strains isolated from human infants and adults. He recognized the following species and biotypes in the genus Bifidobacterium: Bifidobacterium bifidum a and b, Bifidobac-terium infantis, Bifidobacterium parvulorum a and b, Bifidobacterium breve a and b...|$|R

About two thirds of seventy patients hospitalized in our urological department complained some intestinal disorders. To correct these symptoms, Biosmin was applied with the results as follows: 1. Administration of Biosmin corrected intestinal disorders, especially frequency and nature of feces. 2. Effects of Biosmin, when administered eight grams per day, appeared approximately on the third day, {{and it seemed that}} Biosmin should be dosed as much as possible. 3. By administration of Biosmin with antibiotics, such a complication of antibiotics as diarrhea could be avoided. 4.

40|$|Escherichia coli {{was found}} in a similar {{proportion}} of stool specimens from infants who were breast-fed and from others fed on three different artificial-milk preparations. When E. coli was present its mean colony count in the stools of breast-fed infants was within the range of the mean counts for infants receiving the artificial -milk feeds. There was no consistent relation between high counts of bifidobacteria (<b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus)</b> and low counts of E. coli. This suggests that measures aimed at implanting or stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria in the large intestine of artificially fed infants may not greatly influence the E. coli population therein. The results are discussed in relation to the protection of artifically fed infants from E. coli enteritis...|$|E
40|$|Of all the {{intestinal}} bacteria to be detected in guinea pigs, <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus</b> {{is the most}} numerous. L. bifidus may exert a favorable influence on {{the growth of the}} host animals. To prove this, experiments were carried out in germfree guinea pigs, to which the organisms were given orally and their growth was compared with the growth of the controls. Oral administration of L. bifidus markedly accelerated the increase of body weight, indicating that it affects the growth favorably. The M_ 1 strain of Escherichia coli, which invariably kills germfree guinea pigs by causing sepsis, did not cause any fatal disease in the germfree guinea pigs to which L. bifidus had previously been administered orally. This seems to indicate that L. bifidus, once lodged in the intestines of germfree guinea pigs, has an inhibitory action on pathogenic organisms that may later invade the host animals...|$|E
40|$|For six {{strains of}} Bifidobacterium bifidum (<b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus),</b> {{fermentation}} balances of glucose, lactose, galactose, mannitol, and xylose were determined. Products formed were acetate, l(+) -lactate, ethyl alcohol, and formate. l(+) -Lactate dehydrogenase of all strains studied {{was found to}} have an absolute requirement for fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate. The phosphoroclastic enzyme could not be demonstrated in cell-free extracts. Cell suspensions fermented pyruvate to equimolar amounts of acetate and formate. Alcohol dehydrogenase was shown in cell-free extracts. Possible explanations have been suggested for the differences in fermentation balances found for different strains and carbon sources. By enzyme determinations, it was shown that bifidobacteria convert mannitol to fructose- 6 -phosphate by an inducible polyol dehydrogenase and fructokinase. For one strain of B. bifidum, molar growth yields of glucose, lactose, galactose, and mannitol were determined. The mean value of Y (ATP), calculated from molar growth yields and fermentation balances, was 11. 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of human milk {{for the growth}} of <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus</b> var. Penn was compared with that of other species. The average relative activity was highest for human colostrum, closely followed by rat colostrum, then by human milk, rat milk, and cow's colostrum. The milk of ruminants (cow, ewe, goat) showed only very slight activity. Somewhat higher activity was found in the milk of cat, monkey, dog, donkey, rabbit, mare, and sow. The bifidus growth factor has been demonstrated in high concentration in various secretions in man, such as saliva, semen, amniotic fluid, meconium, and tears. Hog gastric mucin which has a high blood-group titer has also shown a high titer for bifidus factor, while other nitrogencontaining polysaccharides were free or almost free of bifidus factor. Ammonium salts and N-acetylglucosamine as well as N-acetylgalactosamine, especially the ammonium salts, in high concentration, were active, probably as precursors of the growth factor...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in guinea pigs raised in an {{germ-free}} environment, using the apparatus HMC- 2 type which was developed in our department, to study bactericidal power of the sera and phagocytic power of the leukocytes, to determine titers of hemolytic complement, and to investigate changes in these values resulting from infection with the organisms of Escherichia coli group and Lactobacillus group, singly or in combination. The following observations were made: 1. The sera of germ-free guinea pigs, when infected with the organisms of Lactobacillus acidophilus, had a lower bactericidal power against strain 0 - 901 of Salmonella typhi than did those of the germ-free guinea pigs infected with strain F 6 of Esch. coli. The sera of the latter were nearly as powerful against the bacteria as those of conventional guinea pigs. 2. Bactericidal power of the sera of the germ-free guinea pigs infected with strain Ml of Esch. coli and the organisms of <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus</b> in combination was {{lower than that of}} the sera of the germ-free guinea pigs infected with strain F 6 of Esch. coli singly. Bactericidal power of the former, however, was a little higher than that of conventional guinea pigs. 3. The leukocytes of germ-free guinea pigs had a lower phagocytic power against Terajima strain of Staphylococcus aureus than did those of conventional guinea pigs. Phagocytic power of the leukocytes of the germ-free guinea pigs infected with strain M 1 of Esch. coli and the organisms of <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus</b> in combination was higher than that of germ-free guinea pigs, but was lower than that of conventional guinea pigs. 4. Opsonic action of the sera of germ-free guinea pigs was less powerful than that of conventional guinea pigs except in one case. 5. The titers of hemolytic complement of the sera of conventional guinea pigs tended to increase {{with the passage of time}} during a period of growth. In the case of germ-free guinea pigs, however, the increase was delayed, and the values tended to show irregular fluctuations. 6. The effect of initial infection of germ-free guinea pigs with the bacteria on the titers of hemolytic complement was obscure...|$|E

Bacteriol. 86 : 656 – 665. 1963. —Electron microscopy of cytoplasmic complexes and the cytoplasmic fine structure of Actinomyces bovis, A. israelii, A. naeslundii, and A. propionicus demonstrated marked differences among these four species. Also {{included in the}} present study was <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus,</b> an organism closely related to the Actinomyces species. A relatively small and compact cytoplasmic membrane complex of A. propionicus was unique in its morphology. Membrane structures of A. naeslundii and A. israelii were relatively large and consisted of coils of various sizes of the cytoplasmic membrane. No membrane complexes were found in L. bifidus or A. bovis. Measurements of cell-wall thickness indicated a significant difference between A. bovis and A. israelii. On the basis of general morphology, cell-wall thickness, and cytoplasmic membrane complexes, A. bovis and A. israelii appear to be distinct species. The relation of the fine structure complexity to phylogenetic position of these organisms is considered...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus</b> ("B. bifidus") {{was first}} described, by Tissier (1899), as constituting {{almost the entire}} flora of the stools of breast-fed infants. In subse-quent {{publications}} (1905, 1906, 1908), {{he found that the}} predominating organism in the stools of bottle-fed infants was Lactobacillus acidophilus ("B. acidophilus"), which, however, was first isolated, also from nurslings ' stools, by Moro (1900). Tissier (1905) and Moro (1905) agreed that L. acidophilus was present in the feces of breast-fed infants in small numbers. Interest in the isolation and growth requirements of L. bifidus was stimulated by its apparently unique occurrence in the stools of nurslings since it was surmised that the presence of these organisms in the intestines was of physiologic significance and might prevent intestinal disorders caused by other bacteria. The original observations of Tissier concern-ing the predominance of L. bifidus in nurslings ' stools have been amply con-firmed. However, the factors responsible for the establishment and maintenance of this bacterial flora in the colon of the breast-fed infant are still unknown. As seen in smears of stools, the organisms are gram-positive, straight or curve...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{globular}} swellings {{known to}} appear occasionally in {{cultures of the}} bifid bacteria {{have been shown to}} occur in all known types of <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus.</b> The swellings developed on a substrate which permitted abundant growth. The development of the globular involution forms was prevented by the addition of tryptic digest of cow’s milk to the substrate. The similarity between the globular forms of L. bimus and protoplasts is mentioned. The globular forms are considered to be organisms with incomplete cell walls which develop on a substrate adequate for growth but not for normal cell wall synthesis. There are in the literature on the bifid bacteria (Lactobacillus bijdus) repeated notes on the occurrence of globular involution forms. Tissier (1900) stated that the whole organism can swell and give a bladder-like appearance as a response to acidity, extreme temperatures or inadequate nitrogen sources in the sub-strate. Orla-Jensen (1943) described his Bacterium bifidum strain no. 9 as extremely irregular with strongly clavate swellings. He assumed a relationship between morphology and physiological properties, and proposed as a possi...|$|E

40|$|The {{induction}} of pleomorphism of <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus</b> by NaCl {{was completely}} inhibited by CaCl 2. When the organism was cultivated in calcium-free medium, {{growth of the}} bifid form was exclusively observed. Supplementation of calcium ion in the medium caused bacilloid growth. Chemical analyses indicated that calcium content of the bifid form organisms was significantly {{less than that of}} the bacilloid form; i. e., in the former type, there was an approximately 30 % decrease of calcium in the whole cells, and an 82 % decrease in the cell wall, as compared with the respective content of the latter. These results indicate a suppressing role of calcium ion in the induction of pleomorphism of L. bifidus. Besides calcium content, sugar and amino acid compositions were shown to be different between the bifid and bacilloid forms. In the cell wall especially, the content of glucose in the bifid form was larger than that in the bacilloid form. Methionine and phenylalanine were present in the bifid form, but not in the bacilloid form. Cell walls of the bifid form organisms lacked a larger molecular weight peptidoglycan (7. 5 S) which was clearly detected in the bacilloid form. Evidence has been given for the relationships of calcium ion and cell wall components to the pleomorphism in L. bifidus...|$|E
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} sensitivity {{patterns of}} gram-positive, nonsporeforming, anaerobic bacilli variously classed as <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus,</b> Actinomyces bifidus, or Bifidobacterium were studied by the plate dilution method. A total of 34 strains, mostly from human feces, was studied. Three species, B. longum, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum, were represented with 11, 11, and 6 strains, respectively. The other six strains fell into four other species. Most strains {{of all types}} resisted 100 μg/ml or more of neomycin, polymyxin B, and nalidixic acid. They were somewhat less resistant to kanamycin and still less so to streptomycin. All strains were inhibited by less than 1 μg/ml of penicillin G and erythromycin, by 3. 1 units or less per ml of bacitracin, by 3. 1 μg/ml or less of chloramphenicol, and by 6. 2 μg/ml or less of tetracycline and lincomycin. Most strains were inhibited by 3. 1 μg/ml of vancomycin. Results were very variable with cephalothin and nitrofurantoin, with some strains quite resistant. With half of the drugs tested, there were moderate differences in sensitivity between different species. These data are discussed {{in relation to the}} effect of antimicrobial agents on bifid bacilli in the normal human fecal flora, in relation to the implications thereof, and in relation to the usefulness of several agents (particularly neomycin, nalidixic acid, and polymyxin B) in selective media for Bifidobacterium...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work on the}} elucidation of {{structures}} of dextrans, and their degradation by enzymes, has dealt mainly with those containing the 'branching' linkage. The aim of the present work has been (a) to extend {{what is known about}} the fine structures of dextrans containing [alpha]- 1 - 3 'branching' linkages, (b) to study dextrans containing [alpha]- 1 - 4 and [alpha]- 1 - 2 'branching' linkages, and (c) to examine the action pattern of several enzymes capable of degrading such dextrans. Standard techniques used in the structural studies have included infrared analysis, periodate oxidation followed by examination of the fragments left (before and after reduction), acid hydrolysis, acetolysis and methylation. Techniques described which have not previously been used on dextrans are glucamylolysis and catalytic oxidation (followed by a study of the modified dextrans). Since one of the key compounds involved, an aldobiouronic acid containing the linkage, was not previously known, it was necessary to carry out certain studies on the catalytic oxidation of a glycosideof maltose, from which the required compound could be isolated. After completion of the present work the acidhas been isolated by other workers 184 the properties being almost identical with the ones obtained in the present investigation. The work describes the action pattern of three dextranase enzymes on 'branched' dextrans, in particular a dextran containing [alpha]- 1 - 4 'branching'.

40|$|A mucoid {{variant of}} <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus</b> was first {{described}} byIMalyoth and Bauer (1950, 1951). Colonies of this variant incubated anaero-bically on solid media {{were said to}} be hygroscopic and to become watery on exposure to atmospheric conditions at room temperature. In the first paper, attempts to demonstrate capsules by staining and by suspension in India ink were re-ported as unsuccessful. If the organisms were stained following suspension in freshly ground Chinese ink, however, capsules were seen. In the second paper, it was reported that capsules may be demonstrated also by means of a phase-contrast microscope when suspensions of or-ganisms are exposed to specific immune serum. In our laboratory the occurrence of mucoid variants or mutants of L. bifidus often has been observed. Occasionally a rare mucoid colony may be found in growth from the original inocu-lum. When strains of L. bifidus isolated from the stools of breast-fed infants are carried in the chemically defined medium of Norris et al. (1950) by periodic transfers, mucoid colonies may ap-pear among the smooth parent colonies. Growth in broth is likewise more viscid than that of the parent type. So far as is now known, the cultural requirements of the organisms appear to be the same as those of the parent type, and differences in agglutination reactions between them have not been detected by Williams et al. (1953). Al-though the mucoid organisms appear to be a variant of the smooth parent type, they have not been observed to revert to the parent type. Like the parent type, however, a change to aerobic straight rods, so-called Lactobacillus parabifidus, frequently occurs. At the same time the mucoid character of the colonies is lost...|$|E
40|$|Background—It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the acidity of gastric contents could be an important factor in regulating jejunal flora.  Aims—To investigate the effects of omeprazole induced changes in gastric pH on jejunal flora and bile acid metabolism.  Methods—Twenty one patients with gastric ulcer and 19 healthy volunteers were studied. Deconjugation of bile acids was detected using a bile acid breath test. Jejunal fluid was aspirated using a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip and deconjugation was examined using thin layer chromatography. Fat malabsorption was detected by a triolein breath test.  Results—In the bile acid breath test, expired breath samples from all patients and healthy volunteers showed significantly greater 14 CO 2 specific activity after omeprazole treatment (20 mg/day) than before treatment. Bacterial overgrowth was found in the jejunal fluid and gastric juice of both ulcer patients and healthy volunteers after omeprazole treatment. The following species were identified: Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, enterococcus, <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus,</b> Bacteroides vulgatus, B uniformis, Eubacterium lentum, Eu parvum, and Corynebacterium granulosum. All of these species, except E coli and C albicans, deconjugate bile acids. There was a significant correlation between 14 CO 2 activity and gastric pH, both before and after omeprazole treatment in both groups. The triolein breath test revealed impaired fat absorption in both groups after omeprazole treatment.  Conclusions—Both patients with gastric ulcer and healthy volunteers exhibited increased deconjugation of bile acids caused by bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum and fat malabsorption after omeprazole treatment. The bacterial overgrowth consisted of both anaerobes and aerobes with deconjugation ability and was probably associated with an omeprazole induced shift to neutral pH in the gastric juice. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{ascertain}} the fact that if the oral administration of Miyarisan, a drug for infant, composed of the spores of certain strain of Clostridium butylicum, causes any changes in the population numbers of bacteria among the intestinal bacterial flora residing in the intestine of infant. The drug of 0. 6 gr. per day was given orally to infant. The ages of twelve infants were varied from two to six months after birth. The experimental periods of time, which mean consecutive days of administration of the drug, were distributed from three to twenty one days. The bacterial flora, such as Clostridium butylicum, <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus,</b> Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, were recovered from the faeces of infants using selction culture media suitable for each bacterial strain. Ebbs and flows in bacterial population numbers of the objected strains were as follows; (1) Cl. butylicum was not recovered through-out all experiments. (2) In all experiments, E. coli did not showed any particular changes in its population numbers. (3) Generally, L. acidophilus, L. bifidus and St. faecalis decreased in their population numbers at the bigining of experiments, but their population numbers increased afterwards. (4) Respect to L. bifidus, ten out of eleven experiments, excluding one experiment, the bacteria showed the tendency of increasing in their population numbers, particularly four out of the ten experiments showed clear increasing in their population numbers. From the above-mentioned results, we could draw the conclusion that the oral administration of Miyarisan possibly played an important role in the multiplication of L. bifidus in the intestines of infants...|$|E
40|$|The hyperlipeniia {{induced by}} a fat meal in anginal {{patients}} is frequently associated with clinical and electrocardiographic changes suggesting transient coronary insufficiency. Gastric mucin administered to 10 anginal {{patients at the}} same time as a fat meal invariably prevented the hyperlipemnia, evaluated as increase of plasma optical density, and in one half of the cases it reduced the magnitude of the electrocardiographic changes as compared with the changes found in control experiments. Gastric mucin therefore exerts a powerful antilipemic and clearing action. Its inhibitory effect on the electro-cardiographic changes associated with alimentary hyperlipemia is less evident than that of heparin. IN A previous paper 1 on plasma turbidity and electrocardiographic changes associ-ated with alimentary hyperlipemia, we dem-onstrated that both the foregoing changes were inhibited when heparin was adminis-tered intravenously {{at the same time}} as the fat meal. We discussed in that paper the interpretation of this phenomenon and its possible relationship with the pathogenesis of postprandial angina and arterial atheroma. Capraro and his associates, 5 Cresseri, 2 - 4 and Cantonej 7 - 9 as a result of their researches on the biologic properties of hog gastric mucin extracts, recently clarified some points of con-siderable interest concerning the effect of such extracts on certain plasma conditions that many investigators believe to be related with atherogenesis or with frank atheromatous conditions.
