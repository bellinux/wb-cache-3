After immersing the tissue segment into the <b>loading</b> <b>well,</b> the loading process is driven by a syringe withdrawing a constant flow rate of buffer solution {{at the far end}} of the loading channel. This causes the transport of the artery towards its dedicated position. This is done with closed fixation and superfusion in/outlet lines. After stopping the pump, sub-atmospheric pressure is applied through one of the fixation channels. Then after sealing the <b>loading</b> <b>well</b> shut, the second fixation channel is subjected to a sub-atmospheric pressure. Now the artery is symmetrically established in the inspection area, and a transmural pressure is felt by the segment.

40|$|Abstract Background Koi Herpesvirus (KHV) affects both {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} common carp and koi, and is especially lethal to fry. The high mortalities {{caused by the}} disease have had {{a negative impact on}} the international koi trade. Different diagnostic techniques have been used to detect KHV, including: isolation of the virus in cell culture, electron microscopy, several PCR tests, ELISA and in situ hybridisation. All of these methods are time consuming, laborious and require specialised equipment. Results A rapid field diagnosis of KHV in common and koi carp was developed using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The LAMP reaction rapidly amplified nucleic acid with high specificity and efficiency under isothermal conditions using a simple water bath. Two methods of extracting DNA from host tissue were compared: extraction by boiling and by using a commercial extraction kit. A set of six primers – two inner primers, two outer primers and two loop primers – was designed from a KHV amplicon. The reaction conditions were optimised for detection of KHV in 60 min at 65 °C using Bst (Bacillus stearothermophilus) DNA polymerase. When visualised by gel electrophoresis, the products of the KHV LAMP assay appeared as a ladder pattern, with many bands of different sizes from 50 base-pairs (bp) up to the <b>loading</b> <b>well.</b> The KHV LAMP product could also be simply detected visually by adding SYBR Green I to the reaction tube and observing a colour change from orange to green. All samples positive for KHV by visual detection were confirmed positive by gel electrophoresis. The KHV LAMP had the same sensitivity as a standard PCR assay for the detection of KHV. Conclusion This paper describes an accelerated LAMP assay for diagnosis of KHV. The entire procedure took only 90 minutes to produce a result: 15 minutes for DNA extraction; 60 min for the LAMP reaction; 2 min for visual detection using SYBR Green I. The test can be used under field conditions because the only equipment it requires is a water bath. </p...|$|E

The {{purpose of a}} stent is {{to help keep the}} portion of the blood vessel that has been treated with angioplasty open after the procedure. Stents have been used to help substantially reduce the restenosis associated with angioplasty procedures. Two broad categories of stents are self-expanding and balloon expanding. Balloon expandable stents have been available for several years, but the application of shape memory alloys to the manufacture of stents is relatively new. The differences between the two stents stem mainly from the material of construction. Self-expanding stents are investigated in this study. In particular, the mechanical response of a bare stent made of a shape memory alloy (SMA), Nitinol is investigated here. The Nitinol stent is investigated experimentally and using finite element methodology (FEM). The Guidant Absolute Nitinol Stent is experimentally tested for various uniaxial tensile loading conditions. In addition the stent specimen was subject to compressive, and crush loads as well. The stent geometry was rendered using computer aided design (CAD) software, Solidworks. Several different lengths of the stent were created, but only 7. 30, 10. 87, 14. 42 mm stents were subject to the same uniaxial tensile, and compression loads. The crush test was not simulated. In addition three modifications to the Absolute stent geometry were also created and tested for the same uniaxial tensile loads. Results from the simulation were validated against the experimentally acquired results. Comparison of the simulation and experimental results reveals that the load-strain relationship from the different simulated lengths is similar to that found experimentally. The simulation represented the elastic region of the Nitinol stent under tensile <b>loading</b> <b>well.</b> The experimental results showed a steeper elastic region, which was accounted for by the increased length of the stent. The load-strain curve comparison reveals that the load at which the Nitinol undergoes phase transformation is 0. 9 N from experiment and approximately 0. 7 N from the simulations. The model correctly predicted the locations of concentrated stress, in turn, accurately identifying the regions that would be expected to suffer structural failure. Moreover, the geometry modifications reveal a dependence of the stiffness of the stent on the number, location, and length of the bridge elements...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Apple {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} horticultural crops of Iran. Its production in the country stands in the second place after citrus. Iran holds the fourth place in the world production of apples and gains a major share in the export of this product. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the quantity and quality of the fruit in order to maintain and promote its position among the countries importing this product from Iran. Most of the mechanical damages to fruits and vegetables occur due to contact stresses under static, quasi-static and impact loading. To obtain stress distribution inside the fruit we can use finite element analysis. The aim of this study was to simulate the behavior of the apple as a viscoelastic body subjected to quasi-static loading and also to determine the failure criteria (maximum normal stress or shear stress) of apple flesh to estimate its susceptibility to mechanical bruising. Materials and methods: In this study, Golab kohanz apple was used. Two samples were removed from each apple using a core sampler, one was used for uniaxial compression and the other was used for confined compression test using Instron universal tension and compression machine. Spherical indenter and parallel plate tests were performed in order to study apple susceptibility to bruising at four deformation levels (1, 2, 3 and 4 mm) and the bruise volume was then measured after 24 hours. Stress-strain curves were plotted and then, the elastic and viscoelastic properties were obtained. Then, by using the data obtained from apple properties, the apple was modeled in Abaqus software as spherical and cylindrical shapes with viscoelastic behavior subjected to quasi-static loadings. Results and Discussion: The normal stress distribution of the modeled apple in the shape of a cylindrical sample is shown in Fig. 4. The value of maximum normal stress was obtained (0. 51 MPa) at the contact point of the loading plate with the sample. Experimental and modeled stress-strain curves are shown in Fig. 5. Up to the bio-yield point, the two curves are nearly matched; and beyond that point, there are some overestimations in the predicted stress values. The location and pattern of failure have often been used to explain the cause of failure in fruits. When specimens of fruit are subjected to a uniaxial compression, the failure often occurs the maximum shear stress plane. Failure patterns in the tested samples indicate that the failure occurs due to shear stresses. Another explanation that has been used by researchers for shear failure is the bruising position inside the fruit after loading. The position of bruising in most of the tested apples was a distance away from the apple surface (Fig. 7). According to the experiments results at the three deformation levels of 2, 3, and 4 mm, the maximum generated normal stress inside the apple was above the point of failure of the cylindrical samples. Based on the empirical results, the bruising was almost zero for the apples subjected to one or two mm deformation (Fig. 9 a). The experimental value of the shear strength of the Golab kahanz apple was obtained to be 0. 23 MPa. The maximum shear stress inside the modeled apple due to the two mm deformation was 0. 195 MPa, which was lower than the shear strength of the apple. On the other hand, by applying three and four mm of deformation, the maximum shear stresses were obtained to be 0. 24 and 0. 26 MPa, respectively, indicating that the induced stress exceeded the shear strength of apple flesh; therefore, the bruising was observed in the flesh of these apples. The location of the maximum shear stress corresponds to the location of bruising in the tested samples as shown in Fig. 9 b. According to the obtained results from the modeling in the finite element software, we can use this software in order to recognize and investigate the damages in agricultural products during different loading conditions (Harvesting, transportation, packaging and storage). Conclusions: In this work, Golab apple was considered as a viscoelastic material and its behavior under quasistatic loading was modeled using finite element method. Elastic, viscoelastic properties and shear strength of apple flesh were obtained and used in the simulation. Comparison of modeling and experimental results shows that the model simulates the behavior of apples during quasistatic <b>loading</b> <b>well.</b> The location of bruise occurrence in the flesh of tested apple and the location of maximum shear stress in the simulated apple was the same. Therefore, the maximum shear stress criterion can be used to estimate the susceptibility of apple varieties to internal bruising under quasistatic loading.
