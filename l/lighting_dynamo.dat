40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the case study}} of an interdisciplinary course in Energy Economy that was developed at the Energy Engineering Graduate Program at Başkent University. The course integrated several unique pedagogical features to satisfy the aim of developing a working knowledge in energy economy with an energy systems perspective. The novel aspects of the course thematically led to a capstone research project where 5 teams of 17 course participants analyzed their prioritized solutions towards improving the energy self-sufficiency of the campus based on the practice of energy economy. The results of the teams’ solutions towards a net-zero energy/exergy campus included electric buses for city-campus transport, poly-generation for the new Arts Center, LED/OLED lighting for campus <b>lighting,</b> <b>dynamo</b> driven/piezoelectric sports center, biofuels from the university-owned dairy products farm, and an energy efficient technology incubation center. This unique course with participatory learning is compared with others before concluding that the case study is a useful international example for energy economy...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Light</b> <b>Dynamo</b> #2 by Heinz Mack, 1966, {{aluminum}} and glass with motor, Honolulu Museum of Art ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{known for}} his minimalist outdoor sculptures, Mack also {{produced}} smaller works, both static and kinetic. <b>Light</b> <b>Dynamo</b> #2 from 1966, {{in the collection of}} the Honolulu Museum of Art, is an example of his rotating disc kinetic sculptures. Since 1991, he has been producing brightly colored, abstract, paintings in acrylic.|$|R
50|$|The {{two seat}} body was built {{in-house}} from aluminium over a wood frame and supplied with a folding hood (top) and one piece windscreen. Although the first cars featured acetylene <b>lights,</b> a <b>dynamo</b> <b>lighting</b> set {{was provided by}} 1921.|$|R
50|$|Of the few {{designs that}} were {{manufactured}} in quantity, {{those of the}} Hult Brothers Rotary Steam Engine Company of Stockholm, Sweden, and the spherical engine of Beauchamp Tower are notable. Tower's engines were used by the Great Eastern Railway to drive <b>lighting</b> <b>dynamos</b> on their locomotives, and by the Admiralty for driving dynamos on board the ships of the Royal Navy. They were eventually replaced in these niche applications by steam turbines.|$|R
50|$|In 1925, the Standard's price {{had dropped}} to £95, and the Aero £130, {{compared}} to £149 for an Austin Chummy. Electric <b>lighting</b> by <b>dynamo</b> became standard that year.|$|R
50|$|The utility {{was founded}} in 1888 by Parker F. Morey and Edward L. Eastham as Willamette Falls Electric Company. On June 3, 1889 it sent power {{generated}} by one of four brush arc <b>light</b> <b>dynamos</b> at Willamette Falls over a 14-mile electric power transmission line to Portland, the first US power plant to do so.On August 6, 1892, Morey, Frederick Van Voorhies Holman, and Henry Failing formed the Portland General Electric Company. It was funded by General Electric and the investment arm of Old Colony Trust, with $4.25 million in capital. The newly formed PGE Company purchased Willamette Falls Electric and the Albina Light & Water Company in 1892.|$|R
50|$|Vélo'v bicycles, {{along with}} a lock and basket, contain {{electronic}} components which allow the bicycle to be identified by the stations, allow tracking of kilometers traveled, tracking of {{the condition of the}} bicycles, (<b>lights,</b> brakes, <b>dynamo),</b> and collection of detailed statistics about the usage of the bicycles.|$|R
50|$|Trenton was {{the first}} U.S. Navy ship to have {{electric}} <b>lights.</b> A <b>dynamo,</b> engine, and <b>lights</b> were installed {{in the summer of}} 1883. The successful use of electricity on this ship led to the installation of electricity on the first ships of the New Steel Navy.|$|R
50|$|This {{remained}} the business's name from foundation until 1967. This watch chronometer and instrument makers business {{was established by}} Samuel Smith in London in 1851. Their premises were in The Strand and they were watchmakers to the Admiralty. Retailing and wholesaling of Smiths-branded motor accessories was added in 1904 when a Watford supplier turned out Smith's first speedometer—The Perfect Speed Indicator. Growth was fast. Smiths began to manufacture {{some of their own}} motor products particularly speedometers. From mid-1913 all motor accessories activities were carried out from handsome purpose-built premises at Speedometer House, 179-185 Great Portland Street ("Motor Row"). The premises in the Strand became a Lyons tearoom but jewellers establishments were retained at Trafalgar Square and 68 Piccadilly. By this time motor accessories production included Smiths multiple-jet carburettors (designed by Trier & Martin), lighting sets, headlamps, sidelights, tail <b>lights,</b> <b>dynamo</b> and electric starters, generators and the Smith's Auto-Clear mechanical horn.|$|R
25|$|To produce {{light when}} the bike is stationary, some <b>dynamo</b> <b>lights</b> have a stand light facility, usually a single blue-white (front light) or red (rear light) LED {{powered by a}} capacitor, which runs for around five minutes.|$|R
2500|$|Low-power LEDs are {{sufficient}} for riding on well-lit streets, {{but do not}} generally project a very bright beam as {{it is difficult to}} collimate the output from multiple LEDs into a single usable beam. [...] This can be overcome by using a few very high-power LEDs - each with their own optics. It is now possible to buy LED equivalents for halogen rechargeable systems (including drop-in replacement bulbs), and LED <b>lights</b> for <b>dynamos.</b> On a dynamo, LEDs produce more light than halogen lights at very low speeds (down to 3km/h according to one manufacturer).|$|R
50|$|Tel-O-Fun {{bikes are}} {{equipped}} with locks and sling backs, and they contain electronic components that allow for their identification by bike stations, track ride, bike mode (<b>lighting,</b> brakes, <b>dynamo),</b> and collecting statistical data on bicycle use. The bicycles are manufactured by the company Panther (Panther Werke) in Germany, and have three gears. They're adapted for women and men alike. Bike parts are not easily broken (the seat is irremovable), {{and they are not}} standard sizes. Tel-O-Fun's bicycle parts don't fit standard bicycles, to prevent the theft and reselling of bicycles and bicycle parts.|$|R

50|$|They are simple, {{relative}} to other bicycles. They are all-steel single speed with 28 in wheels, fenders, fully covered chain, sprung leather saddle, rear rack and rod brakes (a handlebar lever connects directly to the brake pads), double stand (PA02 and PA06) or side stand (PB13). Like the Ford Model T, they are only available in one colour, black, except for the flare of vanilla at the fender tips. They can be equipped with a <b>dynamo</b> <b>lighting</b> set.|$|R
25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels and powered every time a magnet on the wheel spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries. The advantages are pretty much the same as with <b>dynamo</b> <b>lighting</b> while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary city {{bikes are}} {{increasingly}} {{found in many}} European cities, including Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Dutch and Danish-made city bikes often include such features as a clear skirt guard, colors other than black, aluminum alloy or chromoly steel frame, front suspension fork, suspension seatpost, Hub <b>dynamo,</b> <b>dynamo</b> <b>lighting</b> with motion-and-darkness detection, magnetic lights, a 7- or 8-speed hub, adjustable kickstand, child seats, and a headlight integrated into the front fork. Newer German models, on the other hand, tend to incorporate a less is more philosophy.|$|R

25|$|Toe-clips and toestraps and {{clipless}} pedals {{help keep}} the foot locked in the proper pedal position and enable cyclists to pull and push the pedals. Technical accessories include cyclocomputers for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include lights, reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers, bags, water bottles and cages, and bell. Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, <b>dynamos,</b> <b>lights,</b> fenders, racks and bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high visibility clothing.|$|R
50|$|In the field, {{the girls}} use their {{bicycles}} as <b>dynamos,</b> <b>lighting</b> {{it up with}} their bicycle lamps. However, as Gruber shoots the plane and makes one of its wheels come off, it does not land, but returns to England instead. Since René cannot be picked up, {{he returns to the}} café, where Edith is dancing with Monsieur Alfonse. Yvette announces to everybody, that she is pregnant, but just as she is about to reveal who the father is, René walks into the café. Thus, she cannot say it, but faints instead. To keep Edith's mind off the father, René dances with her.|$|R

50|$|One type of {{mechanically}} powered flashlight has {{a winding}} crank and spring {{connected to a}} small electrical generator (dynamo). Some types use the dynamo to charge a capacitor or battery, while others only <b>light</b> while the <b>dynamo</b> is moving. Others generate electricity using electromagnetic induction. They use a strong permanent magnet that can freely slide {{up and down a}} tube, passing through a coil of wire as it does. Shaking the flashlight will charge a capacitor or a rechargeable battery that supplies current to a light source. Such flashlights can be useful during an emergency, when utility power and batteries may not be available. Dynamo-powered flashlights were popular during the Second World War since replacement batteries were difficult to find.|$|R
2500|$|Under the International Vienna Convention on Road Traffic (1968) of the United Nations, {{a bicycle}} is a vehicle. [...] Article 44 of the Convention {{stipulates}} that: [...] "Cycles without an engine in international traffic shall: (c) Be {{equipped with a}} red reflecting device at the rear and with devices such that the cycle can show a white or selective-yellow light {{to the front and}} a red light to the rear." [...] In some countries, for example France, it may be an offence even to sell a bicycle not fitted with legally compliant lighting system. Germany requires that all bikes over 11kg be fitted with compliant <b>dynamo</b> <b>lighting</b> systems, but even lightweight bikes are required to be fitted with lights (battery powered lights allowed) except when racing. However, not all countries impose this requirement on cyclists.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1853, {{as indicated by the}} wrought iron lintel of the door, by an order of Narcis Fonsdeviela, Marques de la Torre. The building is attributed to the architect Josep Roca i Bros who built the most of public works at that time. Initially it was a Gristmill, first of Watermills benefit from the irrigation of Alguemà river, passing through Pont del Princep (also called Rec the molins). On the back passes an artificial canal which until 1950 generated its own <b>light</b> with a <b>dynamo.</b> One of the first owners was Manuel Lleonci, Councilman of Figueres (1862). In that time the mill worked 200 days a year with an average of six hours per day. The property passed in 1899 to Miquel Plana Goytisolo who was the owner of the Granja Avícola del Molí de la Torre, along with his partner Miquel Sola.|$|R
50|$|In 1910 Arthur Roussel {{was hired}} to build a machine that would enable the public to view a film inside their home. Pathé Frères {{introduced}} a 28 mm film size for home use. 28 mm film was preferable because it wasn’t as flammable as the nitrate based 35 mm film, usage of the 28 mm film also gave Pathé Frères exclusivity, by way of patents. The 28 mm wide film had one sprocket hole per frame on one edge of the film, 3 on the other; the large image size of 19 mm x 14 mm allowed the projected picture to be of a very high quality.The 28 mm Pathéscope K.O.K. cine-projector was patented in 1911. This projector featured <b>dynamo</b> <b>lighting</b> which was “powered by a belt from a large flywheel connected to the main shaft. The handle had to be manually turned in order to project a 30 inch picture. The projector “sold for 30 dollars which included two printed films, a screen, metal carrying case and cleaning outfit.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} small, two room museum with a {{collection}} of Edison memorabilia such as historic <b>light</b> bulbs, phonographs, <b>dynamos</b> and portions of Edison's electric train test track. Tours are available for free but the Edison Tower Memorial Corporation recommends you donate at least $5.00 per person. Souvenirs are also available at the museum. After it was put on the list of New Jersey's most endangered historic sites in 1997 (the tower was closed in 1992 after slabs or concrete started falling from the 54-year-old freestanding structure), the Edison Township Memorial Corporation started a $3.875 million renovation. On October 24th, 2015, the end of the restoration was marked by a rededication ceremony which included the relighting of the tower. In the future, there are plans to build a new, larger museum featuring many hands-on activities, and exhibits with artifacts. Surrounding the two historic acres is a small forest with a couple of trails. In the forest are a small pond, a meadow and several ravines that are visible from the trail. On Christie Street, the world's first street lit by electric lights, there are several informative boards describing Menlo Park in the Edison Era.|$|R
5000|$|Extremely bright arc {{lights were}} too bright, {{and with the}} high {{voltages}} and sparking/fire hazard, too dangerous to use indoors. In 1878 inventor Thomas Edison saw a market for a system that could bring electric lighting directly into a customer's business or home, a niche not served by arc lighting systems. After devising a commercially viable incandescent light bulb 1879, Edison went on to develop the first large scale investor-owned electric illumination [...] "utility" [...] in lower Manhattan, eventually serving one square mile with 6 [...] "jumbo dynamos" [...] housed at Pearl Street Station. [...] When service began in September 1882, there were 85 customers with 400 <b>light</b> bulbs. Each <b>dynamo</b> produced 100 kW- enough for 1200 incandescent lights, and transmission was at 110 V via underground conduits. The system cost $300,000 to build with installation of the 100000 ft of underground conduits {{one of the most}} expensive parts of the project. Operating expenses exceeded income in the first two years and fire destroyed the plant in 1890. Further, Edison had a three wire system so that either 110 V or 220 V could be supplied to power some motors.|$|R
40|$|Observations {{of various}} solar-type stars along decades {{revealed}} {{that they can}} have magnetic cycles, just like our Sun. An investigation of the relation between their cycle length and rotation period can shed <b>light</b> on the <b>dynamo</b> mechanisms operating in these stars. Previous works on this relation suggested that the stars could be separated into active and inactive branches, with the Sun falling between them. In this work, we determined short magnetic activity cycles for 6 active solar-type stars observed by the Kepler telescope. The method adopted here estimates the activity from the excess in the residuals of the transitlight curves. This excess is obtained by subtracting a spotless model transit from the light curve, and then integrating over all the residuals during the transit. The presence of long term periodicity is estimated from the analysis of a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the complete time series. Finally, we investigate the rotation-cycle period relation for the stars analysed here and find that some active stars do not follow the behaviour proposed earlier, falling in the inactive branch. In addition, we also notice a considerable spread from other stars in the literature in the active/inactive branches.
