5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, Room Service, significant portions of the album were produced while on tour. According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made it a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> record the album. Adams recorded the album while on tour, making use of the time between playing on stage and readying himself for the next gig. Vallance and Adams recorded the album normally while sitting backstage or in an hotel room with small devices which they usually carried along on tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up mattresses against the windows, and having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E
500|$|Guggenheim {{says while}} it would've been a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> use one format, {{it would not}} have had the same impact. [...] "Each format has its own feel and texture and touch. For the {{storytelling}} of what Gore’s memory was like of growing up on the farm, some of this 8mm stuff that I shot is very impressionistic. And for some of his memories of his son’s accident, these grainy black-and-white stills... have a feel that contrasted very beautifully with the crisp hi-def HD that we shot. Every format was used to its best potential. Some of the footage of Katrina has this blown-out video, where the [...] is just blasted, and it looks real muddy, but that too has its own kind of powerful, impactful feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|Diary of a Camper and {{the films}} that it {{inspired}} were initially called [...] "Quake movies"; the term machinima was later coined in 1998, {{in response to}} the increasing use of other game engines. There was initial hesitance to retroactively label Diary of a Camper the first machinima piece; a Machinima.com article from February 2000 opened, [...] "It's kinda hard to pin down the first Machinima: things like the Doom speedruns, the Stunt Island stuff and the Demo Scene all compete for the title. However, it's a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> pin down the first piece of film made in a 3D game engine: Diary Of A Camper". Marino states that the AMAS carefully defined machinima in 2002 as [...] "animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment" [...] to separate machinima from its creative lineage. Separating machinima from the demoscene and earlier demo recordings, he defines Diary of a Camper as the first machinima work. Lowood also contrasts the film with earlier recordings of [...] "documented gameplay".|$|E

[...] It said that there had been an overall improvement in the fourth season, and that [...] "this could become some of the best Star Trek ever made".

500|$|Space Gun {{was well}} {{received}} by the video game press. In issue 34 of Zero, Amaya Lopex gave the original arcade version of the game {{four out of five}} stars. Jonnie Cook of Sinclair User described the arcade release as enjoyable to those that already liked the genre, but stated he preferred other games. Killer List of Videogames called the cabinet design [...] "quite unique". In March 1992, Gary Whitta of Advanced Computer Entertainment magazine stated that the sections that scroll into the screen are a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> play than the horizontally scrolling sections. The screen can quickly fill up with enemies, which can lead to confusion as to what the player is shooting at, especially when human hostages run across the screen as they can be inadvertently killed. Neil West of Amiga Format commented that the title has a high difficulty level and that power-ups are a necessity to continue playing. The [...] "not perfect" [...] rapid fire weapon (which needs recharging after prolonged use) contributes to the game's difficulty, as stated by Brian Sharp of Games-X magazine.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Countdown to Extinction {{was written in}} two {{different}} sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, {{in the fall of}} 1991. The album was recorded {{in the first half of}} 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o'clock because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: [...] "There’s nothing worse than getting a creative moment and you have to leave. It was like a school bell ringing." [...] The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that Countdown to Extinction [...] "was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and you just know it". He also said that it didn't take the band a long time to record the album because [...] "records were a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> make back then because the pressure wasn't quite as hard".|$|E

500|$|The {{proprietary}} Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for {{the game}} to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities, and the Euphoria and Bullet engines handle further animation and environment rendering tasks. The team found they could render the game world with greater detail than in Grand Theft Auto IV because they had {{become familiar with the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360's hardware. Art director Aaron Garbut said that while the consoles' ageing hardware were tiring to work with, the team could still render detailed lighting and shadows and [...] "maintain a consistent look". Vice president Dan Houser agreed and felt that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was a challenge, but added [...] "now we know what the hardware's capable of, so it's become a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> move things along and a lot more fun, too". The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions fit onto one Blu-Ray Disc; Xbox 360 copies are distributed on two DVD discs and require an 8 GB installation on the HDD or external storage device; while the Microsoft Windows (PC) version takes up seven DVD disks. The team asserted that any differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions would be negligible.|$|E
500|$|On Stranger Tides {{also had}} {{positive}} reviews; some critics found {{the film to}} be entertaining and well-made. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, describing it as [...] "the most fun installment since the first", calling the story [...] "pure cartoon, but a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> follow than the other sequels", and summing as [...] "the franchise is getting tired, but Penelope energizes it." [...] Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, writing that it [...] "feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails". She said that Marshall [...] "swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism" [...] and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances. Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall [...] "shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she [...] "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" [...] and had [...] "lively sexual tension" [...] with Depp. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from [...] "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a [...] "fresh villain" [...] whose [...] "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere". Variety's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. [...] "It has nary an original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he [...] "not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade." ...|$|E

5000|$|Working {{closely with}} Josh Kaufman, the pair {{recorded}} the album mostly as a duo: [...] "Most {{of the album}} was just me and Josh.

[...] She had assumed the name Hossein until her divorce.|$|R
2500|$|Campaign finance expert Jan Baran, {{a member}} of the Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, agreed with the decision, writing that [...] "The history of {{campaign}} finance reform is the history of incumbent politicians seeking to muzzle speakers, any speakers, particularly those who might publicly criticize them and their legislation. It is a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> legislate against unions, gun owners, 'fat cat' bankers, health insurance companies and any other industry or 'special interest' group when they can't talk back." [...] Baran further noted that in general conservatives and libertarians praised the ruling's preservation of the First Amendment and freedom of speech, but that liberals and campaign finance reformers criticized it as greatly expanding the role of corporate money in politics.|$|E
2500|$|The group {{considers}} {{itself to}} have officially formed in January 2006, when its first lineup came together. Vocalist Ann Yu and drummer/keyboardist David Farrell, {{who had previously}} played together in several bands, were preparing to relocate to Los Angeles, California because, according to Yu, [...] "it's a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> find other musicians that are serious about making {{a career out of}} [...] " [...] there. The move was abruptly canceled as the band began to form. Bassist and friend Jesse Hayes became available when his punk rock band Time in Malta split up; then, in January, Yu and Farrell met guitarist Ted Parker through a Craigslist classified advertisement. A few weeks later, the band played its first gig in Los Angeles.|$|E

Jones wrote [...] "Thinking About You" [...] in 1999 with Ilhan Ersahin, her then-bandmate in Wax Poetic, but she thought it {{was too much of a}} pop song for her to record and {{rejected}} a version she recorded for Feels like Home. Jones had an acoustic guitar with her on the tour and wrote more songs with it than she previously had: [...] "The guitar is simple and a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> carry than a piano", she said.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, {{after two}} albums and an EP, Samhain was signed {{to a major}} label by Rubin {{and the name of}} the band was changed to Danzig to allow the band to retain its name in the event of line-up changes.

2500|$|Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times said, [...] "By {{trying so}} hard for authenticity, this Doctor Zhivago drains the story of much of its lyricism.... Mr. Lean's grander, glossier version was a closer match to the romantic spirit of the novel's hero.... The Davies version is engrossing but more for the {{harrowing}} scenes set {{in the civil war}} after the revolution than for the novel's legendary love triangle. Black-and-white archival photographs - Moscow slums, newspaper shots of soldiers marching off to World War I - are interspersed throughout the film and slowly bleed into a scene of the television show. The visual trick gives the series a quasi-documentary feel and is quite effective. Yet Mr. Davies takes the same liberties with Pasternak's text as the original film did, focusing on the love story and discarding a lot of the politics, secondary plots and literary sidetracks.... This Doctor Zhivago can be watched as a useful history lesson and as a cautionary show business tale: it is a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> adapt a Jane Austen novel than it is to remake a film by David Lean." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{synchronous}} abstraction makes reasoning {{about time}} in a synchronous program a <b>lot</b> <b>easier,</b> thanks <b>to</b> the notion of logical ticks: a synchronous program reacts to its environment in a sequence of ticks, and computations within a tick {{are assumed to be}} instantaneous, i.e., as if the processor executing them were infinitely fast. The statement “a||b” is therefore abstracted as the package “ab” where “a” and “b” are simultaneous. To take a concrete example, the Esterel statement “every 60 second emit minute” specifies that the signal “minute” is exactly synchronous with the 60-th occurrence of the signal “second”. At a more fundamental level, the synchronous abstraction eliminates the non-determinism resulting from the interleaving of concurrent behaviors. This allows deterministic semantics, therefore making synchronous programs amenable to formal analysis, verification and certified code generation, and usable as formal specification formalisms.|$|R
