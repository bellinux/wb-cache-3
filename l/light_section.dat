500|$|St Ceidio's is {{constructed}} of rubble masonry, dressed with freestone. [...] The roof {{is made of}} slate, {{and there is a}} stone 19th-century bellcote at the west end. The roof trusses {{can be seen from the}} inside. Entrance is through a round-headed doorway in the north wall at the west end. Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales) says that this doorway is from the 14th century, but a 2009 guide to the buildings of north-west Wales says that it may date from the 17th century. Inside, there is no internal structural division between the nave and the chancel apart from a single step. There are four windows, all with clear leaded glass: the east window is the oldest, dating from the 14th century. [...] It has a single <b>light</b> (<b>section</b> of window) with some tracery at the top and an external hoodmould. [...] The two windows in the south wall and the window in the north wall date from the 19th century, and are set in rectangular frames; the windows are topped with trefoils.|$|E

The lighter {{areas of the}} picture were treated heavier and opaque with a generous amount of white lead mixed into the paint. Light falling on the painting in a <b>light</b> <b>section</b> is reflected back at the viewer. The effect is a startling realism and three-dimensional quality.

Sijo In The Light, like the defunct Sijo West, featured original English-language sijo, as well as essays and reviews. Gross, meanwhile, has maintained a significant presence for sijo on his website Poetry in theWORDshop, which includes translations from Korean masters as well as original contributions by contemporary poets.

50|$|With this method, light {{enters the}} eye {{through a narrow}} to medium slit (2 to 4 mm) {{to one side of}} the area to be examined. The axes of {{illuminating}} and viewing path do not intersect at the point of image focus, to achieve this; the illuminating prism is decentered by rotating it about its vertical axis off the normal position. In this way, reflected, indirect light illuminates the area of the anterior chamber or cornea to be examined. The observed corneal area then lies between the incident <b>light</b> <b>section</b> through the cornea and the irradiated area of the iris. Observation is thus against a comparatively dark background.|$|E
50|$|The tramway was {{originally}} designed to be worked by horses and gravity. During busy periods, 2 or 3 horses were required to work the summit section between the top of No. 3 incline and the Rhiwbach incline. Sometime in the 1920s petrol locomotives were introduced to work this section and a small shed was built in which the locomotive was kept. The practice was not entirely successful, as the locomotive was too heavy for the track materials used, {{and parts of the}} tramway were relaid in <b>light</b> <b>section</b> flat-bottomed rail or heavier section bridge rail. In 1953 the Rhiwbach Quarry closed, leaving the Cwt y Bugail Quarry as the only user of the main section of the tramway.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{consisted of}} a stringer-skin structure supported by large numbers of <b>light</b> <b>section</b> frames; these frames were attached to Z-section stringers which were in turn rivetted to the skin. A semi-circular spine-like reinforcing beam was to traverse {{the full length of}} the fuselage for strength and to stiffen the structure. The entirety of the fuselage was to be pressurised, including its two underfloor cargo holds; the only exceptions being far end of the tail and the landing gear bays. A total of eighteen semi-circular windows, similar to those used on the earlier Vickers Viscount, were to be set into the fuselage along with front and rear entrance doors and a total of six emergency exits. The floor of the main cabin was to be constructed so that it could withstand up to 75lb/sq ft in the center sections while the outer sections were to support up to 150lb/sq ft.|$|E
