50|$|A <b>limber</b> <b>hole</b> is a {{drain hole}} through a frame or other {{structural}} {{member of a}} boat designed to prevent water from accumulating against {{one side of the}} frame, and allowing it to drain toward the bilge. Limber holes are common in the bilges of wooden boats. The term may be extended to cover drain holes in floors. Limber holes are created in between bulkheads so that one compartment does not fill with water. The limber holes allow water to drain into the lowest part of the bilge {{so that it can be}} pumped out by a single bilge pump (or more usually, one electric and one manual pump).|$|E

50|$|Bilges {{may contain}} {{partitions}} to damp {{the rush of}} water {{from side to side}} and fore and aft to avoid destabilizing the ship due to the free surface effect. Partitions may contain <b>limber</b> <b>holes</b> to allow water to flow at a controlled rate into lower compartments.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, using a ROV, DSSI/Oceaneering {{returned}} to the site and took video recordings of the imploded remains of a submarine, which had markings in English, and propeller guards and <b>limber</b> <b>holes</b> identical {{to those of the}} Grunion. The following year, the US Navy confirmed that the find was the Grunion.|$|R
50|$|A horn-shaped {{ventilation}} cowl {{is usually}} fitted facing {{forward to a}} large hole {{at the top of}} the chamber at one end of the box with another large hole opening down into the boat from the chamber at the other end. <b>Limber</b> <b>holes</b> perforate the wall of the box at the floor of each chamber.|$|R

Two lookouts {{are posted}} next to the periscope shears. Her bow planes are rigged in, main gun visible on deck aft. Notice the <b>limber</b> <b>holes</b> and saddle ballast tanks.|$|R
50|$|Bulkheads made of panels {{were set}} into {{the tops of the}} floors to divide the hull into compartments. These were not watertight, as {{centrally}} placed <b>limber</b> <b>holes</b> run through the floor for the drainage of the bilge. While the presence of bulkheads invites comparisons with Chinese ships, the ones on the Kadakkarapally Boat are different in that Chinese bulkheads are watertight and thus serve a somewhat different function.|$|R
50|$|Another {{characteristic}} of junks, interior compartments or bulkheads, strengthened {{the ship and}} slowed flooding in case of holing. Ships built in this manner were written of in Zhu Yu's book Pingzhou Table Talks, published by 1119 during the Song Dynasty. Again, this type of construction for Chinese ship hulls was attested to by the Moroccan Muslim Berber traveler Ibn Batutta (1304-1377 AD), who described it in great detail (refer to Technology of the Song Dynasty). Although some historians have questioned whether the compartments were watertight, most believe that watertight compartments did exist in Chinese junks because {{although most of the}} time there were small paassage ways (known as <b>limber</b> <b>holes)</b> between compartments, these could be blocked with stoppers and such stoppers have been identified in wrecks. All wrecks discovered so far have limber holes; these are different from the free flooding holes that are located only in the foremost and aftermost compartments, but are {{at the base of the}} transverse bulkheads allowing water in each compartment to drain to the lowest compartment, thus facilitating pumping. It is believed from evidence in wrecks that the <b>limber</b> <b>holes</b> could be stopped either to allow the carriage of liquid cargoes or to isolate a compartment that had sprung a leak.|$|R
50|$|Improved Akula-I Hulls: K-328 Leopard, K-461 Volk, K-154 Tigr, K-419 Kuzbass, K-295 Samara and K-152 Nerpa. These {{submarines}} {{are much}} quieter than early Akula class submarines and {{all have the}} SOCKS hydrodynamic sensors except Leopard. The Akula-I Improved submarines have six 533 mm decoy launching tubes, as do subsequent submarines. They have a different arrangement of <b>limber</b> <b>holes</b> on the outer hull than Akula Is. Nerpa and Iribis (not completed) have a different rescue chamber in the sail, which can be distinguished by the large dome on the top surface.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{numerous}} foreign primary sources that hint {{to the existence}} of true watertight compartments in junks, historians such as Joseph Needham proposed that the <b>limber</b> <b>holes</b> were stopped up as noted above in case of leakage. He addresses the quite separate issue of free-flooding compartments on pg 422 of Science and Civilisation in Ancient China: Less well known is the interesting fact that in some types of Chinese craft the foremost(and less frequently also the aftermost) compartments is made free-flooding. Holes are purposely contrived in the planking. This is the case with the salt-boats which shoot the rapdown from Tzuliuching in Szechuan, the gondola-shaped boats of the Poyang Lake, and many sea going junks. The Szechuanese boatmen say that this reduces resistance to the water to a minimum, though such a claim makes absolutely no hydrodynamic sense, and the device is thought to cushion the shocks of pounding when the boat pitches heavily in the rapids, as it acquires and discharges water ballast rapidly supposedly just at the time when it is most desirable to counteract buffeting at stem and stern. As with too many such claims, there has been no empirical testing of them and it seems unlikely that the claims would stand up to such testing since the diameter or number of holes needed for such rapid flooding and discharging would be so great as to significantly weaken the vulnerable fore and aft parts of the vessel. The sailors say, as sailors {{all over the world are}} inclined to do wen conjuring up answer to landlubbers' questions, that it stops junks flying up into the wind. It may be the reality at the bottom of the following story, related by Liu Ching-Shu of the +5th century, in his book I Yuan (Garden of Strange Things)In Fu-Nan (Cambodia) gold is always used in transactions. Once there were (some people who) having hired a boat to go from east to west near and far, had not reached their destination when the time came for the payment of the pound (of gold) which had been agreed upon. They therefore wished to reduce the quantity (to be paid). The master of the ship then played a trick upon them. He made (as it were) a way for the water to enter the bottom of the boat, which seemed to be about to sink, and remained stationary, moving neither forward nor backward. All the passengers were very frightened and came to make offerings. The boat (afterwards) returned to its original state.This, however, would seem to have involved openings which could be controlled, and the water pumped out afterwards. This was easily effected in China (still seen in Kuangtung and Hong Kong), but the practice was also known in England, where the compartment was called the 'wet-well', and the boat in which it was built, a 'well-smack'. If the tradition is right that such boats date in Europe from +1712 then it may well be that the Chinese bulkhead principle was introduced twice, first for small coastal fishing boats at the end of the seventeenth century, and then for large ships a century later. However, the wet well is probably a case of parallel invention since its manner of construction is quite different from that of Chinese junks, the wet well quite often not running the full width of the boat, but only occupying the central part of the hull either side of the keel. [...] More to the point [...] wet wells were apparent in Roman small craft of the 5th century CE.|$|R
