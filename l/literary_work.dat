40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the publication of translations, specifically the under-representation of <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> in one language of limited diffusion (LLD), the Malay language, in English translation. It sets out to examine the role of two parties which are thought to {{play a vital role in}} the publication of Malay <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> in English translation for international consumption: publishers in the United Kingdom and the translation organisation in Malaysia. The aim of the research, more specifically, is to investigate how both parties bear upon the translation of Malay <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> into English. Some of the questions which are central to {{the issue of the}} publication of Malay <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> in English translation include: To what extent are the two parties involved in the publication of Malay <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> in English translation for international consumption? What are the policies of these organisations where the translation of Malay <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> and other <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> in LLD are concerned? Who decides what to translate? What factors are taken into account in deciding what to publish in English translation? Given that this thesis sets out to examine the role of the two parties mentioned above, two main strategies have been employed: surveys and case studies. Drawing on responses from individuals from publishing companies, translation organisations, and other organisations which support translation, I have been able to show that the problem in the publication of Malay <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> in English translation is not merely a translation problem but also a problem of image and promotion. This study thus details the different forces working against the translation of Malay <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> into English for international consumption...|$|R
40|$|Teaching {{literature}} {{cannot be}} separated from the existence of <b>literary</b> <b>works.</b> Teaching literature at school can be a tool to improve the lack of students’ attitude and morality by introducing and delivering the masterpiece values of Indonesian <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> to the students. By reading the <b>literary</b> <b>works,</b> our nation’s experi- ences—sadness-happiness, bitterness-sweetness, and cleverness-stupidness expe- riences—which occur in the <b>literary</b> <b>works</b> can enrich their religious faiths and make them to be the wise individuals in sharing their own life. This will lead them until they grow up and they will have the fruitful knowledge. One of the main problems occuring in the literature teaching is the mixing of a part of the Indone- sian language teaching materials. The impact influences many things, such the lack of teaching time and students are uninterested in <b>literary</b> <b>works.</b> The literature teaching becomes unpleasant.

5|$|Because of his {{willingness}} to tackle such issues as prostitution, extramarital sex and lesbianism, Moore's novels were initially met with disapproval. However, as the public's taste for realist fiction grew, this subsided. Moore began to find success as an art critic {{with the publication of}} books such as Impressions and Opinions (1891) and Modern Painting (1893)—which was the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience. By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of his <b>literary</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hebel was {{interested}} in botany, natural history and other subjects. His <b>literary</b> <b>work</b> began with Allemannische Gedichte, which {{is perhaps the most}} popular work written in Alemannic. He had success with his calendar stories in the Badischer Landkalender, and later with Rheinländischer Hausfreund (Rhenish family friend), but a dispute between Catholics forced him to resign as editor of the calendar. In his last years he devoted himself increasingly to religion, becoming a prelate in 1819, but his wish to become a parish priest was never fulfilled. His last works were biblical stories for young readers, which served as textbooks until 1855. Hebel died 1826 in Schwetzingen. Goethe, Tolstoy, Gottfried Keller, Hermann Hesse and other writers have praised his works.|$|E

The Halmidi inscription, the earliest attested full-length inscription in the Kannada language and script, dates from 450 CE, while the earliest available <b>literary</b> <b>work,</b> the Kavirajamarga, has been dated to 850 CE.
