40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} contrast-detail (CD) {{characteristics}} of screen-film (SF) and postprocessed digital images {{by using a}} phantom-based method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Images of a CD phantom with polymerized methyl methacrylate were acquired with SF and full-field digital mammography systems at matched exposure conditions. A four-alternative forced-choice experiment was conducted with seven observers participating in the study. Each observer was required to identify randomly <b>located</b> <b>disks</b> in phantom images from which detection curves were computed. The CD diagrams for the SF and digital systems were estimated from the detection curves and compared at 50 % and 62. 5 % threshold levels. Furthermore, a theoretic model was used to estimate the CD performance of the SF and digital systems. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance for mixed models was used with the natural logarithm of disk thickness as the dependent variable, the natural logarithm of disk diameter as the covariate, and the observer as a random factor. The results of statistical analysis indicated {{significant differences between the}} CD characteristics of SF and digital mammographic images at both 50 % (PCONCLUSION: The authors conclude that digital CD curves, on average, exhibit threshold contrast characteristics that are lower (better) than those of SF mammography...|$|R

In this paper, we analyzed the observations of an active region filament and critically evaluated the observed properties in the context of current filament formation models.

The line-of-sight motions of the filament, which was <b>located</b> near <b>disk</b> center, have been analyzed inferring the Doppler velocities.

40|$|In {{the near}} future, large digital media servers are {{expected}} to offer storage capacities {{in the order of}} petabytes. Servers made of clusters of PC's connected to jukeboxes may represent an interesting alternative compared with servers made of arrays of magnetic disks. However, due to disk exchange overhead, higher seek times and lower data transfer rates, access to data <b>located</b> on optical <b>disks</b> is significantly slower than access to data <b>located</b> on magnetic <b>disks.</b> In the present contribution, we analyze the benefits and limitations of striping files across multiple optical disks in order to speedup the retrieval of large pieces of information. We also show that server applications requiring both computer power and I/O bandwidth may be distributed over several processing nodes and access files striped over multiple optical disks. For such applications, as long as disk exchanges are not necessary, a predictable speedup can be obtained by ensuring a high enough number of server computers, optical disk drive units, and enough communication bandwidth...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} {{results of}} a comprehensive analysis of the Lenz effect due to motion of artificial heart valves during magnetic resonance imaging. The interaction of rotating metallic heart valves with magnetic fields is studied by performing a time-domain analysis of the corresponding electromagnetic problem. We applied the finite element method (FEM) to solve the T − Ω formulation of Maxwell equations in two cases: first, for metallic <b>disks</b> <b>located</b> in the high intensity homogenous field of the magnet iso-center, and second, <b>disks</b> <b>located</b> in the non-uniform fringe field of the bore entrance. We showed that for valves with full solid disks (such as Starr-Edwards 6500) located in the magnet iso-center, the magnitude of adverse forces can be comparable to the forces applied by the beating heart. However, for rings which consist of multiply connected conductive regions, skin effect and proximity effect counteract, {{which leads to a}} diminished magnetic force. Results of this study show that mechanical heart valves with strengthening rings may be considered safe even under ultra-high imaging conditions with field intensities as high as 10 T. However, heart valves with full conducting disks should be considered as a contraindication to MR imaging...|$|R
