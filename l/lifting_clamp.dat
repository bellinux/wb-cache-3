25|$|Liquid is {{the primary}} {{component}} of hydraulic systems, which take advantage of Pascal's law to provide fluid power. Devices such as pumps and waterwheels {{have been used to}} change liquid motion into mechanical work since ancient times. Oils are forced through hydraulic pumps, which transmit this force to hydraulic cylinders. Hydraulics can be found in many applications, such as automotive brakes and transmissions, heavy equipment, and airplane control systems. Various hydraulic presses are used extensively in repair and manufacturing, for <b>lifting,</b> pressing, <b>clamping</b> and forming.|$|R
50|$|Forklift Attachment {{is a type}} of drum handler that is {{designed}} to easily slide into a forklift truck. This type of drum handler is used to efficiently and safely load and unload different sizes and types of drums. Once inserted into forklift trucks, operators can easily <b>clamp,</b> <b>lift</b> and transport drums anywhere. Forklift drum handlers are available in different models such as forklift mounted, carrier with tilt function, carrier without tilt function, waist type, rim type and multi-drum carrier.|$|R
60|$|I {{took off}} the <b>clamps,</b> <b>lifted</b> the bags of ballast {{to the top of}} the wall, so that there should be no sound of falling, and started the engine. The machine moved forward a few inches, so that it tilted towards the outside of the wall. I threw my weight on the front part of the platform, and we {{commenced}} our downward fall at a sharp angle. A second enlarged the angle, and without further ado we slid away into the darkness. Then, ascending as we went, when the engine began to work at its strength, we turned, and presently made straight for Ilsin.|$|R
50|$|Investigation {{revealed}} that the Redstone's engine shutdown was caused by two of its electrical cables separating in the wrong order. These cables were a control cable, which provided various control signals, and a power cable, which provided electrical power and grounding. Both cables were plugged into the rocket at the bottom edge {{of one of its}} tail fins and would separate at liftoff. The control cable was supposed to separate first, followed by the power cable. However, for this launch, the control cable was longer than expectedâ€”it was one designed for the military PGM-11 Redstone missile rather than the shorter cable designed for Mercury-Redstone. This control cable had been clamped to compensate for its greater length, but when the vehicle <b>lifted</b> off, the <b>clamping</b> did not work as planned and the control cable separation was delayed, eventually occurring about 29 milliseconds after the power cable had separated.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, UCAR {{fabricated}} a snowfall simulator {{that they have}} used to test deicing fluids for aircraft, among other applications. Ice cores are actuated by a stepper motor and travel along a linear guide rail feeding it into an auger bit. This bit shaves the ice core, creating conditions that simulate snowfall. Currently, the simulator is in satisfactory operating condition, however upgrades have been proposed to make the simulator more user friendly. When one ice core has been exhausted, the motor controlling the carriage must be actuated in reverse to move the mount along a lead screw back to reloading position, which can take upwards of three minutes. The purpose of this project is to retrofit the simulator with a quick release system that allows for the user to manually unlock the carriage and quickly pull {{it back into the}} reloading position, decreasing turn around time in the testing process. The final design is a symmetric 2 -clamp system that is installed directly onto the ice core mount. The two clamps engage the lead screw from the left and the right. To reload the ice cores, the user must simply <b>lift</b> the Destaco <b>clamps</b> on each side and pull the entire carriage back to the original position {{at the front of the}} simulator...|$|R
40|$|Spine fusion {{is usually}} done to obtain good lateral and anteroposterior stability, or for {{cosmetic}} improvement, or for both. Almost 50 per cent. of all spine fusions are {{performed in the}} thoracic area. The removal of a bone graft is often very difficult, and always causes an additional scar. Therefore, a procedure has been sought which would give a greater fusion area with increased stability, {{and at the same}} time would eliminate the many objections to the removal of additional bone. During the past four years the following procedure has been routinely used by the author for fusion of the thoracic spine. It differs from the usual Hibbs fusion operation in that the transverse processes are com-pletely removed subperiosteally, thus producing a much greater fusion area. A: Width and shape of the usual fusion area. B: Width and shape of the suggested fusion area. C: Increased depth of suggested fusion. TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION The usual mid-line incision is made down to the spinous processes which are exposed subperiosteally. Stripping with an elevator is then continued laterally over the laminae and out the tranverse processes. This is not difficult as the process is usually just a continuation of the lamina. An osteotome is driven through the base of the transverse proc-ess, which is <b>lifted</b> with a <b>clamp,</b> and the under surface is stripped with an elevator or scissors.

40|$|Seaway Heavy Lifting is an {{offshore}} contractor that transports, installs and decommissions offshore {{oil and gas}} platforms and offshore wind turbines. During transport, objects need to be secured on the deck, the so-called seafastening. In particular for parts of offshore wind turbines, called Transition Pieces, this proves to be difficult. The Transition Pieces are on average 25 m high tubular structures and weight 300 mT. The outside {{is covered with a}} special coating and various attachments, such as boat landings, ladders, and anodes for corrosion protection. The inside of the Transition Pieces contains various structures and equipment, such as groutskirts, shear keys, J-tubes and internal platforms. Seaway Heavy <b>Lifting</b> currently uses <b>clamps</b> on the lower flange to secure the Transition Pieces in an upright position to the deck of the ship. This causes relative high stresses in the flange and weld and {{turned out to be a}} critical limiting factor during transportation for several projects. Due to this limitation, the workability of the vessels is suboptimal. Many other offshore contractors use the same or similar method of clamping the lower flange to the deck. A new method for seafastening Transition Pieces is proposed to improve the securing strength, the safety, and workability of the vessels. This new method comprises of a tubular element, much like the monopile on which the Transition Piece will stand once on offshore location, welded onto the grillage. The Transition Piece can then be lifted over this tubular element. Mounted on the tubular element are hydraulic cylinders that extend outwards towards the inner wall of the Transition Piece. By exerting a force to the inner wall, the Transition Piece is effectively secured to the vessel. This method avoids using the rather weak lower flange. Strength calculations have shown that this new method can withstand accelerations and accompanying forces caused by the ships motions that are nearly twice as high as the current method allows. Because the new method is fully automated, it requires no manual labour and the seafastening can be activated and deactivated quickly, thus saving critical crane time. It also reduces the time frame where the Transition Pieces stands on the deck unsecured, as is the case with the current method which uses clamps and bolts, thus improving safety. This thesis covers the invention of the new method, calculating the critical structural parts, and detailing those element that are crucial to the design. Currently, a patent applications is pending.

40|$|ABSTRACT Carton Clamp Test Methodologies and the Effects on Load Containment and Retention Tyler Don Blumer A carton clamp is an {{alternative}} device for moving packages and material. Instead of using iron tines {{like that of a}} conventional forklift, a carton clamp uses two large aluminum platens to slightly compress and secure the load for handling. This is advantageous as it allows operators to move layers of a unitized load individually, and eliminates the need for a pallet when handling full unitized loads. When using a carton clamp attachment, it is often difficult for operators to accurately gauge the amount of force being applied to the load. The required clamping force changes depending on the size, shape, and weight of the load. This creates the potential for under-clamping (slippage) and over-clamping (compressive damage). Seeing a market need for a reliable means of testing, two organizations set out to develop a testing protocol. A rift formed between schools of thought regarding the correct testing procedure. ISTA provides a sterile, calculated, and stationary simulation of carton clamp handling in its ISTA 6 -SAMS test protocol. ASTM offers a more holistic, dynamic, observational approach in its mobile ASTM 6055 standard protocol. One school of thought is suggested to imply that a package should be developed to be handled by the carton clamp (ASTM). The other school of thought is that the carton clamp attachment should be properly adjusted to the package specimen (ISTA). Previous studies have been performed citing the ISTA standard and using a specialized carton clamping device vibration device that is calibrated for laboratory research. Arguably, this method, though repeatable in nature, does not accurately simulate carton clamp handling found in industry. Likewise, the equipment investment is cost prohibitive for those in industry wishing to duplicate such a study. ASTM uses a carton clamp truck as used in industry, but does not specify any specific parameters making repeatability between laboratories and practitioners ambiguous. This study examined whether or not a common ground can be reached; implementing a carton <b>clamp</b> <b>lift</b> truck as found in industry allowing for mobile (hazard course) testing. A modified version of ISTA 3 B will be paired off against ASTM 6055 for evaluating both column and cross stack pallet patterns with a variety of treatments. This study attempted to determine if carton clamps as found in industry are capable and repeatable enough to provide consistent data. Similarly, this study examined the test methodologies effect on load containment via stretch film force, load retention via unitized load slippage, and the effects of ride height and driver interaction. The study sought to understand if these effects are uniform across the unitized load, or if particular layers of the load more affected than others...|$|R
