5|$|Part of the National Policy was {{implemented}} in the budget presented in February 1879. Under that budget, Canada became a high-tariff nation <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Germany. The tariffs were designed to protect and build Canadian industry—finished textiles received a tariff of 34%, but the machinery to make them entered Canada free. Macdonald continued to fight for higher tariffs {{for the remainder of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|Many, if not all, {{countries}} have {{some degree of}} polyethnicity, with countries <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Canada having large levels and countries like Japan and Poland having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western countries has spurred some arguments against it, which include a belief that it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> the Soviet Union (USSR) {{carried out}} {{research}} on multiple enrichment technologies for the Soviet atomic bomb project. A trial electromagnetic process {{was carried out}} in 1946 with a calutron using a magnet taken from Germany. A site was chosen for an electromagnetic plant at Sverdlovsk-45 in 1946. The pilot plant, known as Plant 418, was completed in 1948. A more efficient design was developed in which the particle beams were bent by 225° instead of 180° as in the American calutron. It was used to complete the uranium enrichment process after technical difficulties were encountered with the gaseous diffusion process. Uranium enriched to about 40 percent uranium-235 was brought to Sverdlovsk-45 for final enrichment to between 92 and 98 percent. After the problems with the gaseous diffusion process were resolved in 1950, it was decided not to proceed with a full-scale electromagnetic plant. , it remains operational. In 1969, a research calutron known as S-2 was built at Arzamas-16 for high-efficiency separation of isotopes of heavy elements like plutonium.|$|E

His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959.

In high-debt industrialized countries, increasing budget balance was related with reduction in inflation rate. But this price effect was so mild {{and there was no}} positive effect on output growth to confirm the existence of expan-sionary fiscal contraction in these countries...|$|R
