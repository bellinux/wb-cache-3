25|$|M. oleifera can be {{cultivated}} for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for {{oil extraction}} and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation. Harvest is done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks attached. Pollarding, coppicing and <b>lopping</b> or pruning are recommended to promote branching, increase production and facilitate harvesting.|$|E
25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a fodder tree. The {{trees are}} heavily lopped {{particularly}} during winter months when no {{other green fodder}} {{is available in the}} dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, if he has a Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even under the most trying condition. The forage yield per tree varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of green forage from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete <b>lopping</b> having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is lopped and 20kg when the lower one third crown is lopped. The leaves are of high nutritive value. Feeding of the leaves during winter when no other green fodder is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a sweetish pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers were {{impressed}} with Barbarians gory gameplay. [...] Zzap!64s Steve Jarratt appreciated the [...] "fast and furious" [...] action and his colleague Ciaran Brennan said [...] Barbarian {{should have been the}} licensed video game to the fantasy action film Highlander (which had a lot of sword fights and decapitations) instead. [...] Amiga Computings Brian Chappell enjoyed [...] "hacking the foe to bits, especially when a well aimed blow decapitates him." [...] Several other reviewers express the same satisfaction in <b>lopping</b> the heads off their foes. [...] Although shocked at the game's violence, Antics reviewer said the [...] "sword fight game is the best available on the ST." [...] According to Jarratt, Barbarian represented [...] "new heights in bloodsports". [...] Equally pleasing to the reviewers at Zzap!64 and Amiga User Internationals Tony Horgan was the simplicity of the game; they observed that almost anyone could quickly familiarise themselves with the game mechanics, making the two-player mode a fun and quick pastime.|$|E
2500|$|The Epping Forest Act 1878 was passed, {{saving the}} forest from enclosure, and halting the {{shrinkage}} {{of the forest}} that this had caused. Epping Forest {{ceased to be a}} royal forest and was placed in the care of the City of London Corporation who act as Conservators. In addition, the Crown's right to venison was terminated, and pollarding was no longer allowed, although grazing rights continued. This act laid down a stipulation that the Conservators [...] "shall at all times keep Epping Forest unenclosed and unbuilt on as an open space for the recreation and enjoyment of the people". In compensation for the loss of <b>lopping</b> rights, <b>Lopping</b> Hall in Loughton was built as a community building.|$|E
2500|$|Virtually {{throughout}} the nation, over-harvest of firewood remains problematic.

50|$|A Dutch rabbit breeder, Adriann de Cock, is {{generally}} credited with developing the dwarf <b>Lop</b> Breeds by crossing together {{the largest of}} the <b>Lop</b> Breeds, French <b>Lop,</b> with the Netherland Dwarf during the winter of year 1949-1950. Years of hard work paid off to produce the smallest of the <b>Lop</b> Breed, and Holland <b>Lops</b> of around 2 kg - 2.5 kg were first shown in 1964.|$|R

50|$|A fix {{is called}} a running fix when {{one or more of}} the <b>LOPs</b> used to obtain it is an <b>LOP</b> {{advanced}} or retrieved over time. In order to get a fix the <b>LOP</b> must cross at an angle, the closer to 90° the better. This means the observations must have different azimuths. During the day, if only the Sun is visible, it is possible to get an <b>LOP</b> from the observation but not a fix as another <b>LOP</b> is needed. What may be done is take a first sight which yields one <b>LOP</b> and, some hours later, when the Sun's azimuth has changed substantially, take a second sight which yields a second <b>LOP.</b> Knowing the distance and course sailed in the interval, the first <b>LOP</b> can be advanced to its new position and the intersection with the second <b>LOP</b> yields a running fix.|$|R
2500|$|There {{can be a}} vast {{difference}} between the techniques and practices of professional arborists and those of inadequately trained tree workers who simply [...] "trim trees". [...] Some commonly offered [...] "services" [...] are considered unacceptable by modern arboricultural standards and may seriously damage, disfigure, weaken, or even kill trees. [...] One such example is tree topping, <b>lopping,</b> or [...] "hat-racking", where entire tops of trees or main stems are removed, generally by cross-cutting the main stem(s) or leaders, leaving large unsightly stubs. [...] Trees that manage to survive such treatment are left prone to a spectrum of detrimental effects, including vigorous but weakly attached regrowth, pest susceptibility, pathogen intrusion, and internal decay.|$|E
2500|$|Is it {{not obvious}} {{that there are}} always enough moral {{problems}} without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than manuscript culture could ever do. Print is the technology of individualism. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for <b>lopping</b> off fingers. [...] "But", someone says, [...] "we didn't know it would happen." [...] Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; {{and it would be}} nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for morality.|$|E

50|$|As {{the first}} breed of <b>lop</b> rabbit, the English <b>Lop</b> {{was one of}} the first fancy breeds of rabbit {{developed}} in England, in the 19th century for the purposes of exhibition as a response to rise of animal fancy and consequently the rabbit's emergence as a mainstream household pet during the Victorian era, marking a departure from the earlier role of domesticated rabbit breeding for meat, fur and wool production. Later, the English <b>Lop</b> was bred with other Continental giant breeds of rabbit gave rise to a number of new breeds of <b>lop</b> rabbit, including the French <b>Lop,</b> which developed from breeding between the English <b>Lop</b> and Flemish Giant, and the Holland <b>Lop,</b> which was in turn developed from the French <b>Lop</b> and the Netherlands Dwarf. it is thought that the English <b>lop</b> got the large ears because in the Algeirs it was hot and with the big ears they kept cool.|$|R

50|$|Once a DTO calculated, {{it can be}} {{combined}} with the known position of the satellites and the receiving station. This combination provides a locus of positions on the Earth’s surface {{for the source of}} the signal; from this result a line of position (<b>LOP)</b> can be derived. A similar line can be derived for the frequency differences. Where the two <b>LOPs</b> intersect is the signal transmission location. In addition to geolocation with a time <b>LOP</b> and a frequency <b>LOP,</b> a location can also be determined by finding the crossing point of two time <b>LOPs.</b> The second time <b>LOP</b> is an identical measurement using a different secondary satellite, or using the same secondary satellite, but later in time. Similarly, two frequency <b>LOPs</b> can be used to determine a location. It can be shown that, in general, it is expected that the two <b>LOPs</b> intersect in two places. In many circumstances it is possible to discount one of the intersections e.g. due to it not being in the coverage area of one or both satellites. In some circumstances, {{it is not possible to}} distinguish intersections from a pair of <b>LOPs,</b> in which case, additional <b>LOPs</b> need to be determined.|$|R

60|$|The Spanish fowl {{offers a}} more curious case; the male has an immense comb, {{but some of}} the {{successive}} variations, by the accumulation of which it was acquired, appear to have been transferred to the female; for she has a comb many times larger than that of the females of the parent species. But the comb of the female differs in one respect from that of the male, for it is apt to lop over; and within a recent period it has been ordered by the fancy that this should always be the case, and success has quickly followed the order. Now the <b>lopping</b> of the comb must be sexually limited in its transmission, otherwise it would prevent the comb of the male from being perfectly upright, which would be abhorrent to every fancier. On the other hand, the uprightness of the comb in the male must likewise be a sexually- limited character, otherwise it would prevent the comb of the female from <b>lopping</b> over.|$|E
