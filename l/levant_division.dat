5|$|Estimates of the {{combined}} size of the French Army of the <b>Levant</b> <b>divisions</b> that participated in the battle ranged from 9,000 to 12,000 troops. The troops were mostly made up of Senegalese and Algerian units, and consisted of ten infantry battalions {{and a number of}} cavalry and artillery units. Among the participating units were the 415th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Algerian Riflemen Regiment, the Senegalese Division, the African Riflemen Regiment and the Moroccan Sipahi Battalion. A number of Maronite volunteers from Mount Lebanon reportedly joined the French forces as well. The Army of the Levant was equipped with plain and mountain artillery batteries and 155mm guns, and backed by tanks and fighter bombers. The commander of the French forces was General Mariano Goybet.|$|R
50|$|Ottoman {{domination}} of Lebanon, which lasted {{for more than}} four centuries, was brought to an end on October 6, 1918, with the entrance of the <b>Levant</b> Marine <b>Division</b> in Beirut roads. The paper money issued by the Turkish Treasury, with a forced exchange rate, suffered the same fate.|$|R
50|$|La Galissonnière {{became the}} {{flagship}} of the <b>Levant</b> Squadron (<b>Division</b> Navale du <b>Levant)</b> under Rear Admiral Alfred Conrad on 27 May 1881. Shortly afterward she bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July 1881 {{as part of}} the French occupation of Tunisia. In early 1882 La Galissonnière was present in Alexandria shortly before the British bombarded it before the beginning of the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War. The ship remained in the Mediterranean through 1883.|$|R
5000|$|At 8am on Sunday 18 October Belle Poule, Favorite and Oreste set sail. Oreste {{rejoined the}} <b>Levant</b> <b>division,</b> whilst {{the two other}} ships sailed towards France at full speed, fearful of being attacked. No notable setback {{occurred}} to Belle Poule and Favorite during the first 13 days of this voyage, though on 31 October they met the merchantman Hambourg, whose captain gave Joinville news of Europe, confirming the news he had received from Doret. The threat of war was confirmed by the Dutch ship Egmont, en route for Batavia. Joinville was sufficiently worried to summon the officers of both his ships to a council of war, to plan precautions to keep the remains out of harm's way should they meet British warships. He had Belle Poule prepared for possible battle. So that all the ship's guns could be mounted, the temporary cabins set up to house the commission to Saint Helena were demolished and the dividers between them, {{as well as their}} furniture, were thrown into the sea - earning the area the nickname [...] "Lacédémone". The crew were frequently drilled and called to action stations. Most importantly, he ordered Favorite to sail away immediately and make for the nearest French port. Joinville was aware that no British warship would attack the ship carrying the body, but also that they would be unlikely to extend the same generosity to Favorite. He doubted, with good reason, that {{he would be able to}} save the corvette if she got within range of an enemy ship, without risking his frigate and its precious cargo. Another hypothesis is that Favorite was the slower ship and would only have held Belle Poule back if they had been attacked.|$|E
50|$|In May 1880 Courbet succeeded Admiral Olry as {{governor}} of New Caledonia. He returned to France {{in the autumn of}} 1882, where he was promised command of the <b>Levant</b> naval <b>division</b> by Admiral Bernard Jauréguiberry, the navy minister. Jauréguiberry was replaced as navy minister in January 1883 when Charles Duclerc's cabinet was replaced by the brief administration of Armand Fallières, and Courbet was instead appointed commander of the division navale d’essais in the Mediterranean. In April 1883 he hoisted his flag aboard the ironclad Bayard at Cherbourg.|$|R
50|$|From 1849 to 1853 Courbet {{served as}} a {{midshipman}} (aspirant) on the corvette Capricieuse (capitaine de vaisseau Roquemaurel). Capricieuse circumnavigated the globe during this period and cruised for several months along the China Coast, giving Courbet his first experience of the seas in which, thirty years later, he would win fame. After his return to France he was posted to the brick Olivier, attached to the <b>Levant</b> naval <b>division.</b> In December 1855, at Smyrna, he intervened to quell a mutiny aboard the Messageries impériales packet Tancrède, and was subsequently commended for his conduct by the navy ministry. He was promoted {{to the rank of}} lieutenant de vaisseau in November 1856.|$|R

It was briefly {{captured by the}} Islamic State but they were swiftly pushed out by the Kurdish Peshmerga. During this period the base suffered looting both by IS and local residents.|$|R
50|$|Triomphante {{was laid}} down at Rochefort on 5 August 1869 and {{launched}} on 28 March 1877. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction {{time is not}} known, the budget for the French Navy was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed with working practices more suitable for the industrial age. The ship was commissioned as the flagship of the Pacific Squadron on 17 October 1880 {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Brossard du Corbigny. On 15 February 1883 she became flagship of the <b>Levant</b> Squadron (<b>Division</b> Navale du <b>Levant)</b> under Rear Admiral Conte. On 28 May the admiral was ordered to shift his flag as Triomphante was ordered to Saigon.|$|R
50|$|Marengo {{was running}} her sea trials when the Franco-Prussian War began and was {{immediately}} put in reserve. She was recommissioned in 1872 for service with the Mediterranean Squadron until 1876 when she was again placed in reserve. On 2 October 1880 the ship was recommissioned and assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. Marengo {{was transferred to the}} <b>Levant</b> Squadron (<b>Division</b> Navale du <b>Levant)</b> on 13 February 1881 and bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July 1881 as part of the French conquest of Tunisia. She remained in the Mediterranean until she was assigned to the Reserve Squadron in 1886. In 1888 Marengo became the flagship of the Northern Squadron and led the squadron during its port visit to Kronstadt in 1891. She was reduced to reserve the following year and sold in 1896.|$|R
50|$|Marengo {{was laid}} down at Brest in July 1865 and {{launched}} on 15 October 1868. The ship began her sea trials on 1 July 1870 and was running {{them when the}} Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 began. She was immediately put in reserve and not commissioned until 1872 for service with the Mediterranean Squadron. Marengo remained with the squadron until 1876 when she was again placed in reserve. On 2 October 1880 the ship was recommissioned and assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. Marengo {{was transferred to the}} <b>Levant</b> Squadron (<b>Division</b> Navale du <b>Levant)</b> on 13 February 1881 and bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July as part of the French occupation of Tunisia. She remained in the Mediterranean until 1886 when she was assigned to the Reserve Squadron. In 1888 Marengo became the flagship of the Northern Squadron and led the squadron during its port visits to Osborne Bay and Spithead in August 1891 and to Kronstadt in September 1891. She was reduced to reserve the following year and sold on 7 March 1896.|$|R
50|$|La Galissonnières initial {{commissions}} {{were in the}} Pacific and in the Caribbean, but she {{was assigned}} to the <b>Levant</b> Squadron (<b>Division</b> Navale du <b>Levant)</b> when she bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July 1881 as part of the French occupation of Tunisia. In early 1882 La Galissonnière was the flagship of the Levant Squadron under Rear Admiral Alfred Conrad. Both La Galissonnière and Triomphante were assigned to the Far East Squadron in 1884, under the command of Vice Admiral Amédée Courbet, and participated in several actions during the Sino-French War of 1884-85. Both ships fought in the Battle of Fuzhou, destroying a small Chinese fleet and coastal defenses defending the Min River. They supplied landing parties during the Battle of Tamsui in October 1884, but they were forced to retreat by Chinese troops, although suffering few casualties (11 killed and 4 wounded between the two ships). Nothing is known of any further participation by La Galissonnière in the war, but Triomphante helped to capture the Pescadore Islands in March 1885 during the Pescadores Campaign.|$|R
5|$|In late July, the French {{escalated}} their {{push into}} Syria's major inland cities. On 23 July, French troops led by General Fernand Goubeau, {{commander of the}} Army of the <b>Levant's</b> Fourth <b>Division,</b> captured Aleppo without resistance. The lack of resistance was criticized by commander al-Sa'dun in his memoirs. In the aftermath of Aleppo's occupation, he organized 750 rebels to oust the French from the city, a plan that did not materialize. The consequent flight of Aleppo's Arab nationalist leaders to the countryside and the French forces' military superiority managed to stymie a potential revolt in the city. On 25 July, French forces captured Damascus a day after routing a small Arab Army contingent and armed volunteers led by Yusuf al-'Azma at the Battle of Maysalun. Following the loss of Aleppo and Damascus, Barakat arranged a meeting of Antiochian rebel leaders in al-Qusayr, in which the attendants were divided between those who advocated either of the following: continuing the revolt, surrendering to the French or approaching the Turks for support. After the meeting, Barakat chose to defect to the French. Afterward, al-Sa'dun and his fighters continued the revolt in Barakat's former area of operations.|$|R

Various treatments have been developed for IMIDs, including immune modulators and targeted biologic agents. However, adherence remains suboptimal. Methods: An adherence survey was used to evaluate physicians’ beliefs about adherence to medication in IMID and to evaluate if and how they manage adherence. The survey was distributed to 100 randomly selected physicians from three different specialties. Results were analyzed by four academic experts commissioned to develop an action plan to address practical and perceptual barriers to adherence, integrating it into treatment goals to maximize outcomes in IMID, thereby elevating local standards of care. Results: Eighty-two physicians participated in this study and completed the questionnaire. Most defined adherence as compliance with prescribed treatment. Although the majority of surveyed physicians (74 %) did not systematically measure adherence in their practice, 54 % identified adherence as a treatment goal of equal or greater importance to therapeutic endpoints. Lack of time and specialized nursing support was reported as an important barrier to measuring adherence. The expert panel identified four key areas for action: 360 ° education (patient–nurse–physician), patient–physician communication, patient perception and concerns, and market access/cost. An action plan was developed centered on education and awareness, enhanced benefit–risk communication, development of adherence assessment tools and promotion of patient support programs. Conclusion: Nonadherence to medication is a commonly underestimated problem with important consequences. A customized target-based strategy to address the root causes of nonadherence is essential in the management of chronic immune-mediated diseases.
