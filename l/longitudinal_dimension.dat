40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{relation}} between dimensional changes and object location {{in the field of}} view (FOV) using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).   Materials and Methods: A custom-made phantom was fabricated from base plate wax. To analyze the accuracy of measurements in horizontal and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimensions,</b> aluminum squares (0. 5 mm thickness, 10 × 10 mm dimensions) were constructed and placed in three levels (upper, middle, and lower) and five positions (central, right, left, anterior and posterior). This phantom was scanned using Asahi, Planmeca and NewTom CBCT systems. CBCT scans were measured three times by use of their corresponding software. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, post-hoc test and two-way ANOVA (P< 0. 05). Results: The differences between the mean horizontal dimensions of different systems were not significant (P= 0. 296). However, the differences between the mean <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimensions</b> of different systems were significant (P= 0. 039). The differences between the different positions and the mean horizontal and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimensions</b> were significant (P< 0. 001, and P< 0. 001, respectively). The differences between the mean horizontal dimensions and different levels were not significant (P= 0. 51), but the differences between the mean <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimensions</b> and different levels were significant (P< 0. 001). The interaction effect of level and position on the accuracy of horizontal and longitudinal measurements was significant (P< 0. 0001). Conclusions: We found statistically significant differences in most of our comparisons; however, these differences were not clinically significant. Therefore, CBCT could be an accurate device for measurement of dimensions of objects placed in different positions in the FOV.   </div...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{estimation}} of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimensions</b> for short electron bunches in an accelerating field is an important diagnostic and can be extremely helpful in evaluating the performance of an accelerator. We investigate a method for close {{estimation of}} bunch length for sub-picosecond electron bunches from the measurement of their energy spreads. Three or more measurements for the bunch energy spread are made by varying the phase of the accelerating structure and later a reconstruction of the bunch <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimensions,</b> namely bunch length, initial energy spread and chirp {{at the entrance of}} the accelerating structure are obtained using the least square method. A comparison of the obtained results with ASTRA simulations is also included to validate the 3 -phase method for sub-ps electron bunches. It is a simple method from both understanding (easy reconstruction using transport matrices) and experimental point of views (multiple measurements of energy spread with varying phase of the accelerating structure) ...|$|R

Shrinkage {{in the three}} anisotropic dimensions varies with MFA (Harris & Meylan, 1965; Megraw et al., 1998; Pentoney, 1953). Longitudinal shrinkage is critical for stability of wood, because wooden boards have much longer <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimensions,</b> and shrinkage in this direction increases with MFA (Harris & Meylan, 1965). MFA diminishes most rapidly with radius in the corewood zone, and so wood derived from this zone {{tends to be more}} unstable than wood nearer the outside of a large log.|$|R

50|$|A {{crosshead}} is {{a mechanism}} used in long reciprocating engines and reciprocating compressors to eliminate sideways {{pressure on the}} piston. Also, the crosshead enables the connecting rod to freely move outside the cylinder. Because of the very small bore-to-stroke ratio on such engines, the connecting rod would hit the cylinder walls and block the engine from rotating if the piston was attached directly to the connecting rod like on trunk engines. Therefore, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimension</b> of the crosshead must be matched to the stroke of the engine.|$|E

40|$|I {{review the}} {{relations}} between mass scales in various string theories and in M-theory. I discuss physical motivations and possible consistent realizations of large volume compactifications and low string scale. Large <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimensions,</b> seen by Standard Model particles, imply in general that string theory is strongly coupled unless its tension {{is close to the}} compactification scale. Weakly coupled, low-scale strings can in turn be realized only in the presence of extra large transverse dimensions, seen through gravitational interactions, or in the presence of infinitesimal string coupling. In the former case, quantum gravity scale is also low, while in the latter, gravitational and string interactions remain suppressed by the four-dimensional Planck mass. There is one exception in this general rule, allowing for large <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimensions</b> without low string scale, when Standard Model is embedded in a six-dimensional fixed-point theory described by a tensionless string. Extra dimensions of size as large as TeV − 1 ≃ 10 − 16 cm are motivated from the problem of supersymmetry breaking in string theory, while TeV scale strings offer a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem, as an alternative to softly broken supersymmetry or technicolor. I discuss these problems {{in the context of the}} above mentioned string realizations, as well as the main physical implications both in particle accelerators and in experiments that measure gravity at sub-millimeter distances...|$|R

In this paper, we extend our analysis and {{results to the}} case of nonimpulsive excitation, paying special attention to the parameterization of the radiation pattern of three-dimensional (3 -D) ellipsoid source distributions driven by square pulses of finite duration. We study the role both of the source’s space distribution and of the square pulse duration on the generation of well-collimated short-pulse fields. In particular, we explore the source’s angular and range resolutions as functions of the transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the source (for a fixed source volume) and of the pulse duration.
