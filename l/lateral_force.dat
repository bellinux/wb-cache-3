5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategies}} that sailfish and thresher sharks employ against shoaling fish {{are more effective}} when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘bait ball’ (Helfman, Collette & Facey, 1997; Oliver et al., 2013; Domenici et al., 2014). Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve, they cooperate in this effort. When herding a shoal of fish or squid, sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger. When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by turning their heads, their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically (Lauder & Drucker, 2004). Domenici et al. (2014) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing. The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> in the direction opposite to the slash. This means that prey {{is less likely to}} recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator (Marras et al., 2015; Webb & Weihs 2015). Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and thresher sharks.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{influence}} of interfacial forces, including drag <b>force</b> and <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> (lift force, turbulent dispersion force and wall force) on the hydrodynamics in pilot-scale bubble columns with internals is analyzed. The {{results indicate that}} the <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> may be optional for the hollow columns, but they are required to accurately predict flow characteristics in the bubble columns with internals. Furthermore, it has been found that the bubbly flow behavior in the bubble columns with internals is more sensitive to the <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> in comparison with those without internals, and the complex geometry significantly alters the response of bubbly flow to the interfacial forces. In addition, despite the insignificant effect on gas holdup, the presence of internals gives rise to an enhancement of large-scale liquid circulation due to the remarkable decrease of turbulent viscosity.

40|$|International audiencePurpose — The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> during the fall of a magnet in a conducting pipe, when the direction of magnetization of the magnet is fixed. If the direction of magnetization is not parallel to the axis of the pipe, <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> occur and a decentration of the magnet happens. Design/methodology/approach — The problem is studied numerically, with a T − h 3 D FE formulation well-suited for the problem. Computational results are compared with experimental results. Findings — The physical model is given and the main force coefficients analyzed. The <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> and the decentration phenomenon are studied as a function of the main parameters (thickness and radius of the pipe). Originality/value — The direction of magnetization is a key parameter to analyze the dynamics of a magnet motion inside a conducting pipe, when the radii of the pipe and the magnet are not so close. This analysis with a fixed direction of magnetization allows to quantify the <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> and the decentration, and is a first step to understand the complete motion which includes the rotation which can be linked to the decentration...|$|R

The Pennsylvania chose the GG1 over the R1 and immediately ordered another 57locomotives. As the number scheme used by the Pennsylvania prevented the first locomotive in the class from being 4899, the R1 and GG1 prototypes, essentially, swapped numbers. The Pennsylvania also enlisted the assistance of Raymond Loewy to refine the aesthetics of the GG1s. Loewy recommended that all subsequent models of the class should have a welded body rather than the riveted body on the prototype.

2500|$|Iceboats {{designs are}} {{generally}} supported by three skate blades called [...] "runners" [...] supporting a triangular or cross-shaped frame with the steering runner in front. Runners {{are made of}} iron or steel and sharpened to a fine edge, most often cut to an angled edge of 90 degrees, which holds onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> of the wind developed by the sails. Once the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> has been effectively countered by the runner edge, the remaining force of [...] "sail-lift" [...] vacuums the boat forward with significant power. That power increases as {{the speed of the}} boat increases, allowing the boat to go much faster than the wind. Limitations to iceboat speed are windage, friction, the camber of the sail shape, strength of construction, and quality of the ice surface. Iceboats can sail as close as 7 degrees off the apparent wind. Ice boats can achieve speeds as high as ten times the wind speed in good conditions. International DN iceboats often achieve speeds of [...] while racing, and speeds as high as [...] have been recorded.|$|E
2500|$|Even when {{designed}} as a bearing joint, the surface friction between the clamped elements may be sufficient to resist movement for some time, especially when the building may not yet be fully loaded - thus it operates initially as a friction joint.
