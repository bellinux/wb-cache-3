40|$|The {{advantages}} {{of being able}} to see protein zones in a gel during electrophoresis (and hence before staining) are pointed out, and a method is described which depends on <b>local</b> <b>increments</b> of refractive index in these zones. The use of <b>local</b> <b>increments</b> of refractive index in polyacrylamide gels for measuring protein concentrations in zones during electrophoresis is briefly considered; it is found that such increments are greater than would be expected from the amount of protein when sodium dodecyl sulphate is present. The enhancement depends on conditions and time of running. This makes quantitative estimates difficult, but the sensitivity of detection of protein zones by observations based on refractive-index changes is greatly increased by this property of sodium dodecyl sulphate. Methods are described for making optically uniform gels (both with uniform and with graded concentrations of polyacrylamide), necessary for observation of small changes in refractive index. A simple dark-field system of observation is described. Examples are given showing protein samples observed with the system during electrophoresis and compared with the same gel stained with Coomassie Blue after completion of the run. Under optimal conditions the optical method is comparable in sensitivity with staining. With the proteins of lower mol. wt. (approx. 15000), the optical method is not so sensitive, becoming less sensitive with longer running time. This loss of sensitivity is greatly decreased by using more concentrated polyacrylamide gels, and graded gels are therefore more suitable for optical observation than are uniform gels. The observation of protein zones during electrophoresis adds nothing to the time needed for making a stained gel and gives much information long before it can be obtained from the stained gel...|$|R

First, we assessed whether there was evidence that these cardinal phases were processed by independent ‘labeled lines,’ using a discrimination at detection threshold paradigm. Second, we assessed whether suprathreshold phase discrimination was best at phases intermediate between these cardinal values. Third, we tried to replicate previous evidence showing that an absence of facilitation occurs only between cosine pedestals and sine tests (or vice-versa). In all three experimental approaches we found no compelling evidence for four cardinal phase groupings. We did however find evidence for independent detectors for pure increments and decrements (±cosine).

Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} when {{coupled to}} an alternating magnetic field {{are capable of}} energy absorption and then release it in form of heat. Thus, enabling the heating of the surroundings of the excited nanoparticles {{which can be used}} as a tool in many bioapplications. The determination of temperature increments around excited nanoparticles represent however an experimental challenge and existing reports tend to show simple and limited assessments. We demonstrate experimentally these temperature increments, when 12 nm magnetic nanoparticles are exposed to a radiofrequency radiation. Moreover, by functionalizing the surface of the nanoparticles with DNA molecules and further hybridizing with different length fluorophore-modified DNA an accurate temperature spatial mapping could be determined. Due to the design of these DNAs, different denaturalization temperatures (melting temperature, Tm) could be achieved. The quantification of the denaturalized fluorophore-modified DNA, and by interpolation onto a Boltzmann fitting model, it has been possible to calculate the <b>local</b> temperature <b>increments</b> at different distances, corresponding to the length of each modified DNA, from the surface of the nanoparticles.

Using two independent numerical methods, one based on the stationary velocity distribution of the motors and the other one on the <b>local</b> <b>increments</b> (also known as the Kramers-Moyal coefficients) of the velocity, we establish a connection between the CMM and the ABP models. The parameters extracted for the ABP via the two methods show good agreement for both symmetric and asymmetric cases and are independent of N, the number of motors, provided that N is not too small. This indicates that one can indeed describe the CMM problem with a simpler ABP model. However, the power spectrum of velocity fluctuations in the CMM model reveals a peak at a finite frequency, a peak which is absent in the velocity spectrum of the ABP model. This implies richer dynamic features of the CMM model which cannot be captured by an ABP model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Apparent {{rarefaction}} in subjective figures {{seems to}} violate the principle of size scaling. It has been claimed that this anomaly {{is due to a}} difference in illusory lightness which counteracts the expected effect of illusory depth. Qualitative evidence is presented that neither illusory lightness nor illusory depth have a relevant part in the phenomenon. An alternative account, in which contrast and size are shown to play major roles, is presented and discussed. 1 Subjective rarefaction in illusory figures and the original explanation for it If texture is introduced in the form of small dots within and around a pattern which produces a subjective figure, as in figure 1, the dots will appear less concentrated on the figure than on the surround. This observation was first made by Kennedy and Lee (1976), who also noted that such a result is exactly the opposite of what would be expected from the principle of size scaling: since a subjective figure looks nearer than its surround, its texture should look more dense. This peculiar paradox was apparently resolved by Parks's (1985) suggestion that the decrement in apparent concentration within the subjective figure is due to a <b>local</b> <b>increment</b> in illusory lightness which overpowers the expected effect of illusory depth.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{describes how}} a vision model incorporating contrast sensitivity, contrast masking, and light adaptation {{is used to}} design visually optimal quantization matrices for Discrete Cosine Transform image compression. The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) underlies several image compression standards (JPEG, MPEG, H. 261). The DCT is applied to 8 x 8 pixel blocks, and the resulting coefficients are quantized by division and rounding. The 8 x 8 'quantization matrix' of divisors determines the visual quality of the reconstructed image; the design of this matrix is left to the user. Since each DCT coefficient corresponds to a particular spatial frequency in a particular image region, each quantization error consists of a <b>local</b> <b>increment</b> or decrement in a particular frequency. After adjustments for contrast sensitivity, local light adaptation, and local contrast masking, this coefficient error {{can be converted to}} a just-noticeable-difference (jnd). The jnd's for different frequencies and image blocks can be pooled to yield a global perceptual error metric. With this metric, we can compute for each image the quantization matrix that minimizes the bit-rate for a given perceptual error, or perceptual error for a given bit-rate. Implementation of this system demonstrates its advantages over existing techniques. A unique feature of this scheme is that the quantization matrix is optimized for each individual image. This is compatible with the JPEG standard, which requires transmission of the quantization matrix...|$|R
