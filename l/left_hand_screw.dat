25|$|Cutting {{a single}} helical groove into a screw-stock {{cylinder}} yields what {{is referred to}} as a single-thread screw. Similarly, one may construct a double-thread screw provided that the helix angle is the same, and a second thread is cut in the space between the grooves of the first. For certain applications, triple and quadruple threads are in use. The helix may be cut either right <b>hand</b> or <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> In <b>screws</b> especially, the helix angle is essential for calculating torque in power screw applications.|$|R
50|$|At the {{fundamental}} level, optical activity {{is a case}} of circular birefringence, and can best be understood in that way. Whereas linear birefringence in a crystal involves a small difference in the phase velocity of light of two different linear polarizations, circular birefringence implies a small difference in the velocities between right and left-handed circular polarizations. Think of one enantiomer in a solution as a large number of little helices (or screws), all right-handed, but in random orientations. Birefringence of this sort is possible even in a fluid because the handedness of the helices is not dependent on their orientation: even when the direction of one helix is reversed, it still appears right handed. And circularly polarized light itself is chiral: as the wave proceeds in one direction the electric (and magnetic) fields composing it are rotating clockwise (or counterclockwise for the opposite circular polarization), tracing out a right (or <b>left)</b> <b>handed</b> <b>screw</b> pattern in space. In addition to the bulk refractive index which substantially lowers the phase velocity of light in any dielectric (transparent) material compared to the speed of light (in vacuum), there is an additional interaction between the chirality of the wave and the chirality of the molecules. Where their chiralities are the same, there will be a small additional effect on the wave's velocity, but the opposite circular polarization will experience an opposite small effect as its chirality is opposite that of the molecules.|$|R

50|$|In the laboratory, {{a patient}} was given two {{different}} fabrics: a wire screen in his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> {{and a piece}} of sandpaper in his right hand. The patient received two different fabrics out of his view so that neither eye nor hemisphere visually seen what his hands were given. When the patient was indicating what fabric was in the <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> he was able to correctly indicate and point with the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> to the wire screen after it had been set on a table. As he pointed with his <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> however, the right hand tried to stop the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and make the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> point to the fabric that the right hand was holding. The <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> continued to point at the correct fabric, even though the right hand tried to forcefully move the <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> During the struggle, the patient also verbalized feelings of animosity by saying, “That’s wrong!” and “I hate this hand”.
