Afin d’établir l'influence de différents paramètres sur l'écoulement de la matière, un processus de thixoextrusion expérimental a été réalisé sur un acier. Les effets de la température initiale du <b>lopin</b> et de l’outillage, de la vitesse de mise en forme et de la présence d'une couche de Ceraspray® à l'interface de l'outil et du <b>lopin</b> ont été étudiés par des expériences et confrontés à la simulation. Semi-solid processing is {{an innovative}} technology for near net-shape production of components, where the metallic alloys are processed in the semi-solid state. Taking {{advantage of the}} thixotropic behavior of alloys in the semi-solid state, significant {{progress has been made}} in semi-solid processing. However, the consequences of such behavior on the flow during thixoforming are still not completely understood. To explore and better understand the influence of the different parameters on material flow during thixoextrusion process, thixoextrusion experiments were performed using the low carbon steel C 38. The billet was partially melted at high solid fraction. Effects of various process parameters including the initial billet temperature, the temperature of die, the punch speed during process and the presence of a Ceraspray layer at the interface of tool and billet were investigated through experiments and simulation. After analyzing the results thus obtained, it was identified that the aforementioned parameters mainly affect thermal exchanges between die and part. Furthermore, the thermal effects can affect the material flow which is composed of various distinct zones...|$|E
