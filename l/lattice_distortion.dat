5000|$|Peierls' theorem {{states that}} a {{one-dimensional}} equally spaced chain with one electron per ion is unstable. It was asserted in the 1930s by Rudolf Peierls. It can be proven using a simple {{model of the}} potential for an electron in a 1-D crystal with lattice spacing [...] The periodicity of the crystal creates energy band gaps in the [...] diagram {{at the edge of the}} Brillouin zone [...] (similar to the result of the Kronig-Penney model, which helps to explain the origin of band gaps in semiconductors). If the ions each contribute one electron, then the band will be half-filled, up to values of [...] in the ground state.Imagine a <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> where every other ion moves closer to one neighbor and further away from the other, the unfavourable energy of the long bond between ions is outweighed by the energy gain of the short bond. The period has just doubled from [...] to [...] In essence, the proof relies on the fact that doubling the period would introduce new band gaps located at multiples of see the figure in the right. This would cause small energy savings, based on the distortion of the bands in the vicinity of the new gaps. Approaching , the distortion due to the introduction of the new band gap will cause the electrons to be at a lower energy than they would be in the perfect crystal. Therefore, this <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> becomes energetically favorable when the energy savings due to the new band gaps outweighs the elastic energy cost of rearranging the ions. Of course, this effect will be noticeable only when the electrons are arranged close to their ground state - in other words, thermal excitation should be minimized. Therefore, the Peierls transition should be seen at low temperature. This is the basic argument for the occurrence of the Peierls transition, sometimes called dimerization.|$|E
5000|$|At the atomistic scales, {{a crystal}} or a {{crystalline}} solid {{is represented by}} a collection of interacting atoms located at discrete sites on a geometric lattice. A perfect crystal consists of a regular and periodic geometric lattice. The perfect lattice has translation symmetry, which means that all the unit cells are identical. In a perfect periodic lattice, which {{is assumed to be}} infinite, all atoms are identical. At equilibrium each atom is assumed to be located at its lattice site. The force at any atom due to other atoms just cancels out so the net force at each atom is zero. These conditions break down in a distorted lattice in which atoms get displaced from their positions of equilibrium. [...] The <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> may be caused by an externally applied force. The lattice can also be distorted by introducing a defect in the lattice or displacing an atom that disturbs the equilibrium configuration and induces a force on the lattice sites. This is shown in Fig. 1. The objective of the mathematical model is to calculate the resulting values of the atomic displacements.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954, Herbert Fröhlich {{proposed}} a microscopic theory, in which energy gaps at ±kF would form below a transition temperature {{as a result}} of the interaction between the electrons and phonons of wavevector Q=2kF. Conduction at high temperatures is metallic in a quasi-1-D conductor, whose Fermi surface consists of fairly flat sheets perpendicular to the chain direction at ±kF. The electrons near the Fermi surface couple strongly with the phonons of 'nesting' wave number Q = 2kF. The 2kF mode thus becomes softened {{as a result of}} the electron-phonon interaction. [...] The 2kF phonon mode frequency decreases with decreasing temperature, and finally goes to zero at the Peierls transition temperature. Since phonons are bosons, this mode becomes macroscopically occupied at lower temperatures, and is manifested by a static periodic <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion.</b> At the same time, an electronic CDW forms, and the Peierls gap opens up at ±kF. Below the Peierls transition temperature, a complete Peierls gap leads to thermally activated behavior in the conductivity due to normal uncondensed electrons.|$|E

5000|$|In physics, the Burgers vector, {{named after}} Dutch {{physicist}} Jan Burgers, is a vector, often denoted as b, {{that represents the}} magnitude {{and direction of the}} <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> resulting from a dislocation in a crystal lattice.The vector's magnitude and direction is best understood when the dislocation-bearing crystal structure is first visualized without the dislocation, that is, the perfect crystal structure. In this perfect crystal structure, a rectangle whose lengths and widths are integer multiples of [...] "a" [...] (the unit cell edge length) is drawn encompassing the site of the original dislocation's origin. Once this encompassing rectangle is drawn, the dislocation can be introduced. This dislocation will have the effect of deforming, not only the perfect crystal structure, but the rectangle as well. The said rectangle could have one of its sides disjoined from the perpendicular side, severing the connection of the length and width line segments of the rectangle at one of the rectangle's corners, and displacing each line segment from each other. What was once a rectangle before the dislocation was introduced is now an open geometric figure, whose opening defines the direction and magnitude of the Burgers vector. Specifically, the breadth of the opening defines the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and, when a set of fixed coordinates is introduced, an angle between the termini of the dislocated rectangle's length line segment and width line segment may be specified.|$|E
5000|$|As {{austenite}} cools, {{the carbon}} diffuses {{out of the}} austenite and forms carbon rich iron-carbide (cementite) and leaves behind carbon poor ferrite. Depending on alloy composition, a layering of ferrite and cementite, called pearlite, may form. If the rate of cooling is very swift, the carbon does not have time enough to diffuse and the alloy may experience a large <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> known as martensitic transformation in which it transforms into martensite, a Body Centered Tetragonal structure (BCT). This {{is a very important}} case, as the carbon does not have time to diffuse due to the high cooling rate, which results in carbon being trapped and as a result forms hard martensite. The rate of cooling determines the relative proportions of martensite, ferrite, and cementite, and therefore determines the mechanical properties of the resulting steel, such as hardness and tensile strength. A high a cooling rate of thick sections will cause a steep thermal gradient in the material. The outer layers of the heat treated part will cool faster and shrink more, causing it to be under tension and thermal staining. At high cooling rates, the material will transform from austenite to martensite which is much harder and will generate cracks at much lower strains. The volume change (martensite is less dense than austenite) [...] which can generate stresses as well. The difference in strain rates of the inner and outer portion of the part may cause cracks to develop in the outer portion, compelling the use of slower quenching rates to avoid this. By alloying the steel with tungsten, the carbon diffusion is slowed and the transformation to BCT allotrope occurs at lower temperatures, thereby avoiding the cracking. Such a material is said to have its hardenability increased. Tempering following quenching will transform some of the brittle martensite into tempered martensite. If a low-hardenability steel is quenched, a significant amount of austenite will be retained in the microstructure, leaving the steel with internal stresses that leave the product prone to sudden fracture.|$|E

40|$|A varying {{refractive}} index across a wavefront {{leads to a}} change in the direction of propagation of the wave(1, 2). This provides the basis for phase-contrast imaging of transparent or weakly absorbing materials with highly coherent X-ray beams(3, 4). <b>Lattice</b> <b>distortions</b> can also change the direction of propagation of a wave field diffracted from a crystal. Here we report the use of this principle to effect phase-contrast imaging of the domain structure of a ferroelectric material, lithium niobate. A periodically domain-inverted structure for quasi-phase-matching of second-harmonic generation is created in this material, in which the direction of spontaneous polarization is sequentially inverted. Because of complex interactions during domain-inversion processing, this is accompanied by <b>lattice</b> <b>distortions</b> across the domain walls.
