50|$|Modern {{critics of}} the poem {{emphasize}} its many historical inaccuracies. For example, the poem depicts the <b>lantern</b> <b>signal</b> in the Old North Church as meant for Revere, but actually the signal was from Revere: the historical Paul Revere did not receive the <b>lantern</b> <b>signal,</b> but actually {{was the one who}} ordered it to be set up. The poem also depicts Revere rowing himself across the Charles River when, in reality, he was rowed over by others. He also did not reach Concord that night. Another inaccuracy is a general lengthening of the time frame of the night's events.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, the expeditionary force of over 700 {{soldiers}} left Boston. Paul Revere rode to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams, who were staying in Lexington (which {{is on the way}} to Concord), to leave so they would not be arrested by the British force. Revere had previously arranged the famous <b>lantern</b> <b>signal</b> from the Old North Church to patriots {{on the other side of}} the Charles River, so they could spread the word, in case Revere was prevented from leaving Boston.|$|E
50|$|April - Trailing soft pink cherry blossom (sakura) {{mixed with}} {{butterflies}} and bonbori <b>lanterns,</b> <b>signaling</b> {{the approach of}} summer. Cherry blossom viewing {{at this time of}} year is a major cultural event in Japan. Also, kanzashi consisting of a single silver (or sometimes gold) butterfly (cho) made of mizuhiki cord are common.|$|R
50|$|The legal {{proceedings}} investigating {{the cause of}} the accident carried on for a year. The exact sequence of events could not be determined, as the dispatcher of the station died in a car accident shortly after the train crash. It was proven that the car accident was not caused by the dispatcher, ruling out suicide. The driver of the freight train, who survived the accident, testified in court that he saw a green light from the dispatcher's hand <b>lantern,</b> <b>signalling</b> him to pass through the station without stopping.|$|R
50|$|Two {{children}} named Gracie Jenkins and Daniel Pender {{are best}} friends {{living on the}} island of Bryher. They enjoy sailing wooden boats that they make off the numerous beaches, but the tide carries their favorite one across to a forbidden bay. This is the home of a local hermit nicknamed the Birdman, whom all the children are forbidden to go near and whom none of the adults trust. This is partly due to him being born on a nearby island named Samson which all locals avoid, as they say it is cursed. On stormy nights he goes over to Samson and can be seen sending <b>lantern</b> <b>signals</b> out to sea.|$|R
60|$|When {{the station}} man came back they {{purchased}} two tickets for Chicago {{and the man}} set out his <b>lantern</b> to <b>signal</b> the express. Then Songbird said good-bye, wishing them all kinds of good luck, and rode back to Brill.|$|R

50|$|Following President Ford's remarks, two {{lanterns}} were lit by Robert Newman Ruggles and Robert Newman Sheet, {{descendants of}} Robert Newman, who, as sexton of the Old North Church in 1775, lit the two <b>lanterns</b> which <b>signaled</b> {{the movement of}} British troops. The President then lit a third lantern, which hangs in a window of the church today.|$|R
50|$|As they ascend the icy mountain, a {{slightly}} jealous Hans (the three had innocently shared a bed the night before, Hans awaking to find Krafft's {{under the heading}} a smiling Maria) insists on taking the lead. While traversing a difficult stretch, he is swept away by an avalanche. Krafft climbs down and rescues the injured Hans, moving him to a precarious ledge near an avalanche shute. Maria bandages Hans' injured scalp, and the three consider their predicament—trapped on the narrow ledge with no means of escape. Moreover, while rescuing Hans, Dr. Krafft broke one of his legs, which he then splints up. Despite Krafft's desperate calls for help, {{there is no one}} near enough to rescue them. They find a small ice cave which provides some shelter during the night for Maria and Hans, while Krafft stands outside with his <b>lantern</b> <b>signaling</b> for help, his ice pick used as a crutch.|$|R
5000|$|The Bavarian track {{blocking}} signal (Gleissperrsignal) is [...] "the {{mother of all}} {{blocking signal}}s".The round <b>signal</b> <b>lanterns</b> displayed a round, white milk glass disc towards the train. This had a horizontal, black bar across it. Unlike the later Reichsbahn standard design, the black bar was not turned; instead the whole lantern was rotated through 90° on its pedestal, so that {{the side of the}} lantern was presented to the train. The side of the <b>signal</b> <b>lantern</b> had an almost square milk glass window. At night the lantern was lit internally.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{rail cars}} were first hauled by horses or mules. A mounted flagman {{on a horse}} preceded some early trains. Hand and arm signals were used to direct the “train drivers”. Foggy and poor-visibility conditions gave rise to flags and <b>lanterns.</b> Wayside <b>signalling</b> dates {{back as far as}} 1832, and used elevated flags or balls that could be seen from afar.|$|R
40|$|This NebGuide {{contains}} {{hand signals}} useful for communicating around noisy equipment {{and from a}} distance. Throughout history, man has devised methods of contacting others who were out of voice range or {{who could not be}} heard because of excess noise. The Indians were skilled at using smoke signals or by imitating some form of wildlife such as the owl or coyote. The early explorers used other signs to guide them. The slashing of bark on trees or sticks pointed in a certain direction were keys for keeping the persons from getting lost or for others to follow. The railroad used a system of <b>lantern</b> <b>signals</b> to make contact between the trainman and the engineer. The Navy used semaphore or a system of flags to communicate between ships at sea. In fact, the Jolly Roger was really a signal to other ships that they were in for trouble. Think of some of the devices used for signaling. They include alarm, beacon, bell, buzzer, fire, flag, gong, gun, hand, lamp, lantern, light, mast, post, rocket, shot, siren, whistle, and others...|$|R

50|$|The poem {{is spoken}} by the {{landlord}} of the Wayside Inn and tells a partly fictionalized story of Paul Revere. In the poem, Revere tells {{a friend to}} prepare <b>signal</b> <b>lanterns</b> in the Old North Church to inform him if the British will attack by land or sea. He would await the signal across the river in Charlestown {{and be ready to}} spread the alarm throughout Middlesex County, Massachusetts. The unnamed friend climbs up the steeple and soon sets up two <b>signal</b> <b>lanterns,</b> informing Revere that the British are coming by sea. Revere rides his horse through Medford, Lexington, and Concord to warn the patriots.|$|R

50|$|According to {{the most}} common version of the legend, Joe Baldwin was the sole {{occupant}} of the rear car of a Wilmington-bound train on a rainy night in 1867. As the train neared Maco, Baldwin realized the car had become detached {{from the rest of}} the train. He knew another train was following, so he ran to the rear platform and frantically waved a <b>lantern</b> to <b>signal</b> the oncoming train. The engineer failed to see the stranded railroad car in time, and Baldwin was decapitated in the collision. Some variants of the story added that Baldwin's head was never found.|$|R
50|$|The {{lanterns}} {{were hung}} for just under {{a minute to}} avoid catching {{the eyes of the}} British troops occupying Boston, but this was long enough for the message to be received in Charlestown. The militia waiting across the river had been told to look for the <b>signal</b> <b>lanterns,</b> and were prepared to act as soon as they saw them.|$|R
60|$|It is {{needless to}} say that the call was unanswered; and then all on board began to {{understand}} the mode of escape. Officers rushed into the several boats, and no less than five different parties commenced the pursuit. At the same time the ship hoisted a <b>lantern,</b> as a <b>signal</b> for the boats to rally to.|$|R

They conclude a Green Lantern must have constructed the beacon.|$|R
2500|$|In all the noise, Pearson {{could not}} {{actually}} hear the reply to his question, {{so he decided}} to send a boarding team. At this point, once again, Jones’s preparation paid off. The boarders were met by a previously hidden defensive force, which swiftly drove them back to Serapis. By this time, the attempts to bring down Serapis’ main mast had also borne some fruit (ironically, the only reason why it had not fallen down was because it was leaning on Bonhomme Richard’s rigging). And then, perhaps about 10:15pm, Alliance returned, and Landais delivered another of his helpful broadsides. Jones’s men yelled at him to stop, and the commodore attempted to send orders for Alliance to help with a boarding operation. The moon was full, brightly illuminating the distinctive yellow livery of Serapis. Bonhomme Richard was clearly showing agreed <b>lantern</b> <b>signals,</b> but Landais stuck to his plan, sailing round the [...] "safe" [...] sides of the locked ships to fire broadsides aimed, in his theory, at both bow and stern of Serapis. In reality, Bonhomme Richard, yet again, was holed below the waterline and started settling so rapidly that the master-at-arms took it upon himself to release the hundred or so prisoners from previous captures, who had been held on the lower decks. As they had not been put in manacles, they were completely free and could potentially have helped Serapis’ crew to overrun the American ship. Jones reacted quickly to the new crisis, successfully urging the prisoners to put all their efforts into working the three remaining pumps to save their own lives.|$|R
5000|$|The Old North Church, {{built in}} 1723, was the {{location}} where Paul Revere had <b>signal</b> <b>lanterns</b> lit {{on the night}} of April 18, 1775, prior to his [...] "midnight ride" [...] that led to the Battles of Lexington and Concord and the start of the revolutionary war. The church, the oldest operating in Boston, has an Episcopalian congregation, which owns and operates the building.|$|R

In July 1911, newspapers reported the burning of the River Queen [...] "to the water's edge" [...] following the explosion of a <b>signal</b> <b>lantern</b> on board. The press reported that [...] "For {{the past year or}} two the River Queen has been used as an excursion boat for Negroes." ...|$|R
50|$|The Colt's {{acetylene}} flash lantern {{was employed}} for night signals. The flash {{is produced by}} means of a key which causes a full flame to burst forth in the lantern for the length of time the key is pressed down; when the pressure is removed the light reduces to a minute jet, not visible to the receiving station. It is carried in three leather cases, one holding the tripod, one the generator, and the third the flash lantern, reading lamp, and remaining parts. It is assembled on an extension tripod, with the flash lantern on top, the generator attached to the legs beneath the lantern, and the reading lamp is placed on one leg near the <b>lantern.</b> The <b>signals</b> can be seen up to thirty miles with an ordinary field glass.|$|R
25|$|The {{first public}} police {{telephones}} in Britain {{were introduced in}} Glasgow in 1891. These tall, hexagonal, cast-iron boxes were painted red and had large gas lanterns fixed to the roof, {{as well as a}} mechanism which enabled the central police station to light the <b>lanterns</b> as <b>signals</b> to police officers in the vicinity to call the station for instructions. As with Chicago's boxes, the original intent was that trusted members of the public would be allowed access to the telephone in case of emergency using a special key that was registered to them, which would remain trapped in the lock until released by a master key carried by a policeman. A newer, rectangular type of cast-iron police box was introduced in Glasgow in 1912, but with the signal light now powered by electricity rather than gas, and access to the telephone now restricted solely to the police.|$|R
60|$|Additional stays {{were fixed}} to the jury mast, {{as it might be}} necessary, at any moment, to attempt to bring her up into the wind; and the word was passed that both watches must remain on deck. Fortunately the night was a light one, for the moon was up, and the sky almost cloudless. The mate stood with two of the best hands at the wheel; while the second mate took his place in the fore top, with a <b>lantern,</b> to <b>signal</b> the {{position}} of ice ahead. Fortunately there were but few small floating blocks about, and the Paramatta threaded her way through the larger bergs, without once approaching near enough to render danger imminent. It was a long and anxious night but, when morning broke, it was seen that the sea was now open ahead, and by the afternoon they had left the last berg behind.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the large}} {{population}} and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections {{of the city in}} 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of <b>lantern</b> and flag <b>signals</b> to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the days}} before April 18, Revere had {{instructed}} Robert Newman, the sexton of the North Church, to send a <b>signal</b> by <b>lantern</b> to alert colonists in Charlestown as to {{the movements of the}} troops when the information became known. In what is well known today by the phrase [...] "one if by land, two if by sea", one lantern in the steeple would signal the army's choice of the land route while two <b>lanterns</b> would <b>signal</b> the route [...] "by water" [...] across the Charles River (the movements would ultimately take the water route, and therefore two lanterns were placed in the steeple). Revere first gave instructions to send the signal to Charlestown. He then crossed the Charles River by rowboat, slipping past the British warship HMS Somerset at anchor. Crossings were banned at that hour, but Revere safely landed in Charlestown and rode to Lexington, avoiding a British patrol and later warning almost every house along the route. The Charlestown colonists dispatched additional riders to the north.|$|R

For example, he once shot down an enemy <b>signal</b> <b>lantern</b> and enabled the Liangshan forces to retreat safely. In another incident, Hua Rong shoots down an eagle high up in the sky with a single arrow shot. His charisma also makes him an important figure in persuading several other heroes to join the Liangshan cause.|$|R
50|$|Twin blasts shook two {{coaches of}} the Samjhauta Express {{travelling}} between India and Pakistan at around 23:53 IST (18:23 UTC) on Sunday, 18 February 2007, {{shortly after the}} train had passed through the railway station {{in the village of}} Diwana, near the Indian city of Panipat. One railway employee manning the level crossing at the time stated:It was about 11.52 when I showed the <b>signal</b> <b>lantern</b> to the Attari Samjhauta Express which was coming in very fast, probably at over 100 kilometers an hour (62.1 mph). Just as it reached near the home signal, I could hear two loud explosions from the coaches near the guards' van at the rear.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{his eyes}} {{caught on a}} distant {{sandbank}} the red gleam of Daman's camp fire instantly eclipsed like the wink of a <b>signalling</b> <b>lantern</b> along {{the level of the}} waters. It brought to his mind the existence of the two men--those other captives. If the war canoe transporting them into the lagoon had left the sands shortly after Hassim's retreat from Daman's camp, Travers and d'Alcacer were by this time far away up the creek. Every thought of action had become odious to Lingard since all he could do in the world now was to hasten the moment of his separation from that woman to whom he had confessed the whole secret of his life.|$|R
50|$|The Vega LED Beacon (VLB)-36 is a self {{contained}} Light Emitting Diode (LED) lantern {{suitable for use}} on both buoys and structures. It is used where it is economical to replace legacy signal and power hardware with a single lantern and a {{self contained}} power system (i.e., solar panels, battery and light are a single unit). The US Coast Guard amongst others purchases and distributes VLB-36 LED red and green lanterns. The lantern is completely self-contained and has three solar panels, LED optic head and a lead-acid non-spill rechargeable battery. It is provided to meet the usual marine requirements in white, yellow, red and green. The cap above the <b>lantern</b> indicates the <b>signal</b> color.|$|R
