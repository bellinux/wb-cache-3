500|$|Writer Rob Edwards {{stated that}} [...] "it was {{extremely}} challenging" [...] {{to take a}} classic novel and set it in outer space, and that they did away {{with some of the}} science fiction elements ("things like the metal space ships and the coldness") early on. Edwards {{goes on to say that}} they [...] "did a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> make the film more modern" [...] and that the idea behind setting the film in outer space was to [...] "make the story as exciting for kids now as the book was for kids then".|$|E
500|$|In post-production, Wan {{found he}} did not have enough shots or takes to work with as he was {{basically}} shooting rehearsals. Having a lot of missing gaps in the final product, he and editor Kevin Greutert created shots to mend together during editing; such as making a shot look like a surveillance camera feed and using still photographs. [...] "We did a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> fill in gaps throughout the film. Whatever we cut to newspaper clippings and stuff like that, or we cut to surveillance cameras, or we cut to still photography within the film, which now people say, 'Wow, that's such a cool experimental style of filmmaking', we really did that out of necessity to fill in gaps we did not get during the filming," [...] he explained.|$|E
500|$|After 10.Qxd2, Tseitlin {{explains}} that [...] "opening manuals assess this position as favourable to White {{on the basis}} of the bishop pair. However, considering the closed nature of the position, White faces substantial difficulties in the realisation of this nominal advantage." [...] Black has not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> be proud of as there are no targets in White's camp, but can put up a lot of resistance thanks to small assets. Black's Ne5 is strongly centralised, attacks the c4-pawn, and restricts the Bf1 from moving to the natural squares d3 and f3. Moreover, exchanging the knight with Bxe5 is not appealing for White, since that would mean losing the advantage of the bishop pair. Also, the Bc8 can sometimes become better than its counterpart the Bf1, if it makes it to the good squares b7 or c6 while the Bf1 remains restricted by the Ne5.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the [...] "X-File in itself is an interesting concept, but left frustratingly vague." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did positively write that the episode is [...] "a character study which gives its new leads some background and depth and, better yet, somewhere new to develop." [...] VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an [...] "C+" [...] and wrote that [...] "there are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> like in “Empedocles,” but the central conceit is just too stupid for the episode as a whole to work." [...] While he enjoyed the [...] "way that [...] features all four FBI agents in the same episode", he was critical of both the plot and the Mulder and Scully dynamic, noting that it fell flat.|$|E
500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that on a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> get a little more grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E
500|$|Watch the Throne {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 76, based on 42 reviews. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "exhilarating messiness and go-for-broke spontaneity infect Jay-Z and push him outside his comfort zone {{and into a}} realm of intense emotional reflection." [...] Pitchforks Tom Breihan felt that it [...] "works best when Jay and Kanye are just talking about how great they are," [...] adding that [...] "Kanye is this album's obvious guiding force ... He displays levels of unequaled audacity." [...] Claire Suddath of Time called it [...] "a beautifully decadent album by two of hip-hop's finest artists—men with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say {{and a lot of}} money to spend." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph praised West's [...] "attention to detail" [...] and found their [...] "wit and absurdity [...] entirely suited to the epic scale of productions." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer stated, [...] "Some find this sort of branded gloating distasteful, but at their best both rappers can still make you laugh." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times deemed it [...] "a cocksure, fiery, smart, if problematic, collaboration that showcases the pair's distinct lyrical skills." [...] Julian Benbow of The Boston Globe observed [...] "an undeniable synergy that they embraced for this project."

2500|$|Sinclair {{announced}} in March 2009 that the series' second season would rely less on 90210 alums like Jennie Garth and Shannen Doherty to boost ratings. She felt that [...] "the show {{tried to be}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> {{a lot of people in}} its first season [...] I think the center lies with the generation of kids that are in high school now." [...] It was also announced that Dustin Milligan ('Ethan Ward') would not be coming back for season two, while Matt Lanter would be joining the cast as a series regular. Casting soon began for new characters to be introduced in the second season. In June 2009, the series was reportedly looking for an actor to play the recurring role of Teddy, a tennis champ returning to West Beverly. Actor and model Trevor Donovan was later cast in the role. Ann Gillespie returned in the second season for multiple episodes as Jackie Taylor, Silver and Kelly's mother. Her character was once again sober and hoped to reconnect with her daughters after being diagnosed with cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Gabriel Rotello blogged about McAlary in The Huffington Post {{after hearing}} about the play. He noted that McAlary {{represented}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> a lot of people, but as the first openly gay columnist, Rotello viewed McAlary unfavorably. According to Rotello, McAlary was an aggressive journalist who {{had a reputation for}} reporting on corrupt cops and miscreants in New York City's crack era. He relied heavily on police sources, hanging out with then-New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton and his mouthpiece, John Miller. His career was built on high-level access rather than using street sources and fact-corroboration. He became prominent in the public eye in Spring 1994 when a black lesbian reported that she had been raped in broad daylight in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. The headline on McAlary's story read [...] "Rape Hoax the Real Crime", with a story alleging that the woman had concocted the story for political purposes such as speaking at lesbian rallies. At the time, New York had recently endured the Tawana Brawley rape allegations, and gaybashing was at its apex. The police then revealed substantial evidence in support of the story and began investigating McAlary's source. Two weeks later McAlary affirmed his story, and the police backed off the investigation. Rotello, who was then with New York Newsday, got Miller on tape confirming that McAlary was begging his police contacts to back him up. McAlary lost credibility with the police and the gay community. Rotello concedes, however, that McAlary later had major success.|$|E

2500|$|Daniel [...] "Danny" [...] McCoy (Josh Duhamel) is {{initially}} Ed Deline's apprentice, surrogate son, and good friend, who is later promoted to head of security. The series' pilot episode is told largely from his perspective and features Danny doing voice-over narration. This convention was quickly dropped, although he remained the show's main character throughout its five-year run. After Ed's resignation in season three, Danny is made {{vice president of}} operations of the Montecito Resort and Casino for a brief period. However, following Ed's return, Danny is officially reinstated as head of security in season three. He {{was born and raised in}} Las Vegas.

Danny sells his father's house and uses the money to pay for a condo. Danny is a former U.S. Marine, with guerrilla training and counterintelligence training. [...] He is recalled into military service in Iraq at the end of season one. In season two, he is awarded the Silver Star after he calls in an air strike over his unit and himself when they are ambushed and overrun. Only he survives the air strike.

2500|$|Following her divorce, Jackson {{decided to}} record an uptempo, optimistic album rather than songs about sadness or anger. Producer Jimmy Jam said, [...] "You {{go through all}} these {{emotions}} and then {{you come out of}} it {{on the other side and}} say, [...] "I'm going to be okay and I have a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> be thankful for,' and that was the overriding feeling in her life when we were making this album." [...] Its concept focuses largely on the demise of her marriage to René Elizondo, Jr. and subsequent embrace of the single life, experiencing dating for the first time. It also contains themes of sensuality, deceit, and betrayal. Jackson said, [...] "It’s a different thing for me. Growing up, I never dated. I’m doing that now, experiencing that whole life." [...] Its upbeat tempo intended to reflect Jackson's self-esteem, described as [...] "a work in progress." [...] Jam commented, [...] "She doesn't see herself the way other people see her. You know...gorgeous and sexy and all that. That isn't the kind of person she is. Although she is closer to feeling like that person now than she was 15 years ago. Or even three of four years ago." [...] Jackson commented, [...] "I look back at pictures of myself from four years ago and I see the unhappiness in my eyes. But I'm in the greatest space now... I believe we have choices and paths, and it's about choosing the right path, the promising path." [...] While recording, Jackson listened to artists such as St. Germain, Buena Vista Social Club, Thievery Corporation, Basement Jaxx, Outkast and Papa Roach.|$|E
