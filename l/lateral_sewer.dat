The analysis demonstrates that the designprocess behind the infrastructure projects was, on the one hand, the outcome ofa complex interplay of technical parameters, transport-economic logics,military strategies, or the characteristics of landscape. However, on the otherhand, the investigation in the case studies also revealed underlying spatial developmentmotives behind the infrastructure designs, proving that infrastructure was morethan the commercial-economic skeleton of the country, a logistic instrument ora merely transport facilitator between point A and B. Infrastructure wassuccessively and conscientiously used as a mechanism through which to steer theexpansion of a city, colonize a province, unify a region, regenerate an area oras a way to frame local developments. The analysis sketches a wide spectrum ofmorphological relationships between infrastructure and urbanization in whichthe trajectory and its junctions act as instigators, catalysts, frameworks,filters and containers of the correlating developments. The corpus of the research consists of three case studies:the Campine, the coast and urban region of the Antwerp agglomeration. Throughout the continuous process of urbanization, thelandscape of the Campine was definitively redrawn by the canal infrastructure. With the deliberate intention of colonizing the region and reclaiming as muchwaste land as possible, the Campine canals were designed as parts of a multiplecanal network, widely spread and finely branched, with tentacles reaching intothe farthest corners of the desolate region. The new infrastructural technologies (in the form of theIron Rhine, the local railways, the Albert Canal and the Koning Boudewijnhighway) that were subsequentlyimplemented would adapt, double or expand theoriginal Campine canals, but they would also systematically endorse andreinterpret the widely spread landscape figure of the canals as an armature forthe successive layers of urbanization. The early 19 th century Belgian coastal landscape was theresult of a protracted interplay between natural processes and man-madeinterventions, consisting of the successive acts of protection, encapsulationand valorization. The railway undeniably had an important morphological impacton the four coastal cities that were branched: Ostend, Blankenberge, Nieuwpoortand Heist. At {{the turn of the}} century the landscape of the coastal region wouldreorient drastically triggered by the regional schematic for an engineeredurbanization project that featured the deployment and entanglement of threeparallel infrastructure systems: the coastal tram, the Royal Route and the seadefenses. The implementation of modern roads after the Second World War,together with a drastic reorganization of the public transport resulted in aquasi-ubiquitous and very high level of accessibility, simultaneously reflectedin various new forms of accommodation and urbanization patterns. The city of Antwerp historically grew in successive stripsframed by different infrastructural trajectories parallel with the Scheldtriver: the old city between the Quays and the Spanish stronghold, the 19 thcentury belt between the Leien and the Brialmont fortifications and the 20 thcentury city between the Ring and the projected belt of fortresses. In theearly 20 th century the implementation of the urban boulevard on the formerBrialmont site is considered the ultimate test of the new emerging disciplineof urbanism. It wasnt until the 1960 s that the multiple E 3 -infrastructureproject, consisting of a small ring, a ring railroad, a <b>lateral</b> <b>sewer</b> and theSingel, occupied the vacant fortification site. Simultaneously, the Ringscapeprovides a test bed for new urban typologies. The saga of the Large Ring Roadremains unsettled, even today. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|Gravity sewer systems {{typically}} {{resemble the}} regional runoff pattern with large trunk sewers in each valley receiving flow from smaller <b>lateral</b> <b>sewers</b> extending up hillsides. Sewer systems within comparatively level terrain require careful planning and construction to minimize energy losses in free falls, sharp bends, or turbulent junctions. Every {{reach of the}} sewer should routinely experience the minimum velocity necessary to maintain solids in suspension and avoid blockage from solids deposition in low-velocity areas. Sewers in hilly areas, however, may require energy dissipation features to avoid sewer damage from high fluid velocities and the scouring effects of gritty solids in turbulent flow. Covered sewers are buried below the frost line to avoid freezing, and deep enough to receive gravity flow from anticipated wastewater sources. Long gravity sewers may require significant excavation depths or tunneling to maintain acceptable gradients near the sewer outfall.|$|R

40|$|International audienceCombined sewer systems convey organic {{matters and}} {{pathogens}} coming from {{human and animal}} faeces. They are mixed with rainfall runoff during storm event and can overflows to natural aquatic systems. Preliminary genetic analyses of pathogens were conducted in an experimental small water course and its <b>lateral</b> combined <b>sewer</b> system (OTHU site). Results indicate that natural system pathogens are an evolution of sewer system pathogens. However their presumed survival should not be confounded with their frequent delivery to the water course. Then a {{first step is to}} check for concentrations and frequencies that are delivered to receiving waters. First data on three pathogen species concentrations were sampled from 2009 to 2011 into the combined sewer system. Data exhibit variations that can be related to dry and wet weather sequences. However variations do not fully correlate between pathogen species. This would indicate growing rate and/or differing locations in the sewer pipe. The main hypothesis to explain concentration increase with storm events is the flushing of organic biofilms lining the immerged part of sewer conduit. This hypothesis is to be confirmed with complementary data more focussed on the water column during storm events and lining biofilms during dry weather...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{requirements}} for water pollution control and high financial loads of municipalities aroused {{the interest in}} optimizing and cost-reducing investigations in the sewage sector in the past years. From the broad topic particularly the infiltration and inflow moved in the focus of political and technical discussions. Infiltration and inflow water is described as an undesired part of the wastewater flow in sewer systems. Predominantly it consists of groundwater infiltration over leakages in public and/or private sewers and drain pipes {{as well as the}} rainfall induced inflow into sanitary sewers. It leads to an additional hydraulic charge, a reduced efficiency of wastewater treatment plants and thus to a higher pollution of water bodies and an increase of sewage costs. In this thesis solutions to avoid and reduce infiltration and inflow are examined taking into account aspects of groundwater management and discharge. For this the national and international state of knowledge is compiled. Finally an integrated view on the topic by an evaluation of measures such as infiltration/inflow reduction and their effects have been achieved. This specifically relates to the possibility of rising groundwater levels with the particular consequences of water-logging or useage restrictions. A sustained and successful reduction of infiltration and inflow can only be achieved by appropriate planning and a supportive tool such as this theses to achieve effective solutions. The significance of groundwater infiltration through leakages in public and <b>lateral</b> <b>sewers</b> are still unknown. Therefore extensive examinations were performed to quantify infiltration volumes into leaking sewers. For this the groundwater infiltration rates into leaking sewers were measured in two separate laboratory test set-ups with varying kinds of surrounding soil, groundwater levels, damages and loads. By evaluating the results of measurements an empirical dependency between groundwater infiltration for point, tearing and sleeve damages and the water permeability of the soil, the damage surface and the hydrostatic pressure can be found. Due to this the success of infiltration-reducing measures, in particular sewer rehabilitation, can be forecasted assuming knowledge of the soil and/or the hydro geological environment. Finally an integrated approach is made to evaluate the measures for infiltration/inflow reduction and their effects. Therefore different scenarios of infiltration/inflow occurrences were developed. By using an efficiency analysis suitable measures were assessed concerning technical, ecological and economic, legal and socio-political criteria. The influence of different weightings of the evaluation criteria is examined by a stability analysis. As a result orders of rank and measure combinations can be determined for infiltration/inflow reduction in each scenario. Thus the expenditure of measures to reduce infiltration/inflow can be calculated more efficiently and a higher planning security can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) {{wishes to}} share its {{experience}} in mitigating floods from Combined Sewer Overflow {{in the middle}} of two densely populated residential neighborhoods. During the Summer of 2012, the Bloomingdale and LeDroit Park neighborhoods in the Northwest Washington DC experienced severe flooding several times. The cause of the flooding was attributed to overflow from Combined Sewer manholes and sanitary <b>sewer</b> <b>laterals.</b> To reduce the impact from future occurrences, DDOT was tasked to develop and implement short and mid-term solutions to control the overland run-off. In November 2013, DDOT completed the short term solutions of installing Permeable Brick Alley with a 362 ̆ 2 underground detention tank, Bioretention cell, new catch basins, and 602 ̆ 2 underground detention tank in order to reduce and control the overland flow. The combination of bioretention cell, permeable alley and 602 ̆ 2 detention tank, stores approximately 100, 000 gallons. The implementation of Mid–term solutions will begin in April 2014. With input from the residents, DDOT will design and construct various Green Infrastructure Elements (permeable pavement, bioretention cells, and plantings). In the later years, DDOT will focus on the neighborhoods uphill of Bloomingdale and LeDroit Park neighborhoods. The presentation will focus about community outreach and the approach to install neighborhood wide Green Infrastructur...|$|R
40|$|Aging sewer {{infrastructure}} is posing {{greater and greater}} risk {{to the health and}} well-being of City residents. Issues can range from pipe blockages in <b>sewer</b> <b>laterals</b> to Sanitary <b>Sewer</b> Overflows. This thesis develops a risk analysis method that can be used by municipalities to maintain and rehabilitate sewer assets. Risk combines the effect of Likelihood of Failure (LOF) and Consequence of Failure (COF) to perform a complete two-dimensional analysis that allows for relative comparison between different pipes in the system. The LOF rating has been equated to pipe integrity while the COF rating was related to the environmental, economic, and social consequences to pipe failure. In order to estimate pipe integrity Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) scores from the City of Santa Barbara were used in combination with spatial and physical properties associated with each pipe. The CCTV scores were simply integer values between 0 and 5 based on the National Association of Sewer Services Company’s (NASSCO) Pipeline Assessment Certification Program (PACP) results. The quantitative parameters included pipe material and age, distance from restaurants, distance from any above ground water source, pipe depth below the ground surface, pipe length, and vehicular traffic volumes. The sensitivity analysis compared the given structural integrity scores with the predicted scores based on the weighted scoring method. It isolated four out of six of the parameters tested that affected the structural integrity of sewer pipes: material and age (45 %), pipe depth (20 %), Vehicular Traffic (10 %), and distance from an above-ground water source (25 %). A program was created in the C programming language that iteratively determined the percentage for each factor. These percentage factors are used to obtain the predicted structural integrity score for all the pipes. Like the LOF rating, the COF rating consisted of scores between 0 and 5. The COF rating used pipe diameter, distance from commercial zones, distance from critical infrastructure, and vehicular traffic volume as parameters for quantifying the environmental, economic, and social consequences. These factors were determined from review of past literature and given approximately equal weighting when determining the COF rating values. The environmental factor, pipe diameter, was given a percentage factor of 30 %; the economic factor, distance to commercial zones, was given a percentage factor of 30 %; and the social concerns, distance to critical infrastructure and vehicular traffic volume, were given percentage factors of 20 % each. Finally, the risk for each pipe was determined in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) by combining the predicted structural integrity score or LOF rating and COF rating value for each pipe. This generated color-coded maps that showed distinct pipes that had the most critical predicted structural integrity scores, highest consequence, and the pipes with the most risk. This process could be used by any City to create a maintenance and rehabilitation schedule and plan for future CCTV inspections...|$|R
