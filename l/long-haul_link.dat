40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that the transmission distance of an ON–OFF-keyed high-speed pseudolinear optical communication system can be dramatically improved by means of runlength-limited coding. The key idea is to impose constraints on transmitted sequences such that the minimum interpulse spacing increases, and the average transmission power decreases. Both effects result in considerable suppression of intrachannel four-wave mixing, a major nonlinear penalty in pseudolinear <b>long-haul</b> <b>links.</b> Several coding schemes with different properties are designed for various constraints and compared against a prototypical reference system.

This paper presents an empirical evaluation of delays across inter-AS links using hop-limited active probes. The measurements cover a diverse set of Internet paths starting from locations within three large transit Internet Service Providers (ISPs). We find that most inter-AS links on the Internet paths covered by this study do not contribute significantly to end-to-end delays. The few exceptions are <b>long-haul</b> <b>links</b> with large propagation delays. Furthermore, the delay estimates are fairly stable across days, making it possible for ISPs to choose inter-domain paths or perform traffic engineering based on delay measurement feedback.

40|$|The use of wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} (WDM) in soliton {{communication systems}} was first proposed by Mollenauer et al. in [1]. As in conventional systems, WDM allows {{a substantial increase}} in system capacity compared to single channel systems. However, soliton interchannel collisions can induce residual frequency shifts that degrade the system performance through timing jitter. In practice, these residual shifts must be reduced, limiting the maximum frequency separation between the outermost channels. Ultimately, this restricts the possible number of channels and thus limits the transmission rate of WDM solitons systems. The use of dispersion management may substantially reduce the residual frequency shifts (and the resultant timing jitter), if the dispersion maps are chosen judiciously. In [2], we have developed a Lagrangian formulation that enables optimal dispersion maps to be chosen. Another possible technique is the use of fixed or sliding frequency filters that damp the residual frequency shifts [3], thus overcoming the restriction in the maximum number of channels. However, there are always residual timing shifts that, when added over the many collisions suffered by solitons in <b>long-haul</b> <b>links,</b> can be an important source of jitter.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{provide a}} challenging application area for signal processing. Sensor networks are collections of small, battery-operated devices called sensor nodes, {{each of which}} is capable of sensing data, processing data with an onboard microprocessor, and sharing data with other nodes by forming a wireless, multi-hop network. Since communication power consumption in nodes typically dominates over sensing and processing power consumption by orders of magnitude, it is often more efficient to pose questions on measured data in a distributed fashion within the network than it is to collect data at a single location for centralized processing. Under this model, nodes collaborate with each other in some neighborhood using localized communications and in-network processing to compute answers to users' questions, which are then sent over more costly, <b>long-haul</b> <b>links</b> to a data sink. In this thesis, our contributions to distributed data processing in sensor networks fall into two main categories. First, we develop a new class of multi-scale distributed data processing algorithms based on distributed wavelet analysis. Specifically, we formulate and analyze a novel, distributed wavelet transform (WT) suited to the irregular-grid data samples expected in real-world sensor network deployments. The WT replaces node measurements with a set of wavelet coefficients that are more sparse than the original data and enable subsequent distributed processing. We then develop and analyze protocols for wavelet-based processing, including distributed, lossy compression and distributed de-noising of node measurements. Our second main contribution is the development of a network application programming interface (API) for distributed data processing in sensor networks. Guided by our experience in implementing the distributed WT in a real sensor network, we realize that a fundamental set of communication patterns underlie the bulk of distributed algorithms. Expanding our scope past the distributed WT, we survey all such algorithms proposed in the proceedings of the Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN) conference to extract the communication patterns. Using the survey results, we design a network API composed of four main families of calls. Its implementation, in ongoing work, will enable easy and invaluable prototyping of distributed processing algorithms in real sensor network hardware...|$|R
