Since then {{the price of gold}} has increased about 1000 percent while consumer prices have increased only about 250 percent or, roughly, a quarter of the increase in the gold price.

5000|$|The {{album is}} {{considered}} by many to be, along with its predecessor The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, the best work the band ever produced. Consisting of a varied selection of songs by Robin Williamson and Mike Heron, with intriguing and poetic lyrics, the album is rich with eclectic and adept instrumentation and arrangements. Around 15 instruments are featured, played mainly by the two band members Williamson and Heron but also, in supporting roles, on a few tracks by Rose Simpson and Licorice McKechnie. Williamson explained the title as follows:- [...] "I saw a man with a huge big dog, and we knew somebody called Wee Tam, in Edinburgh.

2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions {{at two in the}} morning where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, very sure about what was on the page." [...] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot.

He went into the album writing process with a certain desire to not feel restrained {{by the success of}} his previous album Person Pitch, commenting: [...] I got this M3-M workstation, it's usually part of a synthesizer, but I got the version that's just a module-- just a white box, basically. I found out that you could run a line input into the thing and affect that within the box. So, pretty early on in the process, I had this idea of just sticking a guitar into that; that was essentially going to be my setup.Even before I wrote any songs, I had this idea of a triangle where the voice was at the top, some sort of guitar element on one side, and then some sort of really basic rhythm on the other side. That's where I started from in the recording process. So having everything filter through this one brain, this box, seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> really <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> It's <b>a</b> hellish thing to mix live, but I liked how it would connect the dots in the songwriting sense, because everything has these weird little tongue licks of certain types of sound.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of television cameras in legislatures met, in many countries, with serious {{debate about the}} potential benefits and costs of broadcasting legislative debate. There were concerns about tendency for cameras to produce less focused,more attention-seeking behaviour amongst partymembers, and especial-ly leaders. This work draws together the literatures on televising debates, and on personalisation, to explore the impact of {{introduction of}} cameras in the Canadian House of Commons. Analyses are based on content analytic database of over 11, 000 questions asked from 1957 to 2004; they suggest no discernible impact of cameras on House debates. These results are discussed as they pertain to both the current literature on personalisation, and the design of legislative institutions and communication policies. What happens if you put television cameras in legislative assemblies? There are consequences for {{the flow of information}} outside the assembly, certainly. Citizens are better able to see andhearwhat happens inside; journalists, even those not in the press gallery, are able to see and report on what happens as well. If the main goal is the communication of legislative information beyond the walls of the legislature— more importantly, into the homes of the voting public—then television cameras in legislatures seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> There arepotential disadvantages aswell, however. Itmaybe easier for citizens to observe and hold accountable their legislative representatives; but it may also be easier for legislative representatives to win popular support through their behav-iour in the legislature. This can change, fundamentally and negatively, the function of legislative debate. The focus may no longer be on legislation; instead, the focus may be on the outside world. Legislative debate may become indistinguishable fromcampaign stump speeches. The behaviour of party leadersmaybe particularly strongly affected. They may be under pressure to steal the spotlight and to dra...|$|R

40|$|Many {{people suffer}} from kidney failure and need a kidney transplant. Currently, the US {{waiting list for}} kidneys has about 100, 000 people on it. An old idea, used also for other organs, is {{deceased}} donors — when someone dies and is a registered organ donor, their organs can be transplanted into others. One special feature of kidneys is that a healthy person has {{two of them and}} can survive just fine with only one of them. This creates the possibility of living organ donors, such as a family member of the patient in need. Unfortunately, having a living kidney donor is not always enough — sometimes a patient-donor pair is incompatible, meaning that the donor’s kidney is unlikely to function well in the patient. Blood and tissue types are the primary culprits for incompatibilities. For example, a patient with O blood type can only receive a kidney from a donor with the same blood type, and similarly an AB donor can only donate to an AB patient. Suppose patient P 1 is incompatible with its donor D 1 because they have blood types A and B, respectively. Suppose P 2 and D 2 are in the opposite boat, with blood types B and A, respectively (Figure 1). Even though (P 1,D 1) may never have met (P 2,D 2), exchanging donors seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pretty <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> — P 1 can get its kidney from D 2 and P 2 from D 1. This is called a kidney exchange. A few kidney exchanges were done, on an ad hoc basis, around the beginning of this century. These isolated successes make clear the need for a nationwide kidney exchange, where incompatible patient-donor pairs can register and be matched with others. How should such an exchange be designed? The goal of such an exchange is to thicken the kidney exchange market to enable as many matches as possible. National kidney exchanges sprang up around the middle of last decade. We’ll cover some of the early design ideas for these exchanges, as well as current challenges. These exchanges ∗ c© 2013, Tim Roughgarden...|$|R
