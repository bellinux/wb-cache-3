25|$|Schlessinger is the {{recipient}} of numerous prizes, including the Michael Landau Prize (1973), the Sara <b>Leady</b> Prize (1980), the Hestrin Prize (1983), the Levinson Prize (1984), a Ciba-Drew Award (1995), the Antoine Lacassagne Prize (1995), the Taylor Prize (2000), and the Dan David Prize (2006).|$|E
60|$|The <b>leady</b> stood unmoving, {{still holding}} the metal. Soldiers {{appeared}} in the chamber. They surrounded the <b>leady</b> and ran a counter across it carefully.|$|E
6000|$|... "They can't fire back," [...] Franks said calmly. [...] "This {{is another}} bluff. They've tried to bluff {{us all the}} way." [...] He fired {{into the face of}} a <b>leady.</b> The <b>leady</b> dissolved. [...] "They can only try to frighten us. Remember that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come this way." [...] Reluctantly, the two <b>leadys</b> coasted {{toward the}} wall of the warehouse. The three men trudged after them, their heavy shoes ringing against the concrete. At the wall, the two <b>leadys</b> paused.|$|R
60|$|Reluctantly, the {{soldiers}} regrouped. The <b>leadys</b> watched without emotion {{as the men}} marched slowly back toward the warehouse. Franks and Moss and Taylor led them across the ground, glancing alertly at the <b>leadys</b> as they walked.|$|R
60|$|Then it was over. The <b>leadys</b> {{were moving}} away, {{gathering}} together {{off to one}} side. Only four of the Surface Council remained. The others were radioactive particles in the air. D-class <b>leadys</b> were already restoring order, gathering up partly destroyed metal figures and bits and removing them.|$|R
60|$|Franks put {{the package}} in the toothed grip and {{revolved}} the tong {{so that he}} held the other end. The package swung down to the <b>leady,</b> which took it. They watched it unwrap the package and take the metal plate in its hands. The <b>leady</b> turned the metal over and over.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're doing a {{wonderful}} job," [...] Mary agreed vaguely. [...] "Do {{you know what}} we saw today? Our team is getting a <b>leady</b> to show to the school children. I saw the <b>leady,</b> but only for a moment. It's good for the children to see what their contributions are going for, don't you think?" ...|$|E
60|$|Moss {{touched him}} on the arm. An A-class <b>leady</b> {{was coming from the}} {{building}} toward them.|$|E
60|$|It {{signaled}} and the D-class <b>leadys</b> {{moved into}} life. They stepped slowly aside.|$|R
60|$|They {{entered the}} building. <b>Leadys</b> were working everywhere, poring over tables and desks.|$|R
60|$|There was a grating {{sound from}} the Tube. D-class <b>leadys</b> moved toward the edge to receive it.|$|R
60|$|The <b>leady</b> hesitated. Other B-class {{guards were}} coming, scooting across the floor, alert and alarmed. Moss peered around.|$|E
6000|$|Franks faced Taylor and Moss and continued: [...] "The lift {{will bring}} down a <b>leady</b> from the surface, one of the A-class leadys. There's an {{examination}} chamber in the next room, with a lead wall in the center, so the interviewing officers won't be exposed to radiation. We find this easier than bathing the <b>leady.</b> It is going right back up; it has a job to get back to.|$|E
60|$|They went on firing and <b>leady</b> after <b>leady</b> vanished. The room reeked {{with the}} smell of burning metal, the stink of fused plastic and steel. Taylor had been knocked down. He was {{struggling}} to find his gun, reaching wildly among metal legs, groping frantically to find it. His fingers strained, a handle swam in front of him. Suddenly something came down on his arm, a metal foot. He cried out.|$|E
60|$|The two <b>leadys</b> {{approached}} warily. Without speaking, {{they stopped}} {{close by the}} men, looking them up and down.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} and war engine {{remains on the}} surface; the elite [...] "Yance-men". Their president, Talbot Yancy, delivers inspirational speeches to the tankers, motivating them to increase their production of <b>leadies</b> and win the war. The war does eventually end. However, the Yance-men design a conspiracy to maintain {{the wealth of the}} Earth for themselves. Yancy continues to describe devastation in televised speeches. The tankers continue to produce <b>leadies.</b>|$|R
60|$|The men {{stared at}} the Tube entrance. Around them the <b>leadys</b> watched, silent and impassive, their metal faces expressionless.|$|R
6000|$|He put his {{shoulder}} {{against the wall}} and a section slid aside. Taylor gasped--Franks and Moss were hurrying up to the <b>leady!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] Moss said to Taylor, [...] "this <b>leady</b> isn't hot at all. Yet it came {{directly}} from the surface, without even being bathed." ...|$|E
60|$|Taylor nodded. He stared {{through the}} peep slot at the {{immobile}} metal figure. Already the <b>leady</b> {{was beginning to}} stir. It was bent in several places, dented and twisted, and its finish was blackened and charred. It was a <b>leady</b> that had been up there a long time; it had seen war and destruction, ruin so vast that no human being could imagine the extent. It had crawled and slunk {{in a world of}} radiation and death, a world where no life could exist.|$|E
60|$|There was silence. The <b>leadys</b> {{seemed to}} be conferring with each other, {{although}} the three men heard no sound.|$|R
50|$|Taylor's group surprises the <b>leadys</b> at {{the surface}} and demands to see the outside. Although the robots attempt to delay the humans as long as possible, the group discovers outside the bunker an {{undamaged}} valley with forests, animals, and a farm. The <b>leadys</b> reveal that the war ended {{as soon as the}} humans evacuated because the robots could not see a rational purpose for it. Analyzing history, they found that groups of humans warred with each other until they matured to overcome conflict. Humanity is almost ready for a single culture, the current worldwide division into American and Soviet sides being the final step. The <b>leadys</b> create counterfeit photographs of the devastated planet to fool humans, while destroying weapons they received and rebuilding the world for their creators' return.|$|R
60|$|Time passed, {{an endless}} moment, without measure. The men stood, nervous and alert, {{watching}} {{the row of}} <b>leadys</b> in front of them.|$|R
60|$|They {{stepped out}} of the car. A <b>leady</b> was {{approaching}} them rapidly. It coasted up {{in front of them and}} stopped, scanning them with its hand-weapon raised.|$|E
6000|$|... "Examine {{this project}} here," [...] the A-class <b>leady</b> said. Two leadys were {{carefully}} photographing something, an elaborate model {{on a table}} top. [...] "It is a good example." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come over here." [...] The <b>leady</b> {{directed}} {{them toward}} a long, low building. [...] "Work goes on constantly, whole staffs laboring {{to maintain a}} coherent and convincing picture of a global war." ...|$|E
60|$|Moss {{took back}} the metal plate from the <b>leady's</b> hands. He pressed the surface {{carefully}} {{and returned it}} to the stiff, unprotesting fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. The war continues." [...] The <b>leady's</b> {{voice was}} {{automatic}} and toneless. [...] "We {{are a little}} short of fast pursuit craft, the single-seat type. We could use also some--" ...|$|R
60|$|The men stopped, watching. <b>Leadys</b> {{operating}} the little carts moved past them, signaling silently to each other. Guns and parts were being hoisted by magnetic cranes and lowered gently onto waiting carts.|$|R
60|$|The <b>leady</b> moved uncertainly {{away from}} them. At {{the end of}} the building, a door slid back. Two A-class leadys appeared, coming slowly toward them. Each had a green stripe across its front.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{may mean}} nothing," [...] Moss said, [...] "but I doubt it. Something's going on, {{something}} strange. The <b>leady</b> told us no life could exist above without being roasted. The story doesn't fit." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned toward}} {{the lip of the}} Tube. A row of D-class leadys was {{standing}} in front of it, immobile and silent. Franks stopped, moving back. He looked around. An A-class <b>leady</b> was coming toward him.|$|E
60|$|They {{entered the}} warehouse. D-class <b>leadys</b> were loading {{material}} and weapons on surface carts. Cranes and derricks were working busily everywhere. The {{work was done}} with efficiency, but without hurry or excitement.|$|R
6000|$|... "This in incredible," [...] {{one of the}} <b>leadys</b> {{interrupted}} him coldly. [...] "You know you can't live up here. The whole surface is lethal to you. You can't possibly remain on the surface." ...|$|R
60|$|Behind them, the <b>leadys</b> {{had come}} out and were {{standing}} silently, watching, too. The gray sky turned to white and the hills appeared more clearly. Light spread across the valley floor, moving toward them.|$|R
