Programs are divided into small blocks referred to as subroutines, procedures or methods (depending on the era and the programming language being used) which generally have well-defined entrance and exit points where data is passed in or out. This information is lost as the high level language is converted into the processor's much simpler ISA. But this information is so useful that modern compilers have generalized the concept as the [...] "basic block", attempting to identify them within programs while they optimize memory access through the registers. A block of instructions does not have control statements but can have predicated instructions. The dataflow graph is encoded using these blocks, by specifying the flow of data from one block of instructions to another, or to some storage area.|$|E

We linked, evaluated and performed preliminary analyses on these data to provide a practical guide on the steps required to handle <b>linkage</b> <b>of</b> such complex <b>data</b> sources. Methods: Data on PICU admissions in England and Wales for 2003 - 2010 were extracted from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network.

Reports in the gold-standard datasets were compared to those in LabBase 2 to estimate ascertainment in LabBase 2.
