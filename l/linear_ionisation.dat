40|$|High {{harmonic}} generation (HHG) is a non-linear interaction between a driving laser pulse and a target gas. The {{result of this}} process is the generation of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and soft X-ray radiation at harmonic frequencies of the driving laser. There are several uses for this source including attosecond time resolved spectroscopy and nanoscale imaging which this thesis will focus on. The work contained within this thesis begins by investigating the development of capillary based HHG by comparison of the experimentally observed propagation of the driving laser pulse to both a <b>linear</b> <b>ionisation</b> based model and a multimode non-linearSchrodinger equation model. Manufacture, mounting and coupling into the capillary are described. A simple linear model of propagation along the capillary is compared to experimental measurements of fluorescence along the capillary showingthe presence of mode beating. The model is extended to a non linear propagation model and validated against the spatio spectral output of the capillary. The second half of the thesis takes the XUV output from a gas cell and uses it for a coherent diffractive imaging experiment (CDI). The development of the imaging setup is described before presenting the results of a preliminary CDI experiment with a binary test sample and a polychromatic beam. Accurate measurement of the XUV beam focal position was determined by recording diffraction through a binary array of apertures. Results of a CDI experiment demonstrating a resolution of better than 200 nm is shown for a polychromatic beam with an algorithm designed for a monochromatic source...|$|E
40|$|Cultures of cosmomycin D-producing Streptomyces olindensis ICB 20 {{that were}} {{propagated}} for many generations underwent mutations {{that resulted in}} production {{of a range of}} related anthracyclines by the bacteria. The anthracyclines that retained the two trisaccharide chains of the parent compound were separated by HPLC. Exact mass determination of these compounds revealed that they differed from cosmomycin D (CosD) in that they contained one to three fewer oxygen atoms (loss of hydroxyl groups). Some of the anthracyclines that were separated by HPLC had the same mass. The location from which the hydroxyl groups had been lost relative to CosD (on the aglycone and/or on the sugar residues) was probed by collisionally- activated dissociation using an electrospray <b>ionisation</b> <b>linear</b> quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The presence of anthracyclines with the same mass, but different structure, was confirmed using an electrospray ionisation travelling wave ion mobility mass spectrometer...|$|R
40|$|The {{gas phase}} {{reactions}} of the bridgehead 3 -carboxylato- 1 -adamantyl radical anion were observed {{with a series of}} neutral reagents using a modified electrospray <b>ionisation</b> <b>linear</b> ion trap mass spectrometer. This distonic radical anion was observed to undergo processes suggestive of radical reactivity including radical-radical combination reactions, substitution reactions and addition to carbon-carbon double bonds. The rate constants for {{reactions of the}} 3 -carboxylato- 1 -adamantyl radical anion with the following reagents were measured (in units 10 (- 12) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1)) : O- 18 (2) (85 +/- 4), NO (38. 4 +/- 0. 4), I- 2 (50 +/- 50), Br- 2 (8 +/- 2), CH 3 SSCH 3 (12 +/- 2), styrene (1. 20 +/- 0. 03), CHCl 3 (H abstraction 0. 41 +/- 0. 06, Cl abstraction 0. 65 +/- 0. 1), CDCl 3 (D abstraction 0. 035 +/- 0. 01, Cl abstraction 0. 723 +/- 0. 005), allyl bromide (Br abstraction 0. 53 +/- 0. 04, allylation 0. 25 +/- 0. 01). Collision rates were calculated and reaction efficiencies are also reported. This study represents the first quantitative measurement of the gas phase reactivity of a bridgehead radical and suggests that distonic radical anions are good models for the study of their elusive uncharged analogues...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} closed access, it was {{published}} in the journal Metallomics [© Royal Society of Chemistry]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper describes a set of fast and selective high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods coupled to electro-spray <b>ionisation</b> <b>linear</b> ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI–MS), sector-field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) and UV detection for in vitro studies of the bifunctional adducts of oxaliplatin with mono-nucleotides, di-nucleotides and cellular DNA. The stationary phases and the optimised conditions used for each separation are discussed. Interaction of oxaliplatin with A and G mono-nucleotides resulted in the formation of five bifunctional platinum diaminocyclohexane (DACHPt) adducts. These were two isomers of the A-DACHPt-A and A-DACHPt-G adducts, and one G-DACHPt-G adduct, as confirmed by MS/MS spectra obtained by collision induced dissociation. These adducts were also characterised by UV absorption data and SF-ICP-MS elemental 195 Pt and 31 P signals. Further, interaction of oxaliplatin with AG and GG di-nucleotides resulted in the formation of three adducts: DACHPt-GG and two isomers of the DACHPt-AG adduct, as confirmed by ESI-MS and the complementary data obtained by UV and SF-ICP-MS. Finally, a very sensitive LC-ICP-MS method for the quantification of oxaliplatin GG intra-strand adducts (DACHPt-GG) was developed and used for monitoring the in vitro formation and repair of these adducts in human colorectal cancer cells. The method detection limit was 0. 14 ppb Pt which was equivalent to 0. 22 Pt adduct per 106 nucleotides based on a 10 μg DNA sample. This detection limit makes this method suitable for in vivo assessment of DACHPt-GG adducts in patients undergoing oxaliplatin chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: High protein {{production}} and secretion with eukaryotic glycosylation machinery make T. reesei RUT-C 30 a suitable expression host for recombinant proteins. The N-glycosylation of secreted proteins of RUT-C 30 {{is known to}} vary depending on culture nutrients but O-glycosylation has been less extensively studied. Methods: O-Glycans and glycopeptides from secreted proteins were separated by porous graphitised carbon and C- 18 liquid chromatography, respectively. O-Glycans were analysed in negative ion mode by electrospray <b>ionisation</b> <b>linear</b> ion trap mass spectrometry and glycopeptides in positive ion mode by electrospray ionisation hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry. Tandem mass spectrometry was used on O-glycans and glycopeptides including ion trap higher energy collision-induced dissociation (tHCD) to detect glycan fragments not detectable with standard ion trap fragmentation. tHCD allowed targeted MS 3 experiments to be performed on structures containing hexuronic acid, which was not possible with ion trap CID, validating this novel O-glycan composition. Positive mode C 18 -LC/ESI-MS/MS was used to identify and characterise glycopeptides found to be modified with this class of O-glycans, identifying cellobiohydrolase I as a carrier of these novel O-glycans. Results: Negative mode ion trap higher energy collision-induced dissociation allowed detection and targeted MS 3 experiments to be performed on the hexuronic acid substituent of O-glycan structures, which was not possible with ion trap CID, validating the novel O-glycan composition to include hexuronic acid. Using glycopeptide analysis, this novel O-glycan composition {{was found to be}} present on the catalytic domain of cellobiohydrolase I, the most abundant secreted protein by T. reesei. Conclusions: These are the first reported O-glycans to contain acidic sugars in fungi and they could have significant implications for cellobiohydrolase I structure and activity as well as the activity of recombinant proteins expressed in this host system.

40|$|The {{application}} of ICP-MS {{to the fields}} of proteomics and genomics has arisen {{in part due to}} its ability to detect and quantify trace levels of S and P, which are major constituents in proteins and nucleic acids respectively. The development of collision/reaction cell technology and high resolution instruments has enabled these biologically important elements to be measured and quantified at the pg - ng ml- 1 level. Despite these advances, the detection limits of P and S are still inferior compared to other elements. Oligonucleotides containing biotin functionality were labelled with Au nano-particles attached to a streptavidin protein to achieve site specific labelling, with 100 % labelling efficiency. Each nano-particle contained ~ 86 Au atoms, resulting in an 882 fold signal enhancement for 24 base length oligonucleotides. However, this enhancement factor was only observed when one oligonucleotide bound to one nano-particle in a 1 : 1 ratio. Much lower Au labelling efficiencies and signal enhancements were observed when thiolated oligonucleotides were labelled with maleimide functionalised gold nano-particles. This was attributed to the extensive and difficult sample preparation steps that were required prior to labelling. The detection and quantification of adducts formed between DNA and the Pt anti-cancer drugs cisplatin and oxaliplatin were also investigated with ICP-MS. Acid digestion of the carbon based DNA matrix enabled Pt adducts to be quantified at low dose rates of 1 Pt atom per 1 500 000 nucleotides in ~ 12 μg DNA. Such sensitive mass spectrometric determinations could be employed in clinical tests to detect and quantify low level adducts formed in patients in-vivo. To complement ICP-MS analysis, electrospray <b>ionisation</b> <b>linear</b> ion trap mass spectrometry was employed to study the interaction of oxaliplatin with the four DNA nucleobases. Multiple stage mass spectrometry enabled detailed Pt-nucleobase adduct fragmentation pathways to be established. The method of DNA detection using P in conjunction with the collision cell, or cool plasma to form PO+ was also demonstrated and the limitations of the method, namely, polyatomic interferences and severe matrix effects were highlighted.
