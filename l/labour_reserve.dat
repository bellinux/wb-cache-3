In 1954 they opened technical colleges – educational establishments of new type in the <b>labour</b> <b>reserves</b> system. The creation of technical colleges became the new phase of improvement of vocational­training system.

In 1955 they created ten­months building schools which lately, in 1957, were transformed into building colleges. These schools and colleges satisfied the third part of need in qualified workers and builders. Also since 1957 they began to organize such new types of educational establishments as vocational­technical colleges for training of qualified workers with secondary education who came from orphanage.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{continuance}} of mass high unemployment in the United Kingdom and considerable debate concerning the 'real level' of unemployment, the authors of this paper go beyond the official unemployment rate by focusing on the development of alternative indicators of <b>labour</b> <b>reserve</b> in the regions of the United Kingdom. They show how, on a step by-step basis, successively 'broader' indicators of <b>labour</b> <b>reserve</b> (more specifically, those on government training schemes, various categories of those conventionally defined as economically inactive who would like a job, and those in part-time work because they could not find full-time employment) may be derived by means of data from the Labour Force Survey. They then go on to outline the key features of regional variations in the scope for additional labour-force participation. As labour supply is a dynamic concept, and the utilisation of the <b>labour</b> <b>reserve</b> implies transitions from unemployment and nonemployment to employment, selected information on transitions between labour-market states and on the previous economic circumstances of the unemployed is presented. Some key features of the broad regional geography of those categorised as in employment, but 'on the margins' of the <b>labour</b> <b>reserve,</b> are highlighted also. Finally, the implications for policy of substantial labour reserves in many regions in the United Kingdom are explored. ...|$|E

40|$|One winter {{morning in}} 2006, {{conflict}} ensued between firewood vendors (selling wood to passing motorists and also supplying bulk quantities to cities), {{on the one}} hand, {{and a group of}} predominantly women (and others sympathetic to their grievances), from villages on the southern fringes of the former Shangani Reserves in western Zimbabwe, on the other hand. The latter group confiscated firewood displayed for sale and stockpiles waiting for transportation.

This article seeks to provide an alternative explanation by focusing, rather, on the complex dynamics of a worker-peasantry and the circumstances of women in migrant labour societies. An ethnographic research on villages that participated in the demonstration revealed how male labour migrancy created a social arena where women assumed key roles at both the household and society levels on behalf of the absent men.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to stimulate {{academic}} discussion on the Hungarian labour market in a policy-oriented framework by collecting some empirical stylised facts and their hypothetical explanations. These stylised facts cover both the area of labour supply and demand, including selected issues of unemployment, labour force participation, employment and wages. Stylised facts of labour supply are put in the context of micro-level conditions of economic growth and supply-side inflationary pressures. Apart from a discussion of developments in the 1990 s, by using a long-term demographic projection a detailed analysis of expected labour market activity and employment tendencies is also carried out. I show that although demographic changes will increase the labour force participation rate it can only reach the European average if all demographic groups show a large increase in economic activity. I argue against counting on those out of the labour force or the discouraged workers as a potential <b>labour</b> <b>reserve</b> for future economic growth. In terms of the demand side, I show that besides a spectacular employment growth in manufacturing, public sector employment has also expanded. I also explain why it is misleading to analyse employment or wage developments in a blue-collar versus whitecollar setting. As far as empirical labour market implications of the real exchange literature is concerned, I demonstrate that while wage inflation in nontradables has not been higher than that in tradables, some service sectors in the former aggregate show diverging tendencies. ...|$|E
30|$|Germany and Japan are two {{countries}} whose immigration policies {{have traditionally been}} associated with descent (jus sanguinis), a principle which posits that descendants can only be full German or Japanese citizens if born to German or Japanese parents. Both states, in their different ways, have historically adhered to a discourse of belonging called an assimilationist ethno-centrist approach. Both states switched to more restrictive, exclusive regimes for political reasons. Germany had largely been a nation of emigration prior to 1890. Before that, most German states practiced jus domicili (right of domicile). It meant that extended residence gave a guarantee to obtain German citizenship. Early forms of state citizenship in Germany were based on residence (domicile)-not on ethnic criteria- simply to exclude incoming poor alien migrants (many of whom were ethnically German) from receiving economic benefits. At the same time, under the Prussian citizenship law of 1842, ten years of continuous residence abroad meant –in principle- the loss of German citizenship. After 1890 the German Reich and its booming economy attracted many foreign labour migrants. These were regarded by the German states as a cheap <b>labour</b> <b>reserve</b> {{that could be used}} to fill labour force gaps. Between 1890 and 1910 the number of foreign nationals had tripled from 430, 000 to 1, 260, 000. Inclusion into the German nation via naturalization was becoming almost impossible with the adoption of the jus sanguinis principle by the new 1913 citizenship law. Indeed, Brubaker (1992) traces the descent-based approach to citizenship and migrants at least to a 1913 law of citizenship - if not to the 1842 Prussian citizenship law. From then, residency (domicile) was not anymore a criteria for citizenship as it used to be. This law was meant to allow German emigres in former German colonies to retain their citizenship.|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyses}} how {{the hidden}} labour force has {{developed in the}} recent past and what role the far-reaching modifications ensuing from the labour market reforms of 2005 (Hartz IV) have played. Estimations published by IAB in 2005 are used as a starting point. On the basis of these estimation equations, the hidden labour force was calculated up to 2007 using topical data. Against expectations, the present updated estimations show an increase in the hidden labour force in spite of the labour market reforms of 2005. The <b>labour</b> <b>reserve</b> increased strongly between 2004 and 2005 mainly among young people (under 25 years of age) and German women. In contrast, the number of elderly persons (over 50 years old) as well as the number of German men who were part of the hidden labour force dropped relatively sharply. This surprising growth in the hidden labour force may be caused by several effects: on the one hand the Hartz IV reforms enforced a principle of 'encouragement plus obligations' and were expected to result in a greater number of persons registering at the employment offices - persons, that is, who were capable of and available for work and had so far neither registered as unemployed nor were gainfully employed. On the other hand {{it is possible that the}} very negative information on Hartz IV spread in the media caused many people not to register. Moreover, as a significant part of the hidden labour force participates in employment and training schemes, such people are thus already registered and therefore not affected by Hartz IV. Altogether the updated estimations show that alongside official unemployment there is still a considerable hidden labour force of persons who are willing to work. Even after Hartz IV, the 'true' nature of underemployment is still considerably underrepresented by official data.

40|$|Transnational {{outsourcing}} {{makes it}} possible for Western companies to access the enormous <b>labour</b> <b>reserves</b> in countries such as China, India or Bangladesh without entering into formal (contractual) relations with these workers. It provides global buyers with an opportunity to disassociate themselves from (labour-intensive) production activities, and thereby from struggles over wages, environment, conditions of work and reproduction. In this context, workers are increasingly treated as a subcontracted component rather than a fixture as part of employer organisations. Drawing upon concepts derived from human and labour geography, this paper takes one labour-intensive sector—athletic footwear—as a case study of how the transnationalisation of production has resulted in a sweatshop model, while simultaneously transforming the athletic footwear industry into a site of social struggle. This paper looks at how global buyers have used relocation as a spatial fix for crises of profitability and labour control, but also pays attention to countervailing tendencies such as the emergence of a global anti-sweatshop movement, and the influence of codes of conduct on working conditions, which adds an extra-local dimension to labour relations...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} whether institutions in Africa were {{shaped by the}} metropolitan identity of the colonizer or by local conditions is lively debated in the African economic history literature. In this paper we contribute to this debate by revealing regional differences in tax capacity in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique. Samir Amin (1972) divided the African continent into three different “macro-regions of colonial influence”: Africa of the colonial trade or peasant economy, Africa of the concession-owning companies and Africa of the <b>labour</b> <b>reserves.</b> Interestingly, we argue that Mozambique encompassed all three different “macro-regions” in one sole colony. In regression analysis we find differences in “tax capacity” along this threefold categorization. We use a newly compiled dataset that includes government revenue (direct/indirect taxes) raised on a district level between 1930 and the 1973, derived from the statistical yearbooks and national accounts of Mozambique. Focussing on one country has the advantage over cross country comparisons that one can keep the metropolitan identity constant. We conclude that the tax system developed {{as a response to}} the local conditions. and the differences between the three regions were exacerbated during colonial times...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the current}} {{financial}} crisis and {{the crisis of the}} German welfare state, the population development has become a topic of public discussion in Germany. The aging and decline of the population which is on the horizon of most of the highly-developed countries brings up fears of a "collapse" of the compulsory pension scheme which is leached out by the long running high unemployment and the burden of the reunification. This article deals with the assumption of an economy that declines with population, an assumption expressed by economicsts as well. The analysis of the impacts of population development has to consider that the altogether tectonic shifts perform in rather modest annual alternation rates and are overlaid by developments of single cohorts. In this context, the adaptability of the economy in the long run is underestimated. The decrease of the labour force potential that results from a decline of the population can be adsorbed by the mobilisation of domestic <b>labour</b> <b>reserves</b> accompanied by a controlled labour market - and growth oriented immigration policy. There can also be improvements of quality, productivity and dynamics of growth provoked by the release of new labour force. The risk of a shrinking of the economy can be coped with a long-ranging release of new labour force and a economic policy supporting the resources of the economy.
