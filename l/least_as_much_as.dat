25|$|Stiglitz made early {{contributions}} to {{a theory of}} public finance stating that an optimal supply of local public goods can be funded entirely through capture of the land rents generated by those goods (when population distributions are optimal). Stiglitz dubbed this the 'Henry George theorem' {{in reference to the}} radical classical economist Henry George who famously advocated for land value tax. The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a single tax on rents is necessary to provide the optimal supply of local public investment. Stiglitz also shows how the theorem could be used to find the optimal size of a city or firm.|$|E

25|$|For the {{two years}} {{following}} his graduation from college he studied law at Yale, at Harvard, and in his father's office. In 1863 he {{was admitted to the}} bar and began the practice of law. His seventeen years of service as an associate justice and chief justice of the supreme court of his state and his four years as governor, coming {{as they did in the}} latter part of his life, may have had a tendency to obscure for his later contemporaries the fact that he was at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> anything else an eminently successful lawyer. In the practice of the law he won distinction both in his own state and outside, and with it the financial emoluments that usually accompany success at the bar. He was keenly alive to the practical side of the lawyer's work and never lost his zest for it. Till almost the very end of his life he maintained a law office, which he visited daily as long as his health would permit, and kept adding to his law library. As late as 1919 his book The Young Man and the Law revealed him still at heart a lawyer. In 1878, he was one of the founders of the American Bar Association and served as President of the American Bar Association from 1890-1891. For twelve years (1907–1919) he was the director of the American Bar Association's Comparative Law Bureau (as well as its Annual Bulletins editor for general jurisprudence).|$|E

500|$|The Birmingham Barracudas, {{owned by}} {{insurance}} tycoon Art Williams, entered the league playing at Legion Field, which could accommodate a Canadian football field with 15-yard end zones. Led by future Hall of Fame member Matt Dunigan, the Barracudas {{fell short of}} the South Division title, but remained competitive throughout the year. Despite selling 2,000 season tickets and facing community apathy after numerous attempts at pro football squads had failed in the city, attendance {{for the first three}} games exceeded expectations. Williams knew that the 'Cudas potentially faced serious attendance problems once the traditional American football season began, and persuaded the CFL to let them play their late-season home games on Sunday afternoons - something the league had been deliberately eschewing in order to avoid putting its television broadcasts in direct competition with the NFL's. The Barracudas' owner, who was more concerned about his gate receipts, was less concerned about the NFL's impact on his gate since Alabamians' NFL loyalties tend to be divided between different teams. Williams calculated that competing with the NFL on television was a more reasonable risk to take compared to competition with high school and Alabama/Auburn football. However, attendance still dropped to unsustainable levels; none of the final four home games attracted more than 10,000 people. [...] Williams claimed to have lost at least US$10 million on the season—at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> his startup costs—and blamed community apathy for the attendance woes.|$|E

[...] GamesRadar complimented the title for its standout levels and fan service, while criticizing it for levels that are [...] "frustrating, unclear and often misleading way that is unlike any prior Donkey Kong adventure", and motion controls that make them [...] "question the controls in a platformer".

40|$|This paper studies natives' {{economically}} motivated preferences over {{different levels}} of immigration of low-income earners. Immigration affects natives through both intra- and intergenerational redistribution programmes and in the labour market. Our analysis suggests, in a welfare state that looks after {{the poor and the}} aged, economic motivation does not necessarily lead a native to have an extreme opinion on the preferable level of immigration, although it causes disagreement among natives. We find, regardless of parameter values, high-income earners prefer at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> immigration <b>as</b> low-income earners who, in turn, prefer at <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> immigration <b>as</b> pensioners.
