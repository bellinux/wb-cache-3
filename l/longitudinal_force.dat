25|$|Finnpusku uses {{a unique}} rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a transverse force of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the coupling pins push the pusher forwards, resulting in a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>force,</b> also of 450 tons, at the bow pin. The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and independent operation in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the pusher's fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.|$|E

However the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>force</b> increases with the square of the pulse amplitude, so the differences diminish with increasing amplitude.

At this one should estimate the level of maximum <b>longitudinal</b> <b>forces</b> and braking distance size in freight cars of various lengths. Methodology. In this paper we attempt to approximate the actual diagram of braking cylinders filling with rational functions of varying degrees. In selection of coefficients in the required functions the highest values of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>forces</b> and braking distances were used as controlled parameters. They were compared with similar values obtained as a result of experimental rides. The level of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>forces</b> and braking distances amount were evaluated by means of mathematical modeling of train longitudinal vibrations, caused by different braking modes. Findings. At mathematical modeling was assumed that the train consists of 60 uniform four-axle gondola cars, weight of 80 tons, equipped with air dispenser No. 483 included in the median operation, composite braking blocks, and one locomotive VL- 8. Train before braking has been pre-stretched. Various types of pneumatic braking (emergency, full service and adjusting braking) of the freight train on the horizontal section of the track were simulated.

Analysis of the results shows that, for all selected freight cars for the calculation, {{the value of the}} safety factor by squeezing is smaller than the formulas of Standards.

Simultaneously to assess the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>forces</b> level of a track and rolling stock interaction. Methodology. The level of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>forces,</b> effecting the track displacement, was evaluated using mathematical modeling of longitudinal vibrations of the trains at transient modes of motion caused by braking. It was considered that each train vehicle consists of a body (solid) and the wheel sets, connected with the body by friction bearings (inelastic link). It was believed that during the movement of each train vehicle the vertical plane of its symmetry coincident with the vertical plane of symmetry of the assembled rails and sleepers. At simulation it was also supposed that in the process of translational motion of the vehicle body wheels make pure rolling along the rail without slipping on it. Findings. In the results of calculations the values of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>forces</b> at different types of braking were obtained (it is regenerative braking and pneumatic one) under quasi-static and shock transients. For this various initial state of clearances in the inter-car connections up to beginning of transient was considered.

At mathematical modelling it was supposed that tanks were filled by black oil in density ρ = 0, 99 t/m 3. Various variants of removal of the level free surface of liquid from the top internal surface of a copper of the tank were considered. The incomplete filling was accepted equal 0, 4; 0, 8; 1, 2 metres. Scientific results. As a result of calculations diagrammes of distribution of the maximum <b>longitudinal</b> <b>forces</b> along the length of a train and brake ways for various schemes of formation and different level of incomplete filling of transported liquid have been received.

50|$|The first {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} the stress in cylinders {{was developed by the}} mid-19th century engineer William Fairbairn, assisted by his mathematical analyst Eaton Hodgkinson. Their first interest was in studying the design and failures of steam boilers. Fairbairn realised that the hoop stress was twice the longitudinal stress, an important factor in the assembly of boiler shells from rolled sheets joined by riveting. Later work was applied to bridge building, and the invention of the box girder. In the Chepstow Railway Bridge, the cast iron pillars are strengthened by external bands of wrought iron. The vertical, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>force</b> is a compressive force, which cast iron is well able to resist. The hoop stress is tensile and so wrought iron, a material with better tensile strength than cast iron, is added.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea and}} {{implementation}} of torque vectoring are both complex. The main goal of torque vectoring is to independently vary torque to each wheel. Differentials generally consist of only mechanical components. A torque vectoring differential requires an electronic monitoring system in addition to standard mechanical components. This electronic system tells the differential {{when and how to}} vary the torque. Due to the number of wheels that receive power, a front or rear wheel drive differential is less complex than an all-wheel drive differential.The impact of torque distribution is the generation of yaw moment arising from longitudinal forces and changes to the lateral resistance generated by each tyre. Applying more <b>longitudinal</b> <b>force</b> reduces the lateral resistance that can be generated. The specific driving condition dictates what the trade-off should be to either damp or excite yaw acceleration. The function is independent of technology and could be achieved by driveline devices for a conventional powertrain, or with electrical torque sources.Then comes the practical element of integration with brake stability functions for both fun and safety.|$|E

30|$|Since the {{equipment}} {{used to measure}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>force</b> in rails according to the strain method is simple and suitable for long-term monitoring, many researchers have adopted this method to detect and study the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>force</b> in CWRs on bridges [18, 19].

The increased <b>longitudinal</b> <b>force</b> affects the strength and stability of CWR [5, 6], and vertical displacement of rail causes vertical irregularity, thus affecting the riding comfort of vehicles.

Thus, for this type of tyres, neglecting this force might lead to an inaccurate representation of the real tyre behaviour.
