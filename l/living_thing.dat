5|$|Whitney Frost (portrayed by Wynn Everett) is {{the stage}} name of Agnes Cully, an actress and {{scientific}} genius forced {{to hide behind}} her husband, senatorial candidate Calvin Chadwick, due to the sexism of the age.

After she is purged of the Zero Matter, Frost goes insane and is committed to an asylum.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the country}} is varied {{incorporating}} both deciduous and coniferous woodland and moorland and tundra species. However, large scale commercial tree planting and the management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and commercial field sport activities impacts upon the distribution of indigenous plants and animals. The UK's tallest tree is a grand fir planted beside Loch Fyne, Argyll in the 1870s, and the Fortingall Yew may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> in Europe. Although the number of native vascular plants is low by world standards, Scotland's substantial bryophyte flora is of global importance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Patients {{with visual}} {{associative}} agnosia {{have a particular}} difficulty in identifying visually presented <b>living</b> <b>things</b> (plants and animals) as opposed to nonliving things. It has been claimed that this effect cannot be explained by differences in the inherent visual discriminability of <b>living</b> and nonliving <b>things.</b> To test this claim further, we performed two experiments with normal subjects. In Experiment 1 normal human observers {{were asked to identify}} objects in tachistoscopically presented line drawings. They made more errors with <b>living</b> <b>things</b> than with nonliving things. In Experiment 2 normal monkeys learned to discriminate among the same line drawings for food reward. They made many more errors in discriminating among <b>living</b> <b>things</b> than nonliving things. Agnosic patients' responses to the same line drawings were made available to us for correlative analysis with the subjects' responses to these drawings in Experiments 1 and 2. We conclude that a category-specific visual agnosia for <b>living</b> <b>things</b> can arise as a consequence of a modality-specific but not category-specific impairment in visual representation, since <b>living</b> <b>things</b> are more similar to each other visually than nonliving things are...|$|R

25|$|Aristotle applies {{his theory}} of hylomorphism to living things. He defines a soul as that which makes a <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> alive. Life is a {{property}} of living things, just as knowledge and health are. Therefore, a soul is a form—that is, a specifying principle or cause—of a <b>living</b> <b>thing.</b> Furthermore, Aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form to matter.|$|E

40|$|Several {{cases of}} category-specific {{semantic}} deficits for <b>living</b> <b>things</b> {{have now been}} reported, {{most of whom have}} a greater difficulty with knowledge of visual properties of <b>living</b> <b>things</b> than with non-visual properties. This has motivated two different kinds of account of category-specific deficits for <b>living</b> <b>things.</b> One account is that theimpairment forliving things arises as a result of general damage to visual properties, and so it predicts that impairment for visual properties of <b>living</b> <b>things</b> will be accompanied by some degree of impairment for visual properties of other categories. The second account posits explicit category-based organisation of semantic memory, such that visual properties of <b>living</b> and non-living <b>things</b> are stored separately, and so can be independently impaired. We investigated the semantic impairment of a patient SE, who had received a diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis several years previously, resulting in a mild category-specific semantic deficit for <b>living</b> <b>things.</b> Both off-line and on-line tasks revealed that SE had a highly selective impairment for the visual properties of <b>living</b> <b>things,</b> with no sign of problems for the visual properties of non-living things. This raises a challenge for models in which category-specific deficits emerge {{as a result of a}} general deficit determined by some other factor. We suggest one way in which these models may account for the data by encoding inter-relations between the function and form of objects in semantic memory.

25|$|Democritus (460 BC) {{thought that}} the {{essential}} characteristic of life is having a soul (psyche). Like other ancient writers, he was attempting to explain what makes something a <b>living</b> <b>thing.</b> His explanation was that fiery atoms make a soul {{in exactly the same}} way atoms and void account for any other thing. He elaborates on fire because of the apparent connection between life and heat, and because fire moves.|$|E
25|$|This {{rational}} soul is {{united to}} the body {{in such a manner}} that it is the only substantial form of the body.

Therefore, the soul gives man every essential degree of perfection; moreover, it gives the body a share in the act of being whereby it itself exists.|$|E

25|$|Cells are {{the basic}} unit of {{structure}} in every <b>living</b> <b>thing,</b> and all cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. Cell theory was formulated by Henri Dutrochet, Theodor Schwann, Rudolf Virchow and others during the early nineteenth century, and subsequently became widely accepted. The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of its cells, with energy flow occurring within and between them. Cells contain hereditary information that is carried forward as a genetic code during cell division.|$|E

Broken Leg does not want Athos to go since he believes Athos will die.

25|$|From a {{biological}} perspective, the Krakatau problem {{refers to the}} question of whether the islands were completely sterilized by the 1883 eruption or whether some indigenous life survived. When the first researchers reached the islands in May 1884, the only <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> they found was a spider in a crevice on the south side of Rakata. Life quickly recolonized the islands, however; Verbeek's visit in October 1884 found grass shoots already growing. The eastern side of the island has been extensively vegetated by trees and shrubs, presumably brought there as seeds washed up by ocean currents or carried in birds' droppings (or brought by natives and scientific investigators). It is, however, in a somewhat fragile position, and the vegetated area has been badly damaged by recent eruptions.|$|E
25|$|In her own dominion, Charn, Jadis is {{extremely}} powerful; but she finds her magic largely useless in other worlds. She eventually strengthens her powers and usurps {{the throne of}} Narnia, using her magic to cast the land into perpetual winter. Her most feared weapon is her wand, whose magic is capable of turning people into stone. The petrified remains of her enemies decorate the halls of her castle. Her other powers, which she immediately loses after entering another world, include the ability to disintegrate objects and individuals, read minds, control the minds of animals (She does possibly retain or regain this power in Narnia) and the terrifying power of the Deplorable Word - the latter of which wipes out every <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> on a planet except for the speaker.|$|E
25|$|There {{were once}} a king and queen, rulers of an unnamed city, who had three daughters of {{conspicuous}} beauty. The youngest and most beautiful was Psyche, whose admirers, neglecting the proper worship of the love goddess Venus, instead prayed and made offerings to her. It was rumored {{that she was the}} second coming of Venus, or the daughter of Venus from an unseemly union between the goddess and a mortal. Venus is offended, and commissions Cupid to work her revenge. Cupid instead scratches himself with his own dart, which makes any <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> {{fall in love with the}} first thing it sees. As soon as Cupid scratches himself he falls deeply in love with Psyche and disobeys his mother's order to make Psyche fall in love with something hideous.|$|E
