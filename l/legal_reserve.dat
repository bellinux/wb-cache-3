40|$|According to the Forest Code of 1965, it is {{mandatory}} that every rural property destine {{part of its}} land {{to the establishment of}} <b>Legal</b> <b>Reserves.</b> When a diagnosis is made over all Brazil, the reality is quite different from what is demanded by law. Therefore, this work, as a general objective, proposes ways of establishing <b>Legal</b> <b>Reserves</b> based on the analysis of the environmental deterioration in a river basin. For this purpose, the environmental deterioration was detected based on three diagnoses: physical-conservational, socioeconomical, and environmental quality. In this way, from a quantitative and qualitative diagnosis, it was possible to identify the main aggressive factors in the studied river basin and to indicate the main vulnerabilities that the area is subjected. According to such diagnosis, some proposals for the establishment of <b>Legal</b> <b>Reserves</b> are discussed here based on scientific arguments aimed at the conservation of water resources, soil and biodiversity. It is hoped, that from this study, the environment receives a new tool for diagnosis, pollution control, recovery and conservation of natural resources...|$|R

5000|$|Banks {{typically}} make {{loans to}} customers by crediting new demand deposits to {{the account of}} the customer. This practice, which is known as fractional reserve banking, permits the total supply of credit to exceed the liquid <b>legal</b> <b>reserves</b> of the bank. The amount of this excess is expressed as the [...] "reserve ratio" [...] and is limited by government regulators not to exceed a level which they deem adequate to ensure the ability of banks to meet their payment obligations. Under this system, which is currently practiced throughout the world, the money supply varies with the quantity of <b>legal</b> <b>reserves</b> and the amount of credit issuance by banks.|$|R

40|$|The Bachelor Thesis {{deals with}} the {{creation}} and use of financial reserves for redevelopment and recultivation in Cement Hranice mining company, and {{with the impact of}} a new plan of redevelopment and recultivation on this creation. Also {{deals with the}} relationship between inflation and <b>legal</b> <b>reserves.</b> There are suggested ways how could be the inflation put into the creation of both, the legal and the accounting reserves for redevelopment and recultivation. The theoretical part explains the basic important concepts related to redevelopment and recultivation, namely the very definitions of these concepts and then dividing of recultivations. Further describes how are the mining activities and financial reserves for redevelopment and recultivation embedded in legislation. General information related to the legal and the accounting reserves are found {{at the end of the}} theoretical part. The practical part briefly describes the Joint stock company Cement Hranice, its history, current activities and relation to the environment.

50|$|Historically, bank {{reserves}} {{have formed}} {{only a small}} fraction of deposits, a system called fractional reserve banking. Banks would hold only a small percentage of their assets in the form of cash reserves as insurance against bank runs. Over time this process has been regulated and insured by central banks. Such <b>legal</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements were introduced in the 19th century as an attempt to reduce the risk of banks overextending themselves and suffering from bank runs, as this could lead to knock-on effects on other overextended banks. See also money multiplier.|$|E
50|$|Several major {{historical}} {{examples of}} financial regulatory reform {{occurred in the}} 20th century relating to fractional-reserve banking, made {{in response to the}} Great Depression and the many bank runs following the crash of 1929. These reforms included the creation of deposit insurance (such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) to mitigate against the danger of bank runs. Countries have also implemented <b>legal</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements which impose minimum reserve requirements on banks.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} bachelor thesis deals with the creation, valuation, posting and reporting of reserves. According to the Czech accounting standards, the reserves were divided to the accounting and <b>legal</b> <b>reserves.</b> The main objective was to compare the reserves according to Czech accounting standards and International Accounting Standards. Many differences between the standards were defined. The differences in-clude particularly the creation of reserves that are created in the Czech Republic but not created according to the International Accounting Standards. The accounting unit selected {{for the analysis of}} practical data was VETAS České Budějovice, s. r. o., which worked only with <b>legal</b> <b>reserves</b> for repairs of tangible assets. Examples were presented to indicate the differences in accounting depending on whether a repair had or had not been executed, and subsequently the accounting was compared with the current legislation when an accounting unit creating its reserves must transfer money in the amount of the reserve to a special account at a bank. Furthermore, accounting for restructuring reserves according to the Czech accounting standards was compared with the International Accounting Standards. Here, the difference between the terms of time when such a reserve was created, along with the difference between the amounts of the reserve to be created, was presented. The conclusion dealt with the differences in the accounting between accounting units that create reserves and accounting units that do not create reserves, and the differences of the impact on the profit and loss and subsequently also on the corporate income tax...|$|R
