500|$|Although fair {{criticism}} {{has been treated}} as a defence to scandalizing the court in some cases, the Court of Appeal preferred to view it as an element of liability, though it cautioned that [...] "the precise characterisation {{of the concept of}} fair criticism was not fully canvassed before us ... Accordingly, our views on this point must necessarily be taken, to that extent, to be provisional in nature." [...] The Court said that adopting this approach ensures that an alleged contemnor is not disadvantaged with regard to the burden of proof: [...] "If the concept of fair criticism relates to liability, then the evidential burden would be on the party relying on it. The <b>legal</b> <b>burden,</b> on the other hand, would be on the Respondent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism, and that it presents a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. If, however, the concept of fair criticism constitutes a defence, then the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> would shift to the alleged contemnor to show on the balance of probabilities that the impugned statement amounts to fair criticism." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, in England and Wales, the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, s.101 {{stipulates}} that where a defendant relies on some [...] "exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification" [...] in his defence, the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof as to that exception {{falls on the}} defendant, though only on the balance of probabilities. For example, a person charged with being drunk {{in charge of a}} motor vehicle can raise the defence that there was no likelihood of his driving while drunk. The prosecution has the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant exceeded the legal limit of alcohol and was in control of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove control, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar.

50|$|The {{courts have}} found such {{scrutiny}} {{necessary for a}} number of reasons. Rationally, imposing <b>legal</b> <b>burdens</b> on an illegitimate person in order to express disapproval of the conduct of her parents is illogical, unjust, and contrary to the fundamental principle that <b>legal</b> <b>burdens</b> should have some relationship to individual wrongdoing. Like race or gender, the court has stressed that an illegitimate person's status of birth is a condition over which she has no control, and it has no bearing on her ability or willingness to contribute to society. In applying increasingly exacting intermediate scrutiny, the courts have noted that illegitimate persons are a stigmatized minority, are vastly outnumbered politically, and are the target of long-standing and continuing invidious legal discrimination. For all these reasons, exacting constitutional scrutiny is mandated under the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|R

40|$|Purpose Critics of asset {{forfeiture}} {{claim that}} forfeiture laws create financial incentives that inappropriately influence police behavior. The present study examines {{the relationship between}} measures of the financial incentive and <b>legal</b> <b>burdens</b> for civil asset forfeiture on federal equitable sharing payments to local law enforcement to determine whether police behavior is affected by different statutory incentives for forfeiture activity. Methods Using LEMAS and DOJ forfeiture data, this study addresses some {{of the limitations of}} previous research by using a multi-year average for forfeiture activity, an improved measure of financial incentives for law enforcement, and multiple measures of statutory burdens to law enforcement to determine the impact of forfeiture laws on forfeiture activity. Results Consistent with anecdotal reports and limited prior research, findings indicate that agencies in jurisdictions with more restrictive state forfeiture laws receive more proceeds through federal equitable sharing. Conclusions Results suggest that state and local law enforcement agencies use federal equitable sharing to circumvent their own state forfeiture laws when state laws are more burdensome or less financially rewarding to these agencies, providing additional evidence that police operations are influenced by financial incentives. ...|$|R
40|$|Supreme Court {{precedent}} establishes {{that the}} government may not punish children for matters beyond their control. Same-sex marriage bans and non-recognition laws (“marriage bans”) do precisely this. The states argue that marriage is good for children, yet marriage bans categorically exclude an entire class of children – children of same-sex couples – from the legal, economic and social benefits of marriage. This amicus brief recounts a powerful body of equal protection jurisprudence that prohibits punishing children to reflect moral disapproval of parental conduct or to incentivize adult behavior. We then explain that marriage bans punish children of same-sex couples because they: 1) foreclose their central legal route to family formation; 2) categorically void their existing legal parent-child relationships incident to out-of-state marriages; 3) deny them economic rights and benefits; and 4) inflict psychological and stigmatic harm. States cannot justify marriage bans as good for children and then exclude children of same-sex couples based on moral disapproval of their same-sex parents’ relationships or to incentivize opposite-sex couples to “procreate” {{within the bounds of}} marriage.

Often the policy position is to ban student use of social networking, and high risk websites. However, such a policy position may {{be considered to be}} over reactive. This paper considers legal issues related to cyber-bullying and uses these to consider school policy responses to this issue, ensuring a safe, but educative, school environment. Methods: A review of relevant case law and statues was completed to develop a framework. This framework was then used to undertake an analysis of a publicly published policy of a local Catholic secondary school. Outcomes: The selected policy highlights some key considerations for policy makers in other schools. However, it still does not account for the full range of possible outcomes, though such a position may not be necessarily problematic. Conclusions: Schools need to develop an awareness of the effects of cyber-bullying and ensure that their current policy positions adequately respond to these, particularly the schools duty of care for students. Schools also need to ensure that in developing policy responses that they do not over-step boundaries and create unnecessary <b>legal</b> <b>burdens.</b> Any policy response must be accompanied by an educational program and should not limit student use of web-based resources that it becomes detrimental to their learning.
