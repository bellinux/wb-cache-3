40|$|The {{hydrotalcite}} {{structure is}} an ionic <b>lamellar</b> <b>solid</b> with positively charged layers incorporating {{two kinds of}} metallic cations and hydrated gallery anions. The ability of these compounds to retain aggressive ions and simultaneously release a corrosion inhibitor {{is the main reason}} for the development of hydrotalcite compounds to replace hexavalent chromium compounds (chromates) as inhibitive pigments. In this study, alkyd coatings formulated with Al-Zn-vanadate hydrotalcite, at different pigment concentrations were applied on aluminum specimens. The painted panels were subjected to different accelerated tests (condensing humidity, salt spray and Kesternich) and atmospheric exposure in atmospheres of different aggressiveness. Corrosion performance was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A traditional zinc chromate pigment was also tested for comparative purposes. The obtained results confirm that hydrotalcite compounds achieve corrosion inhibition of the underlying aluminum substrate. It has been shown that an increase of anticorrosive pigment content (for a constant pigment volume concentration) does not always improve the primer behavior, but a larger amount of vanadates released from Al-Zn-vanadate hydrotalcite particles does improve anticorrosive behavior. © 2010 Elsevier B.

Crystal habit of ice nucleus and very small crystals (10 2  nm) corresponds to Gibbs–Wolf theorem and Thomson-Gibbs equation. Consequent growth of nucleated crystal is possible under condition of exceeding of water vapor concentration in atmosphere over the equilibrium vapor concentration over ice crystal. This equilibrium concentration for each crystal facet can be characterized by Clausius–Clapeyron relation with regard to its surface energy. The diagram of atmospheric {{ice crystals}} morphology in dependence from absolute and relative vapor supersaturation of atmosphere is developed. It is determined that the relation of height H and diameter D of atmospheric crystals increases at a growth of relative supersaturation, Δ c i /c i, but increases at a growth of absolute supersaturation, Δ c i = c i  – c a. The alteration of H/D occurs gradually, which explains conditional character of delimitation on types on the base of this index. The field of absolute and relative supersaturation it is possible to subdivide relatively index H/D value in two parts: columnar forms area, where index H/D > 0. 89 and lamellar forms area, where H/D < 0. 89.

40|$|Lamellar structures, {{consisting}} of alternating inorganic layers separated by organic moieties, have {{attracted much attention}} {{over a wide range}} of applications, such as polymer-clay composites, rheology control, and optoelectronic devices. Organosilanes are ideal candidates for such efforts due to their ability to self-assemble and the intrinsic hybrid configuration of organic/inorganic moieties. Yet, the main emphasis has been focused on alkylsilane, where an alkyl group is linked with a silane terminal, i. e., R-SiX 3 (R is alkane and X can be halogen or alkoxy). Construction of stacked monolayers of alkylsilane through chemisorption is possible. The demonstrated pathway usually takes place after the monolayer surface is converted to a hydroxylated one. This conversion can be realized by a chemical modification of a nonpolar terminal group to a hydroxyl group. Alternatively, Huo and Parikh found that long-chain alkylsilane could form a <b>lamellar</b> <b>solid</b> or stacked bilayer through solvophobic and van der Waals interactions. Kuroda reported the chain-length dependence study (CnH 2 n+ 1 Si(OEt) 3, n = 12, 14, 16, and 18) of the bilayered structure. Maoz further developed a protocol to grow stacks of bilayers by manipulating the interactions in a stepwise fashion. Collectively, all these studies concluded that the solvophobic and the van der Waals interactions between molecules with long chains were the main driving forces for such a complex assembly. Due to the rather weak interactions between alkylsilanes, the resulting assemblies are usually amorphous and instable at high temperatures; the issue of disturbed packing, as well as difficulties in chemical functionalization of alkyl chains, limits the potential applications for organosilane lamellae...|$|E
40|$|Inorganic <b>lamellar</b> <b>solid</b> particles, {{for example}} {{molybdenum}} disulphide, {{have been used}} as solid additives in lubricants to improve their friction and wear properties. Recently, inorganic fullerene-like materials (IFLM) of metal dichalcogenides with a closed-cage structure have been synthesized. It has been shown that mechanical dispersion of IFLM nanoparticles in mineral and synthetic base oils gives benefits of low friction coefficient and wear and the benefits are superior to those of lamellar solids. The IFLMs positive effect on the oils performance was attributed to rolling mechanism and to their mechanical degradation. The aim of the thesis is to extend knowledge of inorganic tungsten disulphide (IFWS 2) nanoparticles behaviour through study of their interactions with other additives in prepared oils. The investigation of the IF-WS 2 lubrication efficiency had several major objectives. These were: to evaluate effect of various sliding-rolling ratios and temperatures, to classify the IF-WS 2 {{from the point of view}} of additive groups and to evaluate the nature of interactions between specific additives and the nanoparticles. Lubrication efficiency of IF-WS 2 nanoparticles dispersed in oils was evaluated on tribo-rigs with ball-on-disc configuration at a wide range of operating conditions. For the testing of oils with IF-WS 2 Mini Traction Machine (MTM) and High-Frequency Reciprocating (HFRR) rigs were employed. Standard highly polished specimens made of AISI M 52100 steel were used. In addition, Elastohydrodynamic (EHL) rig was utilised for film thickness measurements. One of the major outcomes of this work was establishing a positive effect of elevated temperature on IF-WS 2 dispersion, friction and wear behaviour. Also, a certain sulphuric extreme pressure additive improved IF-WS 2 dispersion properties, which was attributed to a synergistic reaction between these two additives. Moreover, the tribological performance of the nanosuspension was found to be improved by addition of stearic acid under moderate conditions, where nanoparticles show no contribution. Study of interactions between ZDDP and the nanoparticles has shown superior performance of the ZDDP solution compared to the nanosuspension under given conditions. Imperial User Onl...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} goal of {{this work}} was dedicated to improvement of the properties and enhancement of the application potential of commodity polymer based on polyolefins by choosing different synthesis routes to create new structures and materials. More precisely, the presented study explores different aspects of metallocene and post-metallocene catalyzed olefin polymerization leading to synthesis of novel copolymers and nanocomposites. The {{first part of this}} thesis deals with controlled polymerization of α-olefins catalyzed by post-metallocenes. Bis(phenoxyamine) zirconium complexes with [ONNO]-type ligands bearing cumyl (bPA-c) and 1 -adamantyl (bPA-a) ortho-substituents were applied. For the polymerization catalyzed by bPA catalyst quasi-living kinetic character is proposed. The bPA catalyst was applied for synthesis of block copolymers by employing the strategy of sequential monomer addition. The blocky structure of the copolymer was successfully achieved and confirmed by NMR techniques. Moreover, the monomodal distribution of molar mass in SEC chromatogram confirmed the absence of homopolymers. In {{the second part of the}} work new defined comb-like copolymers (CLC) having a poly(10 -undecene- 1 -ol) (PUol) backbone and densely grafted poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) side chains are presented. These copolymers were synthesized in two steps by means of metallocene polymerization followed by ring opening polymerization. Copolymers with varied and adjustable graft length (PCL segments) were synthesized. It was proved that the melting and crystallization temperatures of the CLC correlate with the PCL side chain length, i. e. longer chains result in higher Tm and Tc,o values. The melting enthalpy was found to be asymptotically dependent on the length of PCL side chains. The bulk morphology of the comb-like copolymers is proposed to be lamellar as judged from the TEM micrographs. The third part of the thesis is focused on the synthesis of polypropylene nanocomposites via in situ polymerization. Thereby, organomodified aluminumphosphate with kanemite-type layered structure (AlPO-kan) has been used as novel filler. Melt compounding composites were prepared for comparison purposes to evaluate the influence of in situ synthesis on the dispersion quality of the filler in polymer matrix. Melt compounding of neat AlPO-kan with PP did not lead to formation of nanocomposites. TEM images show macro-composites with the <b>lamellar</b> <b>solid</b> remaining agglomerated. On the contrary, in situ polymerization of propene yielded materials with exfoliated nanocomposite morphology. In XRD, diffractions of the AlPO-kan pilling of layers are not detectable.

The pressure was varied between ambient pressure and 8. 0 GPa. [Eu(bta) 3 L 2] exhibits a smectic A (SmA) phase at room temperature. The complex undergoes a transition from the SmA phase to a <b>solid</b> <b>lamellar</b> structure around 0. 22 GPa and another transition from the <b>solid</b> <b>lamellar</b> phase to an amorphous state from 1. 6 to 3. 5 GPa. At low pressures, the smectic layer spacing increases, and the intermolecular distance decreases. Above 3. 5 GPa, both the interlamellar and the intermolecular spacings hardly change, but the intensity of X-ray reflections exhibits a remarkable decrease and eventually vanishes. An interpretation of the changes in the molecular structure is given. It was found that less interdigitation of the alkyl chains situated in adjacent layers and/or a full extension of the alkyl chains occurred at low pressures and that the second phase transition was accompanied by a transfer of the hydrogen atom from the nitrogen atom of the imine group to the oxygen atom of the Schiff base ligand.

The water molecules are connected to both the metal hydroxide layers and the interlayer anions through extensive hydrogen bonding.

40|$|Burris, David L. Liquid {{lubricants}} are precluded in {{an exceedingly}} {{large number of}} consumer as well as extreme applications {{as a means to}} reduce friction and wear at the sliding interface of two bodies. The extraterrestrial environment is one such example of an extreme environment which has motivated the development of advanced solid lubricant materials. Mechanical systems for space require fabrication, assembly, transportation and testing on earth before launch and deployment. Solid lubricants for space are expected to not only operate efficiently in the hard vacuum of space but also withstand interactions with moisture or oxygen during the terrestrial storage, transportation and assembly prior to deployment and launch. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) is considered the gold standard in solid lubricants for space due to its excellent tribological properties in ultra-high vacuum. However in the presence of environmental species such as water and oxygen or at elevated temperatures, the lubricity and endurance of MoS 2 is severely limited. Past studies have offered several hypotheses for the breakdown of lubrication of MoS 2 under the influence of water and oxygen, although exact mechanisms remain unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear if temperature acts as a driver solely for oxidation or for thermally activated slip and thermally activated desorption as well. The answers to these questions are of fundamental importance to improving the reliability of existing MoS 2 -based solid lubricants for space, as well as for guiding the design of advanced <b>lamellar</b> <b>solid</b> lubricant coatings. This dissertation aims to elucidate: (1) the role of water on MoS 2 oxidation, (2) the role of water on MoS 2 friction, (3) the role of oxygen on MoS 2 friction, (4) the contribution of thermal activation to ambient-temperature friction, and (5) effects of length-scale. The results of this study showed that water does not cause oxidation of MoS 2. Water increases ambient-temperature friction of MoS 2 directly through a combination of both surface adsorption and diffusion into the coating subsurface. Thermally activated desiccation effectively dries the bulk of the coating, yielding low values of friction coefficient even at ambient humidity and temperature. Friction of MoS 2 decreases with increasing temperature between 25 ??C and 100 ??C in the presence of environmental water and increases in the presence of oxygen alone. At temperatures greater than 100 ??C, friction generally increases with temperature only in the presence of environmental oxygen; at these elevated temperatures, friction decreases with increasing humidity. The transition from room-temperature increase to elevated-temperature decrease in friction with increasing humidity is found to be a strong function of the contact history as well as coating microstructure. Lastly, the contribution of nanoscale tribofilms to macroscale friction was studied through nanotribometry. Friction measured on the worn MoS 2 coating with a nano-scale AFM probe showed direct and quantifiable evidence of sliding-induced surface modification of MoS 2; friction measured on the perfectly ordered single crystal MoS 2 was nearly an order of magnitude lower than friction on worn MoS 2. Although friction coefficients measured with a nanoscale probe showed high surface sensitivity, micron-sized AFM probes gave friction coefficients similar to those obtained in the macroscale, suggesting the formation of surface films in-situ during sliding with the colloidal probe. A reduction in friction is observed after annealing for both the nanoscale and microscale probes, suggesting a strong overriding effect of the desiccated bulk over surface adsorption in driving the friction response at these length-scales.

30|$|Graphene {{is one of}} the {{promising}} new materials for application in nanoscale electronics among a wide range of potential applications [1 – 5]. In actual graphene-based electronic devices, gold is commonly used for electric contacts [6]. Therefore, the friction of graphene-gold system {{plays an important role in}} the efficient fabrication and reliable operation of such graphene devices. Although graphene has attracted great interest from the researchers in the field of nanotribology due to its excellent mechanical properties [3, 7], the friction properties of graphene sliding on gold surface are poorly understood. So far, many tribological studies of graphene focus on the friction force between graphene and a scanning probe tip [8 – 14]. For instance, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments of friction on chemically modified graphite revealed a negative friction coefficient [9]. The friction force microscope (FFM) experiments of few-layer graphene found that friction increased as the number of graphene layers decreased [10, 11]. These phenomena are explained by the puckering effect of graphene [9 – 11]. It is supposed that the friction between a graphene flake and graphite was measured as the tip dragged a flake during sliding on graphite [8, 14]. It is found that the rotational motion coupled to lateral motion of flakes for <b>lamellar</b> <b>solids</b> leads to friction increase due to flake reorientation into a commensurate configuration [15]. At the same time, some scholars have also been devoted to studying the friction of graphene and/or gold using other techniques. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique was employed to study the lubricity of gold on graphene [16] and the sliding friction of solid xenon film on graphene/Ni(111) substrate [17]. Both QCM experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the friction of an incommensurate Kr monolayer on Au follows a viscous friction law [18, 19]. MD simulations are conducted to explore the static friction of two-dimensional gold islands and three-dimensional gold clusters on graphite substrate [20]. It is found that the slider thickness can promote lubricity due to the higher effective rigidity of thick clusters. The size-dependent interfacial commensurability was also uncovered by MD simulations of xenon atoms on graphene and Au substrate [21], consistent with the simulations of krypton and silicon clusters on Cu substrate [22], which can explain the size dependence of static friction. Recently, the superlubricity of graphene nanoribbons on an Au(111) substrate is observed at a low temperature [23]. Kitt et al. directly measured the friction of graphene sliding over a SiO 2 substrate and found that the friction behaviors for monolayer and bilayer graphene violate Amontons’ law [24]. Overall, as a pure two-dimensional material, it is reasonable to expect graphene to exhibit atypical friction behaviors for graphene-substrate system. Unfortunately, a detailed investigation of sliding friction of graphene over a gold substrate is still lacking although the interfacial properties between graphene and metals have been systematically explored [25 – 28].|$|R

Materiais biohíbridos a base de argilominerais (montmorillonita, sepiolita) e sólidos inorgânicos (hidróxidos duplos lamelares) são uma boa opção para diversas aplicações (tais como biomédicas) devido ao seu baixo custo, biodegradabilidade e biocompatibilidade. Devido a capacidade de troca iônica, área específica elevada e a capacidade de adsorção que esses materiais possuem, é possível combinar uma grande variedade de espécies orgânicas, tais como drogas, na qualidade de transportadoras. Neste contexto, este trabalho apresenta a preparação de novos bionanocompósitos com base na combinação dos biopolímeros carboximetilcelulose e zeína como revestimento do híbrido, argilomineral - antibiótico e hidróxidos duplos lamelares-antibiótico. Para a síntese dos materiais biohíbridos foi utilizado o antibiótico neomicina de uso tópico e amoxicilina de uso oral como fármacos modelos, o qual, foram incorporados nos argilominerais e hidróxidos duplos lamelares por processo de intercalação por troca iônica e por adsorção. Bionanocomposites systems clay base (montmorillonite and sepiolite), layered double hidroxides and biopolymers (carboxymethylcellulose and zein) were {{evaluated}} as topical delivery systems with antibacterial activity and as oral delivery systems. For this study, neomycin, a topical antibiotic, indicated mainly for open wound infections. The drug amoxicillin, an antibiotic indicated mainly for throat infections, {{were also used}} in this study. Both antibiotics were used as model drugs. Initially, drugs were incorporated directly into the biopolymer matrix, comprising the combination of carboxymethylcellulos and zein, being conformed as movies and balls and evaluated for their antibacterial activity and controlled release simulating gastrointestinal fluids. Moreover, hybrids materials have been prepared where the neomycin drug was incorporated into the <b>lamellar</b> inorganic <b>solids,</b> such as montmorillonite by ion exchange reaction, and the fibrous type, such as sepiolite by adsorption in aqueous solution. But the drug amoxicillin was incorporated into layered double hydroxides by anion exchange and montmorillonite by cation exchange. The resulting hybrids were in turn combined with the biopolymer matrix yielding bionanocomposites shaped materials such as films were tested for their antibacterial activity, and the shaped materials beads were tested for their release in the gastrointestinal fluids. Through the analysis of various physico-chemical techniques, we observed the interactions between the studied materials, the formation of hybrids materials, obtaining the bionanocomposites materials and material efficiency when applied in controlled release of drugs both topical and use oral mainly influenced {{by the presence of}} zein, are promising as topical delivery systems and oral drugs...|$|R
40|$|Bilayers {{formed by}} {{molecules}} that possess long alkyl hydrophobic tails are ubiquitous {{in the natural}} world manifesting both in biological systems as well as in chemistry. The lipid bilayer is an integral feature of cell membranes of living systems with functions that are of critical importance {{to the life of the}} cell. Long chain amphiphilic surfactant molecules can be introduced within the interlamellar region of layered inorganic host lattices to form anchored alkyl chainbilayerswithinthegalleries. Theintercalatedbilayerbearsastriking resemblance to lipid bilayers. However, unlike lipid bilayers where individual molecules can undergo lateral diffusion and also flip-flop between layers the anchored bilayer is characterized by the total absence of translational mobility. The degrees of freedom of the alkyl chains of the anchored bilayer are restricted to changes in conformation. This thesis describes a detailed investigation of the anchored bilayer formed by the intercalation of the anionic surfactant dodecyl sulphate (DDS) in a layered solid, Mg-Al Layered Double Hydroxide(Mg-AlLDH) using both experimental measurements and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations (Chapter 2). The thesis is organized as two parts. The first (Chapters 2 - 4) deals with the anchored bilayer in the condensed phase -the conditions for the formation of the bilayer arrangement of the intercalated surfactant chains and the conformation and dynamics of the alkyl chains of the surfactant in the galleries of the layered solid. The surfactant intercalated Mg-AlLDH-DDS may be delaminated in nonpolar solvents to give colloidal dispersions of individual Mg-Al LDH sheets with the DDS surfactant chains remaining tethered to the inorganic sheets(Scheme 1). The second part of thesis(Chapters 5 - 9) describe studies on the dispersions of the Mg-AlLDH-DDS in toluene. A summary of the results of the of the investigations of the anchored bilayer, formed by the intercalation of DDS ions in Mg-Al LDH, in the condensed and the dispersed phases is presented in the concluding chapter(Chapter 10). Layered Double Hydroxides(LDH) are insulating <b>lamellar</b> <b>solids</b> of the general chemical formula[M’(1 -x) Mx(OH) 2], where M’ is a divalent metal ion and M a trivalent ion. Their structure may be derived from that of Brucite, Mg(OH) 2, by isomorphous substitution of apart of the Mg 2 + by trivalent ions like Al 3 + with electrical neutrality maintained by interlamellar exchangeable ions. The studies reported in this thesis are on an Mg-Al LDH,Mg(1 −x) Alx(OH) 2, x ranging from 0. 17 to 0. 37. Dodecyl sulphate surfactant ions have been ion-exchange intercalated in Mg-AlLDH (Chapter 3). By varying the Mg-Al ratio, differing packing densities of the surfactant chains in the interlamellar space of the Mg-Al LDH-DDS are realized. At high packing densities the alkyl chains of the intercalated dodecyl sulphate ions anchored on opposing Mg-Al LDH sheets are arranged as bilayers while at lower packing densities the surfactant chains form a monolayer with the chains oriented flat in the galleries. This composition driven monolayer to bilayer transformation in the surfactant intercalated Mg-AlLDH-DDS is also reproduced by MD simulations. The simulations also indicate that there are profound differences in the factors that decide the arrangement of the surfactant chains. In the bilayer arrangement it is dispersive van der Waals interactions between the chains in opposing layers that is responsible for the cohesive energy of the solid whereas at lower packing densities, where a monolayer arrangement is favored, Coulomb interactions between the positively charged Mg-Al LDH sheets and the negatively charged head-group of the DDS anion dominate. The conformation and dynamics of the alkyl chains of the intercalated surfactant chains in both the monolayer and bilayer arrangements as well as the effect of packing density on these parameters is reported in Chapter 4. The conformation was studied using spectroscopic techniques, infra-red, Raman and 13 C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) while the dynamics by Variable Contact Time Cross Polarization Magic Angle Spinning(VCT -CPMAS) and 2 DWidelineSeparation(2 DWiSe) NMR techniques. The results showed the expected trends; the concentration of gauche defects and the dynamics of the chains increase with decreasing packing density. There is, however a sharp increase in the gauche concentration and conformational mobilities of the intercalated surfactant chains associated with the bilayer to monolayer transformation. The results of the MD simulations, too, reﬂect these trends. The second part of thesis describes the delamination of the intercalated anchored bilayer (Mg-AlLDH-DDS) in non-polar solvents. Delamination results in a colloidal dispersion Of the anchored bilayer, isolated Mg-AlLDH sheets with the DDS chains tethered to them, as neutral nanosheets of nanometer thickness and micron size. With increasing concentration of the anchored bilayers in the solvent a gel state is realized. The sol to gel transformation of the dispersions of the anchored bilayer in toluene has been investi-gated. Frequency dependent rheology measurements (Chapter 6) were used to investigate the visco-elastic properties of the dispersions and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements(Chapter 7) to understand the structure and shape of the nanosheets. The rheology experiments showed that the dispersions irrespective of their concentrations showed shear thinning. The SAXS results indicate a tactoid structure of the dispersions as well as in the gel phase. At higher concentrations, the X-ray scattering curves indicated that the layers stack loosely with an interlamellar space of ~ 39 Å, a value much larger than the interlayer lattice spacing of solid Mg-AlLDH-DDS(~ 27 Å). The nature of interactions between solvent molecules and the anchored DDS chains were probed by 1 Hand 2 H NMR measurements(Chapter 8). A clear association between the toluene molecules and the alkyl chains of the anchored surfactant was observed. 2 D NOESY experiments established that there are toluene molecules in close proximity that interact with the methyl tail of the anchored surfactant. NMR measurements were also able to distinguish two types of solvent molecules based on their widely differing mobilities. MD simulations(Chapter 9) of the dispersed anchored bilayer are able to reproduce the essential features of the experimental observations including the formation of a loosely bound lamellar structure. It also provides an explanation on how the spectroscopic observation of motional heterogeneity gives rise to the viscoelastic properties of the dispersed anchored bilayer...|$|R
40|$|When {{mixed with}} lithium salts, {{polymers}} that contain {{more than one}} chemical group, such as block copolymers and endgroup-functionalized polymers, are promising electrolyte materials for next-generation lithium batteries. One chemical group can provide good ion solvation and transport properties, while the other chemical group can provide secondary properties that improve the performance characteristics of the battery. Secondary properties of interest include non-flammability for safer lithium ion batteries and high mechanical modulus for dendrite resistance in high energy density lithium metal batteries. Block copolymers and other materials with multiple chemical groups tend to exhibit nanoscale heterogeneity and can undergo microphase separation, which impacts the ion transport properties. In block copolymers that microphase separate, ordered self-assembled structures occur on longer length scales. Understanding the interplay between structure at different length scales, salt concentration, and ion transport is important for improving the performance of multifunctional polymer electrolytes. In this dissertation, two electrolyte materials are characterized: mixtures of endgroup-functionalized, short chain perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) salt, and mixtures of polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO; SEO) and LiTFSI. The PFPE/LiTFSI electrolytes are liquids in which the PFPE backbone provides non-flammability, and the endgroups resemble small molecules that solvate ions. In these electrolytes, the ion transport properties and nanoscale heterogeneity (length scale ~ 1 nm) are characterized {{as a function of}} endgroup using electrochemical techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and wide angle X-ray scattering. Endgroups, especially those containing PEO segments, have a large impact on ionic conductivity, in part because the salt distribution is not homogenous; we find that salt partitions preferentially into the endgroup-rich regions. On the other hand, the SEO/LiTFSI electrolytes are fully microphase-separated, <b>solid,</b> <b>lamellar</b> materials in which the PS block provides mechanical rigidity and the PEO block solvates the ions. In these electrolytes longer length scale structure (~ 10 nm – 1 μm) influences ion transport. We study the relationships between the lamellar grain size, salt concentration, and ionic conductivity using ac impedance spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, and finite element simulations. In experiments, decreasing grain size is found to correlate with increasing salt concentration and increasing ionic conductivity. Studies on both of these polymer electrolytes illustrate that structure and ion transport are closely linked...|$|R
