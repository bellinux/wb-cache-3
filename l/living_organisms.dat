40|$|EP 2316340 A 1 UPAB: 20110516 NOVELTY - The device (100) has {{electrodes}} (120, 120 a- 12 n) contacting with <b>living</b> <b>organism,</b> and supplying electrode signals (130 a- 130 n). An electrode selector (140) selects {{the electrodes}} for determining difference signals (110) from the electrodes {{based on the}} electrode signals, so that difference signals are deduced from the electrode signals of the selected electrodes. The difference signals are utilized to measure a vital parameter of the <b>living</b> <b>organism,</b> and the electrode selector feeds a reference potential and/or reference signal. A storage unit collects the electrodes with the <b>living</b> <b>organism.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The electrodes include a metalized plastic layer, conductive plastic, textile electrode and/or capacitive electrode. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for determining a difference signal for the electrical measurement of a vital parameter of a <b>living</b> <b>organism.</b> USE - Signal recording device for use in an electronic arrangement of a motor vehicle (all claimed) for recording a difference signal for an electrical measurement i. e. ECG measurement, of a vital parameter of a <b>living</b> <b>organism.</b> ADVANTAGE - The device records the difference signals for the electrical measurement of the vital parameter of the <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> in a simple, rapid and cost-effective manner...|$|R

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins {{described himself}} as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> and that of inanimate objects. <b>Living</b> <b>organisms</b> can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction.|$|E

5|$|However, most 16th-century Europeans did not {{recognize}} that fossils were the remains of <b>living</b> <b>organisms.</b> The etymology of the word fossil comes from the Latin for things having been dug up. As this indicates, the term was applied {{to a wide variety}} of stone and stone-like objects without regard to whether they might have an organic origin. 16th-century writers such as Gesner and Georg Agricola were more interested in classifying such objects by their physical and mystical properties than they were in determining the objects' origins. In addition, the natural philosophy of the period encouraged alternative explanations for the origin of fossils. Both the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic schools of philosophy provided support for the idea that stony objects might grow within the earth to resemble living things. Neoplatonic philosophy maintained that there could be affinities between living and non-living objects that could cause one to resemble the other. The Aristotelian school maintained that the seeds of <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> could enter the ground and generate objects resembling those organisms.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in <b>living</b> <b>organisms,</b> in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
