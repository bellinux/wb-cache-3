5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal <b>load-bearing</b> framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse <b>load-bearing</b> assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} <b>load-bearing</b> frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|A tulou is a large, {{enclosed}} and fortified earth building, rectangular or circular, {{with very}} thick <b>load-bearing</b> rammed earth walls {{between three and}} five stories high.|$|E
5|$|The cannon is in a {{compartment}} {{beneath the}} cockpit, {{mounted on a}} <b>load-bearing</b> beam attached to the cockpit floor and the forward fuselage support structure. The nose is fitted with distinctive twin pitot probes and hinges up for service access.|$|E
5|$|Kahn {{structured}} {{the library}} in three concentric square rings. The outer ring, which is built of <b>load-bearing</b> brick, includes all four exterior {{walls and the}} library carrel spaces immediately inside them. The middle ring, which is built of reinforced concrete, holds the heavy book stacks. The inner ring is a dramatic atrium with enormous circular openings in its walls that reveal several floors of book stacks.|$|E
5|$|The Romans made durable {{concrete}} {{strong enough}} for <b>load-bearing</b> walls. Roman concrete contains a rubble of broken bricks and rocks set in mortar. The mortar included lime and pozzolana, a volcanic material that {{contributed significantly to}} its strength. Roman concrete structures such as the Colosseum, completed in 80 AD, still stand.|$|E
5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on <b>load-bearing</b> ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1932, {{but due to}} a {{shortage}} of funds, the design was gradually revised and cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, with the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies completed later. The design featured façades of <b>load-bearing</b> brickwork faced with Portland stone. Holden's intention to adorn the building with sculpture was also not fulfilled. As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest office building in London.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the <b>load-bearing</b> support.|$|E
5|$|The osteoderms (scutes) {{covering}} {{the back of}} Deinosuchus were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some were of a roughly hemispherical shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for connective tissue. Together, the osteoderms and connective tissue would have served as <b>load-bearing</b> reinforcement to support the massive body of Deinosuchus out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms {{have been used to}} suggest that, despite its bulk, Deinosuchus could probably have walked on land much like modern-day crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|The wood of B.integrifolia is pink to red, with {{inconspicuous}} {{rings and}} conspicuous rays. It is spongy and porous, with a density of around 530 kilograms per cubic metre (33lb/ft3). It is considered highly decorative, but it warps badly on drying, has poor <b>load-bearing</b> qualities, and {{is susceptible to}} termite attack; it is therefore unsuitable for most construction purposes. It is sometimes used for cabinet panelling and in ornamental turnery, and natural bends were once sought after for making boat knees. It is a useful firewood.|$|E
5|$|Tsamere {{comes out}} of character, thanks the audience, writers and {{producers}} of the show, and explains that the preceding story is a fiction. He talks about his stage fright and goes off on a tangent about the bulbs around mirrors in dressing rooms; he asks a row of the audience to stand repeatedly to check whether pillars in the theatre are <b>load-bearing.</b> He ends by saying {{that he does not}} need the mirror, as he does not wear make-up.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main <b>load-bearing</b> structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The building, {{including}} the <b>load-bearing</b> elements, was constructed of wood. There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 fire hoses in the hotel. Only a few escape routes had proper emergency lighting and {{directions to the}} emergency exits, and the hotel was also not on a hotline with the emergency centre of the fire department. The building had been inspected by the fire department, first in February 1976, {{and later in the}} beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects. They issued a list of proposed improvements to be implemented by the hotel, such as complying with the building regulations and the regulations for residence facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low <b>load-bearing</b> capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E
5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap shrouds, elevators, rudders and sections of the fins. The skin panels are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown that this type of panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not <b>load-bearing,</b> so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the most}} {{important}} steps towards an expressionist design were under taken by Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. This began with St Paul's Church in the new town of Glenrothes (1956–57). This was a wedge-shaped construction of white-painted common brick focused on a dramatic, jagged metal cross by the sculptor Benno Schotz. From about 1960, all Gillespie, Kidd & Coia's churches were designed in this Late Modernist style, as at St Bride's, East Kilbride (1963–64), which had a rectangular plan. From the mid-1960s, they adopted a centralised, non-rectangular plan, with seating ranged round the altar, reflecting liturgical change. Sacred Heart Church, Cumbernauld (1964), was rectangular, of <b>load-bearing</b> brick, dramatically lit through dark coloured windows. Our Lady of Good Counsel, Dennistoun (1965) had a splayed plan and slanted ceiling. St Benedict Drumchapel (1965–67) had a prow-like roof on curved, laminated timbers. These innovative designs inspired others to experiment, including J. McCarron's Our Lady of Sorrows, South Uist (1964–65). However, many of these designs proved too radical and were later demolished by the Catholic Church, citing structural or maintenance problems.|$|E
5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two <b>load-bearing</b> concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses. Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main trusses, one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the main trusses were the deck trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main trusses. The transverse deck beams, part of the deck truss, rested on top of the main trusses. These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E
25|$|The NTSB made {{recommendations}} to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which included a prohibition of mounting on the same axle different models of tires which had different <b>load-bearing</b> characteristics and also that greater <b>load-bearing</b> characteristics be required in tires manufactured in the future.|$|E
25|$|One common {{feature of}} skyscrapers is a steel {{framework}} from which curtain walls are suspended, rather than <b>load-bearing</b> walls of conventional construction. Most skyscrapers have a steel frame that {{enables them to}} be built taller than typical <b>load-bearing</b> walls of reinforced concrete. Skyscrapers usually have a particularly small surface area of what are conventionally thought of as walls. Because the walls are not <b>load-bearing</b> most skyscrapers are characterized by surface areas of windows made possible by the concept of steel frame and curtain wall. However, skyscrapers can also have curtain walls that mimick conventional walls and have a small surface area of windows.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} is constructed of <b>load-bearing</b> brick walls. The lighting is electric, and the heating system is gravity-rise.|$|E
25|$|By the Carolingian era, houses {{built for}} the nobility had their wooden, <b>load-bearing</b> posts set on {{foundations}} of wood or stone. Such uprights, called Ständer, were very strong and lasted several hundred years. These posts were first used for farmhouses in northern Germany from the 13th century, and enable them to be furnished with a <b>load-bearing</b> loft. In the 15th and 16th centuries {{the design of the}} timber-framing was further perfected.|$|E
25|$|Examination of {{this formula}} reveals the {{following}} facts {{with regard to}} the <b>load-bearing</b> ability of slender columns.|$|E
25|$|Free floor plan, {{relieved}} of <b>load-bearing</b> walls, allowing walls {{to be placed}} freely and only where aesthetically needed.|$|E
25|$|Freely-designed facades, serving {{only as a}} skin of {{the wall}} and windows and {{unconstrained}} by <b>load-bearing</b> considerations.|$|E
25|$|In {{realizing the}} breast-reduction corrections, the plastic surgeon takes {{anatomic}} and histologic {{account of the}} biomechanical, <b>load-bearing</b> properties of the glandular, adipose, and skin tissues that compose and support the breast; among {{the properties of the}} soft tissues of the breast is near-incompressibility (Poisson's ratio of ∼0.5).|$|E
25|$|In {{realizing the}} breast lift, the mastopexic {{correction}} takes anatomic and histologic {{account of the}} biomechanical, <b>load-bearing</b> properties of the three (3) tissue types (glandular, adipose, skin) that compose and support the breast; among {{the properties of the}} soft tissues of the breast is near-incompressibility (Poisson’s ratio of ∼0.5).|$|E
25|$|The general {{structure}} {{is almost always}} the same: posts and lintels support a large and gently curved roof, while the walls are paper-thin, often movable and never <b>load-bearing.</b> Arches and barrel roofs are completely absent. Gable and eave curves are gentler than in China and columnar entasis (convexity at the center) limited.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{definition of}} the word skyscraper was refined later by architectural historians, based on engineering developments of the 1880s that had enabled construction of tall multi-story buildings. This definition {{was based on the}} steel skeleton—as opposed to constructions of <b>load-bearing</b> masonry, which passed their practical limit in 1891 with Chicago's Monadnock Building.|$|E
25|$|The {{thickness}} specified for a wall {{is determined}} by such factors as damp proofing considerations, {{whether or not the}} wall has a cavity, <b>load-bearing</b> requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working. Wall thickness specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in partition walls, others brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has <b>load-bearing</b> brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base. The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.|$|E
25|$|A {{suspension}} bridge {{is a type}} of bridge in which the deck (the <b>load-bearing</b> portion) is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 19th century. Simple {{suspension bridge}}s, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world.|$|E
25|$|The general {{impression}} given by Romanesque architecture, in both ecclesiastical and secular buildings, {{is one of}} massive solidity and strength. In contrast with both the preceding Roman and later Gothic architecture, in which the <b>load-bearing</b> structural members are, or appear to be, columns, pilasters and arches, Romanesque architecture, in common with Byzantine architecture, relies upon its walls, or sections of walls called piers.|$|E
25|$|At {{stacking}} <b>load-bearing</b> locations, 40-foot containers are {{the standard}} unit length, and 45ft, 48ft, and 53ft all stack at the 40ft coupling width. Other units can be stacked {{on top of}} 20ft units only if there are {{two in a row}} (40ft coupling width) but 20ft units can not be stacked on top of 40ft units, or any other larger container.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{crowding}} {{within the}} executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated {{to the newly}} constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office, which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing {{was used as a}} reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's <b>load-bearing</b> exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal <b>load-bearing</b> steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|A {{steel dam}} {{is a type}} of dam briefly experimented with around the start of the 20th century which uses steel plating (at an angle) and <b>load-bearing</b> beams as the structure. Intended as {{permanent}} structures, steel dams were an (arguably failed) experiment to determine if a construction technique could be devised that was cheaper than masonry, concrete or earthworks, but sturdier than timber crib dams.|$|E
25|$|Though {{simple and}} {{compound}} walls were often used, great houses were primarily constructed of core-and-veneer walls: two parallel <b>load-bearing</b> walls comprising dressed, flat sandstone blocks bound in clay mortar were erected. Gaps between walls were packed with rubble, forming the wall's core. Walls were then {{covered in a}} veneer of small sandstone pieces, which were pressed into a layer of binding mud. These surfacing stones were often placed in distinctive patterns.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Vierständerhaus or four-post {{farmhouse}} is a more comfortable evolutionary development of the Zweiständerhaus built by well-to-do farmers. The building is supported by four rows of uprights arranged longitudinally, of which two form {{the sides of the}} Deele and two form the outer walls. So the outsider walls have a <b>load-bearing</b> function. In farmhouses of more affluent farmers there is also a clearer separation between living quarters and animal stalls.|$|E
