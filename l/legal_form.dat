5|$|In his {{biennial}} {{message to}} the legislature in 1910, Willson called for a uniform system of accounting based on legislation recently passed in the neighboring state of Indiana. He also advocated a measure requiring full disclosure of campaign expenditures. Due to its hostility toward Willson, the Assembly scarcely considered the governor's agenda or other needed legislation such as tax reform and redistricting. The reforms Willson advocated would later pass under a Democratic administration. The few accomplishments of this legislature included making electrocution the <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> of capital punishment and establishing of an eight-hour work day for public workers.|$|E
5|$|After the English Reformation of the 16th century, an {{increasing}} number of people were unhappy with the control that the government and monarch had over the Church of England. This {{led to the formation of}} independent churches and schools by what are known as Dissenters. The worship of any faith other than Anglicanism was illegal, and those discovered taking part were arrested and even sentenced to death. Oliver Cromwell imposed a period of religious tolerance, but his death precipitated further persecution of Dissenters, principally through the Act of Uniformity 1549, which required the use of the Book of Common Prayer as the only <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> of worship in England. The South West of England in general, and Taunton specifically, had a significant Dissenter population. There was a Baptist community in the town by 1646, and despite continued persecution they erected their first Meeting House in Taunton, on Mary Street in 1670.|$|E
5|$|With Portal's {{appointment}} came {{consideration of}} splitting Anderson's committee, which functioned as both an advisory and an interdepartmental body. In August 1946, a new standing committee was created, the Atomic Energy Official Committee, which assumed the interdepartmental function. In March 1947, Roger Makins became its chairman. Anderson's committee declined in influence, and was disbanded when he departed {{at the end}} of 1947. During the war, Christopher Hinton had been seconded from ICI to the Ministry of Supply and had become Deputy Director General of Filling Factories. He was due to return to ICI {{at the end of}} the year, but agreed to oversee the design, construction and operation of the new facilities at a salary far below that offered by ICI. He established his headquarters in a former Royal Ordnance Factory at Risley in Lancashire on 4 February 1946. Portal also created a position of Deputy Controller (Technical Policy), to which he appointed Michael Perrin. This created ill-feeling, as Perrin had been junior to Hinton at ICI. Portal also created a Technical Committee to replace the old Tube Alloys Technical Committee. To give the Ministry of Supply's control over atomic energy a <b>legal</b> <b>form,</b> a bill was introduced into the House of Commons on 1 May 1946 that became law as the Atomic Energy Act 1946 on 6 November 1946.|$|E

25|$|The women's rights {{movements}} in these nations {{want to make}} monogamy the only <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> of marriage. The United Nations joined these efforts in 1979 when the General Assembly adopted the , an international bill of rights for women that over 180 nations have agreed to implement. Article 16 of the Convention requires nations to give women and men equal rights in marriage. Polygamy is interpreted as inconsistent with Article 16 when it extends the right of multiple spouses to men but not to women. The United Nations has established the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) to monitor the progress of nations implementing the Convention. The United Nations is thus working through the Convention and CEDAW to promote women's equality by making monogamy the only <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> of marriage worldwide.|$|E

25|$|The term {{private bank}} {{refers to a}} bank that offers private banking {{services}} and in its <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> is a partnership. The first private banks were created in St. Gallen in the mid-18th century and in Geneva in the late 18th century as partnerships, and some {{are still in the}} hands of the original families such as Hottinger and Mirabaud. In Switzerland, such private banks are called private bankers (a protected term) to distinguish them from the other private banks which are typically shared corporations. Historically in Switzerland a minimum of CHF1million was required to open an account, however, over the last years many private banks have lowered their entry hurdles to CHF250,000 for private investors.|$|E

25|$|Since 1949, {{the most}} common method of {{execution}} has been execution by firing squad. This method has been largely superseded by lethal injection, using the same three-drug cocktail pioneered by the United States, introduced in 1996. Execution vans are unique to China, however. Lethal injection is more commonly used for 'economic crimes' such as corruption, while firing squads are used for more common crimes like murder. In 2010, Chinese authorities moved to have lethal injection become the dominant form of execution; in some provinces and municipalities, {{it is now the}} only <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> of capital punishment.

25|$|During {{the time}} of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions, {{conversion}} to Roman Catholicism did not result in total termination of the person's Jewish status. Legally, the converts were no longer regarded as Jews, and thus allowed to stay in the Iberian Peninsula. During the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal, however, many Jews were forced to convert, but thereafter were regarded by many people, though not in a <b>legal</b> <b>form,</b> as New Christians, distinguishing them as separate from the Old Christians of non-Jewish lineage. Since legal, political, religious and social pressure pushed many people to untrue conversions (public behaviour as Christians while retaining some Jewish beliefs and practices privately, a kind of crypto-Judaism), they were still treated with suspicion, a stigma sometimes carried for several generations by their identifiable descendants.|$|E
25|$|Until 1956, {{there were}} only two banks in Liechtenstein: the Liechtensteinische Landesbank as an {{institution}} governed by public law, and Bank in Liechtenstein AG, a private-law company. On 6 April 1956, Guido Feger founded Verwaltungs- und Privat-Bank – today’s VP Bank – in the <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> of a Liechtenstein institution with start-up capital of 2 million Swiss francs. The founding was a logical extension of Guido Feger’s Allgemeinen Treuunternehmens (ATU), at the time the largest and oldest trust company in Vaduz. In 1956, it employed 13 people in Liechtenstein and, on behalf of clients, four offices workers in foreign countries. Together, they catered to the needs of roughly 900 clients in matters pertaining to the fiduciary administration of real estate interests, securities portfolios and current accounts – mainly in the CHF realm and the United States – as well as patent rights, loans and fixed-term deposits.|$|E
