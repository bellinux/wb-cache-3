25|$|In a {{conventional}} lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses {{on the inner}} surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just {{that portion of the}} envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. <b>Light</b> <b>loss</b> is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening. Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the Edison effect, thermionic emission and invention of the vacuum tube.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{used the}} 3D footage to {{increase}} the illusion of depth. Despite this being his first 3D film he found the process easy. He said, [...] "You can literally twiddle a knob and the depth will increase", and, [...] "the trick is not to overdo it". In December 2011, Rapace undertook additional dialogue recordings for the film. Additional pick-up scenes were filmed during January 2012, including a one-day shoot on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, and a new scene shot at a cave in the Scottish mountains. For dark scenes, the film was color graded to specifically compensate for the <b>light</b> <b>loss</b> of 3D glasses, to ensure the image was comparable to the 2D version.|$|E

It has been shown that the reversibla <b>light</b> <b>losses</b> and the colour occuring under the action of an acute UV-illumination are associated with the appearance and death of macroradicals, while the irreversible changes are due to the accumulation of chromophore groups.

2500|$|In the 1990s, {{terminating}} {{fiber optic}} cables was labor-intensive. The number of parts per connector, polishing of the fibers, {{and the need}} to oven-bake the epoxy in each connector made terminating fiber optic cables difficult. Today, many connectors types are on the market that offer easier, less labor-intensive ways of terminating cables. Some of the most popular connectors are pre-polished at the factory, and include a gel inside the connector. Those two steps help save money on labor, especially on large projects. A cleave is made at a required length, to get as close to the polished piece already inside the connector. The gel surrounds the point where the two pieces meet inside the connector for very little <b>light</b> <b>loss.</b> [...] Long term performance of the gel is a design consideration, so for the most demanding installations, factory pre-polished pigtails of sufficient length to reach the first fusion splice enclosure is normally the safest approach that minimizes on-site labor.|$|E
2500|$|About {{the year}} 1774 William Herschel (then {{a teacher of}} music in Bath, England) began to occupy his leisure hours with the {{construction}} of reflector telescope mirrors, finally devoted himself entirely to their construction and use in astronomical research. In 1778, he selected a [...] reflector mirror (the best of some 400 telescope mirrors which he had made) and with it, built a [...] focal length telescope. Using this telescope, he made his early brilliant astronomical discoveries. In 1783, Herschel completed a reflector of approximately [...] in diameter and [...] focal length. He observed the heavens with this telescope for some twenty years, replacing the mirror several times. In 1789 Herschel finished building his largest reflecting telescope with a mirror of [...] and a focal length of , (commonly known as his 40-foot telescope) at his new home, at Observatory House in Slough, England. To cut down on the <b>light</b> <b>loss</b> from the poor reflectivity of the speculum mirrors of that day, Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This design has come to be called the Herschelian telescope. He discovered Saturn's sixth known moon, Enceladus, the first night he used it (August 28, 1789), and on September 17, its seventh known moon, Mimas. This telescope was world's largest telescope for over 50 years. However, this large scope was difficult to handle and thus less used than his favorite 18.7-inch reflector.|$|E

The <b>light</b> <b>losses,</b> including the intrinsic absorption loss from silver nanoparticles and the additional absorption loss induced by the void plasmons in the aluminum reflectors, are quantitatively studied for cells with different front surface morphologies. The study reveals that silver nanoparticles are effective to enhance the photocurrent in cells with planar front surface, while the absorption enhancement can be significantly offset by the plasmonic losses in the textured cells, contributing to marginal or even decreased photocurrent...|$|R
