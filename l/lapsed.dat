40|$|In {{the current}} {{generation}} of radiative-convective models a constant value for the critical atmospheric <b>lapse</b> rate, generally 6. 5 K/km, is used. However, the moist adiabatic <b>lapse</b> rates are a better approximation for use in simple climate models. Thus, a comparison of temperature profiles with critical constant and moist adiabatic <b>lapse</b> rates has been made for a one-dimensional radiative-convective model. The commonly used <b>lapse</b> rate of 6. 5 K/km yields surface temperatures some 1 to 3 K higher than with the use of moist adiabatic <b>lapse</b> rates for both clear sky conditions and a single effective cloud. When multiple clouds are included the constant <b>lapse</b> rate of 6. 5 K/km yields the lower surface temperatures. More importantly, the surface temperature generated from the constant <b>lapse</b> rate formulation is more sensitive to changes in carbon dioxide, relative humidity, cloud cover, and surface albedo.

40|$|This study {{analysed}} mechanisms {{through which}} stress-coping and temptation-coping strategies {{were associated with}} <b>lapses.</b> Furthermore, we explored whether distinct coping strategies differentially predicted reduced <b>lapse</b> risk, lower urge levels, or a weaker association between urge levels and <b>lapses</b> {{during the first week}} of an unassisted smoking cessation attempt. Participants were recruited via the internet and mass media in Switzerland. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with mobile devices was used to assess urge levels and <b>lapses.</b> Online questionnaires were used to measure smoking behaviours and coping variables at baseline, as well as smoking behaviour at the three-month follow-up. The sample consisted of 243 individuals, aged 20 to 40, who reported 4199 observations. Findings of multilevel regression analyses show that coping was mainly associated with a reduced <b>lapse</b> risk and not with lower urge levels or a weaker association between urge levels and <b>lapses.</b> 'Calming down' and 'commitment to change' predicted a lower <b>lapse</b> risk and also a weaker relation between urge levels and <b>lapses.</b> 'Stimulus control' predicted a lower <b>lapse</b> risk and lower urge levels. Conversely, 'task-orientation' and 'risk assessment' were related to higher <b>lapse</b> risk and 'risk assessment' also to higher urge levels. Disengagement coping i. e. 'eating or shopping', 'distraction', and 'mobilising social support' did not affect <b>lapse</b> risk. Promising coping strategies during the initial stage of smoking cessation attempt are targeted directly at reducing the <b>lapse</b> risk and are characterised by engagement with the stressor or one's reactions towards the stressor and a focus on positive consequences instead of health risks...|$|R

40|$|Rationale: During {{a smoking}} quit attempt, a single smoking <b>lapse</b> is highly {{predictive}} of future relapse. While several {{risk factors for}} a smoking <b>lapse</b> have been identified during clinical trials, a laboratory model of <b>lapse</b> was until recently unavailable and, therefore, {{it is unclear whether}} these characteristics also convey risk for <b>lapse</b> in a laboratory environment. Objectives: The primary study goal was to examine whether real-world risk factors of <b>lapse</b> are also predictive of smoking behavior in a laboratory model of smoking <b>lapse.</b> Methods: After overnight abstinence, 77 smokers completed the McKee smoking <b>lapse</b> task, in which they were presented with the choice of smoking or delaying in exchange for monetary reinforcement. Primary outcome measures were the latency to initiate smoking behavior and the number of cigarettes smoked during the <b>lapse.</b> Several baseline measures of smoking behavior, mood, and individual traits were examined as predictive factors. Results: Craving to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal, withdrawal severity, and tension level were negatively predictive of latency to smoke. In contrast, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, withdrawal severity, level of nicotine dependence, craving for the positive effects of smoking, and craving to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal were positively predictive of number of cigarettes smoked. Conclusions: The results suggest that real-world risk factors for smoking <b>lapse</b> are also predictive of smoking behavior in a laboratory model of <b>lapse.</b> Future studies using the McKee <b>lapse</b> task should account for between subject differences in the unique factors that independently predict each outcome measure. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
