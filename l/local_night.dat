5|$|Bruce became {{frustrated}} with the backstage politics of the wrestling business and began searching for another career. Back on the streets, Bruce, Utsler and Utsler's brother, John performed hip hop music at <b>local</b> <b>night</b> clubs, using the stage names ViolentJ, 2Dope, and John Kickjazz, {{under the name of}} their gang, Inner City Posse. Seeing a need for a manager, Bruce's brother Robert recommended his friend and record store owner Alex Abbiss, who established the Psychopathic Records record label with the group in 1991. Later that year the group released the self-produced EP entitled Dog Beats.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler {{formed a}} hip hop group in 1990. Under the stage names Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz, the group began {{performing}} at <b>local</b> <b>night</b> clubs {{under the name}} of their gang, Inner City Posse. By late 1991, the group had invested more money into production than was covered by returns. They decided that their gangsta rap style was the cause of the problem: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. Bruce suggested the band instead adapt a style similar to the hallucinatory, surrealistic [...] "acid rap" [...] of fellow Detroit rapper Esham, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as Los Angeles represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about Satan, which Esham often did.|$|E

Granz discovered Peterson in a peculiar manner. As the impresario was being taken to Montreal airport by cab, the radio was playing a live broadcast of Peterson at a <b>local</b> <b>night</b> club. Granz was so smitten by what he heard that he ordered the driver {{to take him to}} the club so that he could meet the pianist. In 1949, Granz introduced Peterson at a Carnegie Hall Jazz at the Philharmonic show in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|The Astronauts {{developed}} {{out of a}} group, The Stormtroopers, {{which was}} originally formed at Boulder High School, Boulder, Colorado in 1956 by Jon [...] "Storm" [...] Patterson (vocals, guitar), Robert Graham [...] "Bob" [...] Demmon (guitar; born February 11, 1939), and Brad Leach (drums). [...] In 1961, they became The Astronauts after adding Richard Otis [...] "Rich" [...] Fifield (vocals, guitar) and Dick Sellars (guitar), the change of band name recognising the fascist connotations of the previous name and {{to pay tribute to}} local hero, astronaut Scott Carpenter. Patterson switched to bass, Leech was replaced on drums by Jim Gallagher, and soon afterwards Sellars left to join the US Navy, being replaced by Dennis Lindsey. [...] With a line-up of Demmon, Patterson, Fifield, Lindsey and Gallagher, the band gained a strong local reputation, toured as far as Chicago and Dallas, Texas, and released their first single, [...] "Come Along Baby", in 1962, on the small Palladium label. They were signed to RCA Records after a record company executive was impressed by their performance at a <b>local</b> <b>night</b> club, the Tulagi.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of budget}} constraints, the {{production}} crew will often recycle sets to save money. For instance, the hospital corridor for Smallville Medical Center {{was transformed into}} Lex’s cell in [...] "Asylum", which was later transformed into the asylum corridor, before finally being morphed into Dr. Teng’s laboratory in later episodes. When the production crew {{could not afford to}} rent a <b>local</b> <b>night</b> club, with all of the extras they needed, for more than one night they decided to film all of the wide shots—capturing the three hundred plus extras—on the first night. Then, with their remaining funds, they filmed close-ups of the actors with a limit of fifty extras in the background. When scenes in the season three premiere called for Lex to be stranded on a deserted island, instead of traveling to a beach, the crew found a mountain range in Vancouver that had an area in front of the mountain that resembled a beach. The resemblance was close enough that all they needed to do was to bring in some palm trees to complete the aesthetic they were going for. All of the island scenes were shot in one day.|$|E
