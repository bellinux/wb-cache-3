5|$|Casimir III of Poland urged <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> {{intervene}} in his {{war with the}} Lithuanians who had occupied Brest, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and other important towns in Halych and Lodomeria in the previous years. The two monarchs agreed that Halych and Lodomeria would {{be integrated into the}} Kingdom of Hungary after Casimir's death. Casimir also authorized <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> redeem the two realms for 100,000 florins if Casimir fathered a son. Louis led his army to Cracow in June 1351. Because Casimir fell ill, Louis became the sole commander of the united Polish and Hungarian army. He invaded the lands of the Lithuanian prince, Kęstutis, in July. Kęstutis seemingly accepted Louis's suzerainty on 15 August and agreed to be baptised, along with his brothers, in Buda. However, Kęstutis did nothing to fulfill his promises after Polish and Hungarian troops were withdrawn. In an attempt to capture Kęstutis, Louis returned, but he could not defeat the Lithuanians, who even killed one of his allies, Boleslaus III of Płock, in battle. Louis returned to Buda before 13 September. A papal legate visited <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> persuade him to wage war against Stefan Dušan, Emperor of the Serbs, who had forced his Roman Catholic subjects to be re-baptised and join the Serbian Orthodox Church.|$|E

The Bastard arrives with the English army and threatens <b>Louis,</b> but <b>to</b> no avail. War breaks out with substantial losses on each side, including Louis' reinforcements, who are drowned during the sea crossing. Many English nobles return to John's side after a dying French nobleman, Melun, warns them that <b>Louis</b> plans <b>to</b> kill them after his victory.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Suleiman I, the sultan sent an ambassador <b>to</b> <b>Louis</b> II <b>to</b> collect the annual tribute that Hungary had been subjected <b>to.</b> <b>Louis</b> refused <b>to</b> pay annual tribute and had the Ottoman ambassador executed and sent the head <b>to</b> the Sultan. <b>Louis</b> believed that the Papal States and other Christian States including Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor would help him. This event hastened the fall of Hungary.|$|R
5|$|Turley {{moved from}} East St. <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> Lutherville, Maryland, in 1954, when the Browns moved to Baltimore. Though {{he played in}} Baltimore for one season, he {{remained}} in Lutherville {{for the remainder of}} his baseball career, and sent his children to the local public schools.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a school}} {{desegregation}} suit in 1972, the court required St. <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> accept a busing plan in 1980. Judge William L. Hungate declared that a mandatory plan would go into effect unless other arrangements were made {{to adhere to the}} terms of the suit. In 1983, an unprecedented voluntary busing plan was put into place, integrating the schools without a mandated plan being required.|$|E
5|$|Even though Musial left Donora {{after high}} school, he {{retained}} {{close ties to}} the town throughout the rest of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising. Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.|$|E

On July 5, 2013, Lapierre signed with the St. Louis Blues as a free agent. On January 27, 2015, Lapierre was traded from St. <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Marcel Goc.|$|E
5|$|Martin McNally, an {{unemployed}} service-station attendant, used a submachine gun in late June to commandeer an American Airlines 727 {{en route from}} St. <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> Tulsa, then diverted it eastward to Indiana and bailed out with $500,000 in ransom. McNally lost the ransom money as he exited the aircraft, but landed safely near Peru, Indiana, and was apprehended {{a few days later}} in a Detroit suburb.|$|E
5|$|A smaller player {{than his}} peers – St. Louis was listed at five feet nine inches tall in college – he often {{struggled}} to gain recognition for his ability. He was {{passed over for}} a provincial team at a midget age tournament despite leading his league in scoring, while major junior teams showed little interest in him. He was heavily recruited by National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) schools to play for their programs, however. He played one season of junior A hockey with the Hawkesbury Hawks of the Central Junior Hockey League (CJHL) in 1992–93 where he scored 37 goals and 87 points in just 31 games. The University of Vermont Catamounts convinced St. <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> join their hockey program. He had 51 points in 33 games in his freshman season of 1993–94 and {{was named to the}} East Coast Athletic Conference's All-Rookie Team.|$|E

5|$|Chicago has {{had prior}} {{experience}} with Olympic bids. In 1901, {{the city was}} unanimously chosen by the IOC to stage the 1904 Summer Olympics, but the Games were moved to St. <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> coincide with the 1904 World's Fair. Chicago also bid for the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics, without success. Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley visited Beijing – host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics – on May 15, 2006, where he collected information on hosting. The bidding process for the 2016 Olympic Games was officially launched on May 16, 2007.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Louis I, Poland formed a Polish-Hungarian union. In the pact of 1374 (the Privilege of Koszyce), the Polish nobility was granted {{extensive}} concessions and agreed to extend the Anjou succession to Louis's daughters, as Louis had no sons. Louis's neglect of Polish affairs resulted {{in the loss of}} Casimir's territorial gains, including Halych Rus', which was recovered by Queen Jadwiga in 1387. In 1396, Jadwiga and her husband Jagiełło (Jogaila) forcefully annexed the central Polish lands separating Lesser Poland from Greater Poland, previously granted by King <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> his Silesian Piast ally Duke Władysław of Opole.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{conflict}} {{broke out}} in 1127, when Charles, the childless Count of Flanders, was murdered, creating a local succession crisis. Backed by King Louis, William Clito was chosen by the Flemings to become their new ruler. This development potentially threatened Normandy, and Henry began to finance a proxy war in Flanders, promoting the claims of William's Flemish rivals. In an effort to disrupt the French alliance with William, Henry mounted an attack into France in 1128, forcing <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> cut his aid to William. William died unexpectedly in July, removing the last major challenger to Henry's rule and bringing the war in Flanders to a halt. Without William, the baronial opposition in Normandy lacked a leader. A fresh peace was made with France, and the King {{was finally able to}} release the remaining prisoners from the revolt of 1123, including Waleran of Meulan, who was rehabilitated into the royal court.|$|E

50|$|The {{defeat at}} Brémule {{effectively}} crippled the baron's rebellion and led <b>to</b> King <b>Louis</b> having <b>to</b> accept William Adelin as Duke of Normandy. William was officially invested with the duchy in 1120, even though King <b>Louis</b> continued <b>to</b> support William Clito's {{claim to the}} honour.|$|R
5|$|In {{between these}} campaigns Rupert had visited his uncle's court in England. The Palatinate cause {{was a popular}} Protestant issue in England, and in 1637 a general public {{subscription}} helped fund an expedition under Charles <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> try and regain the electorate {{as part of a}} joint French campaign. Rupert was placed in command of a Palatinate cavalry regiment, and his later friend Lord Craven, an admirer of Rupert's mother, assisted in raising funds and accompanied the army on the campaign. The campaign ended badly at the Battle of Vlotho (17 October 1638) during the invasion of Westphalia; Rupert escaped death, but was captured by the forces of the Imperial General Melchior von Hatzfeldt {{towards the end of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|It {{was very}} soon after their arrival that they {{learned of the}} death of Paul I. Louis hoped that Paul's successor, Alexander I, would {{repudiate}} his father's banishment of the Bourbons (which he later did). Louis XVIII then intended to set off to the Kingdom of Naples. The Count of Artois asked <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> send his son, Louis Antoine, and daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse, to him in Edinburgh, but they did not at this time. Artois had an allowance from King George III of Great Britain and sent some money to Louis. Louis XVIII's court in exile was being spied on by French police. The court-in-exile was being financed mainly by interest owed from Francis II on valuables his aunt, Marie Antoinette, had removed from France and had to cut its expenses significantly.|$|E
5|$|John of Bohemia's heir, Charles, Margrave of Moravia, visited Charles in Visegrád {{in early}} 1338. The margrave {{acknowledged}} {{the right of}} Charles's son, <b>Louis,</b> <b>to</b> inherit Poland if CasimirIII died without a son in exchange for Charles's promise to persuade CasimirIII not to invade Silesia. Two leading Polish lords, Zbigniew, chancellor of Cracow, and Spycimir Leliwita, also supported this plan and persuaded CasimirIII, who lost his first wife on 26May 1339, to start negotiations with Charles. In July, Casimir came to Hungary and designated his sister (Charles's wife), Elizabeth, and her sons as his heirs. On his sons' behalf, Charles promised that they would {{make every effort to}} reconquer all lands that Poland had lost and that they would refrain from employing foreigners in Poland.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Otto of Freising and {{the remnant}} of his troops arrived in Jerusalem early in April, and Conrad soon after. Fulk, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, {{was sent to}} invite <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> join them. The fleet that had stopped at Lisbon arrived around this time, {{as well as the}} Provençals who had left Europe under the command of Alfonso Jordan, Count of Toulouse. Alfonso himself did not make it to Jerusalem as he died at Caesarea. He was {{supposedly}} poisoned by Raymond II of Tripoli, the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county. The claim that Raymond had poisoned Alfonso caused much of the Provençal force to turn back and go home. The original focus of the crusade was Edessa, but the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The Veneto–Papal {{alliance}} eventually {{expanded into}} the Holy League, which drove the French from Italy in 1512; disagreements about {{the division of}} the spoils, however, led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France. Under the leadership of Francis I, who had succeeded <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> the throne, the French and Venetians would, through victory at Marignano in 1515, regain the territory they had lost; the treaties of Noyon and Brussels, which ended the war the next year, would essentially return the map of Italy to the status quo of 1508.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the {{campaign}} went well, with John outmanoeuvring the forces under the command of Prince Louis and retaking the county of Anjou by the end of June. John besieged the castle of Roche-au-Moine, a key stronghold, forcing <b>Louis</b> <b>to</b> give battle against John's larger army. The local Angevin nobles refused to advance with the king; left at something of a disadvantage, John retreated back to La Rochelle. Shortly afterwards, Philip won the hard-fought battle of Bouvines in the north against Otto and John's other allies, bringing an end to John's hopes of retaking Normandy. A peace agreement was signed in which John returned Anjou to Philip and paid the French king compensation; the truce was intended to last for six years. John arrived back in England in October.|$|E
