40|$|The {{question}} of the body image pervades Michel Leiris' work, and its underlying narcissistic elaboration often favors themes of confession or unmasking.

In <b>Le</b> ruban au <b>cou</b> d'Olympia, corporeal fusion with the mother reveals an anxiety of nudity which must be immediately veiled through writing.

This allows us to obtain data directly exploitable for the derivation of the intrinsie material behaviour, avoiding then a numerical post treatment. Furthermore, we present the multi &mdash; CCD camera system that we set up in addition to the flywheel apparatus.

This is the first case-control study in a non anglo-saxon setting; it is based on recent years, when foam helmets are the most common helmets. Material and methods: The study is based on a road trauma registry that covers fatalities, inpatients and outpatients. Some 14, 000 injured or killed cyclists are included. Helmet wearing was routinely collected as part of the registry notification form. All injuries are recorded and coded with the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). Cases are respectively defined as being AIS 3 + head injured, AIS 1 + head injured, AIS 1 + face injured, AIS 2 + neck injured and AIS 1 + neck injured. A first analysis is similar to the analyses selected in the Cochrane review, adjusting for age, sex, motorised antagonist (yes/no). A second analysis restricts the dataset to cyclists who are at least injured in a body region other than head, face or neck (n= 11889), to sidestep the bias due to missing crash-involved non-injured cyclists. This analysis moreover adjusts for more crash-force related variables. Results : Fully adjusted OR on the restricted dataset for wearing a helmet is 0. 29, 95 % IC=[0. 13 - 0. 56] for AIS 3 + head injuries, 0. 75, IC=[0. 62 - 0. 91] for AIS 1 + head injuries, 0. 71, IC=[0. 58 - 0. 86] for AIS 1 + face injuries, 1. 51, IC=[0. 56 - 3. 82] for AIS 2 + neck injuries and 1. 34, IC=[1. 01 - 1. 77] for AIS 1 + neck injuries.

40|$|The Rose Blanche Granites are a {{suite of}} two-mica granites emplaced within amphibolite-grade metasediments of the Harbour <b>Le</b> <b>Cou</b> Group (Exploits subzone of the Dunnage Zone, Central Mobile Belt), in the Appalachians of SW Newfoundland.

The Rose Blanche Granite suite consists of a multitude of cm- to km-scale sheets and dykes, which are both concordant with, and cut across S 2, and include xenoliths with S 2 fabrics. Some of the larger plutons are demonstrably laccoliths, and often occur in association with anatectic migmatites. Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility analysis was carried out for 34 sites collected from three large-scale intrusions. Dominantly low values of magnetic susceptibility (Km< 200 SI) indicate that in the majority of samples it is dominated by biotite, although in some, accessory amounts of ilmenite and late magnetite make a contribution. In the majority of samples the Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility fabric represents an indirect estimation of biotite shape preferred orientation. Microstructures observed in the Rose Blanche Granites are indicative of solid-state, amphibolite-grade deformation. The data support the interpretation that the suite was intruded syn-D 2, during peak metamorphic conditions. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

Examination of electromyographic activity in 2 opposing pairs of muscles in the neck and hindlimb of alert cats undergoing sudden, unexpected falls has demonstrated that electrical activation of all muscles tested occurred in 2 distinct phases. The earlier was otolith-dependent, whereas the later activity apparently did not originate in the labyrinth. Smooth landings from short falls were not possible in the absence of either phase of the response. Observation of the head and neck of the above cats while falling demonstrated a stereotyped pattern of movement, consisting of a lack of rotation of the bead and a progressive dorsiflexion of the neck. It was unaltered by loss of 8 th nerve function, and therefore loss of the earlier phase of emg activity in the neck muscles, and could be predicted by an elementary mathematical model based on simple physical principles.

40|$|THE terms carotis-arteria carotidea-sinus caroticus {{have long}} been {{established}} in anatomical nomenclature. I once asked myself {{what is the meaning}} and origin of the name 'carotis'? Why have the other arteries mostly a name related to the organ with which they are connected and why are the arteries in the neck called the 'carotid arteries'? As I did not know the answer to these questions, I had to investigate. The first quotation concerning the function of the arteries in the neck of man appears in a publication of Aristotle (384 - 322 B. C.). 1 In the translation of his Parva Naturalis it is stated 'also pressure on the veins (vessels) ofthe neck causes unconsciousness (fainting, sleep) '. It seems therefore that the term 'carotis ' comes from the Greek word karos meaning 'soft, sleep ' and was already used in anatomy before Aristotle. This origin and meaning of the term 'carotis ' was confirmed by Rufus of Ephesus (A. D. 98 - 117). In the French translation of the writings of Rufus 2 it is stated 'On a autrefois applique le nom d'assoupissants (carotides) aux vaisseaux qui montent a travers <b>le</b> <b>cou,</b> parce qu'en les comprimant on produit l'assoupissement et l'aphonie, mais on sait aujourd'hui que ces symptomes r 6 sultent de la compression des nerfs e...|$|E
