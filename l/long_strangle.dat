Many a time had she <b>longed</b> to <b>strangle</b> Narcisse; and {{she was on the}} point of saying, 'Think of his {{attempts}} on that little one's life--think of your wounds and captivity;' but she had not spent three years with Isaac Gardon without learning that there was sin in giving way to her keen hatred; and she forced herself to silence, while Berenger said, reading her face, 'Keep it back, sweet heart! Make it not harder for me. I would as soon go near a dying serpent, but it were barbarity to leave him as Osbert describes.' ...|$|R

Young Mr. Keller never suspected (my English brethren alone will understand) how very near my fist and his head were to becoming personally and violently acquainted. Different nations--different customs. I can smile as I write about it now.|$|R

50|$|The <b>long</b> <b>strangle</b> {{involves}} going long (buying) both a {{call option}} and a put option {{of the same}} underlying security. Like a straddle, the options expire at the same time, but unlike a straddle, the options have different strike prices. A strangle can be less expensive than a straddle if the strike prices are out-of-the-money. The owner of a <b>long</b> <b>strangle</b> makes a profit if the underlying price moves {{far enough away from}} the current price, either above or below. Thus, an investor may take a <b>long</b> <b>strangle</b> position if he thinks the underlying security is highly volatile, but does not know which direction it is going to move. This position is a limited risk, since the most a purchaser may lose is the cost of both options. At the same time, there is unlimited profit potential.|$|E

The youth was last seen boarding a bus in <b>Long</b> Beach; his <b>strangled</b> body was found the following day, discarded at Sunset Beach with a foreign object protruding from his anus. Drag marks along the beach close to where his body had been discarded indicate two individuals had carried Leras's body into the water. Two weeks after Leras's murder, on January 17, {{the body of a}} 21-year-old named Craig Jonaitis was found discarded {{in the parking lot of}} the Golden Sails Hotel near the Pacific Coast Highway and Loynes Drive in Long Beach. Jonaitis had been strangled to death with a length of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|R
50|$|Hit men Tom and Jerry wait in a Chicago bar for {{the go-ahead}} to kill Stanley. Anxious {{to get the}} hit done, Jerry {{suggests}} they perform the hit immediately; Tom refuses, and Stanley entertains them with jokes. As the phone rings, the film shifts to a flashback set ten years earlier, in 1984. Jerry, a youth employed at Billy's used car dealership, joins Tom as he walks with Karl. Karl describes how a local gangster bit off the nose of Karl's nephew. Disturbed by the audaciousness and brutality of the attack, Tom promises {{to look into the}} issue. However, Karl becomes spooked when they enter Tom's car, and Karl begins bargaining with Tom, to Jerry's confusion. Tom agrees that the two are friends with a <b>long</b> history but <b>strangles</b> Karl after an apology. Jerry throws up but insists that he is otherwise fine.|$|R
6000|$|... [108] During Sir Walter's {{illness in}} 1818-19 Mr. Skene {{was with him}} at Abbotsford, and he records a curious {{incident}} regarding Dryburgh which may be given here:--"For nearly two years he had to struggle for his life with that severe illness, which the natural strength of his constitution at length proved sufficient to throw off. With its disappearance, although restored to health, disappeared also much of his former vigour of body, activity, and power of undergoing fatigue, while in personal appearance he had advanced twenty years in the downward course of life; his hair had become bleached to pure white and scanty locks; the fire of his eye quenched; and his step, more uncertain, had lost the vigorous swinging gait with which {{he was used to}} proceed; in fact, old age had by many years anticipated its usual progress and marked how severely he had suffered. The complaint, that of gall-stones, was one of extreme bodily suffering. During his severest attack he had been alone at Abbotsford with his daughter Sophia, before her marriage to Mr. Lockhart, and had sent {{to say that he was}} desirous I should come to him, which I did, and remained for ten days till the attack had subsided. During its course the extreme violence of the pain end spasmodic contraction of the muscles of the stomach were such that I scarcely expected the powers of endurance could sustain him through the trial, and so much at times was he exhausted by it as to leave us in alarm as to what the result had actually been. One night I shall not soon forget: he had been frequently and severely ill during the day, and having been summoned to his room in the middle of the night, where his daughter was already standing, the picture of deep despair, at his bed-side, the attack seemed intense, and we followed the directions left by the physician to assuage it. At length it seemed to subside, and he fell back exhausted on the pillow, his eyes were closed, and his countenance wan and livid. Apparently with corresponding misgivings, his daughter at one side of the bed and I at the other gazed for some time intently and in silence on his countenance, and then glanced with anxious inquiring looks to each other, till, at length, having placed my finger on his pulse, to ascertain whether it had actually ceased to throb, I shall never forget the sudden beam which again brightened his daughter's countenance, and for a moment dispelled the intense expression of anxiety which had for some time overspread it, when Sir Walter, aware of my feeling his pulse, and the probable purpose, whispered, with a faint voice, but without opening his eyes, 'I am not yet gone.' After some time he revived, and gave us a proof of the mastery of his mind over the sufferings of the body. 'Do you recollect,' he said to me, 'a small round turret near the gate of the Monastery of Aberbrothwick, and placed so as to overhang the street?' Upon answering that I did perfectly, and that a picturesque little morsel it was, he said, 'Well, I was over there when a mob had assembled, excited by some purpose, which I do not recollect, but failing of their original intention, they took umbrage at the little venerable emblem of aristocracy, which still bore its weather-stained head so conspicuously aloft, and, resolving to humble it with the dust, they got a stout hawser from a vessel in the adjoining harbour, which a sailor lad, climbing up, coiled round the body of the little turret, and the rabble seizing the rope by both ends tugged and pulled, and laboured <b>long</b> to <b>strangle</b> and overthrow the poor old turret, but in vain, for it withstood all their endeavours. Now that is exactly the condition of my poor stomach: there is a rope twisted round it, and the malicious devils are straining and tugging at it, and, faith, I could almost think that I sometimes hear them shouting and cheering each other to their task, and when they are at it I always have the little turret and its tormentors before my eyes.' He complained that particular ideas fixed themselves down upon his mind, which he had not the power of shaking off; but this was, in fact, the obvious consequence of the quantity of laudanum which it was necessary for him to swallow to allay the spasms.|$|R

50|$|In finance, a {{strangle}} is {{an investment}} strategy involving the purchase or sale of particular option derivatives that allows the holder to profit based on how much {{the price of the}} underlying security moves, with relatively minimal exposure to the direction of price movement. A purchase of particular options is known as a <b>long</b> <b>strangle,</b> while a sale of the same options is known as a short strangle. As an options position strangle is a variation of a more generic straddle position. Strangle's key difference from a straddle is in giving investor choice of balancing cost of opening a strangle versus a probability of profit. For example, given the same underlying security, strangle positions can be constructed with low cost and low probability of profit. Low cost is relative and comparable to a cost of straddle on the same underlying.Strangles can be used with equity options, index options or options on futures.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} hedging analysis {{against an}} underlying price increase by using <b>Long</b> <b>Strangle</b> strategy formed with vanilla and barrier options. More specifically, up and knock-in call option and standard barrier put options are used. The main theoretical contribution is to specify profit functions for this strategy followed by derivation of cost functions for secured position. The strategy {{is applied to}} real option data for SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). The costs of options in strategy to form secured position are investigated for different values of barriers with fixed strike prices. Furthermore, the mutual effect of variation in requested costs or call/put option strike price or call option barrier is analysed...|$|E
