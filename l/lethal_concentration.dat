25|$|The main hazard of the reagent is its inhalational toxicity. Its median <b>lethal</b> <b>concentration</b> of 100mg/m3 over 4 {{hours in}} rats is {{comparable}} to that of phosgene (49mg/m3 over 50 min in rats).|$|E
25|$|Unlike methane, silane {{is fairly}} toxic: the <b>lethal</b> <b>concentration</b> in air for rats (LC50) is 0.96% (9,600 ppm) over a 4-hour exposure. In addition, contact with eyes may form silicic acid with {{resultant}} irritation.|$|E
25|$|Dimethyl sulfate is {{carcinogenic}} and mutagenic, highly poisonous, corrosive, environmentally hazardous {{and volatile}} (presenting an inhalation hazard). It {{is considered a}} potential chemical weapon. Dimethyl sulfate is absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract, and can cause a fatal delayed respiratory tract reaction. An ocular reaction is also common. There is no strong odor or immediate irritation to warn of <b>lethal</b> <b>concentration</b> in the air. The LD50 (acute, oral) is 205mg/kg (rat) and 140mg/kg (mouse), and LC50 (acute) is 45 ppm / 4 hours (rat). The vapor pressure of 65 Pa is sufficiently large to produce a <b>lethal</b> <b>concentration</b> in air by evaporation at 20°C. Delayed toxicity allows potentially fatal exposures to occur prior to development of any warning symptoms. Symptoms may be delayed 6–24 hours. Concentrated solutions of bases (ammonia, alkalis) {{can be used to}} hydrolyze minor spills and residues on contaminated equipment, but the reaction may become violent with larger amounts of dimethyl sulfate (see ICSC). Although the compound hydrolyses in water, plain water cannot be assumed to hydrolyze dimethyl sulfate quickly enough for decontamination purposes. The hydrolysis product, monomethyl sulfate, is environmentally hazardous. In water, the compound is ultimately hydrolysed to sulfuric acid and methanol.|$|E

25|$|Ammonia {{toxicity}} {{is believed}} to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the <b>lethal</b> <b>concentration</b> for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0mg/l.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solution}} to achieving a <b>lethal</b> <b>concentration</b> without releasing from cylinders was the [...] "gas projector", essentially a large-bore mortar that fired the entire cylinder as a missile. The British Livens projector (invented by Captain W.H. Livens in 1917) {{was a simple}} device; an [...] diameter tube sunk into the ground at an angle, a propellant was ignited by an electrical signal, firing the cylinder containing 30 or 40lb (14 or 18kg) of gas up to 1,900 meters. By arranging a battery of these projectors and firing them simultaneously, a dense concentration of gas could be achieved. The Livens was first used at Arras on 4 April 1917. On 31 March 1918 the British conducted their largest ever [...] "gas shoot", firing 3,728 cylinders at Lens.|$|E

40|$|During {{the present}} investigation, the 96 -hr LC 50 and <b>lethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of copper and cobalt for Tilapia nilotica were {{determined}} under controlled laboratory conditions at constant pH (7. 25), total hardness (255 mgL- 1) and temperature (30 °C). During acute toxicity studies, the physico-chemical parameters of water viz. temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, carbon dioxide, total ammonia, calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium and total hardness were monitored at 12 -hr intervals for each test. Fish {{were exposed to}} different concentrations of copper and cobalt, separately, starting from zero with an increment of 0. 05 and 0. 5 mgL- 1. After 96 -hr exposure of various concentrations of each metal, the fish mortality data were recorded with three replicates for each concentration. The 96 -hr LC 50 and <b>lethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> for each metal was computed by using Probit analyses method at 95 % confidence interval. The 96 -hr LC 50 and <b>lethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of copper for Tilapia nilotica were computed as 25. 00 ± 0. 65 and 47. 56 ± 1. 18 mg L- 1, respectively. However, the tolerance limits of fish for cobalt, in terms of 96 -hr LC 50 and <b>lethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> were calculated as 96. 14 ± 0. 58 and 178. 46 ± 2. 04, respectively. The tolerance limits of fish for both copper and cobalt varied significantly in terms of 96 -hr LC 50 and <b>lethal</b> <b>concentrations.</b> However, fish were significantly more tolerant to cobalt than that of copper. With the increase in metallic ion concentration of the test media (water), the level of ammonia and carbon dioxide increased, while that of dissolved oxygen decreased constantly. Total ammonia of the test media showed significantly direct relationship with carbon dioxide while the same remained significantly negative with dissolved oxygen indicating decrease in oxygen consumption by the fish under metallic ion stress, at different concentrations of copper and cobalt that enhanced the ammonia excretion by the fish...|$|R
