Double-file lines over a block <b>long</b> <b>were</b> reported for opening-week showings at the Audubon Theatre in New York. After the incorporation of the Fox Film Corporation, distribution of this film continued under the new company's name.

5|$|Devika Rani {{was sent}} to {{boarding}} school in England {{at the age of}} nine, and grew up there. After completing her schooling in the mid-1920s, she enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and the Royal Academy of Music in London to study acting and music. She also enrolled for courses in architecture, textile and decor design, and even apprenticed under Elizabeth Arden. All of these courses, each of them a few months <b>long,</b> <b>were</b> completed by 1927, and Devika Rani then took up a job in textile design.|$|E

5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers <b>long</b> <b>were</b> achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E
5|$|From 1943 on, Hergé {{with the}} help of Edgar P. Jacobs started {{redrawing}} and colouring the early Tintin adventures, while also collaborating in the production of new stories. The old stories, usually a bit over 100 pages <b>long,</b> <b>were</b> restructured to fit into 62 pages. Jacobs eventually ended the collaboration in 1947 when Hergé refused to share the credit with him. They remained friends regardless of the fact.|$|E

5|$|On New Year's Day 1911 {{the body}} of Léon Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London. He had been badly beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two inches <b>long,</b> <b>were</b> on his cheeks. The case became {{connected}} in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at {{the time for the}} link was scant. The historian FG Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because {{he was one of the}} informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, Brandon Marshall and Matt Forte {{were named}} to the 2014 Pro Bowl, the fewest number of Bears sent since 2009, when two were also sent, {{and the first time}} a Bears {{defensive}} player was not invited since 2004. On January 14, 2014, Marshall and Forte were {{named to the}} Pro Football Writers Association's All-NFC Team. On January 3, 2014, the Associated Press released its annual All-Pro team, with no Bears named. On January 9, 2014, Alshon Jeffery was named to the Pro Bowl after an injury to Calvin Johnson. Jeffery was later named the PFWA's Most Improved Player on January 17. On January 20, Tim Jennings and Kyle <b>Long</b> <b>were</b> named to the Pro Bowl, replacing Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks, who advanced to Super Bowl XLVIII and Mike Iupati suffered an injury, respectively. Long's invitation marked the first time a Bears rookie was invited since special teamer Johnny Knox in 2009, and the first offensive rookie since Gale Sayers in 1965. The four offensive Pro Bowlers are the most sent by the Bears since 1985, when Jim McMahon, Walter Payton, Jay Hilgenberg and Jim Covert were invited to the game. Forte, Marshall and Jeffery's invitations also marked the first time since 1985 the Bears sent multiple skill position players, and the most sent by the team since 1963 with Bill Wade, Joe Marconi and Mike Ditka. Forte, Marshall and Jeffery were eventually drafted in the fantasy draft by Team Rice, while Long and Jennings were assigned to Team Sanders. In the 22–21 victory for Team Rice, Forte ran for 31 yards on six attempts while catching three passes for 24 yards. Jeffery and Marshall recorded two and one catch for 22 and 21 yards, respectively. For Team Sanders, Jennings recorded three tackles, while Long assisted in shoving Cam Newton into the endzone.|$|E

25|$|A river system then {{migrated}} northward and transitioned {{into either}} a large lake or marsh. As this occurred, bentonite-rich clay (formed {{in part from}} volcanic ash erupted from nearby volcanoes) and clayey cross-bedded sand with some interbeds and lenses of lime ooze were laid down. This eventually became the light purplish-gray claystone, sandstone, and carbonate rock of the Chinle's Monitor Butte Member. Burrows that measure 5inches (13cm) in diameter and 5feet (1.5m) <b>long</b> <b>were</b> excavated by lungfish into the Monitor Butte. This member easily stands out in the lower to middle slopes of the Waterpocket Fold's west face in such places as The Castle and along the cliff's just north of State Route 24 as it enters the park.|$|E
25|$|The listed train {{shed roof}} which is 105 metres wide between {{platforms}} 1 and 12, has four spans, two spans 185 metres in length over {{the eastern part}} of the station date from the 1860s while the other two at the western side measuring 150 metres <b>long</b> <b>were</b> built in the early 1880s. The roof is supported by masonry walls with round-headed windows alongside platforms 1 and 12 and rows of cast iron columns. The roof spans have wrought iron trusses with cast iron struts on girders between the columns. The original roof was covered with slates with some glazing. The slates were subsequently replaced with boarded felt. Between 1997 and 1999 the roof was refurbished and 10,000 panes of toughened glass 'float' above the wrought iron trusses.|$|E
