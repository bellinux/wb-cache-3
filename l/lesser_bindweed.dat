50|$|Convolvulus, 1931 (situated in Helsinki, Kaisaniemi park), which {{depicts a}} young woman. Convolvulus stands for <b>lesser</b> <b>bindweed</b> or field bindweed. In this {{masterpiece}} the woman raises {{her hand in}} a half-protecting, half-blessing gesture. This sculpture is often said to symbolize spring's arrival to the north. The sculpture was born {{as a result of}} a competition organised by Helsinki City in 1930-31 to decorate Helsinki with public works of art. It is made out of bronze and is 240 cm high. Another version of Convolvulus is 120 cm high and stands on the grave of Bertel Hintze in the old part of Hietaniemi cemetery.|$|E
40|$|This work {{dealt with}} Hyalesthes obsoletus, {{which is the}} only known vector of Bois noir disease in grape-vine. Investigation {{centered}} on its flight activity and occurrence on bindweed and stinging nettle and, to a <b>lesser</b> extent, hedge <b>bindweed</b> and dead-nettle in North-Eastern Italy. The survey underlined the importance of bindweed in the insect lifecycle in Northern Italy, where only data from stinging nettle had previously been re-corded. H. obsoletus nymphs were found {{for the first time on}} the roots of dead-nettle, which proved to be a new host plant. The first observation in Italy of nymphs on hedge bindweed roots was also recorded.
