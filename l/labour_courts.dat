25|$|Inspired by {{his brother}} Frei Chico, Lula joined the labour {{movement}} when he worked at , rising steadily through the ranks. He was elected in 1975, and reelected in 1978, {{as president of the}} Steel Workers' Union of São Bernardo do Campo and Diadema. Both cities are located in the ABCD Region, home to most of Brazil's automobile manufacturing facilities, including Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz and others, and are among the most industrialized in the country. In the late 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, Lula helped organize union activities, including major strikes. <b>Labour</b> <b>courts</b> found the strikes illegal, and Lula was jailed for a month. Due to this, and like other people imprisoned for political activities under the military government, Lula was awarded a lifetime pension {{after the fall of the}} military régime.|$|E
25|$|Employers {{were forced}} to improve working {{conditions}} and to provide severance pay and accident compensation, {{the conditions under which}} workers could be dismissed were restricted, a system of <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> to handle the grievances of workers was established, the working day was reduced in various industries, and paid holidays/vacations were generalised to the entire workforce. Perón also passed a law providing minimum wages, maximum hours and vacations for rural workers, froze rural rents, presided over a large increase in rural wages, and helped lumber, wine, sugar and migrant workers organize themselves. From 1943 to 1946, real wages grew by only 4%, but in 1945 Perón established two new institutions that would later increase wages: the “aguinaldo” (a bonus that provided each worker with a lump sum {{at the end of the}} year amounting to one-twelfth of the annual wage) and the National Institute of Compensation, which implemented a minimum wage and collected data on living standards, prices, and wages. Leveraging his authority on behalf of striking abattoir workers and the right to unionise, Perón became increasingly thought of as presidential timber.|$|E
25|$|Perón's {{planning}} prominently included political considerations. Numerous military {{allies were}} fielded as candidates, notably Colonel Domingo Mercante who, when elected Governor of the paramount Province of Buenos Aires, became renowned for his housing program. Having {{brought him to}} power, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) was given overwhelming support by the new administration, which introduced <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> and filled its cabinet with labor union appointees, such as Juan Atilio Bramuglia (Foreign Ministry) and Ángel Borlenghi (Interior Ministry, which, in Argentina, oversees law enforcement). It also made room for amenable wealthy industrialists (Central Bank President Miguel Miranda) and socialists such as José Figuerola, a Spanish economist who had years earlier advised that nation's ill-fated regime of Miguel Primo de Rivera. Intervention of their behalf by Perón's appointees encouraged the CGT to call strikes {{in the face of}} employers reluctant to grant benefits or honor new labor legislation. Strike activity (with 500,000 working days lost in 1945) leapt to 2 million in 1946 and to over 3million in 1947, helping wrest needed labor reforms, though permanently aligning large employers against the Peronists. Labor unions grew in ranks from around 500,000 to over 2million by 1950, primarily in the CGT, which has since been Argentina's paramount labor union. As the country's labor force numbered around 5million people at the time, Argentina's labor force was the most unionized in South America.|$|E

50|$|The Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht) is {{the court}} of the last resort for cases of labour law in Germany, both for {{individual}} labour law (mostly concerning contracts of employment) and collective labour law (e.g. cases concerning strikes and collective bargaining).
