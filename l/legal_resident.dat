25|$|Horton's article {{includes}} an account by Shaker Aamer, a detainee and <b>legal</b> <b>resident</b> of Britain. His lawyer, Zachary Katznelson, had filed an affidavit {{in federal court}} in which Aamer said that he had been taken to the black site on 9 June 2006, where he was beaten and nearly asphyxiated. This was the same evening that the three prisoners died. Aamer said that during his interrogation, he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body. They also inflicted pain to his eyes, bent his fingers until he screamed and then pressed against his throat and put a mask over him so he could not cry out. He said he could hardly breathe. Although Aamer was cleared for repatriation to Britain in 2009, as of 2015 he is still detained at Guantanamo, where he has been held for almost 15 years without charge or trial. He is the last British resident to be held there.|$|E
