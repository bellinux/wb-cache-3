40|$|Trypanosoma brucei gambiense$, a causative {{agent of}} {{sleeping}} sickness, induced a dose-dependent production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha by human macrophages in vitro. TNF-alpha was also induced in the Mono Mac 6 cell line, which indicates a direct effect of parasite components on macrophages. Parasite-soluble factors were also potent inducers of TNF-alpha. The addition of anti-TNF-alpha to cocultures of macrophages and parasites {{increased the number}} of trypanosomes and their life span, whereas irrevelant antibodies had no effect. TNF-alpha may have a direct role (i. e., direct trypanolytic activity) and/or an indirect one, such as TNF-alpha mediated induction of cytotoxic molecules. A direct dose-dependent <b>lytic</b> <b>effect</b> of TNF-alpha on purified parasites was observed. This <b>lytic</b> <b>effect</b> was inhibited by anti-TNF-alpha.

Protease-deficient mutants were more susceptible. However, when subtilisin {{was added to}} exogenously to a protease-deficient strain, the organism assumed the characteristics of nafcillin tolerance.

The effects of nafcillin on B. subtilis were studied with both viability determinations and assay of cellular lysis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of nafcillin tended to be higher for the protease hyperproducing strains, but these values could be reduced by the protease inhibitor. No loss of antibiotic activity was observed when nafcillin was incubated with either subtilisin or trypsin. Furthermore, protease and autolysin from B. subtilis were not modified by nafcillin. The results showed that extracellular proteases could render B. subtilis relatively tolerant to the killing and <b>lytic</b> <b>effects</b> of a cell wall antibiotic.

We evaluated the capability of autologous DCs transfected with total tumor and normal RNA to induce cytotoxic CTL as the preliminary step to design a DC-based vaccine in the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods Monocytes-derived DCs were electroporated with either total tumor RNA or normal RNA. T cells were then primed with tumor RNA transfected DCs and <b>lytic</b> <b>effects</b> of the generated CTL were measured with Cytotoxicity assay and IFN-γ Release Elispot assay.

A. actinomycetemcomitans was more sensitive to lysis in this system than H. aphrophilus. The standard method for bacteriolysis separated the 10 tested strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans into two groups (I and II) based on their lysis patterns, whereas the 7 strains of H. aphrophilus examined were homogeneous. In group I of A. actinomycetemcomitans, EDTA displayed a considerable <b>lytic</b> <b>effect,</b> which was not increased by supplementation with HEWL. In group II, the <b>lytic</b> <b>effect</b> of EDTA was much less, but HEWL had a considerable supplementary <b>lytic</b> <b>effect.</b> When the turbidity of A. actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 29522) or H. aphrophilus (ATCC 33389) suspended in Tris buffer was monitored at close pH intervals (0. 2) from pH 5. 2 to 9. 2, maximal lysis of ATCC 29522 occurred with EDTA at pH 8. 0 and with EDTA-HEWL at pH 7. 6, while ATCC 33389 lysed with EDTA at pH 9. 0 and with EDTA-HEWL at pH 9. 2. When other members of the family Pasteurellaceae (Haemophilus influenzae type b, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Pasteurella ureae) were included for comparison, the group I strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans were the most rapidly lysed by EDTA. H. paraphrophilus was the least sensitive of the gram-negative strains tested, but not as resistant as Micrococcus luteus (control). M. luteus was the organism most sensitive to lysozyme, followed by P. ureae and the group II strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, while the group I strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, H. paraphrophilus, and P. haemolytica were the least sensitive organisms...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{electron}} microscope studies {{indicated that the}} individual spermatozoön of Hydroides hexagonus forms {{a hole in the}} vitelline membrane by means of lysis. Other observations established that the hole is real, being visible in living material during sperm entry. During the present investigation sea water extracts from frozen-thawed sperm were tested for <b>lytic</b> <b>effect</b> on the membrane. In normal living eggs the membrane appears as a single thick envelope, but in electron micrographs of sections it is seen to consist of a narrow outer border layer, a wide principal or middle layer, and a narrow inner border layer. After immersion in sperm extract the outer border layer elevates but does not dissolve, the middle layer liquefies and disappears, and the inner border layer seems not to change. This is interpreted as lysis of the middle layer. The extract exerted the same effect on fertilized and unfertilized eggs. In electron micrographs the sections treated with extract greatly resemble that part of the membrane which has been penetrated by the individual spermatozoön. It is concluded that the individual spermatozoön, too, exerts a <b>lytic</b> <b>effect.</b> Together, the present and two earlier studies are considered clearly to demonstrate that in Hydroides the individual spermatozoön does indeed make an entry hole in the egg membrane by applying lytic material to that part of the membrane in its own vicinity...|$|E

40|$|A cytolytic protein named Coelomic Cytolytic Factor- 1 (CCF- 1) was {{isolated}} from the coelomic fluid of the earthworm Eisenia foetida foetida. Despite {{the absence of any}} gene homology, CCF- 1 showed functional analogy with the mammalian cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF), particularly based on similar lectin-like activity. Indeed, both CCF- 1 and TNF recognise N,N′-diacetylchitobiose and exert lytic activity on African Trypanosoma brucei brucei. In this report, we show that South-American Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes, but not epimastigotes, were lysed by earthworm coelomic fluid or purified CCF- 1. However, T. cruzi was less susceptible to lysis than T. brucei brucei. This <b>lytic</b> <b>effect</b> of coelomic fluid and CCF- 1 on T. cruzi trypomastigotes was partially inhibited in the presence of anti-CCF- 1 monoclonal antibody, antibody neutralising the lectin-like activity of TNF or N,N′-diacetylchitobiose. In contrast, this <b>lytic</b> <b>effect</b> was completely inhibited when using T. b. brucei. In addition, T. cruzi components, upon recognition by CCF- 1 in E. f. foetida coelomic fluid, triggered the prophenoloxidase cascade, an invertebrate defence mechanism. These results further extend the functional analogies of CCF- 1 and TNF, suggesting that both molecules share a similar lectin-like activity that has been conserved as an innate recognition mechanism in invertebrates and vertebrates. They also establish a link between stercorarian (T. cruzi) and salivarian (T. brucei) trypanosomatids having divergent phylogenetic origins and patterns of evolution, but possessing closely related cell surface sugar moieties. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The <b>lytic</b> <b>effect</b> of H 2 O 2 was significantly enhanced by incubating hepatocytes {{in the presence of}} iron salts. Under these conditions, MDA-like products were detected, but lipid peroxidation and cell injury did not correlate. Iron chelators modulated the cytotoxicity of H 2 O 2 in different (and opposite) ways: when iron was complexed with ADP, increased cell lysis was observed compared to uncomplexed iron plus H 2 O 2. Iron-DTPA, on the contrary, decreased such a <b>lytic</b> <b>effect.</b> The preincubation of hepatocytes with desferrioxamine mesylate (Desferal; a strong iron chelator) abolished the cytolytic effects produced by the association of iron salts and H 2 O 2, as well as the membrane oxidative injury due to H 2 O 2 alone, thus suggesting the existence of an intracellular source of iron. This kind of mechanism (metal chelation rather than radical scavenging) is supported by the absence of any protective effect by some free radical scavengers against the oxidative injury induced by the association iron H 2 O 2. Nevertheless, the glycogenolytic effects observed in the presence of H 2 O 2 were not modified by Desferal.

This autolysin from log-phase cells was recovered after a single freeze-thaw cycle and assayed by using both native and penicillin (un-cross-linked) mureins. These same assays, however, revealed a significant difference in autolysin activity extractable from the two strains if the cells were inhibited by oxacillin. Under these conditions, the S. aureus strain that is susceptible to the killing and <b>lytic</b> <b>effects</b> of oxacillin had considerably more activity on penicillin murein than did the tolerant organism. These results provide evidence that hydrolytic enzymes on the cell surface are required to augment the wall damage initiated by oxacillin and other β-lactam antibotics to produce a bactericidal effect...|$|R
