25|$|The {{disasters}} of the VVS {{were largely}} {{down to two}} reasons; the better tactics used by the Luftwaffe {{and the lack of}} communications between Soviet pilots. The Luftwaffe used Rotte (or pairs) which relied on wingman-leader tactics. The two flew 200 metres apart, each covering the others blind spot. In combat the leader engaged while the wingman protected his tail. Two Rotte made up a Schwarm (section) and three Schwarme made up a Staffel in stepped up <b>line</b> <b>astern</b> <b>formation.</b> It allowed the formation to focus in looking for the enemy rather than keeping formation. Soviet aircraft fought with little regard for formation tactics, usually along or in pairs without tactical coordination. The lack of radios in aircraft made coordination worse. When the Soviets did use formation methods, the German Finger-four was much better than the Soviet V formation.|$|E
5000|$|With T-37s, {{the type}} of {{formation}} and sequence virtually remained the same since the team’s inception - <b>line</b> <b>astern</b> to diamond <b>formation</b> during a loop, then clover-leaf, steep turn, barrel roll and finally, the breath-taking bomb-burst. Attempts were made {{to increase the number}} of aircraft in the team, but engine thrust demands were excessive for the outer formation members to cope with. A four aircraft diamond has thus remained the basic formation of the ‘Sherdils’.|$|R

50|$|Muâvenet-i-Millîye weighed anchor at 00:30 {{and slipped}} through the European side of the strait. The Allied destroyers failed to notice her advance. At 01:00 on the <b>line</b> <b>astern</b> of Muâvenet-i-Millîye, two destroyers were seen, on the {{forehead}} was Goliath. Goliath asked the password and Muâvenet-i-Millîye, without losing time, responded with three torpedoes. The first torpedo hit the bridge, the second hit the funnel and the third the stern. The battleship capsized almost immediately taking 570 of the over 700 crew to the bottom, including her captain.|$|R
60|$|While the Cetacea drifted {{slowly with}} the stream the yacht’s {{windlass}} began to clank, {{and a few}} minutes later she steamed toward the smaller craft.

5000|$|The {{basic unit}} was the three plane section, in a Vic; two {{sections}} {{made up a}} flight, and two flights a squadron.

These comprised a pair (leader and wingman) and four (two pairs) in a “finger-four” arrangement ...|$|R
5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, Posen and ten other German battleships {{engaged the}} British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though {{the range and}} poor {{visibility}} prevented effective fire. Shortly thereafter, two British destroyers— and —came under intense fire from the German line. Posen fired at Nestor with both her main battery and secondary guns. At 18:35, Nestor exploded and sank under the combined fire of eight battleships. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed. Posen was now the fourth ship in the <b>line,</b> <b>astern</b> of her three sisters.|$|R
5|$|Nassau {{took part}} in the {{inconclusive}} Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916, in the II Division of the IBattle Squadron. For the majority of the battle, the IBattle Squadron formed the center of the line of battle, behind Rear Admiral Behncke's IIIBattle Squadron, and followed by Rear Admiral Mauve's elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the IIBattle Squadron. Nassau was the third ship in the group of four, behind Rheinland and ahead of Westfalen; Posen was the squadron's flagship. When the German fleet reorganized into a nighttime cruising formation, the order of the ships was inadvertently reversed, and so Nassau was the second ship in the <b>line,</b> <b>astern</b> of Westfalen.|$|R

5|$|As the Ju 87s {{reached the}} coast, the {{respective}} groups split off {{and headed for}} their assigned targets. By this time, some 15 miles off the Isle of Wight, the Bf 109s had caught up and were now zigzagging around the dive-bombers. Bode led III./StG 77 to attack from the northwest, dead into wind in order to bomb accurately. Usually the Ju 87s attacked in <b>line</b> <b>astern,</b> but Bode chose to attack in groups of three to split the anti-aircraft fire. To keep the enemy's heads down, he fired his machine guns in an 80-degree dive. He soon left an altitude of 13,000feet, releasing his bombs and pulling out at 2,275feet. The rest of his unit followed.|$|R
50|$|At 10.08, one He 111 {{was spotted}} by lookouts aboard HMS Edinburgh, at anchor in the estuary. Shortly afterwards, the bomber was {{observed}} over Drem.

Pinkerton spotted the Heinkel and at 10.21 ordered his section into <b>line</b> <b>astern</b> to make a No 1 attack on the enemy bomber. However, the Germans made a sharp turn to port to escape into clouds. Still some distance away, Pinkerton fired {{and one of his}} other pilots, Archie McKellar, at the fleeing enemy, doing no damage. The bomber landed safely at Sylt.|$|R
50|$|By 4:00, the Spanish ship Santísima Trinidad was {{relieved}} {{by two of}} her escorts and made away from the scene. Admiral Moreno's squad put together the survivors of Córdoba's group and turned to assist the harassed Spanish sails. Jervis signalled his fleet to cover the prizes and disabled vessels and at 4:15 the frigates were directed to take the prizes in tow. At 4:39 the fleet was ordered to take station in <b>line</b> <b>astern</b> of Victory. The battle was by now almost over with only some remaining skirmishing between Britannia, Orion and the departing Spanish covering Santísima Trinidad (which was to later serve as the Spanish flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar).|$|R

50|$|The chief {{engineer}} advised the Captain that the Taiaroa was making water. Life belts were handed {{out to all}} the passengers and crew. An unsuccessful {{attempt was made to}} get a line ashore. The Captain ordered all to the four life boats, the intent being to wait until light and then make for the beach. The boats were attached by <b>lines</b> <b>astern</b> but three soon capsized in the heavy sea. A rocket was sent up and a blue light burned to show the position of the beach. Most of those thrown from the capsizing lift boats were drowned having been overcome by the cold. Had they all remained on board they would most likely have all survived.|$|R

5|$|Scheer {{decided to}} reverse {{the course of the}} fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a {{maneuver}} that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously.

Hannover and the other five ships of the squadron therefore were located on the disengaged side of the German line.
