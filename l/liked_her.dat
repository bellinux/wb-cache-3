5|$|Lingerie model Emily Diamond {{has a role}} as {{a prostitute}} who teases Jory Cassel during the visit to the brothel. Diamond was {{initially}} hired as a body double {{to one of the}} main stars, but the producers <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> so much that they decided to give her a role. Also appearing in this episode is the casting team's Robert Sterne, who reprises his cameo role as a page in King's Landing.|$|E
5|$|In the meanwhile, her father's {{fishing boat}} is {{taken away by}} creditors. He sinks {{into a state of}} sadness and begins to drink away their savings. On one occasion, Vanaja’s {{superior}} intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of the child will be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will grow up to be an upper caste boy.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden, and {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. This was the first episode Scott directed for the show. Crittenden also made her debut as a writer for The Simpsons in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman. 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked. When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, {{he thought she was}} a really nice woman who was very mature. Crittenden was only 23 years old at the time, but Mirkin <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> and he hired her.|$|E

25|$|Like {{so many of}} the {{performers}} during the era, Breen was a big fan of the instruments created by the C.F. Martin & Company and used a variety of their products, including a couple of custom inlaid models. Like all of the other performers who had tried, Breen was unsuccessful in obtaining an endorsement deal with Martin. Unlike the others, she didn't go looking for another endorsement deal, she <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> Martin instruments too much.|$|E

25|$|French {{choreographer}} Sébastian Ramirez {{was hired}} from the dancer auditions, which saw over 5,000 applicants in Paris, New York and Los Angeles. Madonna <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> work and enlisted to choreograph two songs for the show. Ramirez {{was surprised by}} the fast pace in which Madonna and her team generated and swapped ideas for the tour. Taking charge of the whole show, Madonna would explain an emotion behind a song and then entrust Ramirez and the other choreographers {{to come up with the}} execution.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the history}} of James Industries, Helen (Herrick) Malsed of Washington state sent the company a letter and {{drawings}} for developing Slinky pull-toys. The company <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> ideas, and Slinky Dog and Slinky Train were added to the company's product line. Slinky Dog, a small plastic dog whose front and rear ends were joined by a metal Slinky, debuted in 1952. Malsed received royalties of $60,000 to $70,000 annually for 17 years on her patent for the Slinky pull-toy idea, but never visited the plant.|$|E
25|$|In August 2016, Rogen again {{spoke to}} Howard Stern {{about how he}} had felt hurt and {{somewhat}} betrayed back then by Heigl's comments. He went on {{to talk about what}} a great rapport they'd had on set while working together, and that at the time he had even envisioned making many more movies with her. Though Rogen wishes she would have apologized to him personally as opposed to publicly, he affirmed that he still really <b>liked</b> <b>her,</b> and that he never would have wanted the incident to hurt her career.|$|E
50|$|As a {{music teacher}} Sharp was gifted. But <b>like</b> <b>her</b> gifted father before her, she had no head for {{business}} and, <b>like</b> <b>her</b> gifted husband, she was stubborn, defensive and eccentric in ways that exasperated many.|$|R

She had a younger brother, David Williams (died 1982). Loy's paternal grandparents were Welsh, and her maternal grandparents were Scottish and Swedish. Her first name was derived from a whistle stop near Broken Bow, Nebraska, whose name her father <b>liked.</b> <b>Her</b> father was also a banker and real estate developer and the youngest man ever elected to the Montana state legislature. Her mother studied music at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago.|$|E
25|$|As {{a fitness}} instructor, Smith found {{a lack of}} {{appealing}} clothes in which to work and started to sew her own. She had no formal training in garment production, but had been interested in fashion since a teenager, crocheting bikinis from age 16, customising her clothes from age 18, and from age 21 starting to design and make her own clothes. She began by unpicking a favourite swimsuit {{and used it to}} make a pattern out of newspaper, providing the basis for her first leotard design. Her students <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> outfits, and started requesting that Smith make clothes for them too.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Raven-Symoné {{auditioned for}} {{a role in the}} Bill Cosby movie, Ghost Dad. At the age of three, she was {{considered}} too young for the role, but Cosby <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> so much that he found a role for her on his show, The Cosby Show, as his step-granddaughter Olivia. She made her debut in the premiere episode of the show's sixth season, and remained until the series finale in 1992. She then appeared as the younger version of Halle Berry's starring character, a headstrong biracial slave, in the TV movie , based on the book by Alex Haley.|$|E

50|$|Akari: In the anime series, she {{is hardly}} an athlete who {{believes}} she shouldn't be an athlete <b>like</b> <b>her</b> mother Tomoe Midou and believes she should quit.

25|$|In the pilot, Sookie {{was played}} by Alex Borstein {{but she could}} not be {{released}} from her Mad TV contract. She was therefore replaced by Melissa McCarthy, who re-filmed Sookie's scenes. The role of Dean also changed after the pilot, with the original actor replaced by newcomer Jared Padalecki. The character Lane was based on Sherman-Palladino's friend and fellow producer Helen Pai; Japanese-American actress Keiko Agena was cast in the role when they could not find an appropriate Korean-American actress. Liza Weil auditioned to play Rory, and while she was considered wrong for the part – Sherman-Palladino <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> so much that she wrote the role of Paris specially for her.|$|E
25|$|In {{a change}} to format, the final {{involved}} the Interviews that candidates undertook, though these included a scrutinising of the candidates' business plans as well. Thomas Pellereau became Lord Sugar's first business partner, whereupon {{he used his}} prize to launch a range of manicure products with assistance from Lord Sugar, including a line of curved nail files - the S-file, the S-Buffer and the Emergency File, two curved nail clippers, the S-Clipper and S-Clipper mini and a curved foot exfoliator, and the S-Ped - which were made available with major retailers in the country. While Susan Ma failed to win the series, Lord Sugar admitted he <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> plan, later investing into her skincare company Tropic in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The lessons, {{especially}} those of Constantin Heger, were very much appreciated by Charlotte, and the two sisters showed exceptional intelligence, although Emily hardly <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> teacher and was somewhat rebellious. Emily learned German and {{to play the piano}} with natural brilliance and very quickly the two sisters were writing literary and philosophical essays in an advanced level of French. After six months of study, Mme Heger suggested they stay at the boarding school free of charge, in return for giving some lessons. After much hesitation, the girls accepted. Neither of them felt particularly attached to their students, and only one, Mademoiselle de Bassompierre, then aged 16, later expressed any affection for her teacher, which in Emily's case appeared to be mutual, and made her a gift of a signed, detailed drawing of a storm ravaged pine tree.|$|E
50|$|In the meantime, Youngsu meets Jong-Won's parents, {{and they}} <b>like</b> <b>her</b> immediately; his mother <b>likes</b> <b>her</b> honesty, {{and his father}} <b>likes</b> <b>her</b> because she looks nothing like Kyung-Hwa. Jong-Won's mother asks to meet Hanja, and {{although}} Hanja first refuses, she eventually relents. After meeting Jong-Won's mother, Hanja realizes that Jong-Won's mother is warm and kind, {{and that she would}} actually be a wonderful mother-in-law for Youngsu. After having been burned by Youngmi's stuck-up mother-in-law, Hanja is even more grateful for Jong-Won's mother. She finally consents to the marriage.|$|R
6000|$|What {{we really}} know about the chief popular hero of his country, from {{documents}} and chronicles, is fragmentary; {{and it is hard}} to find anything trustworthy in Blind Harry's rhyming [...] "Wallace" [...] (1490), plagiarised as it is from Barbour's earlier poem (1370) on Bruce. {38} But Wallace was truly brave, disinterested, and indomitable. Alone among the leaders he never turned his coat, never swore and broke oaths to Edward. He arises from obscurity, like Jeanne d'Arc; <b>like</b> <b>her,</b> he is greatly victorious; <b>like</b> <b>her,</b> he awakens a whole people; <b>like</b> <b>her,</b> he is deserted, and is unlawfully put to death; while his limbs, <b>like</b> <b>her</b> ashes, are scattered by the English. The ravens had not pyked his bones bare before the Scots were up again for freedom.|$|R

25|$|Also {{during this}} time, Kelly's {{mother had a}} new baby, Erin, got married, and put Kelly's {{childhood}} home up for sale. Self-consciousness over her figure, along with the anxiety she began to feel, caused her to lash out emotionally, abuse diet pills, and briefly lose control over her life. The character's physical appearance is shown to {{play a part in}} her development. At various points of the series, she won the title of Spring Princess at a dance, and was voted her school's most beautiful girl. Kelly is aware of her appeal, but not to the point of conceit; instead, she is sometimes shown to be troubled by it. At one point, she entered a phase where she felt that no one took her seriously, which was heightened when Dylan gave his manuscript to Andrea for review instead of to her. During this time, she began to feel that people only <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> because she was physically attractive.|$|E
25|$|When World War II broke out, Walton {{began working}} for Time magazine. Walton met {{journalist}} Mary Welsh while they both worked for Time in England. Although he <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> and enjoyed her writing, he felt she lacked {{insight into the}} deeper meaning of the events she was covering. When Walton received permission to parachute into Normandy on D-Day and was training for the jump, Welsh invited him to a May 24 party at the London apartment of Robert Capa, the Hungarian war photographer. Capa had also invited Ernest Hemingway to the party. Although Welsh was not present, a mutual friend of hers introduced Walton to Hemingway. Hemingway and Walton soon became good friends, in part because Hemingway was fascinated by Walton's forthcoming parachute jump. Walton parachuted into France with the 82nd Airborne Division on June 6. Hemingway gained access to liberated France shortly thereafter. When Walton was staying in Cherbourg in mid-July, Hemingway visited him numerous times under the pretense of bringing him his mail. Hemingway, Capa, and Walton also spent a week at newly liberated Mont Saint-Michel in August 1944, drinking and eating {{as much as they}} could. Hemingway and Walton accompanied one another during {{the first phase of the}} Battle of Hürtgen Forest in September and October 1944. They even shared a double-bed.|$|E
25|$|Mega Man {{then takes}} a flight in a ship merged with Gatz {{heading for the}} planet Elysium with Yuna. In Elysium, Mega Man reaches {{the room where the}} Carbon Reinitialization Program is to be {{executed}} from. Sera then appears {{in the form of a}} robot to Mega Man and states that she did not execute the Carbon Reinitialization Program but has, instead, been waiting for Mega Man's arrival to challenge him in hopes that by defeating him she would prove that their master <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> more. In battle, Gatz tries to aid Mega Man by attacking Sera's logic circuits, but dies in the attempt. As Mega Man defeats Sera, Yuna arrives at the scene reminding Sera that it is not their Master's wish for her to die. Sera awakes in Yuna's real body and decides to help Yuna protect the Carbons from the machines that are being activated in Terra due to an old system Master tried to stop. However, due to Gatz's death, Mega Man, Sera and Yuna are now stranded in Elysium with no means of transporting back to Terra any time soon. The game ends with Roll and other characters working together to build a rocket to rescue Mega Man from Elysium.|$|E
