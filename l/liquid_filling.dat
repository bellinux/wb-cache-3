50|$|Slurry {{walls are}} {{typically}} constructed by {{starting with a}} set of guide walls, typically 1 m deep and 0.5 m thick. The guide walls are constructed on the ground surface to outline the desired slurry trench and guide the excavation machinery. Excavation is done using a special clamshell-shaped digger or a hydromill trench cutter, suspended from a crane. The excavator digs down to design depth (or bedrock) for the first wall segment. The excavator is then lifted and moved along the trench guide walls to continue the trench with successive cuts as needed.

On the other hand, heavy <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> is better suited for the detection of gamma rays but the events are harder to interpret. An External Muon Identifier (EMI) and an External Particle Identifier (EPI) were added to the BEBC, in 1979, to identify muons and charged hadrons, respectively, leaving the chamber. [...] Furthermore, an Internal Picket Fence (IPF) was used to obtain timing signals for events occurring in the bubble chamber helping to suppress the background.

5000|$|The {{cases of}} some diving watches {{designed}} for extreme depths {{are filled with}} silicone oil or fluorinated oil (oil {{in which all the}} hydrogen is replaced by fluorine) exploiting the relative incompressibility of liquids. This technology only works with quartz movements as a mechanical movement does not work properly in the oil filled case. An example of these watches is the Sinn UX (EZM 2B), whose case is certified by Germanischer Lloyd for 12000 m, which is deeper than the Challenger Deep. However, the quartz controlled movement is only certified for 5000 m. At extreme liquid pressures, the metal tube or the glass vial that shields the movement's quartz crystal oscillator in a quartz movement will eventually implode and the movement will stop functioning. The watch battery is another critical part that might fail under extreme liquid pressure.A problem with this technology is to accommodate for thermal expansion of the liquid contained inside the watch. The employed oil changes volume by 10% over a temperature range from [...] to [...] This property endangers a traditional watch case since the crystal would blow out from any significant internal overpressure. On the UX (EZM 2B), the case back contains a large movable piston with an o-ring seal, allowing the liquid inside the watch case to expand and contract to adjust internal fluid volume and equalize with outside pressure. The <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> improves the watch face legibility under water significantly, due to reduced refractive index differences between the watch crystal and its adjacent media and eliminates crystal fogging due to condensation.To obtain its water resistance the Sinn UX (EZM 2B) stainless steel watch case has a diameter of 44 mm, thickness of 13.3 mm and the case and bracelet weigh 105 g. This is dimensionally modest compared to air filled diving watches designed for extreme depths.|$|E
