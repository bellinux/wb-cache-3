40|$|The {{increasing}} {{range of}} explosive types {{and methods of}} initiation available to the blasting design engineer, and the possibilities of obtaining more detailed rock property data, require improvements in the precision of blasting design methods. Average design values, such as powder factor and specific charge, have little significance where rock properties vary in any <b>lithological</b> <b>section</b> of the blast. Application {{of the concept of}} incremental explosive energy distribution will increase the design sensitivity and control over blastability variations. In this paper the use of this concept is described for different levels of complexity. These range from the simple allocation of explosive energy for large rock sections, to the use of more complex energy attentuation functions to allocate incremental specific energy levels. Procedures to develop rock fragmentation predictions from such data are also outlined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Radioactive {{characteristics}} of pits drilled in the Al-Sharquieh mine while prospecting for recent phosphatic resources have been investigated. The {{results indicate that}} phosphatic layers are characterized generally by high radioactive intensities (more than 800 c. p. s). The lithological sec-tion {{in the study area}} is very complex sedimentologically, and characterized by high faciological variation in all directions. The Schlumberger geo-electrical configuration with fine separation of AB/ 2 was successfully applied to determine lithological boundaries, and the resistivities of the lay-ers of the <b>lithological</b> <b>section,</b> especially for thin layers. It was shown that the phosphatic layer resis-tivities increase or decrease as a function of associated material. As a result, two types of phosphatic layers have been geo-electrically distinguished. The first is characterized by high resistivity and rel-atively low radioactivity, which could be related to the rock phosphatic layers. The second is char-acterized by low resistivities and high radioactivity, which could be related to the sandy phosphatic layers. © 2001 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum.

40|$|The silicoflagellate taxa {{obtained}} in IODP Expedition 302 (ACEX) {{were identified and}} counted {{in order to establish}} the silicoflagellate biostratigraphy in the central Arctic Ocean. These microfossils in the ACEX samples were preserved in the Lithology Units 1 / 6 and 2, which are dark silty clay and biosiliceous ooze, respectively. The silicoflagellate skeletons in the ACEX samples are assigned to 56 taxa. Seven taxa were described as new species, which were abundant in Lithology Unit 2. Comparison with several study cases outside the Eocene Arctic Ocean suggested that the silicoflagellate assemblages in ACEX were unique in Lithology Unit 2. The dominance of silicoflagellate taxa varied throughout the <b>lithological</b> <b>section.</b> Based on the cluster analysis by Morishita similarity index C(Lambda), the silicoflagellate assemblageswere divided into nine assemblage groups. The silicoflagellate datum event of the first occurrence of Corbisema hexacantha in the lower part of Lithology Unit 1 / 6 is regarded.

40|$|Recently, Neural Networks {{became a}} popular method in geosciences {{in the context}} of pattern {{recognition}} problems. They can be used for classification of well logs, for image processing, for anomaly detection and similar problems. In the past, such problems were mainly solved by statistical approaches. However parametric statistical classification methods suffer from strong assumptions and nonparametric one's are unsuitable for small data sets. The hypothesis is, that Neural Networks can provide a useful technique, if statistic classification methods fail. Some theoretical considerations can support this suggestion. A standard layered Neural Network type with a linear accumulation and a sigmoid transfer function has been used to classify geophysical well logs into <b>lithological</b> <b>sections.</b> The selected data set consists of four geophysical logs (gamma ray, electrical resistivity, density, neutron neutron) and the known lithology of the wells. The available data has been divided into a training and a test data set. On the basis of the training data the networks have built an universal classification rule. The performance has been evaluated on the test data and compared versus a number of statistical classification methods: Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Discriminant Analysis with nonparametric density estimators and knearest -neighbour classification algorithms.

40|$|The {{concept that}} the Mohorovicic Discontinuity (Moho) does not {{necessarily}} coincide with {{the base of the}} continental crust as defined by rock-type compositions was introduced in the early 1980 s. This had an important impact on understanding the nature of the crust-mantle boundary using information from seismology and from deep-seated samples brought to the surface as xenoliths in magmas, or as tectonic terranes. The use of empirically-constrained P-T estimates to plot the locus of temperature vs depth for xenoliths defined a variety of geotherms depending on tectonic environment. The xenolith geotherms provided a framework for constructing <b>lithological</b> <b>sections</b> through the deep lithosphere, and revealed that the crust-mantle boundary in off-craton regions commonly is transitional over a depth range of about 5 - 20. km. Early seismic-reflection data showed common layering near the Moho, correlating with the petrological observation of multiple episodes of basaltic intrusion around the crust-mantle boundary. Developments in seismology, petrophysics and experimental petrology have refined interpretation of lithospheric domains. The expansion of in situ geochronology (especially zircon U-Pb ages and Hf-isotopes; Os isotopes of mantle sulfides) has defined tectonic events that affected whole crust-mantle sections, and revealed that the crust-mantle boundary can change in depth through time. However, the nature of the crust-mantle boundary in cratonic regions remains enigmatic, mainly due to lack of key xenoliths or exposed sections. The observation that the Moho may lie significantly deeper than the crust-mantle boundary has important implications for modeling the volume of the crust. Mapping the crust using seismic techniques alone, without consideration of the petrological problems, may lead to an overestimation of crustal thickness by 15 - 30 %. This will propagate to large uncertainties in the calculation of elemental mass balances relevant to crust-formation processes, and the composition of the convecting mantle. 12 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The Limousin {{ophiolite}} (French Massif Central) {{occurs as}} elongate bodies forming a (nearly) continuous suture zone between two major lithotectonic {{units of the}} French Variscan belt. The mantle section of the ophiolite is made of diopside-bearing harzburgite, harzburgite and dunite characteristic of a lherzolite-harzburgite ophiolite type (LHOT). The plutonic section is essentially composed of troctolites, wehrlites and gabbros locally intruded by ilmenite-rich mafic dykes. All the rocks were strongly affected by an ocean-floor hydrothermal metamorphism. The composition and evolution of primary magmatic phases (olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and spinel) throughout the lowermost magmatic sequence correspond to those described in oceanic cumulates (ODP data). The Limousin ophiolite is thus of MOR type instead of SSZ type. The whole <b>lithological</b> <b>section,</b> the mineral chemistry, the extensive hydrothermal oceanic alteration and the relatively thin crustal section are typical of a slow-spreading ridge ocean (i. e. Mid-Atlantic ridge). Comparison of the Limousin ophiolite with other ophiolites from European Variscides suggests that the oceanic domain was actively spreading during the Late Palaeozoic and extended from the Armorican massif to the Polish Sudetes. © 2006 The Mineralogical Society.

40|$|A major level {{drawdown}} {{of about}} 20 m, due to low inflows and reservoir operation, was experienced {{at the time}} interval between the hydrographic survey of the Kremasta reservoir (July 1999) and the collection of two sedimentary cores from the reservoir's invert (September 2001). The minimum reservoir level was recorded in December 2000. The sedimentary cores were taken at the Acheloos River mouth within a meandering reservoir section of about 2. 3 km distance from each other. At the latter time, a significant channel change was observed at the upstream core cross section with respect to its configuration in July 1999. At the maximum level drawdown, this cross section was actually upstream of the reservoir and {{the surface of the}} deposited sediment was exposed while the downstream one was only marginally submerged. This change of the channel profile is attributed to a significant erosion of loose, fine grained, deposited sediment during the first winter intense floods {{around the time of the}} reservoirSs minimum level. The channel geometry changed completely and the vertical scour of the deposited sediments was at least 2 m. The eroded sediment was transported downstream to the reservoir's interior and re-deposited according to flow velocity regime. The downstream core is investigated for possible signs of deposition of the eroded sediment. Apart from the analysis of the recent reservoir drawdown, cores were also described and correlated using lithology and sedimentary structures. The sediment deposits are composed of poorly graded sands to low plasticity clays and the horizontal stratification implies major flood events, possibly associated with the historical drawdowns of the reservoir (e. g. silty sand on top of low plasticity clay). The above observations illustrate the dynamic behaviour of the reservoir siltation as a result of reservoir operation, intense flood events and incoming sediment load. The analyses of the sedimentary cores' <b>lithological</b> <b>sections,</b> can serve as a useful tool for reconstructing the siltation history of the Kremasta reservoir...|$|R
40|$|The Viséan (Carboniferous) {{sedimentary}} {{succession of}} the basinal Kulm facies (Rhenish Mountains) {{was investigated in}} detail {{in order to achieve}} a high-resolution stratigraphic subdivision and correlation. Additionally, the ranges of fossil index taxa (ammonoids), fossil marker beds, volcaniclastic horizons and sedimentary features (e. g. colour changes) were integrated in the correlation. As a result, a comprehensive database was compiled, which contains 190 stratigraphic events of the Viséan interval of this area. Several sections are almost completely composed of shales, which are regarded to represent a slow but constant basinal background sedimentation of the Kulm facies. The thickness of <b>lithological</b> homogeneous <b>sections</b> thus indicates an approximately linear record of time and the average thicknesses of biozones and positions of stratigraphic events can easily be calculated from the compiled database.

40|$|The {{northern}} area of Gaza Strip, Palestine, {{is considered}} {{as one of the}} highest densely populated areas in the world. The groundwater pollution by nitrates increased rapidly as a result of absence of proper sewer system, inappropriate design of WWTPs, disposing of solid wastes in any available open areas and highly intensive use of agrochemicals. The aims of this study are to obtain a comprehensive picture about the spatial distribution of nitrates in the aquifer at three stages (1994 / 1995, 1999 / 2000, and 2003 / 2004) based on the hydrological year data, to delineate groundwater areas that is suitable for domestic use, and finally to define the role of land use, rainfall distribution, topography and aquifer lithology on groundwater pollution. For achieving these goals, maps for nitrates at the three stages and a 3 -D topography map have been drawn using surfer software version (8).

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 470. The Manín Unit {{belongs to}} units with Central Western Carpathians {{affinity}} and {{was incorporated into}} the Paleo-Alpine Acretionary Belt. The deposits of Manín, Klape and Drietoma units originated between the PKB Zone and Peripieninie deepwater fault (Mahel 1980). Tectonically, these units were created in the foreland of a transferring block of the Central Western Carpathians (Rakus & Hok 2005). From the lithological point of view the Manín Unit {{can be divided into}} two groups of sedimentary sequences: the first one, the Manín - Butkov Group (Rakus 1977), which is built up mostly of hemipelagic Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous marly limestones; and the second one, the Podmanin Group (Kysela et al. 1982), consisting of Albian to Maastrichtian flysch and pelagic rock complexes. The most characteristic massive set of Barremian - Lower Albian Urgonian limestones is developed in Manín and Podhorie formations (Vasicek et al. 1994). The recorded Albian stratigraphic hiatus within the Manín Unit was followed by rapid deepening of this sedimentary area and onset of the pelagic deposition of dark marls of the Butkov Formation. The Manín Formation is developed in complex of mainly gray to light gray massive organogenic limestones with numerous Barremian to Albian fossils of foraminifers (Orbitolina), crinoids, echinoids, molluscs, ostracods, corals and calcareous algae. Organodetritic bituminous limestones with dark grey cherts are typical of the Barremian - Lower Aptian Podhorie Formation. In microfacies, the fragments of foraminifers (Hedbergela), molluscs and crinoid ossicles are the most frequently identified bioclasts (Borza et al. 1987). In the Butkov Quarry, within the Manín Formation three <b>lithological</b> <b>sections</b> were sampled, which were used for the biostratigraphic analysis. The lower parts of the sections consist of grainstones, pelbiointrasparites, with dominance of recrystallized peloids and intraclasts. Fragments of foraminifers, corals and sponges are less common. Microborings of blue green and green algae were observed in bioclasts, which indicate deposition within the photic zone (up to 75 m), (Budd & Perkins 1980). In the upper parts of the sections only biomicrite wackestones occur with dominant increase of bioclasts. Biostratigraphically important foraminifers (Globigerina, Textularia, Miliolida, Orbitolina) are common. They belong sometimes to rock-forming elements, especially in the Lower Cretaceous open shelf and deep-shelf deposits. Fragments of brachiopods, echinoids, bivalves and gastropods were also identified. The limestone sedimentation in the Manín Unit in Manín - Butkov Group ends with typical hardground (Rakus 1977), which terminates the Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous sedimentary cycle. Total thickness is variable and ranges from about 50 m (Butkov Quarry) to 120 m (Manín Strait). Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Art. jest abstr. referatu z konferencji. Bibliogr. s. 81. The {{objective}} of the present paper is to show clues which are provided for understanding the development and paleogeographic significance of the Lower Cretaceous carbonate platform sequences in different localities. The results are based mainly {{on the study of}} previous works and also on the preliminary results from <b>lithological</b> <b>sections</b> investigated by authors. The Urgonian-type limestone represents a characteristic Barremian and Aptian shallow-water carbonate facies deposited along the northern Tethyan margin. The term Urgonien was established by A. d'Orbigny in 1847 for the reef limestones near Orgon (southern France). The facies encloses massive, light-coloured organodetrital limestones with foraminifers (Orbitolina) and transitional sediments - detrital or siliceous limestones. Among bioclasts, fragments of bivalves (rudists), corals, hydrozoans, bryozoans, small and large foraminifera (Palorbitolina lenticularis, Sabaudia minuta) and algae are the most characteristic constituens. In the Early Cretaceous, the opening of Alpine Tethys was completed and induced the development of carbonate platforms on its northern margin. Urgonian carbonate platforms in the Tethys have been widely studied (e. g. Arnaud & Arnaud-Vanneau 1991, Michalik 1994). Several deposition areas can be distinguished in the Western Carpathians, mainly: the Tatric "Urgonian" Platform (biohermal and lagoonal facies), source of the detritus transported to the Muráň Limestone; and the Manín Urgonian Platform prograding into the Belá Unit during the Aptian. Debris from both platforms was transported into adjacent basins and deposited as allodapic accumulations (Mišík 1990). The oldest hypothesis on the position of the neritic "Urgonian" Lower Cretaceous limestones of the Manín Unit consisting of Podhorie and Manin formations was summarized by Andrusov (1938). He considered the Manín Unit as an independent nappe unit. Later, based on lithostratigraphic and tectonic features, he characterized it as a succession of Central Carpathian affinity. However, its position and the tectonic style are close to Pieniny Klippen Belt structures (Andrusov 1938, Birkenmajer 1977). From the Urgonian-like facies, which occur in the Klippen Belt and the Peri-Klippen Belt we focused mainly on the Manin Unit {{in the area of the}} Strážovske vrchy Mts., the Nižná Unit (Nižná Limestone Formation) (Jozsa & Aubrecht 2008), Beňatina Klippe (Schlögl et al. 2004) and also in the Haligovce Unit (Haligovce Limestone Formation), which is usually considered as an equivalent of the Manín Unit. In the Outer Carpathians, the Urgonian-type limestones occur exclusively as exotic pebbles in younger deposits. Urgonian facies in the Western Carpathians shows some different features in comparison with other areas in the Tethys realm; e. g. lack of oolitic and oncolitic limestones, small representation of typical lagoonal facies with miliolids and dasycladaceans. The "reef-tufa" cementation, fenestrae, evaporate minerals are also missing, bauxitization is unknown. They use to be affected by silicification (presence of cherts). Dolomitization is almost missing (Mišík 1990). Dostępny również w formie drukowanej. KEYWORDS: Lower Cretaceous, limestone, foraminifers...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{comparison}} was made between pingo remnant depressions {{in the northern}} Netherlands and north-western Germany. For this purpose, the dimensions, substrate and infill of 17 depressions have been studied. These depressions are located in four separate study areas: Friesland, Drenthe (the Netherlands), Ost-Friesland and the region between Cloppenburg and Visbek (Germany). In most cases, <b>lithological</b> cross <b>sections</b> have been constructed. In the laboratory, Loss on Ignition measurements were performed on the deepest infill of three cores, each derived from a different study area. Two cores were selected {{for the construction of}} an age model of the deepest infill. This model has been made based on correlation of important transitions in pollen assemblage in the records to the well-known vegetation development in the Netherlands, reflected in a high-resolution pollen diagram of the Uteringsveen pingo remnant in Drenthe. For several other depressions, the age of deepest infill was determined based on a pollen quickscan. All pingo remnant depressions are situated in areas where sands are covered by glacial till which belongs to the Drenthe Formation. This is in turn covered by coversands of the Boxtel Formation. Morphologically, four different types of depressions have been distinguished; (1) flat-based pingo remnant depressions, (2) cone-shaped pingo remnant depressions, (3) possible underdeveloped pingo remnant depressions, (4) depressions of which the origin is unclear and (5) depressions that are not pingo remnants. A clear geographical trend is evident, as all flat-based pingo remnants occur in the northernmost study areas. This is thought to be caused by regional differences in the substrate. Infill of the depressions is roughly similar for most sites, showing a hydroseral succession of organic material. Two depressions contain an infill of mainly sands. Vegetation development and aeolian activity during the time of earliest infill have been derived from pollen assemblages and LOI measurements. Results are consistent with pre-existing literature. Pollen analysis on samples of the deepest organic infill indicates that pingo collapse initiated in the Pleniglacial and Bølling. Pingo remnants with a Pleniglacial infill are thought to have formed by collapse because of mechanical failure of the former pingo, whereas remnants with an infill of Bølling age may have formed by climate-induced collapse during the transition to a warmer climate. Possible indicators for climate-induced collapse are proposed: more of the (weathered) pingo skin will have descended back into the depression, which is likely to be relatively small and should have an infill dating from a period of transition to a warmer climate. Former pingos in the study area are thought to have been of the hydraulic type, where pressurised water is forced upward, penetrating the glacial till in the substrate through weaker spots. This is implied by the presence of the impermeable substrate, the cone-shape of several of the pingo remnants and by indicators of both former and modern seepage conditions...|$|R
