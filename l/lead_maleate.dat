40|$|Three {{types of}} lead salts of maleic acid are known. They are acid, normal and basic salt. This report is {{concerned}} with a basic salt. Tribasic <b>lead</b> <b>maleate</b> was obtained and ascertained by reacting normal <b>lead</b> <b>maleate</b> with aqueous solution of ammonia. 	It {{was considered to be}} formed by the partial decomposition and following co-ordination of normal salt in aqueous ammonia: 	PbM+OH- → PbO+HM-………(1) 	PbM+nPbO → PbMnPbO n= 3 ………(2) 	The reaction of dil. HCl on tribasic <b>lead</b> <b>maleate</b> was experimented and the mechanism was discussed. The basic parts are replaced by chlorides to give the polynuclear lead chloride or oxychloride (3). 	PbM 3 PbO+dil HCl → PbM nPbO mPbCl 2 ………(3) 	The product PbM 3 PbCl 2 (n= 0) is soluble polynuclear co-ordination salt of lead. 	One tribasic salt catches six HCl and thus the stabilization power for polyvinylchloride is expected...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of ammonium chloride solution on tribasic <b>lead</b> <b>maleate</b> {{and the reaction}} {{in the presence of}} maleic acid were studied. In both cases the precipitation products have each constant composition but crystallization products from solutions are variable. 	The following reaction mechanism was discussed. 	NH 4 Cl → NH 4 + ↔ NH 3 +H+………(1) 	When maleic acid is absent, 	PbO+H++Cl- → PbCl 2 +H 2 O………(2) 	NH 3 +H 2 O → NH 4 +OH-………(3) 	PbM+OH- → PbO+HM-………(4) 	When maleic acid is present, 	PbO+H++M [...] → PbM+H 2 O………(5) 	where PbO and PbM are the basic and maleate part of tribasic <b>lead</b> <b>maleate.</b> 	The precipitation products formed by above reactions are considered to be polynuclear co-ordination compounds and their structures are compatible with the electronic theory...|$|E
40|$|Crystallographic {{analysis}} of the bromo-beta-lactones obtained by addition of bromine to aqueous solutions of disodium 2, 3 -dimethylmaleate and 2, 3 -dimethylfumarate reveals stereochernistries (4 from 1, and 3 from 2) opposite to those originally assigned (3 from 1, and 4 from 2). Specifically, the <b>maleate</b> <b>leads</b> to a bromo-beta-lactone with the methyl groups in a trans relationship, whereas the fumarate leads to the corresponding cis isomer. To account for this observation, we suggest that the first-formed intermediate in each case is an alpha-lactone. B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 + G(d) calculations in PCM water indicate that the cyclic chloronium and bromonium adducts of acrylate anion are not intermediates but transition structures for the degenerate rearrangement of halomethyl-alpha-lactones. Bader {{analysis of}} MP 2 / 6 - 31 + G(d,p) electron density distributions indicates that oxiranone possesses considerable ionic character in the endocyclic C-alpha-O-n bond. In PCM water there is neither a ring critical point nor a bond critical point for C-alpha-O-n, although geometrically the molecule still possesses an acute-angled three-membered ring with a C-alpha-C-n angle of only 69 degrees. Combined quantum/classical calculations for B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 + G(d) oxiranone surrounded by about 600 explicit TIP 3 P water molecules indicate that the cyclic structure is an energy minimum in aqueous solution, and Bader analysis gives a result similar to that from the continuum model.

40|$|While the {{build-up}} of oxidized proteins within {{cells is}} believed to be toxic, there is currently no evidence linking protein carbonylation and cell death. In the present study, we show that incubation of nPC 12 (neuron-like PC 12) cells with 50 &#x 3 BC;M DEM (diethyl <b>maleate)</b> <b>leads</b> to a partial and transient depletion of glutathione (GSH). Concomitant with GSH disappearance there is increased accumulation of PCOs (protein carbonyls) and cell death (both by necrosis and apoptosis). Immunocytochemical studies also revealed a temporal/spatial relationship between carbonylation and cellular apoptosis. In addition, the extent of all three, PCO accumulation, protein aggregation and cell death, augments if oxidized proteins are not removed by proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the carbonyl scavengers hydralazine, histidine hydrazide and methoxylamine at preventing cell death identifies PCOs as the toxic species. Experiments using well-characterized apoptosis inhibitors place protein carbonylation downstream of the mitochondrial transition pore opening and upstream of caspase activation. While the study focused mostly on nPC 12 cells, experiments in primary neuronal cultures yielded the same results. The findings are also not restricted to DEM-induced cell death, since a similar relationship between carbonylation and apoptosis was found in staurosporine- and buthionine sulfoximine-treated nPC 12 cells. In sum, the above results show {{for the first time a}} causal relationship between carbonylation, protein aggregation and apoptosis of neurons undergoing oxidative damage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to place direct (oxidative) protein carbonylation within the apoptotic pathway...|$|R
