5|$|A moat, {{approximately}} 190 metres (620 feet) to {{the south}} of the castle, was constructed in mediaeval times, likely {{around the time of the}} rebuilding in 1305. A Scheduled Ancient Monument in its own right, the moat encloses approximately an acre of <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the property. The moat may have been an enclosure surrounding farm buildings connected to the castle.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{changes to}} the stadium itself, Rangers have also sought to develop <b>land</b> <b>around</b> Ibrox. In {{partnership}} with the Las Vegas Sands corporation, the club received outline planning permission from Glasgow City Council {{for the development of}} land adjoining Ibrox as the home of a super casino. The casino was planned to be accompanied by a Rangers-themed leisure complex. Britain's Casino Advisory Panel reviewed bids from eight short-listed cities, including Glasgow, and in 2007 awarded the first licence to Manchester. There is no immediate prospect of the Ibrox proposal being resurrected, as Gordon Brown dropped the plans for super casinos soon after becoming Prime Minister. Rangers were given approval by Glasgow City Council in October 2008 to purchase <b>land</b> <b>around</b> Ibrox and redevelop the area with hotel and retail outlets. This scheme stalled, however, as regulations constrained what could be built in the area.|$|E

5|$|Discussion of damming the White River for {{flood control}} {{began in the}} 1930s, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) held {{hearings}} on building a dam in January 1946. The new dam would create a lake 50miles (80km) long, and one arm would extend to Monte Ne. Work on Beaver Dam began in 1960 as the CoE impounded and bought <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the White River. In July 1962, Mary Powell sold Camp Joyzelle to the CoE, and W. T. McWhorten sold his land as well.|$|E
5|$|During the post-Civil War {{construction}} of the extended Richmond and Danville Railroad System in 1865, railroad stockholders Thomas Garner and Larkin Smith purchased <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the railroad's right-of-way and began developing the city of Buford.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} features of Justinian's reign was the recovery of large stretches of <b>land</b> <b>around</b> the Western Mediterranean basin that had slipped out of Imperial control in the 5th century. As a Christian Roman emperor, Justinian considered it his divine duty to restore the Roman Empire to its ancient boundaries. Although he never personally took part in military campaigns, he boasted of his successes in the prefaces to his laws and had them commemorated in art. The re-conquests were in large part carried out by his general Belisarius.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of {{the timber}} <b>land</b> <b>around</b> {{the tree was}} {{eventually}} acquired by the Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust, which leased the timbering rights to the North East Lumber Company. Under the lease agreement, the North East Lumber Company only paid for the lumber that it cleared from the land. The company found the Mingo Oak too large to cut down, and assessed that its removal was too costly to undertake. The Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust also leased out the land where the tree was located to the Island Creek Coal Company for mining.|$|E
5|$|Pevensey Castle was reoccupied between 1940 and 1945, {{during the}} Second World War, {{when it was}} garrisoned by units from the Home Guard, the British and Canadian armies and the United States Army Air Corps. Machine-gun posts were built into the Roman and Norman walls to control the flat <b>land</b> <b>around</b> Pevensey and guard against {{the threat of a}} German invasion.

5|$|Svalbard has {{permafrost}} and tundra, {{with both}} low, {{middle and high}} Arctic vegetation. 165 species of plants have been found on the archipelago. Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, which accounts for about 10% of the archipelago. Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld <b>Land,</b> <b>around</b> Isfjorden and where affected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving the archipelago a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid sultan, Al-Adil I, stormed {{into the}} County of Tripoli, {{creating}} {{an opportunity for}} Leo to plunder the <b>land</b> <b>around</b> Antioch in 1208. Bohemond persuaded Kaykaus I, Sultan of Rum, to invade Cilicia, forcing Leo to withdraw from Antioch. Pope Innocent tasked Albert Avogadro, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to mediate a peace. Avogadro, who was an ally of the Knights Templar, urged Leo to return Bagras to them. In an attempt to renew the truce, Leo obeyed the legate's demand, promising to withdraw from Bagras.|$|E

In addition, the region has been impacted by frequent faulting, leading to the combination of rocks from different geologic periods. As a result, it is difficult to create an accurate geologic map of the area.|$|E
