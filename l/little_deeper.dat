Benaud at once set a very aggressive field, especially to Bailey, where he fielded only three yards from the bat to Meckiff's bowling, a <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> for Davidson. Bailey had a word with Benaud, no doubt asking him not to move when the bowler was running up to bowl. I thought he was so close that if Bailey had put his bat out to swing at a ball he would have hit him.|$|E

Instead, she has trussed herself up in vinyl to coo another batch of digitized porn." [...] On a better note, she called the tracks [...] "Rollercoaster" [...] and [...] "Luv" [...] "engaging tracks", describing them as a [...] "sassy-sweet side" [...] and [...] "a plump, crackling confection", respectively.|$|E

Her mother, Martha Mayor, was a paper conservator for the Freer and Sackler Galleries at the Smithsonian Institution. Smith's parents later divorced.

[...] Billboards David Greenwald praised the choreography and noted that Usher shows no signs of sickness as he performs the compound choreography, [...] "which ends with a forceful escape". Sam Lansky of Idolator was divided on the video and wrote that the singer [...] "could have dug a <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> to tap into some of that very real personal pain to bring something more emotionally charged to this video; as it stands, it’s a little too polished to feel anything but contrived." ...|$|E
500|$|Lifehouse {{lead singer}} Jason Wade had many inspirations when writing songs for Who We Are.

I had to dig a little for that one, but I find myself at a place where I can write stuff that's a <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> than your average love song in terms of emotion." [...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he read a newspaper article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|E
500|$|Günther and Newton {{noted that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} was shaped somewhat differently and longer {{than that of the}} hoopoe starling, being about [...] long from the occipital condyle; it was also narrower, being [...] wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the eye sockets were about [...] apart. The interorbital septum was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about [...] long, less curved and proportionally a <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger nostrils, with the nostril openings in the bone being [...] in length. The mandible was about [...] long and [...] deep proximally. The skull had an attachment scar above the temporal fossa. The supraoccipital ridge on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a biventer muscle attachment in the parietal region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.|$|E

500|$|Davies {{also uses}} his scripts {{to examine and}} debate on large issues such as {{sexuality}} and religion, especially from a homosexual or atheist perspective. He refrains from a dependence on [...] "cheap, easy lines" [...] that provide <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> insight; his mantra during his early adult drama career was [...] "no boring issues". Queer as Folk is the primary vehicle for his social commentary of homosexuality and advocation of greater acceptance. He used the series to challenge the [...] "primal ... gut instinct" [...] of homophobia by introducing homosexual imagery {{in contrast to the}} heterosexual [...] "fundamental image of life, of family, of childhood, [...] of survival". His next series, Bob & Rose, examined the issue of a gay man who {{falls in love with a}} woman, and the reaction of the couple's respective social circles. Torchwood, in Davies' own words, is [...] "a very bisexual programme", and demonstrates a fluid approach to both gender and sexuality [...] "almost from its opening moments": for example, the lead character Captain Jack Harkness nonchalantly mentions he was once pregnant; and later, the other lead characters discuss Jack's sexuality. The gay website AfterElton opined that Torchwoods biggest breakthrough could be [...] "queer representation" [...] by showing Captain Jack as a character whose bisexuality is explored but not his only character trait.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{decided to}} change its name to Revocation in 2006; Davidson commented: [...] "I think, looking a <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> into it, we {{made a lot of}} {{mistakes}} with Cryptic Warning. We were younger and didn't really know what we were doing, so Revocation was us starting fresh with a clean slate and revoking our past mistakes." [...] With a direction change, Revocation promptly recorded a three-song demo titled Summon the Spawn, and in 2008 they went back into the studio to record their first full-length album, Empire of the Obscene. The full length was self-released, and the band financed its own tour, attracting the interest of several record labels. Revocation subsequently signed to Relapse Records.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2011 interview, Kelis {{said that}} her sixth studio album would be {{finished}} [...] "in the next few weeks". According to Kelis's management firm at the time, Three Six Zero Group, the album was to feature production from Skream, BURNS, Tom Neville, Dan Black, and Caspa. She said of the album, [...] "I've been on a real 1990s vibe with this record, it's kind of trip-hoppish [...] it's more electro, it's a <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> and darker". The Skream-produced single [...] "Distance" [...] received its UK radio premiere in mid 2012, although {{the rest of the}} material from these recording sessions remains unreleased. Kelis was featured on Dan Black's single [...] "Hearts" [...] and Skream's [...] "Copy Cat" [...] (both 2013), the latter of which led to a dispute after Kelis alleged that Skream refused to have her appear in the music video.|$|E
2500|$|Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle {{believed}} {{the film to}} be [...] "an odd picture, a rumination on depression and self-discovery that's couched as an office comedy." [...] Although Meyer said that the film is [...] "never truly funny or insightful," [...] she did give the picture some credit, stating that [...] "the movie works intermittently by digging a <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> than you might expect." [...] Meyer also approved of the performances of Allen, Belushi, and Warburton. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times likened the film to [...] "an afterschool special, with grownups cast in the kids' roles."

2500|$|The A.V.

[...] Even the Stars commented that [...] "the James faithful are split down the middle on Wah Wah. Those with a predilection for the big hit singles turn their nose up at it, but those who dig a <b>little</b> <b>deeper</b> know that it is the real James baring their artistic soul, opening up their creative process to outside scrutiny - raw, real and putting everything out on the line. It's a fascinating insight into the workings of the band egged on by one of the most inventive writers and producers of the generation - a completely unique record and typical of James' contrary approach at times." ...|$|E

[...] He, however, deemed the ensemble [...] "excellent." [...] The Star-Ledger writer Stephen Witty said that the film [...] "has a few good lines, and a fine cast." [...] He thought that Laurie was [...] "particularly good," [...] Keener amusing and Platt charming, but expected more of the film: [...] "You want something that plays a little sharper, and cuts a <b>little</b> <b>deeper.</b> You want something that demands more of its performers, and delivers more to its audience." [...] Similarly, New York Post Lou Lumenick wrote: [...] "While there are laughs, the farcical elements of The Oranges are not presented with sufficient discipline {{to live up to}} the full potential of its cast." [...] The Hollywood Reporter critic David Rooney praised members of the cast [...] "who manage to hit a sweet spot even in this mediocre material," [...] noting that the film [...] "runs out of juice" [...] when it becomes serious and that the film's [...] "cathartic moments feel fabricated" [...] and concluded that the cast [...] "deserves better." ...|$|E
