30|$|In this research, {{the dynamic}} motion {{simulation}} of human lifting was planned as an optimization-based problem with 100 variables. Total <b>lifting</b> <b>time</b> was divided in 10 evenly distributed sequences. The {{first and last}} sequences {{are designed to be}} coincided with starting and finishing <b>lifting</b> <b>time,</b> so the initial and final postures are optimized by the algorithm and there’s no need to pre define these postures anymore. The novel body collision avoidance algorithm inspired from body self-awareness ability of human was implemented successfully in optimal motion planning framework. The basic idea is based on the automatic selection of body models with the respect to the posture predicted by the algorithm. Later, the model will be implemented in calculation of the desired position of robot’s wrist where box would not collide with the body. The lifting motion was generated using four biologically meaningful objective functions to evaluate the performance of the collision avoidance algorithm for motions with different dynamics. Finally the stability index TMA was measured for all of the four simulation result to demonstrate the stability of predicted motions.|$|E

Then the kinematical and dynamical model of human body is employed as two main set of constraints using the mentioned input parameters. These two sets of constraints are responsible for checking the kinematic and dynamic consistency of the predicted movement. The designed objective functions are aimed to impose different dynamic on the predicted movement to check the efficiency of the collision avoidance algorithm under different dynamics.|$|E

40|$|Although {{acupuncture}} manipulation {{has been}} {{regarded as one of}} the important factors in clinical outcome, it has been difficult to train novice students to become skillful experts due to a lack of adequate educational program and tools. In the present study, we investigated whether newly developed phantom acupoint tools would be useful to practice-naïve acupuncture students for practicing the three different types of acupuncture manipulation to enhance their skills. We recruited 12 novice students and had them practice acupuncture manipulations on the phantom acupoint (5 % agarose gel). We used the Acusensor 2 and compared their acupuncture manipulation techniques, for which the target criteria were depth and time factors, at acupoint LI 11 in the human body before and after 10 training sessions. The outcomes were depth of needle insertion, depth error from target criterion, time of rotating, lifting, and thrusting, time error from target criteria and the time ratio. After 10 training sessions, the students showed significantly improved outcomes in depth of needle, depth error (rotation, reducing lifting/thrusting), thumb-forward time error, thumb-backward time error (rotation), and <b>lifting</b> <b>time</b> (reinforcing lifting/thrusting).

Within the establishment of set, different weight cues v;ere used to influence the strength of the set developed. Objects were coded with weight cues of size or numerical labels and were colored either red, green, or white.

These effects have mainly been attributed to their antioxidative properties. One of the most common flavonoids in food plants is quercetin, of which yellow onion (Allium cepa L.) is one of our main dietary sources. The effects of cultivars, nitrogen fertiliser level, <b>lifting</b> <b>time,</b> curing, cultivation system and storage conditions on the quercetin content in yellow onion are investigated in this thesis. Analyses were performed using reversed-phase HPLC after extraction of raw onion samples in ethanol. The main determinant of quercetin level was found to be the amount of global solar radiation during the end of the bulbing phase in August. Annual variations in quercetin content were higher than any treatment effect within each year. Cultivar differences in quercetin levels were significant but inconsistent. Early lifting, when 50 % of the onions had fallen leaves, resulted in onions with better keeping quality and equal quercetin content compared with onions with later lifting times. Minimised split application of nitrogen fertilisers reduced the risk of mineral nutrient leaching without lowering the yield or quercetin content. Field curing generally resulted in significant increases in quercetin content compared with levels at lifting. The role of onion size for quercetin content was inconsistent but of minor importance. Quercetin levels were stable during cold storage at constant temperature. No {{significant differences were found between}} inorganically fertilised and organically fertilised onions of the same cultivar or between directly sown and transplanted onions.

40|$|Abstract. Normal saline is {{the most}} popular agent used during {{endoscopic}} submucosal injection. However, endosco-pists have never identified an optimal submucosal injection solution, which is not only safe and cost-effective but has a unique lifting ability with endoscopic submucosal cushion and causes less tissue damage. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and microscopic characteristics of a blood solution, including whole blood and plasma solution, as a submucosal cushioning agent, compared with normal saline. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) procedures in pig stomachs were performed by injecting plasma solution (n= 4) and normal saline (n= 4). A total of 38 patients with gastroin-testinal neoplasms underwent endoscopic musocal resection (EMR) procedures. Of 38 EMRs, 7 used whole blood injec-tion, and 31 of 38 acting as the control group used normal saline. A tissue damage scoring system was developed based on injection-induced hydrops and tears for the evaluation of tissue damage. In animal experiments, the <b>lifting</b> <b>time</b> of the injection with normal saline in the pig colon was shorter than that of the group with plasma solution (18. 25 ± 5. 44 min vs. 6. 5 ± 2. 38 min, P= 0. 007). In animal experiments with ESD procedures in the stomach, the hydrops in the normal saline injection group were more extensive than those in the group with plasma (P= 0. 011). The degree of tearing in the group with normal saline was observed to be less than that in the group with plasma (P= 0. 008). In patients with EMR, using the histological scoring method, it was determined that the degree of hydrops in the group with normal saline injection was more extensive than that in the group with whole blood (P< 0. 001). The effective submucosal tearing in the group with normal saline was less than that in the group with blood (P< 0. 001).

Behavioural indices of acute nociception were monitored in the conscious rat following subplantar injection of adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP), α,β-methylene ATP, adenosine 5 ′-diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine. Signs of overt nociception, i. e. hindpaw lifting and licking, were apparent in animals injected subplantar with the P 2 X receptor agonist, α,β-methylene ATP. Nociceptive behaviours continued for 15 [*]min following administration of α,β-methylene ATP (200 [*]nmol) and were dose-related (0 – 5 [*]min hindpaw lifting times after injection of α,β-methylene ATP 100 [*]nmol and 1000 [*]nmol were 89 ± 26 [*]s and 232 ± 11 [*]s, respectively). Subplantar ATP evoked a modest response only at the highest dose tested (1000 [*]nmol; 0 – 5 [*]min hindpaw <b>lifting</b> <b>time</b> 66 ± 19 [*]s) whilst ADP or adenosine (both 600 [*]nmol) elicited negligible spontaneous nociceptive activity. Morphine (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) abolished hindpaw licking behaviour induced by subplantar injection of either α,β-methylene ATP (600 [*]nmol) or bradykinin (1 [*]nmol) and substantially reduced (88 ± 5 %) paw licking in formalin (0. 5 %, 0. 1 [*]ml) injected animals. In contrast, hindpaw lifting was only modestly inhibited (34 ± 11 %) in morphine-pretreated animals that had received subplantar bradykinin and was unaffected in rats in which the noxious stimulus was either subplantar α,β-methylene ATP or formalin. Pretreatment of hindpaws with subplantar bupivacaine (1 % w/v, 0. 1 [*]ml) abolished α,β-methylene ATP-evoked nociceptive behaviours. Hindpaw lifting and licking mediated by α,β-methylene ATP (600 [*]nmol, subplantar) were inhibited (72 ± 15 % and 95 ± 5 %, respectively) by 30 [*]min local pretreatment with 600 [*]nmol α,β-methylene ATP. Subplantar α,β-methylene ATP pretreatment did not inhibit behaviour stimulated by subsequent bradykinin (1 [*]nmol) or formalin (0. 5 %, 0. 1 [*]ml) injection into the hindpaw. Desensitization of small diameter sensory neurones with a single subplantar injection of capsaicin (100 [*]μg) abolished all behaviours indicative of spontaneous nociceptive sensation in animals subsequently injected with α,β-methylene ATP (600 [*]nmol), bradykinin (1 [*]nmol) or formalin (0. 5 %, 0. 1 [*]ml).

In studies of volitional inhibition, successful task performance usually requires {{the prevention of}} all movement. In reality, movements are selectively prevented {{in the presence of}} global motor output. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the ability to prevent one movement while concurrently executing another, referred to as selective inhibition. In two experiments, participants released switches with either their index and middle fingers (unimanual) or their left and right index fingers (bimanual) to stop two moving indicators at a fixed target (Go trials). Stop trials occurred when either one or both indicators automatically stopped before reaching the target, signaling that prevention of the prepared movement was required. Stop All and selective Stop trials were randomly interspersed among more frequently occurring Go trials. We found that selective inhibition is harder to perform than nonselective inhibition, for both unimanual and bimanual task contexts. During selective inhibition trials, <b>lift</b> <b>time</b> of the responding digit was delayed in both experiments by <= 100 ms, demonstrating the generality of the result. A nonselective neural inhibitory pathway may temporarily "brake" the required response, followed by selective excitation of the to-be-moved digit's cortical representation.
