Christopher Schneider, a sociologist from the University of British Columbia says {{that there is not}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> to support that theory.

500|$|When {{co-owner}} Smith died in July 1950, O'Malley {{convinced his}} widow {{to turn over}} control of the shares to the Brooklyn Trust Company, which O'Malley controlled as chief legal counsel. Rickey's contract as general manager was set to expire on October 28, 1950. Rickey's Dodgers stock was held on margin and he had fully levered life insurance policy. O'Malley lowballed Rickey with an offer of $346,000 (the purchase price). Rickey demanded $1 million ($ today). O'Malley eventually pursued a complicated buyout of Rickey, who had received an outside offer from William Zeckendorf of $1million for his interests. [...] There were varying accounts about the sincerity of the offer because Zeckendorf and Pittsburgh Pirates owner John Galbreath were fraternity brothers, but there is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that he had a sincere interest in acquiring the team. The outside offer triggered a clause in the partnership agreement whereby the asking price of a [...] had to be matched if a current owner wanted to retain control and the third party would be compensated $50,000. The canceled $50,000 check would later include Rickey's signature showing that Zeckendorf turned over the $50,000 to Rickey.|$|E

Moreover, the Court found [...] "that Serbia has not committed genocide" [...] nor [...] "conspired to" [...] or [...] "incited the commission of genocide". It did however, find that Serbia had failed [...] "to take all measures within its power to prevent genocide in Srebrenica" [...] and to comply fully with the ICTY by failing to transfer Ratko Mladić to the custody of the ICTY in the Hague and that Serbia must in future transfer to the Hague all ICTY-indicted individuals, who reside under Serbian jurisdiction.|$|E

40|$|Deflation {{is often}} {{associated}} with poor macroeconomic performance. We demonstrate that one possible explanation for this is menu costs, which imply that firms are more reluctant to reduce prices than raise them, due to asymmetries in the profit function. As a result, deflation would be characterised by prices that are “too high, ” and output that is therefore “too low. ” We test the implications of menu cost models using a rich set of microeconomic prices that covers both inflationary and deflationary periods for Hong Kong using simple, robust statistical methods. While we find <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> asymmetry in price setting behaviour, this is generally inconsistent with the predictions of menu costs...|$|R
40|$|The most {{socially}} significant {{cardiovascular diseases}} are recently considered {{from the standpoint}} of "cardiovascular continuum". Changes in neurohumoral factors especially activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) {{play a key role in}} the pathogenesis of the cardiovascular continuum. The first drugs that block RAAS were ACE inhibitors. Lisinopril deserves special attention among the ACE inhibitors. Lisinopril — one of the most known and well-studied drugs in this group with proven organoprotective properties. This allows its use in various clinical situations. Lisinopril is used for hypertension treatment long ago and there are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> its high antihypertensive efficacy currently.

This mixed population remained as it was, until 1609 to 1614 where the Spanish government forced Moriscos to leave the kingdom of Spain after the marriage of the queen of Castille, Isabel, and the King of Aragon, Ferdinand. The town then lost most of its population, but remained constant for the following years.|$|R
40|$|Anterior {{pituitary}} cells produce {{growth factors}} plus cytokines and their receptors. Although {{some of these}} pituitary growth factors and cytokines {{are known to be}} involved in the control of cell differentiation, proliferation and hormone production in the pituitary gland, their physiological roles remain unknown. <b>Lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> indicates that they are involved in the regulation of prolactin-secreting mammotroph cell proliferation. The regulation of mammotroph functions is a suitable system for understanding the intrapituitary regulatory system operated by growth factors and cytokines, since mammotrophs are the most actively proliferating cells in female pituitary glands.
