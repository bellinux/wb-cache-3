40|$|At {{its title}} indicates, {{the purpose of}} this article is to {{determine}} what the significance of the preamble of the British North America Act is; that is to say, what influence the preamble of the B. N. A. Act can have in the interpretation of that law. In the first part of this article, Mr. Sormany discusses the fundamental points necessary for the study of the subject, i. e., the formal nature of the preamble of the B. N. A. Act, the analysis of its text, and the interpretation given it by the courts... In the second part, he discusses the focal point of his paper — the constitutional importance of the preamble of the B. N. A. Act. More precisely, Mr. Sormany considers that the preamble of the B. N. A. Act can only have an importance that is essentially interpretation in nature. This is derived from the fact that it is no more than the preamble of a law and that, because of that, its significance is limited. Then the analysis of the text of the preamble of the B. N. A. Act makes it possible to determine the exact significance of each of its four paragraphs, and to decide which of these are susceptible of having some significance. For example, in the course of this analysis the author explains that the part of the preamble of the B. N. A. Act which mentions the Constitution of the United Kingdom implies that the Constitution of Canada incorporates the principle of the supremacy of parliamentary law, that is, a fusion of the sovereignty of parliament and of the Rule of Law. Mr. Sormany also explains why, according to him, certain parts of the preamble of the B. N. A. Act, such as the third and fourth paragraphs, are not of constitutional significance. Finally, the author completes this first section with a review of the jurisprudence relative to the preamble of the B. N. A. Act. The purpose of this review is to indicate in which cases and in what fashion the preamble of the B. N. A. Act has been invoked. Therefore, this review is not an analysis of this body of jurisprudence. The analysis of the most important cases appears in section 2. Nevertheless, this review permits one to determine that the preamble of the B. N. A. Act was not invoked only as an affirmation of certain civil liberties (Reference re Alberta Statutes,Saumur, Switzman, Hess, etc...) but also, for example, as a reference to the principle of parliamentary supremacy (Persons' Case), and as a recognition of the status and powers of the Lieutenant-governor (In re TheInitiative and Referendum Act). At the start of the second section, Mr. Sormany focuses on the parts of the preamble, which are susceptible of having constitutional significance in the light of his discussions in section 1. According to him, three points emerge from the preamble of the B. N. A. Act, and each of them is the subject of a sub-section. In the first sub-section, the author demonstrates that if one can perceive a reference to the theory of the pact, or to the Quebec and <b>London</b> <b>Resolutions,</b> in the preamble, then in none of its aspects can the preamble have a significance at the juridical level. On the other hand, in the second sub-section, Mr. Sormany concludes that, in spite of its apparent ambiguity, the part of the preamble which refers to the Constitution of the United Kingdom has a very important constitutional significance because it constitutes the only affirmation in the B. N. A. Act of one of its basic principles which is the principle of the supremacy of Parliamentary law. The author analyses why case law has given an entirely different significance to this part of the preamble, finding in it either an affirmation of certain civil liberties, the recognition of the status and of the powers of the Lieutenant-governor, or again, a reference to the principle of Ministerial responsibility and the independence of the courts. Finally, in the third sub-section, Mr. Sormany demonstrates that the preamble of the B. N. A. Act does not possess any constitutional significance in so far as the affirmation of the principle of federalism is concerned. This conclusion is based on the fact that the intent of the B. N. A. Act is sufficiently clear in that question and that the preamble does not add anyting in this respect. This study is thus an exhaustive analysis of the constitutional significance of the preamble of the B. N. A. Act, and it is on this basis that its originality is founded. In effect, although it is a question of a part of the B. N. A. Act which is susceptible of having some influence on constitutional law, and in spite of the declaration of principles which it makes, to date, the preamble of the B. N. A. Act has never itself been the subject of specific analysis...|$|E

Creeke used his skills to draw up a map of the vast Branksome Estate, hundreds of acres in extent, which proved useful in sorting out the wrangles over the various mortgages and charges at the estate. As a result of Creeke's work, the estate was soon up for sale and attracted some significant purchasers, such as the Talbot sisters and Charles William Packe.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{their earlier}} {{willingness}} to accept Kenyon as the Labour representative, the executive committee of the national Labour party at a meeting at their Victoria Street headquarters in <b>London</b> passed a <b>resolution</b> on 12 August 1913 repudiating Kenyon as an official Labour candidate {{on the grounds that}} he was not conducting his campaign in accordance with the Labour Party constitution. This decision caused some disquiet to Labour supporters of Kenyon in the constituency as it now seemed distinctly possible that an official Labour candidate would be put up. They were right to be concerned because on 14 August, just two days before close of nominations, a meeting of trade unionists and socialists in Chesterfield voted to put up John Scurr, Chairman of the London District Committee, Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union to be Labour and Socialist candidate at the by-election. Scurr had fought a Parliamentary election as a socialist before, at South West Bethnal Green in 1911 where he came bottom of the poll by a long margin. He was to contest the same seat again in 1914 and he also fought at Ipswich in 1914. Scurr later became an Alderman on Poplar Borough Council and was imprisoned in the controversial rates case there in the 1920s. He later won a seat on the London County Council and became Labour MP for Mile End.|$|R
5000|$|In 1898 a third {{division}} of Christadelphians occurred, this time over “resurrectional responsibility”. Since Christadelphians teach a bodily resurrection and judgment at {{the return of}} Jesus Christ to earth, the controversy was over who would be resurrected and called to judgment. At question was whether or not persons who knew the word of God but were not baptised would be judged and condemned for rejecting the “Truth”, subsequently called in Unamended literature “enlightened rejectors”. Although the exact phrase was not used in Britain, the Sydney Australia ecclesia had already excommunicated [...] "ten who {{are not able to}} see that unbaptised and knowing rejectors of the truth are responsible" [...] in 1884. And this action had been defended by the editor Robert Roberts. Nevertheless, the Birmingham Central Ecclesia did not immediately add this to their statement of faith, though some ecclesias did so. The statement of the North London ecclesia in 1887 read [...] "Resurrection affects those only who are responsible to God by a knowledge of His revealed will". In 1894 J.J. Andrew of North London published a booklet 'Blood of the Covenant' in which he argued that no unbaptised would be raised and judged. On April 3 and 5, 1894 a debate was held on [...] "Resurrectional Responsibility" [...] between Roberts and Andrew, and on April 15 Islington Temperance Hall ecclesia, <b>London,</b> passed as <b>resolution</b> to separate from Barnsbury Hall ecclesia, London. The controversy continued 1894-1898. Roberts was absent from the UK in 1897 and died in 1898 in San Francisco, so opposition to J.J. Andrew was left to A.T. Jannaway and Frank Jannaway at London Clapham, and Charles Curwen Walker, the deputy editor in Birmingham.|$|R
6000|$|I ask {{permission}} {{to introduce a}} Bill {{for the establishment of}} a national system of Labour Exchanges. There is high authority for this proposal. The Majority and Minority representatives of the Poor Law Commission, differing in so much else, are agreed unanimously in its support.

[...] "This National Labour Exchange," [...] says the Minority Report, [...] "though in itself no adequate remedy, is the foundation of all our proposals. It is, in our view, an indispensable condition of any real reform." [...] The National Conference of Trade Union Delegates, convened by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, of March 19, 1909, resolved unanimously: [...] "That this Conference of Trade Union delegates, representing 1,400,000 members, approves of the establishment of Labour Exchanges on a national basis, under the control of the Board of Trade, provided that the managing board contains at least an equal proportion of employers and representatives of Trade Unions." [...] The Central Unemployed Body for <b>London,</b> by a <b>Resolution</b> in June 1908, declared in favour of a national system of Labour Exchanges. Economists as divergent in opinion as Professor Ashley, of Birmingham, and Professor Chapman, of Manchester, have all approved and urged the project publicly in the strongest terms. Several of the principal members of the late Government have, either in evidence before the Poor Law Commission or in public speeches, expressed themselves in favour of Labour Exchanges, and the Report of the delegates of the Labour Party to Germany strongly approves of the system which they found there, namely: [...] "the co-ordination and systematic management of Public Labour Exchanges." ...|$|R
