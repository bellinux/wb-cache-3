6000|$|... "I’m sure he would," [...] said Fraser. [...] "I suppose there’s {{no chance}} of his having been picked up. I slung a <b>life-belt</b> overboard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He’s gone," [...] he spluttered; [...] "there ain’t {{a sign of}} ’im about, and the <b>life-belt</b> wot {{hangs on}} the galley ’as gone too. Wot am I to do?" ...|$|E
60|$|Francis, who {{had been}} {{watching}} Shopland come to the surface, shrugged his shoulders. He delayed answering for a moment while he watched the detective, disdaining the <b>life-belt,</b> swim to the opposite shore.|$|E
60|$|We hurriedly {{put on our}} <b>life-belts,</b> regretting {{the absence}} of an {{experienced}} maid.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bow, you're {{feathering}} under water,' she exclaimed, {{when the}} unfortunate Ustâni disappeared in a lasher, where we, {{thanks to our}} <b>life-belts,</b> floated gaily enough.|$|R
6000|$|He marked each [...] "belted cruiser" [...] fine, [...] Her poddy <b>life-belts</b> {{floating}} [...] In tether {{where the}} hungry brine [...] Impinged upon her coating.|$|R
60|$|The mate, {{following}} his outstretched arm, saw it too, {{and picking up}} a boat-hook stood ready, and they were soon close enough to distinguish {{the body of a}} man supported by a <b>life-belt.</b>|$|E
60|$|I let {{the others}} go down first, {{and when they}} came up I went in, tied the <b>life-belt</b> round me, and put on my oilskin. I fetched out a bottle of hollands from my locker, and then came out and {{fastened}} the hatch.|$|E
60|$|The two men {{suddenly}} stepped forward. Shopland made no protest, attempted no struggle. They {{lifted him}} off his feet {{as though he were}} a baby, and a moment later there was a splash in the water. They threw a <b>life-belt</b> after him.|$|E
60|$|The missionary {{gave his}} {{daughter}} his arm, {{and led her}} away, while Guy, pushing through the crowd, soon stood beside the lifeboat, the crew of which, already encased in their cork <b>life-belts,</b> were hastily taking their places.|$|R
60|$|The {{crew of the}} {{lifeboat}} being now much exhausted, were obliged {{to give up their}} oars and <b>life-belts</b> to fresh men, who volunteered for the service in scores. Nothing, however, would persuade John Furby to resign his position, although he was nearly worn out with fatigue and exposure.|$|R
6000|$|Of the {{subsequent}} {{fate of the}} Bonnyclabber, I {{can only say that}} the log-book from which I have quoted was found some years later in the stomach of a whale, along with some shreds of clothing, a few buttons and several decayed <b>life-belts.</b> It contained only one new entry, in a straggling handwriting, {{as if it had been}} penned in the dark: ...|$|R
60|$|The sack went overboard, and, at {{the same}} moment, the mate left the wheel with an ear-splitting yell and rushed to the galley for the <b>life-belt</b> which hung there. He crashed heavily into Joe, who had rushed on deck, but, without pausing, ran {{to the side and}} flung it overboard.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} strong hopes {{that he may}} have got picked up," [...] said Fraser, cheerfully; [...] "very strong hopes, I threw him a <b>life-belt,</b> and though we got the boat out and pulled about, we couldn’t find either of them. I shouldn’t be at all {{surprised}} if he has been picked up by some vessel outward bound. Stranger things have happened." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Wondershoot, {{when she}} heard that this amazing child had {{positively}} burst out of its beautiful charity clothes, decided that she must speak to Caddles herself. He appeared in her presence with his hair hastily wetted and smoothed by hand, breathless, and clinging to his hat brim {{as though it was}} a <b>life-belt,</b> and he stumbled at the carpet edge out of sheer distress of mind.|$|E
50|$|The event dogged the {{division}} afterwards with a poor reputation until 29 September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, when it re-established its {{name at the}} Battle of St. Quentin Canal where, utilising <b>life-belts</b> and collapsible boats, it crossed the formidable obstacle of the canal and used scaling ladders to surmount the steep gradient of the opposite bank and captured multiple fortified machine-gun posts.|$|R
60|$|He ran as {{he spoke}} to the spot where the {{lifeboat}} lay ready under the shelter of the pier, but Jo was on board before him. Almost simultaneously did a dozen strong and fearless men leap into the noble craft and don their cork <b>life-belts.</b> A few seconds sufficed. Every man knew well his place and his duty. The short, powerful oars were shipped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] {{continued}} Guy, [...] "there {{is another}} subject which {{occurs to me}} just now, although it does not come under the head of charities. I wish to supply a ship's lifeboat to every vessel that belongs to us, {{and a set of}} <b>life-belts,</b> besides other things. I estimate that this will require a sum of nearly two thousand pounds. Let me see--" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} {{one of the}} men raised an oar, which was blown round by a sudden blast, and its end struck another of the crew on the temple, {{rendering}} him almost insensible. He had to be put out at once, and another volunteer was called for. Like a flash of light, our youthful seaman again vaulted into the boat. His services were now accepted, and a cork <b>life-belt</b> was given to him, which he quickly put on.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{stood there}} for a moment 'arf dazed, looking down at the water. Then I pulled down a <b>life-belt</b> from the wall 'ere and threw it in, and, arter another moment's thought, ran back to the <i>Lizzie and Annie,</i> wot was in the inside berth, and gave them a hail. I've always 'ad a good voice, and in a flash the skipper and Ted Sawyer came {{tumbling}} up out of the cabin and the 'ands out of the fo'c'sle.|$|E
60|$|The mate {{disappeared}} again. This {{time he was}} out {{of sight}} longer than usual, and when he came up merely tossed his arms weakly and went down again. There was a scream from the women, and a mighty splash as the skipper went overboard with a <b>life-belt.</b> The mate's head, black and shining, showed for a moment; the skipper grabbed him by the hair and towed him to the barge's side, {{and in the midst of}} a considerable hubbub both men were drawn from the water.|$|E
60|$|It {{was during}} the {{formation}} of this raft that the great value of the <b>life-belts</b> became manifest. While the spars were in a loose and half-fastened state, the men were obliged {{to work in the}} water. To have done this without the support of the belts would have been very exhausting, almost impossible; but with their floating power the men could work with both hands, and move about almost as freely in the water as on land.|$|R
60|$|I {{shall never}} forget the ashy faces of the {{passengers}} as they stampeded for their <b>life-belts,</b> {{though there was no}} panic. Nobs rose with a low growl. I rose, also, and over the ship's side, I saw not two hundred yards distant the periscope of a submarine, while racing toward the liner the wake of a torpedo was distinctly visible. We were aboard an American ship--which, of course, was not armed. We were entirely defenseless; yet without warning, we were being torpedoed.|$|R
6000|$|... "A little British destroyer, her midships rent {{by a great}} shell {{meant for}} a battle-cruiser; exuding steam from every pore; able to go ahead but not to steer; unable {{to get out of}} anybody's way, likely to be rammed by any one of a dozen ships; her syren whimpering: 'Let me through! Make way!'; her crew fallen in aft dressed in <b>life-belts</b> ready for her final plunge, and cheering wildly as it might have been an {{enthusiastic}} crowd when the King passes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Transport on Water.--Parcels.--The swimmer's {{valuables}} {{may as well}} be put {{inside the}} empty vessel that acts as his float, as in the turban on his head (see [...] "Floats"). A goat-skin is often filled half full of the things he wants to carry, and is then blown out and its mouth secured. A very good <b>life-belt</b> may be bought, which admits of this arrangement: it has a large opening at one end, which is closed by a brass door that shuts like the top of an inkstand, and is then quite air-tight.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{rose to the}} surface," [...] he said, slowly [...] "and saw {{the ship}} drawing away in the {{darkness}} and heard the cries on board, I swam as strongly as I could towards it. I was weighed down by my clothes, and I had also struck my head going overboard, and I felt that every moment was my last, when I suddenly bumped up against the <b>life-belt.</b> I had just strength to put that on and give one faint hail, and then I think for a time I lost my senses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hire some passengers, hire a submarine--that's {{the only}} difficulty, I guess. Governments {{are apt to}} be a bit hidebound over their engines of war. They won't sell to the firstcomer. Still, I guess that can be got over. Ever heard of the word 'graft,' sir? Well, graft gets there every time! I reckon that we shan't really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it ought to be enough for an {{innocent}} young girl like Jane. By the time she's got a <b>life-belt</b> on her, and is being hustled into a boat, with a well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on deck, why--she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915. How's that for the bare outline?" ...|$|E
60|$|To an ignorant {{observer}} {{it might}} have seemed that all hope was gone-- that every man must perish. But this was not so. The buoyant qualities of the magnificent lifeboat {{brought it to the}} surface like a cork the instant it was freed. Its self-righting qualities turned it on its keel. The self-acting discharging tubes emptied it in less than two minutes; and the crew, supported by their cork <b>life-belts,</b> caught the life-lines festooned round the boat's side for this very purpose, and clambered into her.|$|R
60|$|In the end, {{the boat}} was ordered and paid for, and sent to Edinburgh to be exhibited. It was drawn by six {{magnificent}} horses through the principal streets of the city, with a real lifeboat crew on board, in their sou'westers and cork <b>life-belts.</b> Then it was launched in Saint Margaret's Loch, {{at the foot of}} Arthur's Seat, where it was upset--with great difficulty, by means of a large erection with blocks and ropes--in order to show its self-righting and self-emptying qualities to the thousands of spectators who crowded the hill-sides.|$|R
60|$|It was found, however, {{when they}} had taken their places and seized the oars, {{that two of the}} crew were missing. Volunteers were {{instantly}} called for, and Jeff, with his friend David Bowers, answered to the call. They put on the cork <b>life-belts,</b> took the vacant seats, and grasped the oars. Then the transporting carriage, with the boat and crew on it, was pushed by many willing hands as far into the sea as possible, the men bending forward with the oars out, ready to pull at a moment's notice.|$|R
60|$|And then I let my eyes drop {{once more}} to the face upon the water, and what I saw nearly tumbled me {{backward}} into the sea, for the eyes in the dead face had opened; the lips had parted; and one hand was raised toward me in a mute appeal for succor. She lived! She was not dead! I leaned over the boat's side and drew her quickly in to the comparative safety which God had given me. I removed her <b>life-belt</b> and my soggy coat and made a pillow for her head. I chafed her hands and arms and feet. I worked over her for an hour, and at last I was rewarded by a deep sigh, and again those great eyes opened and looked into mine.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{confused}} {{rush to the}} upper deck, and everybody flung something over the ship's side--a <b>life-belt,</b> a chicken-coop, a coil of rope, a spar, an old sail, a pocket handkerchief, an iron crowbar--any movable article which it was thought might be useful to a drowning man who had followed the vessel during the hour that had elapsed since the initial alarm at the mast-head. In a few moments the ship was pretty nearly dismantled of everything that could be easily renounced, and some excitable passenger having cut away the boats {{there was nothing more}} that we could do, though the chaplain explained that if the ill-fated gentleman in the wet did not turn up after a while it was his intention to stand at the stern and read the burial service of the Church of England.|$|E
60|$|It did {{not take}} me long to clamber over its side and drag Nobs in to {{comparative}} safety, and then I glanced around upon the scene of death and desolation which surrounded us. The sea was littered with wreckage among which floated the pitiful forms of women and children, buoyed up by their useless lifebelts. Some were torn and mangled; others lay rolling quietly to {{the motion of the}} sea, their countenances composed and peaceful; others were set in hideous lines of agony or horror. Close to the boat's side floated the figure of a girl. Her face was turned upward, held above the surface by her <b>life-belt,</b> and was framed in a floating mass of dark and waving hair. She was very beautiful. I had never looked upon such perfect features, such a divine molding which was at the same time human--intensely human. It was a face filled with character and strength and femininity--the face of one who was created to love and to be loved. The cheeks were flushed to the hue of life and health and vitality, and yet she lay there upon the bosom of the sea, dead. I felt something rise in my throat as I looked down upon that radiant vision, and I swore that I should live to avenge her murder.|$|E
60|$|The {{work was}} nobly done! John Furby, the coxswain, with a sturdy crew of volunteers--twelve in all--were ready for action, with cork <b>life-belts</b> and oilskin coats on, {{when the team}} of four stout horses came tearing along the sands {{dragging}} the lifeboat after them, assisted and cheered on by a large crowd of men and boys. No unnecessary delay occurred. Opposite the first wreck, the carriage was wheeled round, so that {{the bow of the}} boat pointed to the sea. The crew sprang into their seats, and, shipping the oars, sat ready and resolute.|$|R
6000|$|To-day {{it is all}} {{of sixty}} years since I began to smoke the limit. I have never bought cigars with <b>life-belts</b> around them. I early found that those were too {{expensive}} for me: I have always bought cheap cigars--reasonably cheap, at any rate. Sixty years ago they cost me four dollars a barrel, but my taste has improved, latterly, and I pay seven, now. Six or seven. Seven, I think. Yes; it's seven. But that includes the barrel. I often have smoking-parties at my house; but the people that come have always just taken the pledge. I wonder why that is? ...|$|R
60|$|The scissors, and skates, and {{the soap}} we {{procured}} at the Church and State stores,[11] but not, of course, the revolvers. The revolvers we got of the genuine Government pattern, because both Leonora and I are dreadfully afraid of fire-arms, {{and we knew}} that these, anyhow, would not 'go off.' The jam we got, of course, at the official cartridge emporium, same which we did not shoot the Arabs. The Gladstone bag and the Bryant & May's matches we procured direct from the makers, resisting the piteous appeals of itinerant vendors. Some <b>life-belts</b> we laid in, and, as will presently be seen, we could have made no more judicious purchase.|$|R
