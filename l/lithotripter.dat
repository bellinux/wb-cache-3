40|$|PURPOSE: Clinical studies produce {{conflicting}} {{results on}} pain relief for shock wave lithotripsy (SWL). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids in pain relief for SWL powered by an electromagnetic generator. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed and all randomized controlled trials comparing NSAIDs and opioids in pain relief for SWL using modern electromagnetic <b>lithotripters</b> {{were included in}} the analysis. Data from 3 trials (244 patients) were pooled. The primary outcome measure was adequate analgesia, defined as "if no additional pain relief was used".

40|$|BACKGROUND Extracorporeal {{shock wave}} {{lithotripsy}} (ESWL) {{is well known}} for its non-invasiveness, effectiveness and minimal morbidity for the management of renal stones. Some generation of <b>lithotripters</b> were associated with significant pain, needing anaesthesia. In modern <b>lithotripters,</b> pain is insignificant making lithotripsy an outpatient procedure (day care). AIMS The present study is aimed to compare the clinical efficacy between four drugs. METHODS AND MATERIALS This was a prospective study of 1000 patients with normal BMI (25 - 30) who underwent ESWL in the Year 2012 - 15 at our institute. All the patients with renal stones were randomly divided into 4 groups. Dornier Compact Sigma lithotripsy machine was used in all the patients. Group A was given IM diclofenac sodium (1 mg/kg), 60 minutes before the procedure. In group B, 10 g of EMLA cream; and in group C, 15 g of diclofenac diethylamine gel; in group D placebo (electrode gel) was applied locally. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the severity of pain for initial 5 - 10 minutes and after the procedure. A P value of less than 0. 05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was done using one way ANOVA and results were compared between four groups. RESULTS All four groups were having comparable age, weight, stone size, number of shock waves delivered and maximum voltage used. In group A total 250 patients (M/F: 177 / 73), group B 250 patients (M/F: 129 / 121), group C 250 patients (M/F: 158 / 92), group D 250 patients (M/F: 162 / 88).

30|$|During ESWL, {{shock waves}} {{generated}} outside the body cross through the soft tissues without loss {{of strength and}} cause disintegration of urinary stones into smaller portions through direct shearing force, erosion or cavitation. With the increasing availability of newer and improved <b>lithotripters,</b> the patient tolerance and efficacy of the procedure have increased; therefore, ESWL is usually performed in an outpatient setting without general anaesthesia and can be repeated as necessary. Routine pre-treatment stenting has now been abandoned because it contributes minimally to the prophylaxis of complications and may reduce the stone-free rate (SFR). ESWL achieves a 78 – 82  % overall success rate (SFR at 3  months) with a significant (45 – 53  %) proportion of repeated treatments and 8.4 – 11  % need for auxiliary procedures [4, 9 – 14].|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Determine the {{influence}} of passage through the body wall on the properties of <b>lithotripter</b> shock waves (SWs) and {{the characteristics of the}} acoustic field of an electromagnetic <b>lithotripter.</b> METHODS: Full-thickness ex vivo segments of pig abdominal wall were secured against the acoustic window of a test tank coupled to the <b>lithotripter.</b> A fiber-optic probe hydrophone was used to measure SW pressures, determine shock rise time, and map the acoustic field in the focal plane. RESULTS: Peak positive pressure on axis was attenuated roughly proportional to tissue thickness-approximately 6 % per cm. Irregularities in the tissue path affected the symmetry of SW focusing, shifting the maximum peak positive pressure laterally by as much as ∼ 2 [*]mm. Within the time resolution of the hydrophone (7 - 15 ns), shock rise time was unchanged, measuring ∼ 17 - 21 ns with and without tissue present. Mapping of the field showed no effect of the body wall on focal width, regardless of thickness of the body wall. CONCLUSIONS: Passage through the body wall has minimal effect on the characteristics of <b>lithotripter</b> SWs. Other than reducing pulse amplitude and having the potential to affect the symmetry of the focused wave, the body wall has little influence on the acoustic field. These findings help to validate laboratory assessment of <b>lithotripter</b> acoustic field and suggest that the properties of SWs in the body are much the same as have been measured in vitro...|$|E

Immediately after nephrectomy, the kidneys were perfused with cold HTK solution and kept in hypothermia (8 degrees C) for a maximum of 4 hours. In five cases, the tumor-free parenchyma was treated at the upper or lower renal pole with 2000 shocks, energy output 21 kV, in an experimental electromagnetic shockwave system (Siemens Co., Erlangen).

Changes after treatment with the electromagnetic system were found mainly in the tubules and midsized blood vessels in a well-defined focal area. Treatment with the electrohydraulic system was followed by tubular and glomerular lesions combined with vessel defects in a patchy pattern.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the ultrastructural {{features of the}} urinary stonesremoved with endoscopic stone surgery, using micro computed tomography(micro-CT). Materials and Methods: Patients who had endoscopic surgery for renalor ureteral stones removal were included in this study. After surgery, thestones were classified into three groups and investigated with Skyscan 1174 micro-CT. Group I underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) withultrasonic lithotripsy; group II had ureteroscopic stone surgery (USS) withpneumatic lithotripsy; and group III (the control group) had stone removalwith USS or PNL without lithotripsy. Stone homogeneity, voids, and theinternal structure of the stones were evaluated. Chi-square test was used to{{evaluate the}} difference statistically. P values less than. 05 were consideredstatistically significant. Results: A total of 24 “calcium oxalate monohydrate” stones from 24 patients were scanned with micro-CT. Stones treated with ultrasoniclithotripsy (group I) were more fragile, fragmented, and cracked than thosetreated with the pneumatic lithotripsy (group II; P =. 01). Stones in groupII were more homogeneous and smooth than those in group I and resembled those of the control group (P =. 02). Homogeneous, non-fragile stones andheterogeneous, fragile calculi were seen in all groups. Conclusion: The stone fragility could be confirmed by micro-CTinvestigation.
