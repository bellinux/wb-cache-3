40|$|The {{development}} of two hexagonal solar cell process sequences, a <b>laserscribing</b> process technique for scribing hexagonal and modified hexagonal solar cells, a large through-put diffusion process, and two surface macrostructure processes suitable for large scale production is reported. Experimental analysis {{was made on}} automated spin-on anti-reflective coating equipment and high pressure wafer cleaning equipment. Six hexagonal solar cell modules were fabricated. Also covered is a detailed theoretical analysis on the optimum silicon utilization by modified hexagonal solar cells...|$|E
