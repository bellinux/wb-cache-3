5000|$|No {{intrinsic}} performance gain to be derived, per se, <b>lake</b> <b>pipes</b> evolved {{a function}} of practicality. Common instances, their manifolds routed straight out the front wheel-whels posing an asphyxiation axiom to the race driver, [...] "lake pipes" [...] were fashioned, extending from the header flange along the rocker panels, bottom-side of the vehicle, beneath the doors, thus allowing (1) suspension tuners a lower ride height sufficient for land speed record attempts, and (2) engine tuners ease and flexibility of interchanging different exhaust manifolds without hoisting the vehicle, thus precluding having to wrench undercarriage of the vehicle.|$|E

5000|$|A {{consequence}} of the problematic nature in adaptation of large diameter exhaust tubing to the undercarriage of ladder-frame or body-on-frame chassis architecture vehicles with altered geometry suspensions, <b>lake</b> <b>pipes</b> evolved to become a front-engined vehicle exhaust archetype crafted by specialty motor sport engine specialists of the 1930s, 40s and 50s, whose preoccupation was optimization of the acoustic effect associated with high output internal combustion engines. The name is derived from their use on the vast, empty dry lake beds northeast of Los Angeles County, where engine specialists of yore custom crafted, interchanged and evaluated one-piece header manifolds of various mil thicknesses, a function of temperature, humidity, elevation and climate they anticipated.|$|E
50|$|The {{left side}} exhaust {{manifold}} exhausted to the front, where a crossover pipe took the exhaust to the forward {{end of the}} right side manifold on the car engines and between the 1st and second cylinder on some trucks, in turn exhausting to a single pipe at the rear. A common conversion was to block off the right forward manifold entrance and route the left side exhaust to a new pipe to form a dual exhaust system with better flow characteristics. These typically involved installation of free-flowing mufflers, which if at a legal noise level still allowed low frequency sounds to pass, giving a characteristic rumbling dual exhaust sound to these systems. In the 1950s shortcut exhaust outlets with manually removed covers were added to street machines in emulation of vehicles intended for high speed straight line racing on dry lake beds, typically located just behind the front wheel, although chromed external runners sometimes extended to just forward of the rear wheel. These covers were referred to as lake plugs, the pipes as <b>lake</b> <b>pipes.</b> This style exhaust was also used legally in sanctioned drag racing and illegally in unsanctioned performance demonstrations.|$|E

Through constructing artificial piping plover nests with {{different types of}} linings {{in the field and}} in the laboratory, I explored three possible functions of the nest lining. Linings may serve {{to reduce the amount of}} water retained in the nests after rain. Protection from sand deposition is not a function of the nest lining under normal wind conditions. Light-colored fragments remain cooler than unlined sand scrapes or scrapes lined with dark fragments. From simulations, I found that when adults are not incubating, the temperature in the nests increases significantly. Therefore, human disturbances which interrupt incubation may be detrimental to hatching success...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{volcanic}} pipe {{found in}} the Lac de Gras region was the Point Lake kimberlite, discovered by Chuck Fipke and Stewart Blusson who had been prospecting in the region for almost ten years, having found kimberlite indicator minerals as early as 1985.

40|$|Six {{types of}} aerosol {{samplers}} were evaluated experimentally {{in a test}} chamber with polydisperse fly ash. The Andersen sampler overestimates the mass of small particles due to particle bounce between stages and therefore provides a conservative estimate of respirable particulate mass and thoracic particulate mass. The TSP sampler provides an unbiased estimate of total particulate mass. TSP/CCM provides no information below ESD 2 ????m and therefore underestimates respirable particulate mass. The PM 10 sampler provides a reasonable estimate of the thoracic particulate fraction. The RespiCon sampler provides an unbiased estimate of respirable, thoracic, and inhalable fractions. DustTrak and SidePak monitors provide relative particle concentrations instead of absolute concentrations because {{it could not be}} calibrated for absolute particle concentrations with varying particle shape, composition, and density. Six sampler technologies were used to evaluate airborne dust concentrations released from oilfield pipe rattling operations. The task sampled was the removal of scale deposited on the inner wall of the pipe before it was removed from service in a producing well. The measured mass concentrations of the aerosol samplers show that a Gaussian plume model is applicable to the data of pipe rattling operations for finding an attainment area. It is estimated that workers who remain within 1 m of the machine centerline and directly downwind have an 8 -hour TWA exposure opportunity of (13. 3 ???? 9. 7) mg/m 3 for the Mud <b>Lake</b> <b>pipe</b> scale and (11. 4 ???? 9. 7) mg/m 3 for the <b>Lake</b> Sand <b>pipe</b> scale at 95 % confidence. At distances more than 4 m downwind from the machine centerline, dust concentrations are below the TWA-TLV of 10 mg/m 3 for the worker in both scales. At positions crosswind or upwind from the machine centerline there is no measurable exposure. Available data suggest that the attainment area for the public starts at about 9 m downwind from the machine centerline in both scales, as 24 hour average concentrations at these distances are smaller than the 0. 15 mg/m 3, the NAAQS for unrestricted public access. The PSD of the suspended plume is dominated by particles smaller than ESD 50 ????m...|$|R
50|$|Lopez Lake {{provides}} {{drinking water}} for Arroyo Grande, Grover Beach, Pismo Beach, Oceano and Avila Beach. It also provides groundwater recharge, water for irrigation and flood control. Unlike most municipal water supplies, human {{contact with the}} water is permitted. Sailing, wind surfing, water skiing, swimming, fishing and camping are popular activities. There is also a waterslide next to the lake. To prevent contamination of the drinking water, water from the <b>lake</b> is <b>piped</b> 3 mi to a terminal reservoir, where it remains to allow particles to settle out and pathogens to die off.

50|$|The cleanup {{plan calls}} for the {{dredging}} of up to 2.65 million cubic yards of contaminated sediments to a depth that will allow for a cap to be built without losing any lake surface area. The sediments will be hydraulically dredged {{from the bottom of}} the <b>lake</b> and <b>piped</b> to a sediment consolidation area in Camillus, New York. Dredging was expected to begin in 2012. The cap that the {{plan calls for}} would cover 580 acres of lake-bottom. The plan also calls for the installation of a barrier wall made of steel on the southwest corner of the lake. In 2008, Honeywell began second-phase construction on this barrier wall. The estimated cost of the cleanup plan is $451 million; an estimated $414 million in order to construct the remedy, followed by an annual maintenance cost of $3 million.|$|R
