5|$|The {{inner and}} outer walls were {{constructed}} similarly with the outer wall measuring nine feet high and 18 inches thick, which was also coated in plaster. The outer wall {{is believed to have}} been constructed during the fifteenth century. The construction of the inner wall has been attributed to the Portuguese presence along the coast in the sixteenth century, whilst the presence of gun ports has been used to infer that the walls were not constructed earlier. However, the practicality of the walls as defensive fortification is unclear, since according to Kirkman the walls and gates surrounding the town have no significant strength, which seems to conform to a proposal that the walls and the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> were used to maintain social barriers. Although the inner wall has a more obvious defensive function and despite the absence of gun ports and the questionable strength of the outer wall, it has nonetheless been credited as being a fortification.|$|E

50|$|The {{layout of}} the monastic coenobium was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} factors. These included a need for defence, economy of space, and convenience of access. The <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> became compact and orderly. Larger buildings were erected and defence was provided by strong outside walls. Within the walls, the buildings were arranged around one or more open courts surrounded by cloisters.

Dadivank was sufficiently well preserved to leave no doubt {{that it was one}} of the most complete monasteries in the entire Caucasus. With its Memorial Cathedral of the Holy Virgin in the center, Dadivank has approximately twenty different structures, which are divided into four groups: ecclesiastical, residential, defensive and ancillary. Dadivank is an active monastery of the Armenian Apostolic Church.|$|E
