[...] Regarding third-party support in Siri, he called it [...] "great", while noting the limited class of apps ("calls, messaging, payments, photos, ride-sharing apps, some CarPlay systems, and workouts"), and that sometimes a button press was required to complete the process. Beyond app integrations, he criticized Siri, writing [...] "Siri doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you remember". Bohn enjoyed the new machine <b>learning</b> <b>technology</b> present in the Photos app, writing that he was [...] "impressed" [...] by Apple's image recognition technology, which he noted is done locally on the device, but did criticize the error rate, where he compares the technology to Google Photos as a step ahead.

Bohn particularly enjoyed the new lock screen, where he highlighted that notification bubbles can be 3D Touch-ed to access more information, all without needing to unlock the phone. Other small bits of new features he liked included [...] "deletable" [...] apps, upgraded [...] "widgets" [...] when 3D Touch-ing a home screen icon, and breaking news notifications in Apple News.
