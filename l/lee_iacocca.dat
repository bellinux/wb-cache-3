5|$|In May 1982, President Ronald Reagan {{announced}} {{the formation of}} the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Centennial Commission, led by Chrysler Corporation chair <b>Lee</b> <b>Iacocca,</b> to raise the funds needed to complete the work. Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group raised more than $350million in donations. The Statue of Liberty was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a cause marketing campaign. A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express card, the company would contribute one cent to the renovation of the statue. The campaign generated contributions of $1.7million to the restoration project.|$|E

The Americans donated generously as well, with Washington dispatching eight official planeloads of official relief aid plus a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter from Italy. Private donations from the United States were also significant. Chrysler chairman <b>Lee</b> <b>Iacocca</b> arranged for a fund drive, and in Chicago (one of five major Armenian population centers in the US) the community raised $800,000 and donated 20,000 pounds of supplies.|$|E

25|$|The Grand Cherokee thus {{became the}} first Chrysler-badged Jeep product. Development work for the new Jeep model {{continued}} and Chrysler's employees (after the 1987 buyout of AMC) were eager for a late-1980s release date; however, CEO <b>Lee</b> <b>Iacocca</b> was pushing for redesigned Chrysler minivans, thus delaying the Grand Cherokee's release until late-1992 as an Explorer competitor. Unlike the Explorer, the Grand Cherokee utilized monocoque (unibody) construction, whereas the Explorer was a derivative of the Ranger pickup with a separate body-on-frame.|$|E

40|$|AbstractKnowledge {{workers are}} {{important}} and growing group of employees. The major resource and tool of their work is knowledge. Due to its tacit dimension, knowledge is of intangible character which makes the management of knowledge workers difficult; managers cannot observe and control {{the most important part}} of the process of work of knowledge workers (it happens in their brains and is invisible) and they cannot use directive tools that fail with this group of employees. Managers of knowledge workers are advised to change their managerial role for the leadership one. The article discusses problematic of leadership of knowledge workers. Research on this problematic is a part of the research on knowledge workers, their management and leadership. The research started in autumn 2010 at the University of Economics Prague and the Police Academy of the Czech Republic in Prague and it still continues. The objective of the research is to verify some aspects of knowledge work and the management and leadership of knowledge workers. The research is a quantitative research based on the questionnaire. As both management and leadership are practical disciplines we decided to use <b>Lee</b> <b>Iacocca's</b> concept of 9 Cs of leadership (leadership scorecard) as a basis for the research on leadership. The article provides the results of answers of 125 respondents and shows that managers in our country have great reserves in leadership techniques and skills...|$|R

500|$|Initial {{planning}} for the Pinto began {{in the summer of}} 1967; was recommended by Ford's Product Planning Committee in December 1968; and approved by Ford's Board of Directors in January 1969. Ford President <b>Lee</b> <b>Iacocca</b> wanted a 1971 model that weighed less than 2,000 pounds and that would be priced at less than $2,000. The Pinto product development, from conception through delivery, was completed in 25 months, when the automotive industry average was 43 months; the Pinto project was the shortest production planning schedule in automotive history up to that time. Some development processes usually conducted sequentially were conducted in parallel. Machine tooling overlapped with product development, which froze the basic design. Decisions which threatened the schedule were discouraged. The attitude of Ford management was to develop the Pinto as quickly as possible. Iacocca ordered a rush project to build the car, and the Pinto became known internally as [...] "Lee's car." [...] The Pinto's bodywork was styled by Robert Eidschun.|$|E

Snyder's son cameos as a young Rorschach, while the director himself appears as an American soldier in Vietnam. Actor Thomas Jane was invited by Snyder, but declined to work in the film due to being too busy.|$|E
