500|$|Snippets {{of voices}} between {{and over the}} music are another notable feature of the album. [...] During {{recording}} sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer {{a series of questions}} printed on flashcards. [...] The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3, and shown such questions as [...] "What's your favourite colour?" [...] and [...] "What's your favourite food?", before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death). [...] Questions such as [...] "When was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> violent?", followed immediately by [...] "Were you in the right?", were answered in the order they were presented. Roger [...] "The Hat" [...] Manifold proved difficult to find, and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid. [...] Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied [...] "...give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock..." [...] When asked about death he responded [...] "live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me..." [...] Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: [...] "I've been mad for fucking years – absolutely years". [...] The band's road manager Peter Watts (father of actress Naomi Watts) contributed the repeated laughter during [...] "Brain Damage" [...] and [...] "Speak to Me". [...] His second wife, Patricia [...] "Puddie" [...] Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the [...] "geezer" [...] who was [...] "cruisin' for a bruisin used in the segue between [...] "Money" [...] and [...] "Us and Them", and the words [...] "I never said I was frightened of dying" [...] heard halfway through [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think the}} other four will be enough for the boats. You did not go ashore <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> here, I think, Mr. Glover," [...] he added with a slight smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Many's the time, Mr. Hadden," [...] {{returned}} the driver. [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> {{back from the}} islands it was me that drove you to the races, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Artist," [...] he cried, {{quickening}} {{his walk}} impatiently, [...] "in {{the interests of}} the Town Council, your employers, allow me to ask <b>you</b> for the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to begin?" ...|$|R
50|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the penetration had been uncovered, Giskes on 1 April 1944 sent the following message in clear to London (in Marks, p499): To SOE section chiefs Messrs Blunt, Bingham and Succs Ltd., London.In the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> trying to make business in Netherlands without our assistance stop we think this rather unfair in view of our long and successful co-operation as your sole agents stop but never mind whenever you will come to pay a visit to the Continent <b>you</b> may <b>be</b> assured that <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> received with the same care and result as all those who you sent us before stop so long.|$|R
6000|$|... "How do you do, Mr. Sabin?" [...] he said. [...] "Don't {{remember}} me, I daresay. Met {{you once}} or twice <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in London. I wish I could say that I {{was glad to see}} you here again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but, Mark, dear Mark; don't say so. You know I don't mean it. But Lady Lufton {{does not}} like those Chaldicotes people. You know Lord Lufton was with you the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> there; and how annoyed she was!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{said you}} were delighted with the things my uncle showed you the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> here, and a friend has just sent him a fresh lot from Benares." [...] He gave her an {{appealing}} look. [...] "It struck me {{you might like to}} see them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are not {{altogether}} strangers, you know," [...] she went on. [...] "I have seen <b>you</b> before several <b>times.</b> I think the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in Paris <b>you</b> {{sat in a}} box at Auteuil with some friends of mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Deringham {{did nothing}} of the sort," [...] she replied. [...] "Do <b>you</b> {{remember}} <b>last</b> <b>time</b> when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> down <b>you</b> took me for a walk once or twice and you talked {{to me in the}} evenings, and--but perhaps you have forgotten. Have you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well, Sir Ralph, but you must {{remember}} {{that you had a}} new suit the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in London, and have not worn it from then till now, and I will warrant me that it cost well-nigh as much as Aline's garments or mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it, sir!" [...] he said, eagerly; [...] "that's what I {{wanted to}} speak to you about; that's what I've been {{preparing}} in my mind. Mr. Pedgift, sir, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> at the great house, when you came away in your gig, you--you overtook me on the drive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just stop a moment,' said Mr. Bounderby, {{excessively}} {{red in the}} face. 'I told you, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{here with}} a grievance, that you had better turn about and come out of that. And I also told you, if you remember, that I {{was up to the}} gold spoon look- out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Company won’t save you," [...] ses Joe. [...] "For the <b>last</b> <b>time,</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to}} give me that watch and chain, or not? Here’s your fifteen bob." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{remember}} Button-Bright," [...] {{replied the}} maiden in a sweet, tinkling voice. [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> I saw <b>you</b> <b>was</b> in the Land of Oz." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} the others. I hold a winning hand, but what that is I'll let time show. Now, for the <b>last</b> <b>time,</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> willing to let me take charge or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No. I am done. Social paragraphs. This {{office is}} the place where {{everything}} is known about everybody—including even a great deal of nobodies. Queer fellows drift in and out of this room. Waifs and strays from home, from up-country, from the Pacific. And, by the way, <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> here you picked up one of that sort for your assistant—didn’t you?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say I {{have been}} brought here at a terrible {{sacrifice}} for no purpose whatever. What use is it to be? And then you pretend to care what this poor man is eating and drinking and what physic he is taking when, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in his company, you wouldn't so much as look at him for fear you should make another man jealous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We talked {{that over}} the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> here, doctor, and you know we agreed {{it was better to}} run the risk of falling {{into the hands of the}} Yankee troops than into those of one of those {{partisan}} bands whose exploits are always performed at a distance from the army. However, if Hood has retreated across the Tennessee, there is an end of that plan, and we must take some other route. Which do you advise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{changing}} sides, Herbert," [...] Harry said, {{with a faint}} smile. [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> we met <b>you</b> <b>were</b> nigh falling {{into the hands of}} the Royalists, now I have altogether fallen into yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Quatermain," [...] said Sir Henry Curtis, {{when the}} man had brought the whisky and lit the lamp, [...] "the year before <b>last</b> about this <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> I believe, {{at a place called}} Bamangwato, {{to the north of the}} Transvaal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{remember}} us, I suppose, my man?" [...] Charlie began. [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> I saw <b>you</b> <b>was</b> when I {{brought my}} stick {{down on your}} head, when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> listening outside a window at Lynnwood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{talked of}} my wife, Father Benwell, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> here. You only knew, then, that her {{reception}} of Mr. Winterfield had determined him never to enter my house again. By way of adding to your {{information on the}} subject of 'petticoat government,' I may now tell you that Mrs. Romayne has forbidden Penrose to proceed with the attempt to convert me. By common consent, the subject is never mentioned between us." [...] The bitter irony of his tone, thus far, suddenly disappeared. He spoke eagerly and anxiously. [...] "I hope you are not angry with Arthur?" [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> so good as {{to come to}} this house, do you {{remember}} how Magdalen embarrassed and distressed us by questioning you about her right to bear her father's name? Do {{you remember}} her persisting in her inquiries, until she had forced you to acknowledge that, legally speaking, she and her sister had No Name? I venture to remind you of this, because you have the affairs of hundreds of clients to think of, and you might well have forgotten the circumstance. Whatever natural reluctance she might otherwise have had to deceiving us, and degrading herself, by the use of an assumed name, that conversation with you is certain to have removed. We must discover her by personal description--we can trace her in no other way.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Markham, soothingly; [...] "he's ashore {{with the}} Padre, and {{everything}} else is all right too. But it's rather ridiculous to think that those idiotic Indians believed {{the only way they}} could show Mr. Hurlstone that they meant us no harm was to drag us all up to THEIR Mission, as they call that half heathen cross of theirs--for safety against--who do you think, dear?--the dreadful AMERICANS! And imagine all the while the Padre and I were just behind you, bringing up the rear of the procession--only they wouldn't let us join you because they wanted to show you special honor as"--she sank her voice to a whisper in Eleanor's ear--"as the future Mrs. Hurlstone! It appears they must have noticed something about you two, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> there, my dear. And--to think--YOU never told me anything about it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} {{recognized}} you, sir, {{for all your}} moustache and your inches. The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> I saw <b>you</b> <b>was</b> in Jack Hammersley's office. Well, Jack's dead, and here I am, little better, I reckon. You remember Hammersley's house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She proceeded: [...] "I {{shall never}} forget that morning when you went away the <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to Truro; but I'm not sure-- perhaps it was to London. I only {{know that it was}} very far away, and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going for a very long time. It was early in the morning, and I <b>was</b> in bed. <b>You</b> know how late I always <b>am.</b> I heard <b>you</b> calling to me to come down and say good-bye; so I jumped up and came down in my {{nightdress}} and saw you standing waiting for me {{at the foot of the}} stairs. Then, when I got down, you took me up in your arms and kissed me. I shall never forget it!" ...|$|R

6000|$|Prince, however, {{had noticed}} it, {{not without a}} faint sense of sympathy. [...] "Look here!" [...] he said, with a certain brusqueness, which in {{a man of his}} {{character}} was less dangerous than his smoothness. [...] "I know your feelings to that family--at least to one of them--and, if I've been playing it pretty rough on you, it's only because you played it rather rough on ME the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> here. Let's understand each other. I'll {{go so far as to}} say I don't believe that Mrs. Saltonstall had anything to do with that murder, but, as a business man, I'm bound to say that these circumstances and her own indiscretion are quite enough to bring the biggest pressure down on her. I wouldn't want any better 'bear' on the market value of her rights than this. Take it at its best. Say that the Coroner's verdict is set aside, and a charge of murder against unknown parties is made--" ...|$|E
5000|$|A 1977 {{article in}} Fortune {{magazine}} stated he [...] "single-handedly... won {{billions of dollars}} for veterans programs". Gerald Nicosia, in his 2001 book Home to War: A History of the Vietnam Veterans' Movement recounted an incident in which Feldman came {{to testify before the}} United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, when a staffer muttered that [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> here, you cost us a billion dollars".|$|E
5000|$|As he {{sits and}} waits {{in the dark}} barn, Charley descends into a rage after he concludes he has been played for a fool. He storms out of the barn, but just as he crosses the threshold, he looks back and briefly glimpses, {{in a flash of}} light, the planet Verna through the back window of the barn before the barn door slams shut. By the time he gets the barn door back open, the people he left in the barn are gone, taken to Verna. Returning to the travel agency some time later, Charley is greeted by the proprietor, who hands him his money and says, [...] "You left this on the counter <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> here.
