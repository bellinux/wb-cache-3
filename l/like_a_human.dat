5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> carrying a heavy timber.|$|E

The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E

25|$|An android is a {{humanoid}} robot or synthetic organism {{designed to look}} and act <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human,</b> especially one with a body having a flesh-like resemblance. Historically, androids remained completely within the domain of science fiction where they are frequently seen in film and television. Only recently have advancements in robot technology allowed the design of functional and realistic {{humanoid robot}}s.|$|E
25|$|Cito {{knows how}} to work with each individual, {{treating}} everyone <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> being. He knows exactly what to say, when to say it, what to do and how to go about doing it. When you have a manager like that, it makes you want to play for the guy. We'd go to war for him. What Cito has done for the Blue Jays can't be taken lightly.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} broadcasts included {{references to}} the sponsor, Coca-Cola. Subsequent broadcasts and home media releases have excised all references to Coca-Cola products. Later subsequent broadcasts of the special also had some scenes, animation, including sound effects being redone for correction. Snoopy's dog bowl was given a new color, Charlie Brown no longer looked off-model in Lucy's psychiatric booth, new animation was placed in scenes where Charlie Brown was giving directions at the auditorium, the hearts when Sally gets enamored in Linus were redone, and Snoopy no longer sings <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> in the final carol.|$|E
25|$|Brown rats have acute hearing, are {{sensitive}} to ultrasound, and possess a very highly developed olfactory sense. Their average heart rate is 300 to 400 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of around 100 per minute. The vision of a pigmented rat is poor, around 20/600, while a non-pigmented (albino) with no melanin in its eyes has both around 20/1200 vision and a terrible scattering of light within its vision. Brown rats are dichromates which perceive colors rather <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> with red-green colorblindness, and their colour saturation may be quite faint. Their blue perception, however, also has UV receptors, allowing them to see ultraviolet lights that some species cannot.|$|E
25|$|Conventionally, many dildos {{are shaped}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> penis {{with varying degrees}} of detail; others are made to {{resemble}} the phallus of male animals. Not all, however, are fashioned to reproduce the male anatomy meticulously, and dildos come {{in a wide variety of}} shapes. These may resemble figures, or simply be practical creations which stimulate more easily than conventional designs. In Japan, many dildos are created to resemble animals or cartoon characters, such as Hello Kitty, so that they may be sold as toys, thus avoiding obscenity laws. Some dildos have textured surfaces to enhance sexual pleasure. Some dildos have macrophallic dimensions including over a dozen inches long.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} common effectors is the gripper. In its {{simplest}} manifestation, it consists of just two fingers which can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects. Fingers can for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire run through it. Hands that resemble and work more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand. Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand. Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.|$|E
25|$|Poor old Keeper, Emily's {{faithful}} {{friend and}} worshipper, {{seemed to understand}} her <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> being. One evening, when the four friends were sitting closely round {{the fire in the}} sitting-room, Keeper forced himself in between Charlotte and Emily and mounted himself on Emily’s lap; finding the space too limited for his comfort he pressed himself forward on to the guest’s knees, making himself quite comfortable. Emily’s heart was won by the unresisting endurance of the visitor, little guessing that she herself, being in close contact, was the inspiring cause of submission to Keeper’s preference. Sometimes Emily would delight in showing off Keeper—make him frantic in action, and roar with the voice of a lion. It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary sitting-room. Keeper was a solemn mourner at Emily’s funeral and never recovered his cheerfulness.|$|E
500|$|The Vacanti mouse was a {{laboratory}} mouse that had what looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> ear grown on its back. The [...] "ear" [...] was actually an ear-shaped cartilage structure grown by seeding cow cartilage cells into a biodegradable ear-shaped mold and then implanted {{under the skin}} of the mouse; then the cartilage naturally grew by itself. It was developed as an alternative to ear repair or grafting procedures and the results met with much publicity and controversy in 1997.|$|E

500|$|The DR {{incorporated}} a [...] "robot operator" [...] which would reset the knobs on the DU {{to complete a}} sequence of measurements at different wavelengths, just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> operator would to generate results for a full spectrum. [...] It used a linear shuttle with four positions, and a superstructure to change the knobs. [...] It had a moving chart recorder to plot results, with red, green and black dots. [...] The price of recording spectrophotometers was substantially higher than non-recording machines.|$|E
500|$|Buzz {{is one of}} the two {{official}} mascots of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Buzz {{is usually}} represented as a stylized yellowjacket with yellow-and-black fur, white wings, a yellow head, and antennae. Buzz is almost never drawn with six legs, but rather with arms, legs, hands (in white gloves) and feet (in black Converse high tops), <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human.</b> Invented in 1972 and restyled in 1979, Buzz reflects the tradition of referring to Georgia Tech students as [...] "Yellow Jackets." [...] Buzz is also one of Georgia Tech's emblems and trademarks, one that they defended in a 1998 legal conflict with the Salt Lake Buzz.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} further popularized and embellished in Journey Into Darkness: Ghosts and Vampires of New Orleans (1998) by Kalila Katherina Smith, the {{operator}} of a New Orleans ghost tour business. Smith's book added several more explicit details to the discoveries allegedly made by rescuers during the 1834 fire, including a [...] "victim [...] obviously had her arms amputated {{and her skin}} peeled off in a circular pattern, making her look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> caterpillar," [...] and another who had had her limbs broken and reset [...] "at odd angles so she resembled a human crab". [...] Many of the new details in Smith's book were unsourced, while others were {{not supported by the}} sources given.|$|E

500|$|In August 1892, Dubois's {{team found}} a long femur (thighbone) shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> one, {{suggesting}} that its owner had stood upright. Believing {{that the three}} fossils belonged to a single individual, [...] "probably a very aged female", Dubois renamed the specimen Anthropopithecus erectus. Only in late 1892, when he determined that the cranium measured about , did Dubois consider that his specimen was a transitional form between apes and humans. In 1894, he thus renamed it Pithecanthropus erectus ("upright ape-man"), borrowing the genus name Pithecanthropus from Ernst Haeckel, who had coined it {{a few years earlier}} to refer to a supposed [...] "missing link" [...] between apes and humans. This specimen has also been known as Pithecanthropus 1.|$|E

Jim says, [...] "I {{have a lot of work}} to do this afternoon. Those mines aren't going to sweep themselves," [...] a reference to the computer game Minesweeper. Ryan is said to be [...] "sleeping with random prostitutes" [...] in Thailand; prostitution in the Southeast Asian nation is technically illegal, but is in practice tolerated and regulated. Kevin said his previous engagement ended immediately after he remarked that the Philadelphia Eagles, a National Football League football team, might have a chance at winning the NFC East division championship.|$|E
500|$|Many {{philosophers}} consider {{experience to}} be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. [...] But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do {{the vast majority of}} people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not? [...] This is called the problem of other minds. [...] It is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness. Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois. and Colin Allen a professor at Indiana University regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.|$|E
