40|$|Azo {{compounds}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} common families of dyes used in textile and <b>leather</b> <b>treatments.</b> An important step during the treatment of water polluted by these compounds, is the degradation of the compounds by decomposition of the -N=N- bonds, producing the de-colorization of the water. This de-colorization reaction can be activated by the presence of zero valent metallic particles. The metastable structures generated during rapid solidification tend to increase the chemical activity of the alloys. Recently, it has been discovered that the use of metallic particles in a metastable phase (amorphous or nanocrystalline) multiplies significantly the efficiency of the decolorization water-treatment step. Here we present the results obtained in the decolorization of water using alloys based on different metals (Fe, Mn, Ni and Al) produced by rapid solidification and posterior ball milling. For some Al-containing alloys the results show a fast reaction, even in neutral pH conditions.

50|$|Three main factors play an {{essential}} {{role in the development of}} chronic hand eczema: excessive contact with water and irritants (cumulative-toxic stress), contact with allergens, and atopic diathesis, which has a genetic component. Individual hand eczema types are identified and named according to the main catalysts involved, i.e. cumulative-toxic, contact-allergenic, or atopic hand eczema. Activities that are stressful for the skin or involve repeated, excessive contact with water or skin-irritating substances at work or home can cause damage to the skin's protective abilities and increase the chances of inflammation. This also applies to prolonged wearing of protective rubber gloves and similar materials, since sweating occurs within these gloves. Disturbance of the skin's protective barrier also facilitates penetration by allergenic substances and promotes the development of contact dermatitis. Contact allergies play a very important role in the development of hand eczema. If the hand is subjected to repeated contact with a substance that leads to an allergy, the skin reacts with signs of inflammation. Numerous people affected by hand eczema also experience skin inflammation on their feet. Often, a contact allergy to an ingredient in shoe <b>leather</b> <b>treatment</b> may be the catalyst. Contact allergies in certain types of employment are especially problematic, particularly if the work involves the handling of allergenic materials, e.g. masonry work or hairdressing.|$|E

A área de estudo passou um processo de gerenciamento {{ambiental}} que contemplou diversos estudos ambientais para aquisição de dados e delimitar a contaminação, horizontal e verticalmente. O teste de bancada realizado com o reagente químico polissulfeto de cálcio demonstrou ser eficiente para reduzir as concentrações de cromo hexavalente em solo e água subterrânea. Com base nos dados adquiridos neste teste foi possível calcular a dose de injeção do polissulfeto de cálcio. Foram realizados setenta pontos de sondagem, pela técnica direct push, para injetar duzentos e cinquenta e dois mil e trinta litros de solução de polissulfeto de cálcio e água, sendo aproximadamente três mil e quinhentos litros por ponto de injeção. Os resultados após a injeção demonstraram que o polissulfeto de cálcio conseguiu remover o cromo hexavalente que estava adsorvido ao solo e reduziu a concentração de cromo hexavalente na água subterrânea entre quarenta e seis e sessenta e sete e noventa e nove e noventa e cinco por cento, após dezenove meses da injeção.

The study area is located in the Rio de Janeiro city and was occupied by a glass factory for forty years and purchased for construction of residential condominiums. Chromium is an important metal for the industry and is used in various products and processes, such as electroplating, <b>leather</b> <b>treatment,</b> pulp, wood preservation, and refractory manufacturing. The trivalent chromium is essential from a nutritional point of view, non-toxic and poorly absorbed in the body, acting in the maintenance of some functions. Cr(III) is the most common being found and occurs naturally, since the element Cr(VI) can occur naturally, but in low concentrations, if the groundwater has geochemical conditions the Cr (III) can be oxidize to Cr (VI). The hexavalent chromium is the most dangerous valence state and, according to ATSDR (two thousand and twelve), have greater mobility in the groundwater, being carcinogenic by inhalation of high doses of soluble chromate salts. The mobility of hexavalent chromium is high in soil and groundwater because it is not adsorbed by the soil in that valence state, on the other hand when it is in trivalent form is strongly adsorbed by the soil, forming insoluble precipitates, having low mobility in soil and groundwater. The hexavalent chromium remediation by in situ chemical reduction using calcium polysulfide {{has been the subject of}} several field studies documented in the literature, both for soil and groundwater from the Chromite Ore Processing Residue (COPR) (Storch, et al., two thousand and two; Graham, et al., two thousand and six; Charboneau, et al., two thousand and six; Wazne, et al., two thousand seven a; Wazne, et al., two thousand seven b; Chrysochoou, et al., two thousand and ten; Chrysochoou & Ting, two thousand and eleven; Pakzadeh & Batista, two thousand and eleven; Chrysochoou, et al., two thousand and twelve). Calcium polysulfide is a fertilizer to soil and commercially available and has been used in some remediation studies cases for reducing hexavalent chromium in soil and groundwater. Being commercially available and used as fertilizer, it is a relatively cheap chemical reagent in comparison with other chemical compounds exclusively developed for this purpose. The stoichiometric demand and the chemical kinetics of the reduction of Cr (VI) by the calcium polysulfide in aqueous solution was studied by Graham et al. (two thousand and six) from the chromite ore processing residue (COPR). With this study it was reported that a molar ratio of a point sixty-six is required (close to the theoretical value of one point five) and a first-order kinetics with an initial concentration of twenty-six eight point mg/L and pH of the CPS solution around eleven point five, with the presence of oxygen. Thus, the hexavalent chromium is reduced to chromium hydroxide, slightly water soluble compound which is precipitated to the soil. The trivalent chromium has low solubility, toxicity, mobility, reactivity and is considered stable. There are various application techniques of chemical reagents in the underground environment, and choosing the most appropriate method for each area depends on the type of contaminant, geological environment, groundwater and surface interference, depth, thickness and size of the contaminated area. As described by Suthersan (mil novecentos ninety-six), the injection of chemical reagents has to achieve two objectives: (one) creating and maintaining an ideal redox environment and other p...|$|E

A series of experiments were performed to investigate the described effect of cherry laurel leaves and the compounds emitted therefrom upon flexural rigidity of dry archaeological leather from wet burial sites, which upon uncontrolled drying becomes rigid. To aid interpretation or to ease stress and strain on the material, it is often desirable to modify the flexural rigidity of the leather to allow for the object to be reformed. A review of current <b>leather</b> <b>treatments</b> which modify flexural rigidity: immersion, humidity chambers and infusion with humectants followed by freeze drying, indicates that some dry archaeological leathers would not withstand these treatments due to induced collapse and cross-linking of collagen fibres. Treatment with cherry laurel leaves (Prunus laurocerasus) has been proposed as an alternative method, but there is a general lack of literature on the treatment and no explanation of the working mechanism of the treatment. Considering the time and constrained resources, a limited number of methods were selected to first evaluate the effect of the treatment on dry archaeological leather, and then clarify the mechanism of the treatment. An apparatus to measure the flexural rigidity of leather was designed and constructed. Results from this instrument were used to demonstrate that; a) the treatment depends upon emission of volatile compounds from the crushed leaves; and that b) benzaldehyde and water are the active compounds in the treatment. An experiment comparing the effects of a matrix of treatments: 1) chopped cherry laurel leaves in contact; 2) chopped cherry laurel leaves in noncontact; 3) benzaldehyde + distilled water; and, 4) 4 -Methoxybenzaldehyde + distilled water was conducted by measuring changes in: flexural rigidity, pH, surface colour, weight, length, width, thickness and evaluate other attributes such as visual appearance, touch/texture, workability with respect to both before and immediately after treatment and also with respect to treatment reversibility through elapsed time following treatment. This experiment indicates that all treatments work in a similar way, but to different extents, and that the presence of an aldehyde + moisture is required for modification of flexural rigidity. Benzaldehyde with water was found to be the most effective treatment. The results also indicate that the treatments are reversible within an acceptable time frame with the changes in the above measured properties returning to their original values within 48 hours following treatment. Benzaldehyde with water has the added benefit of not involving the emission of HCN(hydrogen cyanide), as is the case when cherry laurel leaves are used, which is both an acute toxin and a potential hazard for the leatherDegree Project in Bachelor of Science in Conservation Faculty of Science, Programme of Conservation 15 hp University of Gothenburg 2015 : 1...|$|R

Of the heavy metals, chromium (Cr) is a major pollutant, poses a great threat to flora and fauna and persists for long time. The most abundant species of Cr—Cr(III) and Cr(VI) —have very different properties. The toxicity, mobility, and bioavailability of Cr mainly depend on its speciation. In the natural environment, Cr(III) is most immobile, less soluble and stable, whereas Cr(VI) is highly mobile, soluble and bioavailable.
