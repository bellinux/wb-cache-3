5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{origin of}} the ash is evidenced by its distinctive mineralogy–the ash was deposited directly upon the water, so its angular quartz grains differ from the clastic sediments rounded through the erosion process that carries them to the sea. As the volcanic ash settled to the bottom, it was admixed with these terrigenous components, producing a distinctive <b>lithology</b> in the sedimentary rock.|$|E
5|$|The Pamphylia plain {{between the}} sea and the {{mountains}} is an isolated example of an Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forest, which include Lebanon Cedar, evergreen scrub, fig trees, and black pine. The Alanya Massif refers to the area of metamorphic rocks east of Antalya. This formation is divided into three nappes from lowest to highest, the Mahmutlar, the Sugözü, and the Yumrudağ.

5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous <b>lithologies,</b> granulitic <b>lithologies,</b> and impact-melt <b>lithologies.</b> Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in one or both of two major surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|R
40|$|For {{reservoir}} characterization, the subsurface heterogeneity {{needs to}} be qualified in which the distribution of <b>lithologies</b> {{is an essential part}} since it determines the location and migration paths of hydrocarbons. Preliminary analysis of well-log data could help to identify various <b>lithologies</b> in a one-dimensional direction (depth), while the lateral information is missing because of the sparse locations. On the other hand, a larger areal coverage of the target reservoir could be provided by seismic data, and from the inversion thereof, inferences of <b>lithologies</b> could be made. However, just like other geophysical inversions, translation of seismic inversion results to these categorical variables (<b>lithologies)</b> is a non-unique problem, which means that different <b>lithologies</b> could produce the same, or similar, property responses. In order to mitigate this problem, geological prior information should be introduced in the sense of Bayes’ theorem. Thus, the main motivation for this thesis is to investigate the usage of geological prior information in the classification of reservoir <b>lithologies</b> from properties obtained from seismic inversion. Different methods have been tried in this process in order to fully understand their performances and to make comparisons. Applied Geolog...|$|R

5|$|The <b>lithology</b> of the Kirtlandian {{formations}} {{are made}} up of mostly a combination of coal beds. The Fruitland Formation consists entirely of them, and one fifth of all rocks of the Kirtland Formation are a coal. The other common rocks found in the Kirtland Formation are siltstone, mudstone, shale and most commonly, sandstone. The Bisti Bed of the Hunter Wash Member is made up completely of sandstone, which marks the border between the Kirtland and Fruitland formations.|$|E
25|$|Facies can be {{distinguished}} {{in a number of}} ways: the most common are by the <b>lithology</b> (for example: limestone, siltstone or sandstone) or by fossil content. Coral for example only lives in warm and shallow marine environments and fossils of coral are thus typical for shallow marine facies. Facies determined by <b>lithology</b> are called lithofacies; facies determined by fossils are biofacies.|$|E
25|$|The low {{mountains}} of the ecoregion {{are covered by}} highly productive, rain-drenched evergreen forests that are home to the three tallest conifer species in the world: Coast redwood, Coast Douglas-fir, and Sitka spruce. Historically, Sitka spruce forests dominated the fog-shrouded coast, while a mosaic of western redcedar, western hemlock, and seral Douglas-fir blanketed the inland areas. Today, Douglas-fir plantations are prevalent on the intensively logged and managed landscape. <b>Lithology</b> influences land management strategies; slopes underlain by sedimentary rock {{are more susceptible to}} failure following clearcutting and road building than those underlain by volcanic rock.|$|E

25|$|The Eastern Pilbara Craton is very geologically {{significant}} {{due to its}} age and {{the types}} of <b>lithology</b> found within it. Within the Eastern Pilbara Craton there are 2 distinct lithologic divisions: (1), early Earth crust (3.8–3.53 Ga); (2), intrusive granitic domes along with greenstone belts (3.53–3.23 Ga). What separates this East Pilbara terrane {{from the rest of the}} Pilbara region are regional unconformities and that these rocks were once part of or deposited on the original Pilbara Craton and are still exposed today. These groups not only differ in relative age, but also in composition.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, the paleocurrent data orientated from south-south west to north-north east {{is common}} to both Lesser Himalaya and Tethyan Himalaya, more {{specifically}} in the Tal Group and Kunzam La Formation, respectively.

Finally, both sequences contain the same Early Cambrian equatorial trilobite species, reinforcing the likelihood of the passive continental margin model.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, it is {{proposed}} that the protolith of the Greater Himalaya may have been sedimentary in nature and correlate with the Lesser and Tethyan Himalayan sequences. Although precise matching of the ancient stratigraphy of the Greater Himalaya with the other zones is not possible, the Greater Himalayan sequence shares correlative strata with Neoproterozoic to Cambrian age rocks in Tethyan Himalaya. Similar transition from siliciclastic rocks to carbonates occurs in both sequences in strata of similar ages. In spite of the metamorphic grade of Greater Himalaya, the protolith <b>lithology</b> is nevertheless similar to the other zones and possibly shares the same depositional setting.|$|E
25|$|Roughly {{three-quarters of}} all Martian meteorites can be {{classified}} as shergottites. They are named after the Shergotty meteorite, which fell at Sherghati, India in 1865. Shergottites are igneous rocks of mafic to ultramafic <b>lithology.</b> They fall into three main groups, the basaltic, olivine-phyric (such as the Tissint group found in Morocco in 2011) and lherzolitic shergottites, based on their crystal size and mineral content. They can be categorised alternatively into three or four groups based on their rare-earth element content. These two classification systems do not line up with each other, hinting at complex relationships between the various source rocks and magmas that the shergottites formed from.|$|E
25|$|The Yucatan is an extensive, {{limestone}} rich plains {{region that}} {{is dominated by}} karst topography and geology. Being karst landscape is significant, as no surface water is present. This means no major river systems and hardly any lakes {{are present in the}} northern Yucatan as the limestone <b>lithology</b> drains subterraneously. Any surface water that is retained is unsuitable for consumption and occurs in very small amounts. The underground drainage results in the northern Yucatan being covered in caves and sinkholes called Cenotes, which are subsequently used by the inhabitants to access drinkable ground water. Any relief in the Puuc region is due to unequal dissolution rates within the limestone bedrock, and never reaches 400 meters above sea level.|$|E

Parental magma for the Bonanza King MIC formed in an subduction-related tectonic setting by partial melting of a depleted mantle enriched by slab-derived fluids.

40|$|Almost all rock {{types in}} the SNC meteorites are cumulates, {{products}} of magma differentiation by crystal fractionation (addition or removal of crystals). If the SNC meteorites are {{from the surface of}} Mars or near sub-surface, then most of the igneous units on Mars are differentiated. Basaltic units probably experienced minor to moderate differentiation, but ultrabasic units probably experienced extreme differentiation. Products of this differentiation may include Fe-rich gabbro, pyroxenite, peridotite (and thus serpentine), and possibly massive sulfides. The SNC meteorites include ten <b>lithologies</b> (three in EETA 79001), eight of which are crystal cumulates. The other <b>lithologies,</b> EETA 79001 A and B are subophitic basalts.

25|$|In {{addition}} to identifying {{rocks in the}} field (<b>lithology),</b> petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe. In an optical mineralogy analysis, petrologists analyze thin sections of rock samples using a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens. In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.

25|$|The red {{freestone}} of the Keuper {{building stone}} is familiar in buildings and bridges throughout North and West Cheshire. It is easily quarried and yields large free standing blocks and though soft {{at the time}} of quarrying, it has quality of hardening on exposure to the weather. The building stone represents a particular <b>lithology</b> of medium grained massive sandstones within the Keuper Sandstone and may not always lie at precisely the same horizon. It seems likely that the rock quarried {{in the northern part of}} the district is the lateral equivalent in part at any rate to the conglomerates of Alderley Edge which die out northwards. There are no working quarries of any importance today, but there are many old quarries around the area.|$|E

The veining, mineralization and associated <b>lithology</b> of this deposit appear to be typical of greenstone-hosted lode gold deposit. On the basis of mode of occurrence two types of gold mineralization are recognized in Attappadi, (1) Primary gold mineralization is associated with quartz veins intruding to AS and PGC.

40|$|Abstract: The Eocene Sarayc›k granodiorite, eastern Pontides, Turkey, {{is a small}} post-tectonic {{intrusive}} body (∼ 11 km 2), cross-cutting tectonically juxtaposed distinct metamorphic and non-metamorphic <b>lithologies.</b> A ∼ 0. 8 to 1 -km-wide contact-metamorphic aureole {{has developed}} around the intrusion. Disequilibrium is prevalent in all <b>lithologies,</b> even in the inner zones of the contact aureole. Conditions of contact metamorphism are estimated by simple phase equilibria applied to microdomains in the metapelitic <b>lithologies</b> without obvious signs of disequilibrium: Shallow emplacement depths (0. 21 ± 0. 05 GPa = ∼ 5 – 8 km) are suggested by contact-metamorphic mineral assemblages (e. g., andalusite + corundum + K-feldspar), by Al-in-hornblende barometry on granodiorite and by partial melting within the stability field of andalusite near the intrusive contact. Peak temperatures during the contact metamorphism ranged from 430 – 520 ºC at the outer domains of the aureole (∼ 400 m from the intrusive contact) to ≥ 730 ºC at the immediate contact of the intrusion. Textural evidence for partial melting in the stability fields of both andalusite and sillimanite are observed in metapelitic <b>lithologies</b> at distances ≤ 30 m from the intrusive contact. Basic <b>lithologies</b> contain mostly foliation-parallel, 2 – 50 -mm-thick layers with skarn-like mineralogy, which probably formed via infiltration of chemically reactive fluids. Prevalence of disequilibrium is predominantly related to temporal variation in temperature and/or fluid composition attending the contac...|$|R

25|$|Named after Mount Ainslie, Australian Capital Territory {{where their}} type {{location}} occurs, the Ainslie Volcanics {{are composed of}} Dacitic ignimbrite and minor volcaniclastic and argillaceous sediments.

These volcanics contain chloritised cordierite and some have red almandine garnet. Jasper is found on low hills {{on the north side}} of the Molonglo River. The thickness is at least 700 metres. The magma was formed by melting an aluminiumrich pelitic sediment. The eruption came from a volcano into shallow sea water. The deposits built above sea level as they progressed. The underlying sediments now make up the Canberra Formation. Between Hall and Namina Hill on Spring Range, the Mount Painter Volcanics lie unconformably on top.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary environments usually exist {{alongside}} {{each other}} in certain natural successions. A beach, where sand and gravel is deposited, is usually bounded by a deeper marine environment a little offshore, where finer sediments are deposited at the same time. Behind the beach, there can be dunes (where the dominant deposition is well sorted sand) or a lagoon (where fine clay and organic material is deposited). Every sedimentary environment has its own characteristic deposits. The typical rock formed in a certain environment is called its sedimentary facies. When sedimentary strata accumulate through time, the environment can shift, forming a change in facies in the subsurface at one location. On the other hand, when a rock layer with a certain age is followed laterally, the <b>lithology</b> (the type of rock) and facies eventually change.|$|E
