5000|$|The {{evidence}} of the defendants also showed that they had commenced work upon the claim about July 21, 1880, and sank and excavated an open cut, striking the vein or lode at the depth of ten feet or more, and exposed therein a vein of rock in place bearing gold and silver; that no mineral nor any indications of a vein or lode were found {{until they reached the}} depth of seven or eight feet, and that subsequently, and within the time limited by law, they marked the bounds of their claim on said lode, called by them the [...] "Johnny Bull Lode" [...] and recorded a <b>location</b> <b>certificate,</b> describing their claim by reference to natural objects and permanent landmarks and complying in all respects with the requirements of the law.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{also showed}} that Boaro and Hull entered upon the premises on or about July 21, 1880, and remained thereafter continuously in possession; that threats of violence to the plaintiff and Carroll, if they should enter upon the premises or attempt to take possession of them, were communicated to Carroll as having been made by Boaro early in August following; that in consequence of such threats and the possession held by Boaro, Carroll was prevented from resuming work upon and completing the discovery shaft, and from entering upon {{any other part of}} the lode or vein and performing the acts of location required by law within the time limited. The evidence also tended to show that within ninety days from the discovery of the lode by Carroll, one French, on behalf of the plaintiff and Carroll, secretly caused the boundaries of the claim to be marked by six substantial posts, so as to include the place of discovery and the premises in controversy, and filed {{in the office of the}} recorder of the county a <b>location</b> <b>certificate</b> setting forth the name of the lode, the date of the location, the names of the plaintiff and Carroll as locators, and the course of the lode or vein, and giving such a description of the claim, with reference to natural objects and permanent landmarks, as would suffice to identify the same with reasonable certainty.|$|E

40|$|We propose using Power Line Communication (PLC) as {{a second}} channel for data origin authentication, and we present a system {{architecture}} and protocol for doing so taking advantage of existing infrastructure for communicating over power lines. Our system connects a user's computer to a secure electric meter in his building via a secure Human Authorization Detector (HAD). The electric meter, which has a unique secret identifier and encryption key, communicates securely with the trusted Power Grid Server (PG) through PLC. Upon request from an Internet Application Server (AS), the user sends a <b>location</b> <b>certificate</b> to the AS, obtained via PLC from the PG and signed by the PG. Because PLC requires physical access to the electric meter, our system offers fine-grain location authentication. Unlike movable modems and dongles, the meter is permanently attached to the user's building. The user authorizes or denies certificate requests and deliveries by reading the HAD's display and pushing {{a button on the}} HAD, thus protecting against the possible threat of malware on the user's computer maliciously requesting or forwarding location certificates unauthorized by the user. Our system provides strong location authentication useful to many on-line applications, such as banking and SCADA systems. PLC offers finer-grain location authentication than do cellular telephones. Furthermore, the power grid is deployed widely and is highly reliable, even in many places where cellular telephone and GPS signals are obstructed or unavailable. We present our architecture and Power line Location Authentication Protocol (PLAP) in sufficient detail to permit further implementation and analysis...|$|E

She made the connection that Laboring Sons Park might be the location of Laboring Sons Cemetery. Around the same time former alderman Bill Lee and Bernard Brown, grand master of the Black Elks Lodge, were urging the city to acknowledge {{what had happened and}} make amends.|$|R
5000|$|In many countries, {{the term}} “master mariner” is {{reserved}} {{only for those}} who hold an unlimited master's certificate. The term “unlimited” (often referred to as unrestricted) indicates {{that there are no}} limits on size, power or geographic <b>location</b> on the <b>certificate.</b> It is the highest level of professional qualification amongst mariners and deck officers. The Extra Master's qualification (issued only in the United Kingdom), which was discontinued in the 1990s, used to be the highest professional qualification and it was the pinnacle for any mariner to achieve. There are also various other levels of master's certificates, which may be restricted or limited to home trade/near coastal voyages and/or by gross tonnage. The holder of a restricted master's certificate is not referred to as a [...] "master mariner".|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of three "criteria" air {{pollutants}} on infant health in New Jersey in the 1990 s by combining information about mother's residential <b>location</b> from birth <b>certificates</b> with information from air quality monitors. In addition to large sample size, our work offers three important innovations: First, because we know the exact addresses of mothers, we select those mothers closest to air monitors to ensure a more accurate measure of air quality. Second, since we follow mothers over time, we control for unobserved characteristics of mothers using maternal fixed effects. Third, we examine interactions of air pollution with smoking and other predictors of poor infant health outcomes. We find consistently negative effects of exposure to pollution, especially carbon monoxide, both during and after birth. The effects are considerably larger for smokers than for nonsmokers as well as for older mothers. Since automobiles are the main source of carbon monoxide emissions, our results have important implications for regulation of automobile emissions. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This thesis studies trust {{establishment}} in wireless, ad hoc networks. ADOPT is presented, a complete scheme for certificate validation in wireless, ad hoc networks. Its architecture {{is based on}} a distributed version of OCSP and more specifically on OCSP response caching in carefully selected nodes of the network. The method for locating cached OCSP response is thoroughly analyzed, along with techniques for caching optimization and especially efficient methods for choosing caching nodes as well as cache update and deletion policies. ADOPT is evaluated regarding its efficiency through carefully selected simulation scenarios. Moreover, the ADOPT scheme is adjusted in order to function efficiently in vehicular ad hoc networks. Simulation studies were performed to evaluate ADOPT in such an environment. In order to improve ADOPT’s robustness and resilience to possible attacks, it is combined with a trust establishment scheme, namely ATF. Simulation tests prove that trust integration in ADOPT not only increases the security of the scheme but also its overall performance. Finally, ADOPT is compared with other, similar certificate validation schemes for wireless, ad hoc networks. Emphasis is given on its optimal performance concerning the rapid <b>location</b> of fresh <b>certificate</b> status information and the reduced overhead introduced to both the network and its nodes...|$|R
