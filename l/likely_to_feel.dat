A study by Ann Pritt in 1998 found that Mormon women who were sexually abused were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> distant from God, blame themselves for bad things that happen to them, and be more pessimistic in general compared to Mormon women who were not sexually abused (with both parties having received counseling at some point). Another study by Jacobsen and Wright in 2014 found that Mormon women who experience same-sex attraction feel isolation and worthlessness and need to form a positive self-identity.|$|E

These advantages include the absence of local pollution such as particulates, sulphur oxides (SOX's) and nitrous oxides (NOX's). For the business community, the economic advantages are also becoming clearer. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} the working environment has a significant effect on workforce morale. Renewable energy solutions are a part of this, wind turbines in particular being seen by many as a potent symbol of a new modernity, where environmental considerations are taken seriously.

25|$|Perceptions of wage {{entitlement}} differ {{between women}} and men such that men are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> worthy of higher pay while women's sense of wage entitlement is depressed. Women's beliefs about their relatively lower worth and their depressed wage entitlement reflects their lower social status such that when women's status is raised, their wage entitlement raises as well. However, gender-related status manipulation has no impact on men's elevated wage entitlement. Even when men's status is lowered on a specific task (e.g., by telling them that women typically outperform men on this task), men do not reduce their self-pay and respond with elevated projections of their own competence. The usual pattern whereby men assign themselves more pay than women for comparable work might explain why men tend to initiate negotiations more than women.|$|E

500|$|Few male {{respondents}} {{had engaged in}} childhood sex play, {{and it did not}} seem to be important in the development of homosexuality. Homosexual men were less likely to report having enjoyed boys' activities such as football and to see themselves as having been very masculine while growing up, but more likely to report having enjoyed stereotypical girls' activities. Three variables (dislike of typical boys' activities, enjoying typical girls' activities, and feelings of masculinity or femininity) were combined into a composite measure called [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity", which proved to be the most important developmental variable. It appeared to make male respondents less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> attraction to the opposite sex during childhood, but more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> sexually different from other boys, experience homosexual arousal and activities, and become homosexual as adults. Homosexual men were more likely to recall having felt different from other boys their age, or to say that they felt different because they did not like sport, or because they were not interested in girls or were sexually interested in other boys. They were also more likely to report feeling different because they had stereotypical feminine traits or interests. Feeling different during childhood appeared to be irrelevant, but feeling different for gender reasons during adolescence had [...] "modest total effects". Boys who felt sexually different were more likely to become homosexual as adults, whether they began to feel that way during childhood or adolescence. While homosexual men were more likely to have been labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, this apparently played no significant role in the development of sexual orientation.|$|E
500|$|Bell et al. {{found that}} {{homosexual}} {{men were more}} likely than heterosexual men to have felt especially close to their mothers. Male respondents who were unusually close to their mothers were more likely to describe themselves as having been feminine children, but only a minority of boys with this kind of background became homosexual. Bell et al. concluded that male homosexuality is not the [...] "result of an unusually strong maternal identification", and that mothers have only a small influence on their sons′ psychosexual development. Homosexual men were less likely to give positive descriptions of their fathers, but more likely to have negative feelings toward their fathers, to dislike, hate, or fail to feel close to them, or to consider them hostile or detached. They were also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more similar to their mothers than to their fathers, or to prefer to be like their mothers. Bell et al. concluded that, [...] "Unfavorable relationships with fathers" [...] have a weak connection to [...] "gender nonconformity and early homosexual experiences".|$|E
500|$|The {{benefits}} {{for children to}} maintain relationships with both parents have been repeatedly shown in research. [...] Children in joint custody arrangements often report greater levels of satisfaction with the division of time between their parents and children are also less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> torn between their parents when compared with children who are in sole custody arrangements. In addition, children in joint custody arrangements report feeling closer to both parents than children in sole custody arrangements. Joint custody arrangements also appear to benefit the parents. Not only do parents in joint custody arrangements report lower levels of conflict with one another, when compared to those in sole custody arrangements, but joint custody is frequently related to more positive relationships, effective parenting, and lower inter-parental conflict; key factors that ensure a child’s well-being following divorce. However, {{it is important to}} point out that children are far less likely to do well with joint custody and sole custody arrangements when their parents used them as pawns or when they consistently witness their parents' frequent, intense, and ongoing conflict.|$|E

2500|$|Attributions of {{responsibility}} for a given transgression may have an adverse effect on forgiveness. [...] Specifically, if a transgression is viewed as intentional or malicious, the offended partner is less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> empathy and forgive. [...] Based {{on the notion that}} forgiveness is driven primarily by empathy, the offender must accept responsibility and seek forgiveness immediately following the transgression, as apologies have shown to elicit empathy from the offended partner. [...] The resulting feelings of empathy elicited in the offended partner may cause them to better relate to the guilt and loneliness their partner may feel {{as a result of the}} transgression. [...] In this state of mind, the offended partner is more likely to seek to normalize the relationship through granting forgiveness and restoring closeness with their partner.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of {{literacy}} in disadvantaged environments and the interplay between self-generated literacy practices and their conceptualization of literacy in 7 to 10 -year-old Chilean pupils from two different schools located in Santiago, Chile. The study was framed within a participatory approach focused on promoting the children’s agency and voice in the research. A range of second-level data materials were collected through interviews with parents, photographs and existing documents. Although at a resources-associated level the sociocultural context did not inhibit the emergence of literacy practices, the context did contribute to the children’s understanding of literacy. This study raises the need for considering how children’s understanding of literacy influence their involvement and learning about reading and writing as their experiences and perceptions {{have an important role}} in their learning process, particularly on how they develop their reading and writing practices. The findings implied that by raising the participants’ awareness of the relevance of everyday practices in relation with reading and writing, they are <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more comfortable and empowered towards their own literacy practices. Particularly, the empowerment of children coming from a disadvantaged background would give them more opportunities to support their learning. By making the children aware of the relevance of their own perceptions and practices, the pupils could gain in confidence, be agents of their learning processes, and have more resources to succeed on the demanding school environment...|$|R

40|$|Ireland has a {{well-established}} specialisation in pharma-chem production, with {{nine of the}} top ten multinational corporations located in Ireland. The sector accounts for about 11 per cent of value added although due to its knowledge-intensive nature its share in employment and the labour share of value added are modest by comparison. Ireland is the production base {{for a number of}} patented drugs which have gone or are going off patent in quick succession, including the global bestseller in 2011. These expiries are having an impact on pharma-chem production in Ireland. Both output and exports are down from their mid- 2012 peaks, although the headline impact is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be offset to an (uncertain) extent by reduced imports of royalties. Ireland is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the impact of the patent cliff as drugs being produced in Ireland continue to come off patent in coming years.

2500|$|Self-determination is {{the ability}} to make choices and {{exercise}} a high degree of control, such as what the student does and how they do it (Deci et al., 1991; Reeve, Hamm, & Nix, 2003; Ryan & Deci, 2002). Self-determination can be supported by providing opportunities for students to be challenged, such as leadership opportunities, providing appropriate feedback and fostering, establishing and maintaining good relationships between teachers and students. These strategies can increase students' interest, competence, creativity and desire to be challenged and ensure that students are intrinsically motivated to study. On the other hand, students who lack self-determination are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> their success is out of their control. Such students lose motivation to study, which causes a state of [...] "helpless learning". Students who feel helpless readily believe they will fail and therefore cease to try.

2500|$|For example, when Edward and Richard {{are urging}} York {{to break his}} oath to Henry, Edward says, [...] "But for a kingdom, any oath may be broken;/I would break a {{thousand}} oaths to reign one year" [...] (1.2.16–17), thus showing the attraction that power has for the characters, and what {{they would be willing}} to do to attain it. Later, echoing Warwick's statement about his reasons for joining the Lancastrians, Richard outlines why he has remained loyal to the Yorkists; [...] "I stay not for the love of Edward but the crown" [...] (4.1.125), again showing the attraction of power and the subversion of all other concerns, including familial relations. Another example is when Prince Edward is killed in Act 5, Scene 5. His death is brought about because he taunts the Plantagenet brothers, and they lose their temper with him, not because they are exacting revenge for an ongoing feud with his family. Similarly, when Richard kills Henry, his motives have nothing to do with the conflict between his family and Henry's. He murders him simply because Henry stands in the way of his attempts to gain the throne. As Michael Hattaway writes, [...] "family loyalties may have been the initial cause of the feuds, but an audience watching 3 Henry VI is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that individual ambition rather than family honour is what fuels the vendettas that inform the play. Both [...] seem to have forgotten that the quarrel between [...] originally was a dynastic one: their claims to legitimacy and authority in this play are now validated only by the forces they can muster" [...] As Jane Howell, director of the BBC Shakespeare adaptation argues, [...] "anarchy is loosed and you're left with a very different set of values – every man for himself.

50|$|Anthony Walsh {{criticizes the}} attempt to use the macrostructural {{opportunity}} model to explain interracial rape as {{has been done in}} studies conducted in the past few decades, pointing out that such a defense is directly contradicted by the data related to homicide. Walsh argues that the macrostructural opportunity model helps explain why black murderers almost always choose black victims. There are disparities in rates of reporting rape where victims of some races are statistically less likely or more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report their rape, especially depending on the race of the offender. Black women in America are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report sexual assault that has been perpetrated by a stranger. Black women are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> under-report rapes overall as they are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> blame themselves, <b>feel</b> they will be blamed or feel they won't be believed.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{a sample}} {{representative}} of the Canadian population aged 30 - 59, this paper assesses the impact of time spent on productive activities, and various types of activities, on stress and health. The main finding is {{that the number of}} hours spent is a better predictor of stress than is the type of activity. Moreover, the effects of paid and unpaid work are additive rather than multiplicative. That is, the more people work, regardless of what they are doing, the more <b>likely</b> they are <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> stressed. Still, working irregular hours and non-traditional family models are also associated with poorer health and reduced stress. Being married appears to mitigate the effect of unpaid work on stress, but does not mitigate the effect of paid work on stress.
