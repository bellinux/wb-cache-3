30|$|Both the Session <b>Logging</b> <b>Tool</b> and the Teacher Learning Goals {{instrument}} {{examine the}} facilitator’s modifications within a session.

50|$|Neutron {{porosity}} <b>logging</b> <b>tools</b> {{contain an}} americium-beryllium neutron source, which irradiates the formation with neutrons. These neutrons lose energy through elastic collisions with nuclei in the formation. Once their energy has decreased to thermal level, they diffuse randomly {{away from the}} source and are ultimately absorbed by a nucleus. Hydrogen atoms have essentially the same mass as the neutron; therefore hydrogen is the main contributor to the slowing down of neutrons. A detector at {{some distance from the}} source records the number of neutron reaching this point. Neutrons that have been slowed down to thermal level have a high probability of being absorbed by the formation before reaching the detector. The neutron counting rate is therefore inversely related to the amount of hydrogen in the formation. Since hydrogen is mostly present in pore fluids (water, hydrocarbons) the count rate can be converted into apparent porosity. Modern neutron <b>logging</b> <b>tools</b> usually include two detectors to compensate for some borehole effects. Porosity is derived from the ratio of count rates at these two detectors rather than from count rates at a single detector.|$|E
5000|$|Density logging is a {{well logging}} tool that can provide a {{continuous}} record of a formation's bulk density {{along the length of}} a borehole.

50|$|Wireline logging is {{performed}} by lowering a 'logging tool' - or {{a string of}} one or more instruments - {{on the end of a}} wireline into an oil well (or borehole) and recording petrophysical properties using a variety of sensors. <b>Logging</b> <b>tools</b> developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids.

50|$|A {{gamma ray}} {{detector}} located {{some distance from}} the source, detects surviving gamma rays and sorts them into several energy windows.

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze the {{feasibility}} of three dimensional (3 D) electromagnetic (EM) imaging from a single borehole. The proposed <b>logging</b> <b>tool</b> consists of three mutually orthogonal magnetic dipole sources and multiple three component magnetic field receivers. A sensitivity analysis indicates {{that the most important}} sensor configuration for providing 3 D geological information about the borehole consists of a transmitter with moment aligned parallel to the axis of the borehole, and receivers aligned perpendicular to the axis. The standard coaxial logging configuration provides the greatest depth of sensitivity compared to other configurations, but offers no information regarding 3 D structure. Two other tool configurations in which both the source and receiver are aligned perpendicular to the borehole axis provide some directional information and therefore better image resolution, but not true 3 D information. A 3 D inversion algorithm has been employed to demonstrate the plausibility of 3 D inversion using data collected with the proposed <b>logging</b> <b>tool.</b> This study demonstrates that an increase in image resolution results when three orthogonal sources are incorporated into the <b>logging</b> <b>tool</b> rather than a single axially aligned source...|$|R
