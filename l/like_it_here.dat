Delphine meets with Sarah to ask if her young daughter, Kira, will donate her bone marrow to help cure Cosima's illness, and Kira agrees. Meanwhile, Cosima works with her lab assistant Scott (Josh Vokey) and Rachel's adoptive father Ethan (Andrew Gillies), a founder scientist of the cloning program, to find the genetic sequence that has caused her illness. Rachel, who is usually stoic, laughs and sobs whilst watching home videos of her childhood, lamenting her own infertility. Disguised as Sarah, she tricks her way into the pediatric clinic where Kira is recovering and sedates Sarah's foster brother Felix (Jordan Gavaris). She abducts Kira and takes her to a young girl's bedroom in the Dyad Institute, telling Kira that she [...] "may even grow to <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>here,</b> just as I did".|$|E

[...] He told The Telegraph that he was inspired by his half-brother. According to Time, George [...] "has repeatedly denied... that he feels abandoned by Obama." [...] CNN quoted him as saying, [...] "I was brought up well. I live well even now.

2500|$|The next season, in {{the winter}} {{transfer}} window, he transferred to La Liga team Mallorca on loan, scoring six goals in 19 games. At {{the end of the}} season, Eto'o left Real Madrid, signing a permanent deal with Mallorca for a club record £4.4 million fee. In his second season, he scored 11 goals and began to garner attention throughout the league. Mallorca President Mateo Alemany said of his style of play, [...] "I doubt if there is any other player in the world who would please the fans more at this moment." [...] Eto'o himself commented on his rise to stardom, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>here</b> in Mallorca; I have always been well looked after, the fans appreciate me and I also have a contract that runs until 2007." [...] He returned the fans' appreciation when he donated €30,000 in meals to travelling Mallorca supporters who made the journey to the Copa del Rey final against Recreativo de Huelva in 2003. Mallorca won the match 3–0, with Eto'o scoring two late goals to seal the victory.|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn {{entered the}} 1993 season anticipating {{that he would}} be better after his past two surgeries, and he had also {{incorporated}} Williams' advice into his swing. The Padres lost 101 games that year for the team's worst record during his career. They finished last in the division, behind even the Colorado Rockies, who were an expansion team in their inaugural season. San Diego that season had traded most of its star players—including Fred McGriff, Gary Sheffield, and Tony Fernández—in fire sales. Gwynn finished with a [...]358 average, the then-second best average of his career, but Colorado's Andrés Galarraga won the title at [...]370. He batted [...]587 on pulled balls, compared to his [...]315 in 1991 before Williams' pointers. Gwynn was affected early in the season by a sprained thumb, but he hit [...]400 (76-for-190) over {{the second half of the}} season. On June 10, he missed the opportunity to hit for the cycle when Manager Jim Riggleman replaced him in the seventh inning of a 14–2 rout against the Dodgers after he had hit for a home run, double, and triple in his three prior at-bats. Riggleman was not aware that he needed a single to complete the cycle. Still wary of Clark's earlier criticism that he was selfish, Gwynn did not contest his removal, which angered his manager when he found out after the game. On August 4 against the Giants, Gwynn had the only six-hit game of his career. He might have gone 7–for–7 if not for an excellent play at first base by Will Clark. Gwynn recorded his 2,000th hit with a single off Colorado lefthander Bruce Ruffin on August 6. His last game was September 5 before undergoing arthroscopic surgery to clear [...] "loose bodies" [...] from his knee. It was the fourth consecutive year his season ended early, and the third straight season it was due to left knee surgery. After the season, Gwynn's father, Charles, died young at the age of 57 from heart problems. Two days earlier, Charles had argued with Gwynn that he should leave San Diego, questioning the Padres' commitment to winning. Gwynn eventually concluded, [...] "No, I <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>here,</b> I should stay." [...] He contemplated leaving baseball after his father's death; however, he recalled his father always telling him to [...] "never be a quitter, work hard".|$|E
