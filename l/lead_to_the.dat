5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E

5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.|$|E
