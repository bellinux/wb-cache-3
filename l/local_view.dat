500|$|In the 1830s, {{plans were}} drawn up {{to build the}} new London and Birmingham Railway. From an {{engineering}} perspective, the ideal route for the railway ran through {{the site of the}} castle, but concerns over the need to protect ancient monuments and buildings had been growing for several years, and the local Bridgwater estate were also keen to protect the <b>local</b> <b>view</b> from their buildings. The castle was ultimately specifically protected in the 1833 act that sanctioned the railway, forcing the track to take a route across the valley floor. Berkhamsted was the first building in Britain to receive statutory protection from development in this way. Nonetheless, the route still required the track to pass through the outer fortifications of the castle, [...] a major engineering operation which was carried out in 1834, destroying the castle gatehouse in the process.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, the Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) {{meeting in}} Barrow, Alaska, United States officially adopted Inuit as a {{designation}} for all circumpolar native peoples, {{regardless of their}} <b>local</b> <b>view</b> on an appropriate term. [...] As a result, the Canadian government usage has replaced the (locally) defunct term Eskimo with Inuit (Inuk in singular). The preferred term in Canada's Central Arctic is Inuinnaq, and in the eastern Canadian Arctic Inuit. The language is often called Inuktitut, though other local designations are also used. Despite the ICC's 1977 decision to adopt the term Inuit, this was never accepted by the Yupik peoples, likened to calling all Native American Indians Navaho simply because the Navaho felt that that's what all tribes should be called.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a {{mediator}} architecture for the querying and integration of Web-accessible XML data sources. Our contributions are (i) the definition of a simple but expressive mapping language, following the <b>local</b> as <b>view</b> approach and describing XML resources as <b>local</b> <b>views</b> of some global schema, and (ii) efficient algorithms for rewriting user queries according to existing source descriptions. The approach has been validated by the ¦¨§�©�� prototype. ...|$|R
50|$|AR can aid in {{visualizing}} building projects. Computer-generated {{images of}} a structure can be superimposed into a real life <b>local</b> <b>view</b> of a property before the physical building is constructed there; this was demonstrated publicly by Trimble Navigation in 2004. AR can also be employed within an architect's workspace, rendering into their view animated 3D visualizations of their 2D drawings. Architecture sight-seeing can be enhanced with AR applications allowing users viewing a building's exterior to virtually see through its walls, viewing its interior objects and layout.|$|E

50|$|The {{caste system}} in India {{has long been}} the subject of {{scholarly}} interest, but there was a distinct lack of ethonographic material on it as noted by Radcliffe-Brown. Inspired by this and other works such as that of Robert Redfield and Fei Hsiao-Tung, he set out to India to carry out fieldwork as part of the position he was offered by his teacher, Evans-Pritchard and ended up choosing Rampura due to his fluency in Kannada and several emotional factors, including his ties to Mysore and being awed by the <b>local</b> <b>view.</b>|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} multi-source multi-destination multi-layer wireless networks, and we seek fundamental limits of communications when sources have limited <b>local</b> <b>views</b> of the network. To model <b>local</b> <b>views</b> at wireless nodes, {{we consider}} the scenario in which each source-destination (S-D) pair has enough information to perform optimally when other pairs do not interfere. Beyond that, the only other information available at each node is the global network connectivity. We refer to this model of local network knowledge as 1 -local view [1]. The motivation for this model stems from coordination protocols such as routing which are often employed in multi-hop networks to discover source-destination routes.|$|R

50|$|Editing in {{this view}} is an {{intermediate}} step between true WYSIWYG and editing in the regular text view in terms of complexity for the author. The XML elements are made more human-readable and intuitive, but the nesting and semantics of the XML document are still clear. The cursor can be placed between any elements, and when the cursor's position is ambiguous, a tool-tip window will appear showing a <b>local</b> <b>view</b> of the XML tree and the cursor's position in it. A bar {{along the top of}} the view shows the list of elements from the document root to the element under the cursor.|$|E
50|$|According {{to popular}} belief, the term Ostfriesland is purely {{geographical}} and includes {{the district of}} Friesland {{and the town of}} Wilhelmshaven. However, this is not the <b>local</b> <b>view.</b> The residents of East Frisia (i.e. districts of Aurich, Leer, Wittmund and the town of Emden) {{are the only ones who}} call themselves fully East Frisian. In the district of Frisia and town of Wilhelmshaven, however, they hardly, if ever, refer to themselves as East Frisian. If the inhabitants of these two areas do not call themselves Frieslanders (Friesländer or, more rarely, Frisians) or Wilhelmshaveners, then they tend to be known as Oldenburgisch.|$|E
50|$|Clients of EJBs do not {{instantiate}} those beans directly via Java's new operator, {{but instead}} have {{to obtain a}} reference via the EJB container. This reference is usually not {{a reference to the}} implementation bean itself, but to a proxy, which either dynamically implements the local or remote business interface that the client requested or dynamically implements a sub-type of the actual bean. The proxy can then be directly cast to the interface or bean. A client is said to have a 'view' on the EJB, and the local interface, remote interface and bean type itself respectively correspond with the <b>local</b> <b>view,</b> remote view and no-interface view.|$|E
40|$|By having {{subjects}} drive {{a virtual}} taxicab through a computer-rendered town, we examined how landmark and layout information interact during spatial navigation. Subject-drivers searched for passengers, and then attempted {{to take the}} most efficient route to the requested destinations (one of several target stores). Experiment 1 demonstrated that subjects rapidly learn to find direct paths from random pickup locations to target stores. Experiment 2 varied {{the degree to which}} landmark and layout cues were preserved across two successively learned towns. When spatial layout was preserved, transfer was low if only target stores were altered, and high if both target stores and surrounding buildings were altered, even though in the latter case all <b>local</b> <b>views</b> were changed. This suggests that subjects can rapidly acquire a survey representation based on the spatial layout of the town and independent of <b>local</b> <b>views,</b> but that subjects will rely on <b>local</b> <b>views</b> when present, and are harmed when associations between previously learned landmarks are disrupted. We propose that spatial navigation reflects a hierarchical system in which either layout or landmark information is sufficient for orienting and wayfinding; however, when these types of cues conflict, landmarks are preferentially used...|$|R

The Vita was rewritten and amplified by the monks of Issoire, who retained as a relic the saint's head. There is a further elaborated Vita of the late 11th century, with new episodes, made {{at the same time as}} a forgery of a charter of Pippin (the Short or one of two kings of Aquitaine being intended).

50|$|In a {{production}} setting, only one ship in {{a task force}} would carry the DATAR computer. The rest of the ships had computer terminals that allowed the operators to use a trackball based on a Canadian five-pin bowling ball and trigger to send position info over the PCM links to the DATAR. DATAR then processed the locations, translated everything into the various ship's <b>local</b> <b>view,</b> and sent the data back to them over the same PCM links. Here it was displayed on another console originally adapted from a radar unit. In contrast with the United States Air Force's Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, DATAR did not develop tracks automatically, relying on the operators to continue feeding new data into the system by hand.|$|E
