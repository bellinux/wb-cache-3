5000|$|When {{applied to}} a <b>liquidated</b> <b>demand,</b> the verb [...] "adjust" [...] has the same meaning as the word [...] "settle" [...] in the same connection, and means to pay the demand. When {{applied to a}}n unliquidated demand, it means to {{ascertain}} the amount due or to settle. In the latter connection, to settle means to effect a mutual adjustment between the parties and to agree upon the balance.|$|E
5000|$|Ordinarily a default {{judgment}} may {{be granted}} administratively. This means the clerk or registrar {{is permitted to}} grant the judgment, provided that the papers are in order. In matters where the claim is not for a debt or a <b>liquidated</b> <b>demand,</b> default judgment can only be obtained after either giving oral evidence before court or providing same by way of affidavit. When faced with a request, a magistrate or clerk can do one of the following: ...|$|E
50|$|As to the {{alternative}} claims for their value, he held, {{as to the}} first case, that {{the alternative}} claim was a delictual claim for damages and was not a <b>liquidated</b> <b>demand</b> {{for the purposes of}} Rule of Court 31(2)(a). Accordingly, he found that the plaintiff was not entitled to a judgment on the alternative claim unless evidence was led to establish the value of the diamonds on the date of the alleged delict: that is, when the diamonds were wrongfully disposed of or alienated.|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} past our Chambers of Commerce and Mercantile Associations {{have been calling}} for the {{establishment}} in the County Courts of Ireland of a summary power to obtain decrees by default for <b>liquidated</b> <b>demands.</b> In support of this claim the analogy of the power to obtain judgment by default in the High Court, and {{the provisions of the}} English County Courts Acts, enabling such decrees to be obtained outside Sessions, are relied on. It is urged that the want of such a power delays and sometimes defeats just and undisputed debts, and imposes upon creditors, and particularly upon trade creditors, the hardship and inconvenience of attending Quarter Sessions and proving demands to which no defence could or was intended to be offered...|$|R
60|$|All was ready; boats hoisted in, stun' sail gear rove, {{messenger}} passed, capstan-bars {{in their}} places, accommodation-ladder below; and in glorious spirits, {{we sat down}} to dinner. In the ward-room, the lieutenants were passing round their oldest port, and pledging their friends; in the steerage, the middies were busy raising loans to <b>liquidate</b> the <b>demands</b> of their laundress, or else--in the navy phrase--preparing to pay their creditors with a flying fore-topsail. On the poop, the captain was looking to windward; and in his grand, inaccessible cabin, the high and mighty commodore sat silent and stately, as the statue of Jupiter in Dodona.|$|R
50|$|The {{inner ring}} of fortifications was now {{redundant}} militarily, and hampered the city's development. Mayor Richard Witting, coming to office in 1891, {{tried to have}} it <b>liquidated.</b> The army <b>demanded</b> 18 million marks from the city in compensation for the land, finally reduced to 12 million (the city's total budget in 1898 was 3.77 million marks). The amount was eventually paid to the army by the central government, which became {{the owner of the}} land. Demolition was confirmed by a decree of Emperor Wilhelm II dated 3 September 1902. The names which had been given to elements of the inner fortifications were transferred to forts in the new outer ring, although some of the forts received new names.|$|R
50|$|As to {{the second}} case, Goldstone AJ found that the {{alternative}} claim appeared to be one for damages {{as an alternative to}} specific performance. The value of the goods had to be determined at the date of judgment: Such claim could not be for a <b>liquidated</b> <b>demand.</b> He held, accordingly, that it was also necessary for the plaintiff to lead evidence to establish the value of the shirts at the date of judgment in order to be entitled to default judgment for the amount of the alternative claim.|$|E
50|$|A simple summons is a {{document}} which contains the basis (the particulars of the claim) for the plaintiff's {{action in the}} body of the summons. The simple summons is the High Court equivalent of the ordinary summons in the Magistrate's Court. A combined summons, on the other hand, has a more detailed and separate document containing the particulars of claim and is annexed to the summons. As a general rule, the simple summons is used where the claim is for a debt or a <b>liquidated</b> <b>demand.</b> There are certain matters for which a combined summons is prescribed: for example, in divorce matters. In the High Court, however, it is customary only to use a simple summons when one is certain that it is appropriate to do so.|$|E
5000|$|In 1797, {{he insisted}} that the bank was fully {{competent}} to <b>liquidate</b> all the <b>demands</b> that could be brought against it, and recommended that Â£3,000,000 should {{be added to the}} capital, to enable the directors to discount to such an amount as would accommodate the commercial world.He was well disposed to the Greville ministry, which made him a baronet on 9 Apr 1806. John accepted this on the condition that he might pass it on to his nephew John William. This was granted and John William in gratitude chose the family motto to with it [...] "Auctor pretiosa facit" [...] (the giver makes the gift precious). He was listed amongst the [...] "staunch friends" [...] of the abolition of the slave trade at around the same time.His nephew wrote of him [...] "he was an excellent man of business and a genial, kind friend. He was fond of horses and hunting and used to drive 4 Greys into the City from his house in St James Place, which he had purchased in 1802 with Samuel Rogers the poet; Sir John taking two-thirds and Mr Rogers one-third.|$|R
5000|$|In Classical Economics, {{the chief}} {{economic}} concern of all economists according to Thomas Sowell (On Classical Economics, 2006, pp. 22) {{was how to}} generate and sustain stable economic growth on a national level. Each factory-producer's basic concern is of maximizing return on investment through sales. Yet, concern was also expressed that savings (and not spending money by the wealthy classes) or production of the wrong items contrary to market demand would produce a nationwide economic glut (a.k.a. recession/depression) because of the un-purchased (unconsumed) products which result in unemployment, idle factories, low national output, and wealth fleeting from the nation. Some theorized that a general glut is then (in the basic case over time) avoidable and not inevitable. Say's Law says, Since [...] "savings equals investment" [...] in a bank or other wise, money is always spent and ultimately reinvested into more or newer production activities which generates demand (both for the production resources and the items produced). Say's Law: Since [...] "demand is always present," [...] then, [...] "production generates its own demand." [...] Then if a glut exists, producers must react to market <b>demand</b> <b>liquidating</b> glut items and produce the items the market desires. Demand will return and any remaining glut will then be distributed by the market. A company/country only needs to keep producing, or produce more wisely, or respond to market conditions with products that meet consumer's demands to avoid a (national recession/depression) glut.|$|R
