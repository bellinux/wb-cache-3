40|$|AbstractWe study a dual mixed {{formulation}} of the elasticity system in a polygonal domain of the plane with mixed boundary conditions and its numerical approximation. The (essential) Neumann boundary conditions (or traction boundary condition) are imposed using a discontinuous Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the trace of the displacement field. Moreover, a strain tensor is introduced as a new unknown and its symmetry is relaxed, also {{by the use of}} a Lagrange multiplier (the rotation). The singular behaviour of the solution requires us to use refined meshes to restore optimal rates of convergence. Uniform error estimates in the <b>Lamé</b> <b>coefficient</b> λ are obtained for large λ.

We show that the value of the first <b>Lamé</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the material constituting the shell has no marked influence on the value of the resonance frequency of the core-shell resonator, that is, it does not necessarily need to be small for satisfying the condition of subwavelength resonator dimension at resonance. Moreover, we show that the larger the density contrast between the core and the shell and the thinner the shell, the broader is the frequency band over which the effective density of the resonator suspension is negative, but that it is practically useless to decrease the dimensionless shell thickness below 0. 6. Finally, we show that the dissipation is also less perceptible the thinner is the shell and the larger is the density contrast. The effect of the density contrast between the core and the shell and of the dissipation on the resonance width are explained by comparing with the harmonic oscillator and the mass-in-mass 1 D lattice...|$|E

40|$|Localization of {{elastic waves}} in {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) media with random distributions of the <b>Lamé</b> <b>coefficients</b> (the shear and bulk moduli) is studied, using extensive numerical simulations. We compute the frequency-dependence {{of the minimum}} positive Lyapunov exponent γ (the inverse of the localization length) using the transfer-matrix method, the density of states utilizing the force-oscillator method, and the energy-level statistics of the media. The results indicate that all the states may be localized in the 2 D media, up to the disorder width and the smallest frequencies considered, although the numerical results also hint at {{the possibility that there}} might a small range of the allowed frequencies over which a mobility edge might exist. In the 3 D media, however, most of the states are extended, with {{only a small part of}} the spectrum in the upper band tail that contains localized states, even if the <b>Lamé</b> <b>coefficients</b> are randomly distributed. Thus, the 3 D heterogeneous media still possess a mobility edge. If both <b>Lamé</b> <b>coefficients</b> vary spatially in the 3 D medium, the localization length Λ follows a power law near the mobility edge, Λ∼(Ω-Ω_c) ^-ν, where Ω_c is the critical frequency.

Let Ω ⊂ R 2 be a bounded smooth domain and σ 0 ⊂ Ω be a simple smooth curve of class C 3. For a positive small ε, consider a subset of Ω, ωε: = {x ∈ Ω: d (x, σ 0) < ε}.

50|$|A common {{application}} {{to this is}} {{the evaluation of the}} potential energy as function of the strain tensor, within the framework of linear elasticity. Exhausting the above theorem the free energy of the system reduces to a function of 3 scalar parameters rather than 6. Within linear elasticity the free energy has to be quadratic in the tensor's elements, which eliminates an additional scalar. Thus, for an isotropic material only two independent parameters are needed to describe the elastic properties, known as <b>Lamé</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Consequently, experimental fits and computational efforts may be eased significantly.|$|R
