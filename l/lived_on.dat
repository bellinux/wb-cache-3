5|$|The Choiseul pigeon was {{non-migratory}} and {{is thought}} to have <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> the forest floor in lowland forests, including coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. The Choiseul pigeon is usually considered to have been endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands off the coast of New Guinea, where the only specimens were collected. The specimens Meek acquired were likely collected near Choiseul Bay {{in the northern part of}} the island. The last reports of the species from the indigenous population came from the Kolombangara River. It also reportedly <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> the neighboring islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita, and it is suspected that it may once have <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> Bougainville Island. However, these reports were never confirmed and must be considered anecdotal. It would be considered very unusual if the Choiseul pigeon were truly endemic to Choiseul as the island hosts no other endemic species, and the pigeon was never linked ecologically with another species on the island.|$|E
