5|$|The Japanese Navy used five Ko-hyoteki-class midget {{submarines}} in {{an unsuccessful}} operation against US battleships during {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor. The navy hoped that upgrades to the submarines, intensified crew training, and {{the selection of a}} less well defended target would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> results and an increased chance of the crews of the midgets to return alive from their mission. Therefore, on 16 December 1941, the navy initiated plans for a second midget submarine operation.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{complicated}} relationship between prospective memory and time management skills which include making lists, scheduling activities, and avoiding interruptions. Studies have not identified distinct cause and effect relationships between prospective memory and time management, but many consistent correlations have been observed. For example, people who reported better prospective memory according to the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) also indicated a higher likelihood of setting goals and priorities and being more organized. There may be a cyclical effect between prospective memory and time management: better memory may <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> organization, and better organization may further <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> memory.|$|E

25|$|From {{the above}} {{examples}} {{one can see}} why understanding of referred pain can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> diagnoses of various conditions and diseases. In 1981 physiotherapist Robin McKenzie described what he termed centralization. He concluded that centralization occurs when referred pain moves from a distal to a more proximal location. Observations {{in support of this}} idea were seen when patients would bend backward and forward during an examination.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{with a low}} {{heart rate}} prior to {{pacemaker}} implantation are more at risk of developing pacemaker syndrome. Normally the first chamber of the heart (atrium) contracts as the second chamber (ventricle) is relaxed, allowing the ventricle to fill before it contracts and pumps blood out of the heart. When the timing between the two chambers goes out of synchronization, less blood is delivered on each beat. Patients who develop pacemaker syndrome may require adjustment of the pacemaker, or fitting of another <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> coordinate the timing of atrial and ventricular contraction.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{emotional}} approach coping may {{signal to the}} social environment that an individual {{is in need of}} support. The responsiveness of the social environment will determine the adaptiveness {{of emotional}} approach coping. Emotional expression that is met with empathetic concern may <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> adjustment than emotional expression met by rejection. Some evidence from the research suggests this could be a potential mechanism. For women with breast cancer who perceive their social environment to be highly receptive, coping through emotional expression predicts improved quality of life.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also argued}} that this {{augmented}} understanding of etiology will <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> remediation and rehabilitation strategies through {{an understanding of the}} different levels in the causal process where one can intervene. It may be that non-organic interventions, like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), better attenuate disorders alone or in conjunction with drugs. Linden's (2006) demonstration of how psychotherapy has neurobiological commonalities with pharmacotherapy is a pertinent example of this and is encouraging from a patient perspective as the potentiality for pernicious side effects is decreased while self-efficacy is increased.|$|E

The organisation soon adopted a radical new form of study, implementing experiments on live highways. This method resulted in improvements to surfacing materials, road marking paint, and non-skid treatments. The laboratory was significantly enlarged in 1946 and took on a wider remit to investigate road safety and traffic management. Research in this area <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>better</b> tyre materials, zebra crossings, speed limits, and laws regarding the wearing of safety helmets and seat belts. The RRL also investigated headlight dazzle and braking distances.|$|E
