40|$|Although workers, employers, and {{insurance}} companies by 1910 supported the adoption of workers' compensation, they fiercely debated the specific features of the legislation. In this paper we examine how workers' compensation benefit levels were determined {{in the political process}} of forging compromises across interest groups, and even within individual groups. A quantitative analysis of the benefit levels in each state between the time of adoption and 1930 shows several important trends. Employers in dangerous industries effectively imposed <b>limits</b> on <b>accident</b> <b>benefits,</b> while organized labor and the commissions that administered the laws were instrumental in achieving higher expected benefit levels. Political reformers that gained control of state legislatures {{in the early twentieth century}} aided organized labor in achieving their goal of improving workers' compensation <b>accident</b> <b>benefits.</b> The paper also presents case-studies of the political struggle over benefits that occurred in" three states [...] Ohio, Minnesota, and Missouri. These qualitative descriptions of the fight over benefit levels provide a more detailed picture of the political process through which workers' compensation was created because the cross-state quantitative study largely abstracts away from the political nuances that shaped workers' compensation legislation. ...|$|R

METHODS: Records of benefit decisions from the National Benefits System of the National Social Security Institute for the State of Bahia in 2000 were utilized. Occupational accidents were defined {{in accordance with the}} clinical diagnoses of External Causes, Injuries and Poisoning (SS- 00 to T 99) of the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision, and with the benefit type, which distinguishes between occupational and non-occupational health problems. RESULTS: A total of 31, 096 benefits granted due to illnesses or health problems were studied. Of these, 2, 857 (7. 3 %) were caused by work accidents. Greater proportions were found among workers in the manufacturing, construction, electricity and gas industries, accounting for 18 % of the total benefits. The costs of occupational <b>accident</b> <b>benefits</b> were estimated to be R$ 8. 5 million, with around half a million work days lost during the year studied.

In this study, roads were classified into 4 groups based on lanes, roads level and the existence of median barriers.
