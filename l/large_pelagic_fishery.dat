30|$|More {{stratified}} conditions, {{along with}} acidification {{of the upper}} 300  m layer (Fig.  7), shoaling of the oxycline (Fig.  8) and declining oxygen concentrations will directly contribute to increasing fish kill incidents (Fig.  13) and habitat compression for pelagic fishes over Omani shelf. This habitat compression is likely {{the cause of the}} reduced variability in sardine landings (Fig.  11). Oxygen concentrations below 3.5  ml L− 1 are stressful for many <b>larger</b> tropical <b>pelagic</b> fish (Prince and Goodyear 2006; Stramma et al. 2012). Oxygen and a shoaling oxycline both result in pelagic populations compressed in the upper layer. This increases they susceptibility to trawling and traditional fishing practices. Consequently, artisanal landings of pelagic species in Oman are tightly linked to hydrophysical processes and their changes over the last 50  years. Landings for 13 major groups of <b>large</b> <b>pelagic</b> species (Yellowfin tuna, Longtail tuna, Kawakawa, Stripped bonito, Frigate tuna, Other tuna, Skipjack, Kingfish, Queenfish, Baracuda, Cobia, Sailfish, and Large jacks) displayed positive trends through the past 20  years (Fishery Statistics Book 2012). However, rising landings (markedly driven by increased number of boats) might end soon. A shoaling oxycline (Fig.  8) could reach an ecological threshold of oxygen depletion in the upper 50  m layer, pushing hypoxic waters further onto the Omani shelf in the coming decades. Further shoaling could cause a gradual decline or even a collapse of <b>large</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fisheries</b> as many species will move offshore. This is a critical issue as the artisanal fishery, accounting for 96  % of Omani landings, represents the cornerstone of the national industry, directly employing around 40, 000 fishermen (Fishery Statistics Book 2012; Piontkovski et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to obtain scientific advice {{for the purpose of}} implementing the EUPOA on sharks as regards the facilitation of monitoring fisheries and shark stock assessment on a species-specific level in the high seas. The study was focused on major elasmobranch species caught by both artisanal and industrial <b>large</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fisheries</b> on the High Seas of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific area, which are currently monitored and potentially managed by respective Tuna RFMOs. Estimated “potential” shark species catch in the Indian Ocean is around 160, 000 t for 22, 000 t. presently declared (7 times higher than declared). Considering all sharks that are not reported at species level, the total amount of shark declared was around 100, 000 tons and, thus, the underreporting reduced to 1. 6 times higher. 19 fisheries among the 195 fisheries found in IOTC database generate 86 % of potential investigated shark catches. In the Indian Ocean, Gillnet (GN) and a composition of Gillnet and Longline (GN-LL) are the most impacting one with 61 % of the total estimated studied shark species catches (97, 000 t). It is followed by longline (LL and LL-swo) with 18 % and other métiers (OTH) with 12 %, which precise gear composition is unknown. The blue shark is estimated to be the major shark catch in the Indian Ocean followed by silky shark, threshers, Oceanic whitetip, shortfin mako and hammerheads sharks. The research framework to be proposed is organized in three steps: (i) estimation of shark catches by species using the method proposed here which allows identifying the most impacted shark species and the métier most affecting those species; (ii) a preliminary Ecological Risk Assessment (or other preliminary assessment based on fishery indicators) by fleets which allows to identify the most vulnerable species to focus the efforts in conjunction with point (i); and (iii) specific recommendations of how to apply possible management measures, to improve data collection and assessment of those fleets/species identified as priorities based on points (ii) and (iii).

40|$|International audienceThe Humboldt Current System (HCS) sustains the world′s <b>largest</b> small <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery.</b> While {{a cooling}} {{of this system}} has been {{observed}} during recent decades, there is debate about the potential impacts of rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations on upwelling dynamics and productivity. Recent studies suggest that under increased atmospheric CO 2 scenarios the oceanic stratification may strongly increase and upwelling-favorable winds may remain nearly constant off Peru and increase off Chile. Here we investigate the impact of such climatic conditions on egg and larval dispersal phases, a key stage of small pelagic fish reproduction. We used larval retention rate in a predefined nursery area to provide a proxy for the recruitment level. Numerical experiments are based on hydrodynamics downscaled to the HCS from global simulations forced by pre-industrial (PI), 2 × CO 2 and 4 × CO 2 scenarios. A biogeochemical model {{is applied to the}} PI and 4 × CO 2 scenarios to define a time-variable nursery area where larval survival is optimum. We test two distinct values of the oxycline depth that limits larval vertical distribution: One corresponding to the present-day situation and the other corresponding to a shallower oxycline potentially produced by climate change. It appeared that larval retention over the continental shelf increases with enhanced stratification due to regional warming. However, this increase in retention is largely compensated for by a decrease of the nursery area and the shoaling of the oxycline. The underlying dynamics are explained by a combination of stratification effects and mesoscale activity changes. Our results therefore show that future climate change may significantly reduce fish capacity in the HCS with strong ecological, economic and social consequences...|$|R

According {{to the landing}} statistics provided by countries to FAO, dolphinfish ranked seventh overall in reported average annual landings of <b>large</b> <b>pelagic</b> fishes in the Western Central Atlantic from 1989 to 1993. Yellowfin tuna, Spanish mackerel, skipjack tuna, king mackerel, swordfish and Atlantic bonito ranked ahead of dolphinfish. There is a trend of increasing total annual landings from about 1, 700 mt in 1970 - 74 to about 2, 800 mt in 1989 - 1993.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> of Northern Chile, estimating harvesting {{functions that}} contribute to understand why rather poor incentives to exit may predominate in <b>pelagic</b> <b>fisheries,</b> despite scarcer fish stocks. Our results show that per‐vessel catch's stock sensitivity (the catch‐to‐biomass elasticity value) varies negatively with stock levels. Stock levels preceding a marked fall into biological overfishing would have been associated to biomass elasticities lower than the unitary value. This suggests that during catch bonanza periods, catch‐per‐unit‐of‐effort would fail to detect a rapidly declining stock trend, increasing the risk of fishing collapse. Moreover, external economies in search efforts would have reduced the incentives to exit, particularly for the smaller vessels in our sample. Finally, we find evidence of either constant or increasing marginal returns {{in the use of}} per‐vessel fishing effort, which suggests that inefficiency in production has resulted from direct restrictions upon fishing effort. Overall, our findings provide consistent evidence that enhances the necessity of more efficient regulations upon harvesting in <b>pelagic</b> <b>fisheries...</b>|$|R

Despite major conservation concerns about this species, little is known about its genetic status and level of demographic or evolutionary connectivity among its regional distributions. We report a genetic assessment of silky sharks sampled across a major portion of the species’ global range. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial DNA control region from 276 individuals taken from the western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans and the Red Sea. Overall, haplotype and nucleotide diversities were relatively large (0. 93 ± 0. 01 and 0. 61 ± 0. 32 %, respectively). Nucleotide diversity in Indo-Pacific sharks, however, was significantly lower and about half that in Atlantic sharks. Strong phylogeographic partitioning occurred between ocean basins. Furthermore, shallow but significant pairwise statistical differentiation occurred among most regional samples within the Indo-Pacific, but not the western Atlantic. Overall, at least five mitochondrial DNA populations of silky sharks were identified globally.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade there has been global concern about the bycatch of seabirds, turtles and sharks in fishing operations, in {{particular}} longline and trawl fisheries, which have been widely held responsible for their declining population s and threatened conservation status. This thesis addresses the issue of bycatch in a holistic manner, {{taking into account that}} species, whether they be target or non-target, do not exist in isolation from each other and their environment. South African fisheries incidentally catch approximately 21 000 seabirds, 165 turtles and 43 000 pelagic sharks per year, including 21 Endangered species. Decreasing CPUE and size-frequency data for Blue Prionace glauca and Short- finned Mako Sharks Isurus oxyrinchus caught in the <b>large</b> <b>pelagic</b> longline <b>fishery</b> suggests exploitation of these species is unsustainable. A decreasing trend in the biomass index was also observed for the Yellow-spotted Catshark Scyliorhinus capensis and the Biscuit Skate Raja. straeleni. An argument for the likelihood of fisheries mortality contributing to the slower than expected turtle population recovery rates is presented, which is supported by results from satellite tracking of Leatherback Turtles Dermochelys coriacea indicating a high degree of overlap with fishing effort. Satellite tracking of Black-browed Thalassarche melanophrys and White-capped T. steadi Albatrosses reveal striking differences in their foraging patterns and presents evidence that Black-browed Albatrosses, in particular, forage to a large extent on natural prey, despite the availability of discards from fishing vessels in the Benguela. Therefore, given the high albatross mortality in the trawl fishery, the benefit of a management decision to limit discarding as a mitigation measure is likely to outweigh the disadvantage of reduced food supply. Reducing bycatch is dependent on the development of effective and relatively inexpensive methods which do not impact on target catches and/or other vulnerable species. In the demersal longline fishery, two methods of optimising line sink rates to reduce seabird bycatch were investigated: increasing mass of weights and decreasing the spacing between weights. This study indicated that while the target species is unlikely to be affected by increased weighting, other vulnerable species of fish and sharks may be affected. Other mitigation experiments investigated line sinking rates and the use of circle hooks in <b>pelagic</b> longline <b>fisheries.</b> The implications of night setting on Swordfish Xiphias gladius catches, fishery closure during full moon and the appropriateness of the international standard 5 % fin to trunk ratio for the South African fishery, were also investigated.

40|$|In 2001 an {{individual}} (operationally transferable) quota system was introduced {{for all the}} most important industrial fisheries in Chile. This system {{was put in place}} after years of declining stocks and over investment. In this paper we describe this reform and estimate related allocative efficiency benefits for the most important industrial fishery in the country, the southern <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery.</b> Benefits were estimated using a bioeconomic model and Monte Carlo techniques. This approach allows benefits to be estimated using more realistic counterfactual scenarios than just comparing the fishery before and after the reform. Estimated discounted net benefits reach US$ 123 to US$ 366 million in the period 2001 to 2020. Fleet size fell from 148 active boats in 2000 to 65 in 2002 as a direct consequence of the reform. Among the interesting features of the recent Chilean experience is the way the political economy of the reform was facilitated by the prior introduction of de facto individual quotas within the framework of fishery research activities. When the authorities closed the southern <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> because of biological problems between 1997 and 2000, they organized ‘experimental’ fishing expeditions in which participant boats were given the right to fish a certain amount of resources per expedition. This pseudo quota system allowed fishermen to experience directly the benefits of individual quotas and that was instrumental to the political agreement leading to the reform. This successful gradual approach may be of interest to other countries planning to introduce individual quotas. Finally, {{it is important to note}} that the Chilean southern industrial <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> has average catches of over 1. 4 million tons a year, making it one of the largest fisheries in the world to be regulated by individual quotas.

In the same ecosystems, another issue attracts the attention of international tuna commissions: the use of drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs).

The use of modern smoking techniques coupled with effective distribution systems can undoubtedly reduce waste. However, these are often not within the reach of most artisanal processors. It is proposed that the organised private sector should invest on simple but proven processing equipment such as smoking kilns. The inshore pelagic fish species and other small fishes can sustain cottage canning industries sited in fishing villages/settlements while larger canning factories {{should be based on}} offshore resources. Modalities for successful investments are highlighted, while a major consideration is given to joint venture...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{fisheries}} {{are recognized}} as one of the greatest threats to shark populations worldwide, but factors affecting the likelihood of shark mortality during fishery capture are poorly understood. We used the U. S. <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> logbook data from 1992 through 2008 to quantify the effects of several variables (fisheries regulatory periods, geographic zone, target catch, and sea surface temperature) on mortality of blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier). Mortality rates and trends in both species closely matched those recorded from other sources, and therefore indicated that the data on sharks discarded dead and discarded alive in the U. S. <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> logbook are accurate. The introduction of fisheries management regulations (fin weight to carcass weight ratios in 1993 [to prevent finning] and the prohibition of J-hooks in 2004) presumably decreased the immediate mortality rate of captured blue and tiger sharks (by 8. 0 % in blue sharks after 2004 and 4. 4 % in tiger sharks after 1993). Other factors that we examined had a statistically significant effect on mortality, but additional variables should be recorded or made available in logbook data to enable the determination of other causes of mortality. Our results show that the U. S. <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> logbook data can be used as a powerful tool in future studies of the immediate mortality of longline-caught animals...|$|R
