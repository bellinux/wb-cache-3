5000|$|For {{some time}} Union Connector {{produced}} 2P&G connectors with a distinctive yellow cover that featured a locking tab {{in the ground}} pin that provided a positive mechanical lock to prevent accidental disengagement of the connectors. This design required special connectors on both {{the male and female}} side in order to work, meaning that all connectors in an installation would need to be replaced to see a real benefit to the <b>locking</b> <b>feature.</b> The expense of this proposition as well as the unpopularity of the connector itself among technicians led the <b>locking</b> <b>feature</b> to eventually be dropped, and locking connectors are no longer manufactured. The locking connectors that are still found occasionally in installations or spare parts bins are often referred to as [...] "Union Connectors", though the Union Connector brand now features only standard non-locking stage pin connectors.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the Animas Ping {{which has}} a <b>locking</b> <b>feature</b> that is undone by {{pressing}} both {{the up and down}} arrow buttons, the Deltec Cozmo had a number <b>locking</b> <b>feature.</b> The purpose of this feature was somewhat defeated by pump trainers encouraging the use of 14 as the code number. The Deltec Cozmo also used a different scrolling mechanism than the Animas Ping. On the Ping pump holding down the up or down button causes a change in one number then increments by five and on the Ping meter the numbers slowly climb to 5 then abruptly change speed, going from 5 to 110 in the same time it took to go from 0-5; on the Cozmo the scrolling speed slowly accelerated the longer the button was held down. This allowed the pumper to get to high values relatively fast and then still get to the exact value they wanted.|$|E

50|$|As a {{prevention}} system against account hackers, Perfect World has a Phone <b>Lock</b> <b>feature</b> {{for those}} who wish to use it. The Phone Lock, when activated, will freeze an account until the player of that account dials in using the registered phone number. Once the number is recognized, the account is temporarily activated for login. The player must login within 10 minutes of activation before the account login is frozen again. The player may continue to play despite the freeze. If the player logs out after the 10 minutes are up, that player must once again dial in to temporarily deactivate the Phone Lock. The phone <b>lock</b> <b>feature</b> is exclusive to the Chinese Malaysian version of the game.|$|R

They also have a door closure system that closes the doors automatically when the vehicle starts moving, and keeps them closed while driving.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the risk}} of camera movement, the camera is most often mounted on a tripod for the {{duration}} of the exposure. While it's generally possible to use the shutter release button on the camera itself, a cable release or electronic remote is often used to further eliminate the risk of shaking the camera during the long exposure. The cable releases generally include a <b>locking</b> <b>feature</b> to eliminate the need to keep the button or plunger depressed during extremely long exposures.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{computerized}} sets {{cannot be}} connected end-to-end. However, some newer sets contain special miniature plugs - a female jack {{is located at}} the end of the set, and a male plug is located between the control box and the beginning of the actual lights. By disconnecting the control box from one set, it can now be plugged into the end of an identical chasing set to produce a longer strand of chasing lights. These plugs generally have a twist-on <b>locking</b> <b>feature</b> similar to that found on garden hoses.|$|E
50|$|ControlTrac has {{different}} drive modes {{as well as}} different operational behavior for those drive modes depending on which vehicle it is used in. For example, the Ford Expedition used a new auto <b>lock</b> <b>feature</b> in Auto mode. Auto mode with auto lock was not available on the Explorer at that time.|$|R
50|$|In 1908, they {{patented}} the detachable <b>lock</b> <b>feature</b> {{with small}} lever, for sidelock shotguns. The last major {{development in the}} evolution of the sidelock side-by-side gun occurred in 1922, when the H&H assisted-opening mechanism was patented. This gun, the self-opening Royal side-by-side, has been hugely influential in gun-making throughout the world.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{ubiquitous}} computing has been rapidly emerged {{in our lives}} and extensive {{studies have been conducted}} in a variety of areas related to smart devices, such as tablets, smartphones, smart TVs, smart refrigerators, and smart media devices, as a measure for realizing the {{ubiquitous computing}}. In particular, smartphones have significantly evolved from the traditional feature phones. Increasingly higher-end smartphone models that can perform a range of functions are now available. Smart devices have become widely popular since they provide high efficiency and great convenience for not only private daily activities but also business endeavors. Rapid advancements have been achieved in smart device technologies to improve the end users’ convenience. Consequently, many people increasingly rely on smart devices to store their valuable and important data. With this increasing dependence, an important aspect that must be addressed is security issues. Leaking of private information or sensitive business data due to loss or theft of smart devices could result in exorbitant damage. To mitigate these security threats, basic embedded <b>locking</b> <b>features</b> are provided in smart devices. However, these <b>locking</b> <b>features</b> are vulnerable. In this paper, an original security-locking scheme using a rhythm-based locking system (RLS) is proposed to overcome the existing security problems of smart devices. RLS is a user-authenticated system that addresses vulnerability issues in the existing <b>locking</b> <b>features</b> and provides secure confidentiality in addition to convenience...|$|R
50|$|Spherical {{bearings}} {{can be of}} a hydrostatic or mechanical construction. A {{spherical bearing}} by itself consists of an outer ring {{and an inner ring}} and a <b>locking</b> <b>feature</b> that makes the inner ring captive within the outer ring in the axial direction only. The outer surface of the inner ring and the inner surface of the outer ring are spherical (or more correctly, toroidal) and are collectively considered the raceway and they slide against each other, either with a lubricant, a maintenance-free (typically polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE) based liner, or they incorporate a rolling element such as a race of ball-bearings, allowing lower friction.|$|E
5000|$|Equipment content varied widely by market-including such {{features}} as six airbags (front, front side and air curtain), Anti-lock braking system (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Electronic Stability Control (ESC) with Traction Control System (TCS) & Brake Assist System (BAS), dual or tri-zone heating and cooling, [...] "walk through" [...] aisle between the front seats with fold-down tray, tilt/height adjustable steering wheel, Isofix anchor points, rear side sliding doors with [...] "hold open" [...] <b>locking</b> <b>feature</b> (to prevent {{an open door}} from inadvertently closing), second row power roll-down windows, third row 60/40-fold-in-floor seat (LWB only), power sliding doors and liftgate, backup sensors, and in-dash navigation.|$|E
50|$|Many theatres {{also use}} Edison plugs, {{which are the}} {{standard}} connector used in homes and businesses in North America, because of their availability {{and the ability to}} connect household fixtures to a theatrical control system. Twist-lock connectors are used in many theatres because of their <b>locking</b> <b>feature,</b> which will not allow fixtures to become accidentally disconnected. Connectors used to power lighting fixtures must be rated at 20 amperes or higher, depending on local electrical codes. Temporary high-power distribution wiring often employs camlock connectors to connect dimming equipment, power distribution units, controllers for motorized chain hoists, and other high-power equipment to a company switch, generator, or other tie-in point.|$|E

5000|$|The {{twist-on}} {{design has}} slots {{on the lid}} engaging with flanges on the body, similar to a lid on a glass jar, that works by placing the lid on the pot and twisting it about 30° to lock it in place. A common modern design, it has easily implemented <b>locking</b> <b>features</b> that prevent {{the removal of the}} lid while under pressure.|$|R
50|$|TransTrem is {{a guitar}} vibrato system {{developed}} by Steinberger in 1984. Its main feature {{is to maintain}} the pitch of each string at the proper tuning interval to the others when the vibrato ("Whammy bar") is used. This allows entire chords to have their pitch bent while remaining in tune, whereas a conventional vibrato system would cause the strings {{to go out of}} tune with each other. The system also allows transposition of the pitch of the guitar as a whole: the pitch of all the strings can be raised or lowered from the standard EADGBE tuning and locked into one of several preset positions. The Washburn Wonderbar from the 1980s attempted a similar approach (sans the <b>locking</b> <b>feature)</b> with far less success.|$|E
5000|$|In first-person shooter (FPS) games, {{the scroll}} wheel is usually set to change weapons. Because of this some gaming mice, such as Logitech G500, {{implement}} a <b>locking</b> <b>feature</b> that lets the mouse switch between scrolling in steps (needed for gaming) and continuous scrolling (good for web browsing). The scroll wheel is also sometimes {{used to control}} the zoom of scoped weapons and binoculars. FPS games {{with an emphasis on}} realism may choose to use the wheel for changing between stances or adjusting the range settings on iron sights. Since the introduction of tilting scroll-wheels, many FPS games use the left-right motion of the scroll wheel to cause the player to lean left and right. [...] A less common use is to use the mouse wheel to adjust the player's speed of movement.|$|E
5000|$|The Torsen T-3 is {{currently}} employed as the centre differential in all non-Haldex Traction Audi models with a ZF-sourced automatic transmission Quattro four-wheel drive, such as: Audi A6, Audi A7, and Audi Q7. Audi uses a mechanical [...] "Crown Wheel" [...] centre differential for all longitudinal implementations using dual-clutch transmissions, {{such as the}} 2013/14 S4/RS4. Alfa Romeo used a Torsen C twin differential in the Alfa Romeo 156 Crosswagon Q4 {{and also in the}} 159, Alfa Romeo Brera and Spider Q4 models. Also, Toyota uses a Torsen T-3 in the center differential of the 4Runner Limited, FJ Cruiser 6-speed manual, Land Cruiser and Lexus GX470, with manual <b>locking</b> <b>feature,</b> and General Motors used a Torsen T-3 center differential in the transfer case of the Chevrolet TrailBlazer SS and Saab 9-7X (Aero model only).|$|E
