40|$|AbstractThis study {{estimated}} the operational impacts of left-turn waiting areas at signalized intersections using the VISSIM simulation technique. A procedure was proposed to model capacity of single <b>left-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> with waiting areas in VISSIM. Using {{data collected from}} 7 different sites, the VISSIM simulation model was calibrated and validated. The simulation results of the calibrated VISSIM model were compared to field measured capacity, {{as well as the}} capacity estimated using the analytical model developed in our previous studies. The calibrated VISSIM simulation model yields a Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) of 8. 28 % for the exclusive <b>left-turn</b> <b>lanes,</b> indicating that VISSIM provides reasonable capacity estimates for <b>left-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> with waiting areas at signalized intersections. Based on the calibrated VISSIM simulation model, the capacity for <b>left-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> with waiting areas with different storage capacity was compared with the scenario for which the left-turn waiting area is not installed. The results show that the use of left-turn waiting areas could increase the capacity for the left-turn movement, and the capacity gains would increase with the increase {{in the size of the}} left-turn waiting areas...|$|R

40|$|Motor vehicle crashes have {{increasingly}} become a serious concern for highway safety engineers and transportation agencies {{over the past}} few decades. This serious concern has led to a great deal of research activities. One of these activities is to develop safety analysis tools, specifically crash prediction models, for the purpose of reducing crashes and enhancing highway safety. Crash prediction models based on statistical or econometric modeling techniques are used for a variety of purposes; most commonly to estimate the expected crash frequencies from various roadway entities (highways, intersections, interstates, etc.) and also to identify geometric, environmental, and operations factors that are associated with crashes. A comprehensive review of prior literature indicates that many researchers have mainly focused on the development of aggregate crash prediction models based on single equation estimation techniques to identify the influences of geometric, environmental, and traffic variables on a single counted outcome. In some cases, however, more than one dependent variable might be of interest and hence several equations are formulated at the same time. Such a multiple equation structure may require simultaneous (or joint) estimation techniques under some situations. This dissertation research develops simultaneous estimation approaches to account for contemporaneous correlation and endogeneity problems in crash data. Specifically, seemingly unrelated negative binomial models and simultaneous equation models are developed to account for contemporaneous correlation between the disturbance terms across crash type models and to control for the endogenous relationship between the presence of <b>left-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> and angle crashes. Modeling crash types may provide certain advantages to gain insights as to 1) identification of high-risk sites with respect to specific types of crashes, which is not revealed through crash totals, and 2) the differences between conditions that lead to various crash types, but the disturbance terms across crash types might be contemporaneously correlated due to the unobserved common characteristics. Therefore, individual and simultaneous crash type models were estimated and the results of both models were compared. The results showed that a simultaneous estimation approach provides more efficient estimators relative to a single equation estimation technique. The presence of <b>left-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> has been treated as exogenous in crash prediction models, but in fact they are affecting each other. The bi-directional relationship between <b>left-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> and crashes results in endogeneity. This research investigated the endogenous relationship between <b>left-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> and crashes and developed simultaneous equation models to control for the endogeneity. The findings indicated that the presence of <b>left-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> is endogenously associated with crashes and the real effect of <b>left-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> on crashes can be obtained by controlling for endogeneity...|$|R

40|$|When left-turning {{vehicles}} are {{released from the}} multiple <b>left-turning</b> <b>lanes</b> at the signalized intersection, there will be conflicts among them, and the conflicts will affect the traffic operation and safety. In order to solve the problem, by extracting running trajectories of left-turning vehicles and analyzing distribution characteristics of trajectories, velocity changing characteristics, and flow changing characteristics, the left-turning vehicle’s trajectory model was established. On {{the basis of the}} above research, taking an example of quadruple <b>left-turning</b> <b>lanes,</b> the idea of setting left-turning guide line at the intersection was proposed.

The sight distance available to each left-turn driver was computed at these study sites. Also, the gap acceptance of the left-turn drivers was investigated. The results of the study showed that left-turn drivers position their vehicles in such a manner as to achieve adequate sight distance. A relationship among left-turn accident rates, availability of sight distance, and gap acceptance was also found.
