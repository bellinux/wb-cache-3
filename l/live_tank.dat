50|$|Current {{transformers}} {{are used}} for protection, measurement and control in high-voltage electrical substations and the electrical grid. Current transformers may be installed inside switchgear or in apparatus bushings, but very often free-standing outdoor current transformers are used. In a switchyard, <b>live</b> <b>tank</b> current transformers have {{a substantial part of}} their enclosure energized at the line voltage and must be mounted on insulators. Dead tank current transformers isolate the measured circuit from the enclosure. <b>Live</b> <b>tank</b> CTs are useful because the primary conductor is short, which gives better stability and a higher short-circuit current rating. The primary of the winding can be evenly distributed around the magnetic core, which gives better performance for overloads and transients. Since the major insulation of a live-tank current transformer is not exposed to the heat of the primary conductors, insulation life and thermal stability is improved.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} the {{operating}} times of high voltage SF 6 <b>live</b> <b>tank</b> circuit breakers are tested using standard timing tests. The time measurements obtained {{have proven to}} be adequate to the normal distribution. The hypothesis testing methodology is applied {{in order to determine the}} mean difference value between the tested phase operating times. The results obtained showed that the time difference between the operating times of the tested circuit breakers is located between - 0. 661 and 0. 536 ms, which indicates that the operating mechanism of the breakers is still reliable and in good condition...|$|E
30|$|According {{to another}} {{standard}} IEC- 62271, breaker inherent breaking time is usually {{provided by the}} manufacturer. As for the 500  kV level breakers, i.e. Siemens Germany 3 AP <b>live</b> <b>tank</b> circuit breaker is not more than two fundamental cycles 40  ms [29], Pinggao Electric China LW 6 - 550 series breaker has an inherent breaking time of 28  ms [30]. And the triggering pulse for modern power electronic devices can be as fast as less than 10  ms [31, 32], which is sufficient to implement the proposed transformer EIS control method before the contact separation of breakers so as to interrupt a comparatively small short-circuit fault current.|$|E
40|$|Contact erosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial factors {{affecting}} the electrical service lifetime of high-voltage circuit breakers (HVCBs). On-line monitoring the contacts’ erosion degree is increasingly in demand for the sake of condition based maintenance to guarantee the functional operation of HVCBs. A spectroscopic monitoring system has been designed based upon a commercial 245 kV/ 40 kA S F 6 <b>live</b> <b>tank</b> circuit breaker with copper–tungsten (28 wt % and 72 wt %) arcing contacts at atmospheric S F 6 pressure. Three optical-fibre based sensors are used to capture the time-resolved spectra of arcs. A novel approach using chromatic methods to process the time-resolved spectral signal has been proposed. The processed chromatic parameters have been interpreted to show that the time variation of spectral emission from the contact material and quenching gas are closely correlated to the mass loss and surface degradation of the plug arcing contact. The feasibility of applying this method to online monitoring of contact erosion is indicated...|$|E

2500|$|Mega Man 9 is an action-platform game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the titular character and must complete a number of 2D side-scrolling stages. The start of the game presents a select screen of eight stages from which the player can choose to complete in any order desired. Within each stage, the player advances by running, jumping, avoiding traps, shooting enemies and mini-bosses, and ultimately battling the Robot Master boss at the end. Mega Man begins with a [...] "Mega Buster" [...] arm-cannon weapon, but as each boss is defeated, a unique weapon is added to his arsenal. Because each Robot Master is weak to a specific weapon, the player may strategize the order which the stages are cleared. The player also begins the game with the option to call on Mega Man's dog Rush, who can transform into a [...] "Coil" [...] springboard for jumping higher or a [...] "Jet" [...] for transversing long distances in the air. Mega Man's health, his special weapons, and his Rush options are all limited by energy gauges that can be refilled by picking up items found throughout each level. Special screws can also be picked up and used to buy items at Auto's shop between stages. These items include extra <b>lives,</b> <b>tanks</b> that refill energy, and one-time-use items that call on Mega Man's companions Eddie and Beat for help.|$|R

40|$|Circuit {{breakers}} {{are one of}} {{the important}} equipments used by electricity transmission utilities. With the various options of interrupting media and energy storage there are many different types of circuit breakers available to purchase in the market. In general, the equipment acquisition process used by industry does not take into consideration the assets whole of life cycle such as operational requirements, maintenance needs, operating conditions and risk consequences. Maintenance and risk need to be considered prior to making any procurement decision. This paper presents a Life Cycle approach to assist decision-making when purchasing outdoor dead or <b>live</b> <b>tank</b> circuit breakers in electricity transmission utilities. Whole of life cycle phases are considered during the model construction using AS IEC 60300. 3. 3 - 2005 (Australian Standard "Dependability Management, Part 3. 3 : Application Guide - Life Cycle Costing"). The model has three main phases; acquisition, maintenance and disposal with detailed subheadings for each of the phase. During model construction, the relevant object structures are identified as contributing factors and then the cost is estimated over 40 years to enable NPV (net present value) analysis to comparedifferent equipment types, models and manufacturers on a total life cycle basis. In this paper the routine maintenance, dominant failures, potential refurbishment activities and likely risks are identified and captured in the model for informed, long term asset investment decision...|$|E

50|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} disputed, since the wooden box protecting a lead pipe along the longitudinal {{axis of the}} hull found on the wreck suggest {{the existence of a}} bilge well (Oleson and Stein 2007). Previous ships involved in <b>live</b> fish <b>tank</b> transport, entitled navis vivariae, did not employ a hydraulic system, and for this reason the hypothesis proves especially questionable (Boetto 124). For example, one of the wrecks found in Claudius’s harbor at the modern Fiumicino Airport in Italy was a small fish craft dating somewhere around the 2nd century CE. Archaeologists discovered a fish-well {{in the middle of the}} ship that used the hole/plump system bored in the bottom of the boat to fill the tank (Boetto 2006).
