40|$|According to European Community (2 ̆ 2 EC 2 ̆ 2) law, the {{initiative}} for legislation {{lies with the}} Commission of the European Communities (“Commission”). Therefore, on July 31, 1996, the Commission submitted to the Council of the European Union a “proposal for a Council regulation protecting against {{the effects of the}} application of certain legislation of certain third countries, and actions based thereon or resulting therefrom. ” After long and intensive discussions by the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Member States (“COREPER”) and at the ministerial level, which proved to be difficult due to political and legal reasons, the Council, during its October 28, 1996 session, arrived at a political agreement in Council Regulation 2771 / 96 (“Regulation”). The Regulation aimed to “protect[] against the effects of the extra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a third country, and actions based thereon or resulting therefrom. ” The Council based this Regulation on Articles 73 c, 113, and 235 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community (“EC Treaty”). The Council believed that this piece of Community legislation did not cover all areas of activities that needed protection, and, therefore, the Council also adopted a Joint Action based on Articles J. 3 and K. 3 of the Treaty on European Union (“TEU”). The official adoption of this Regulation and of this Joint Action by the Council took place on November 25, 1996 after <b>legal</b> <b>linguistic</b> <b>experts</b> had finalized the legal texts.

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} an {{automatic}} technique to help segment the Arabic texts while preserving the semantics. The technique {{is based on}} an empirical study on the sentences and clauses connectors. It has evolved from tedious analysis of various Arabic texts and from observations that have been noted {{over a long period of}} time. The analysis made it possible to realize the functionality of each connector in terms of separating standalone segments in the Arabic texts. This has lead to a categorization of active and passive connectors. We used the introduced notion of active and passive connectors to develop an algorithm that respects the semantic of the text to identify the segments of a given Arabic text. The algorithm has been implemented and experimented with. Various Arabic essays were segmented using the algorithm and the results were compared to that of manual segmentations performed by <b>linguistic</b> <b>experts.</b> The performance of the algorithm was in line with the manual segmentations that were performed by the <b>linguistic</b> <b>experts...</b>|$|R
