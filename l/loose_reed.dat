5000|$|James Bullough {{improved}} his loom by inventing various components, including the [...] "self-acting temple", which kept the woven cloth at its correct width, the weft fork (patented 1841 but disputed by Osbaldeston) and a <b>loose</b> <b>reed</b> {{that allowed the}} lathe to back away on encountering a shuttle trapped in the warp. Bullough also invented a simple but effective warning device which rang a bell every time the warp thread broke on his loom. He worked with William Kenworthy at Brookhouse Mills, with whom he applied his inventions to develop an improved power loom that {{became known as the}} Lancashire Loom.|$|E
50|$|The early textile trade {{relied on}} {{domestic}} outworking. Handloom weavers {{would take the}} yarn to their cottage loom shops, and return the completed fabric to the mill. Reliable power looms that could be worked from an overhead line shaft were not available before Kenworthy and Bulloughs weft stop motion, the roller temple and the <b>loose</b> <b>reed</b> {{which appeared in the}} 1840s. The first weaving floors were {{on the ground floor of}} the existing narrow mills, where the workpiece was lit by tall exterior windows. The weaving shed appeared around this time. They initially adjoined existing mills, and then were built as standalone mills by speculating investors or by industrial co-operatives of former handloom weavers. Either group would run the looms themselves or operate the shed as a room and power mill. Here as the name suggests, space was rented to other companies who could specialise in weaving with out the skills needed to finance, build and maintain a building. Weaving sheds were cheap to build and fireproof having no wooden beams. They were also safer, because their north-facing roof windows meant they were not as dependent on gas-lighting as were spinning mills.|$|E

In an hour when the sun begins to sink, the hounds will be <b>loosed</b> in yonder <b>reeds</b> and since the water is behind them, the lions will come out, and then we shall see." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s {{he began his}} {{collaboration}} with cornetist Josh Berman and drummer Mike Reed. Since then he was worked in the Chicago jazz and improvisation scene with multiple bands, including Rob Mazurek’s Starlicker and Exploding Star Orchestra, Mike <b>Reed’s</b> <b>Loose</b> Assembly, Josh Berman and His Gang, Nicole Mitchell’s Ice Crystal, James Falzone’s Klang and Ken Vandermark’s Topology and Audio One.|$|R
50|$|Reid {{grew up in}} Washington, D.C. and {{attended}} University of Maryland, College Park earning a Bachelor of Music, her schooling continued at DePaul University where she received a Master of Music. Reid taught {{middle and high school}} orchestra at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools for seven years before beginning her Doctor of Music from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Reid is associated and performed with groups including Mike <b>Reed's</b> <b>Loose</b> Assembly, Chicago Jazz Philharmonic and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians' Great Black Music Ensemble.|$|R
5000|$|John Bullough (1800-68) {{was from}} Accrington, often {{described}} as a simple-minded Westhoughton weaver. Originally a handloom weaver, unlike others of his trade Bullough embraced new developments such as Edmund Cartwright's power loom (1785). While colleagues were busy rejecting new devices {{such as in the}} power-loom riots that broke out in Lancashire in 1826, Bullough improved his own loom by inventing various components, including the [...] "self-acting temple" [...] that kept the woven cloth at its correct width, and a <b>loose</b> <b>reed</b> that allowed the lathe to back away on encountering a shuttle trapped in the warp. Bullough also invented a simple but effective warning device which rang a bell every time a warp thread broke on his loom. Bullough moved to Blackburn and worked with William Kenworthy at Brookhouse Mills, with whom he applied his inventions to develop an improved power loom that later became known as the [...] "Lancashire Loom". He was forced to quit Blackburn, for fear of angry handloom weavers. He later settled in Accrington to form Howard & Bullough in partnership with John Howard at Globe Works, alongside the Leeds-Liverpool Canal in Accrington. Here he invented the slasher, which founded the company's success. He was one of the country's largest manufacturers. At the height of the business the Globe works employed almost 6000 workers and covered 52 acre. 75% of production was exported.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{construction}} and thermal properties of walls insulated with reed, to enable comparisons with other wall structures that are widely used in building. In 2010 we built a test house insulated with reed adjacent to the Estonian University of Life Sciences in Tartu. The load-bearing structure {{of the house was}} a timber frame, and four different technologies were used to place reed insulation in its external walls. The thickness of the reed layer was 450 mm in all cases, and both sides (inside and outside) of the walls were rendered with clay plaster. Records were kept of time spent and materials used in construction of the different types of walls, and these data were used to calculate unit (m- 2) requirements of time and materials for each wall type to enable direct comparisons. From October 2010 to March 2012, heat flow plates were used to measure the thermal transmittance of the walls of the completed house and the results were compared with the thermal transmittance requirements set by Estonian legislation. Only one of the test walls met the Estonian standard. This was insulated with compressed <b>loose</b> <b>reed,</b> placed horizontally in the wall...|$|E
50|$|Blastaar is {{a member}} of an alien race known as the Baluurians, of the planet Baluur in the Negative Zone (in Sector 56-D, as charted by Reed Richards). He ruled the Baluurians as their monarch ruthlessly until his {{subjects}} rebelled and rose against him. Blastaar was deposed as monarch, and became a Negative Zone outlaw. Blastaar was locked up in a special containment suit and set adrift in outer space in the Negative Zone. When he broke <b>loose</b> he sighted <b>Reed</b> Richards, who had been trapped in the Negative Zone as well and followed him and Triton back to Earth. He fought with the Sandman and Reed Richards' group of superheroes, the Fantastic Four but was driven back to the Negative Zone by Mister Fantastic.|$|R
50|$|The film {{depicts a}} {{rehearsal}} of The Velvet Underground and Nico, and is essentially one long <b>loose</b> improvisation. Lou <b>Reed</b> and Sterling Morrison play their electric guitars (Gretsch Country Gentleman and Vox Phantom respectively), Maureen Tucker plays her 3-piece drum kit {{consisting of a}} rack tom, snare drum, bass drum and single cymbal, John Cale plays his electric viola and Nico bashes a single maraca against a tambourine. Cale subsequently switches to bass and at some stage, he creates feedback on an wooden frame from a piano while Nico plays on Cale's Fender Precision Bass. Cale soon switches back to his viola and {{near the end of}} the film, the rehearsal is disrupted by the arrival of the New York police, supposedly in response to a noise complaint.|$|R
50|$|While {{living in}} Philadelphia {{in the late}} 1980s, Abrams {{was a member of}} Square Roots, a street music group that {{eventually}} developed into The Roots. He moved to Chicago and became active in the jazz scene there, playing with musicians Fred Anderson, Josh Berman, Jason Stein, David Boykin, Ernest Dawkins, Fred Lonberg-Holm, the Exploding Star Orchestra, Town and Country, Hamid Drake, Jeff Albert, and Matana Roberts. He was a member of Mike <b>Reed's</b> <b>Loose</b> Assembly and Nicole Mitchell's Black Earth Ensemble, and played with Adam Rudolph's group Moving Pictures. In 2003, he played bass on Godspeed You! Black Emperor's album Yanqui U.X.O.. He has worked as a studio musician on recordings made in Chicago, such as Jandek's Chicago Wednesday and albums from Chicago musical artists Joan of Arc, David Grubbs, and Sam Prekop.|$|R
