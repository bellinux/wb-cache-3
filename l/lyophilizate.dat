This comes from protons of the solid matrix of the lamellae and consists of (i) an exponentially decaying contribution L 1 from mobile membrane protons, presumably from lipids, and from water that is tightly bound to the membrane surface and thus restricted in mobility; and (ii) an exponentially decaying component L 2 from more mobile, loosely bound water pool. Both proton relaxometry data and proton spectroscopy show that dry <b>lyophilizate</b> incubated in dry air, i. e., at a relative humidity (p/p 0) of 0 % reveals a relatively high hydration level. The observed liquid signal most likely originates from mobile membrane protons and a tightly bound water fraction that is sealed in pores of dry <b>lyophilizate</b> and thus restricted in mobility. The estimations suggest {{that the amount of}} sealed water does not exceed the value characteristic for the main hydration shell of a phospholipid. Proton spectra collected for dry <b>lyophilizate</b> of photosynthetic lamellae show a continuous decrease in the liquid signal component without a distinct freezing transition when it is cooled down to - 60 °C, which is significantly lower than the homogeneous ice nucleation temperature [Bronshteyn, V.

40|$|In {{the course}} of several years of use of {{lyophilization}} for long term preservation of oxytetracycline producing Streptomyces strains, their morphogenetic stability and the stability of their antibiotic yields were verified. The described process of lyophilization, as regards the viability and morphogenetic stability of both sporogenous and the asporogenous forms, has been proved very successful, with few exceptions. Data are given in Table II. Viable spore counts of 40 — 90. 8 % were satisfactory. The growth of lyophilized cultures on agar medium (P— 1) did not differ much from the growth of non-lyophilized (control) cultures: the populations of the cultures invariably retained all essential »starting« morphological characteristics. Only in a small number of cases alterations in some lyophilized cultures in comparison with the »starting« cultures were observed (e. g. T 6 — 429, T 6 — 483 and BIM— 197 in Table II). These differences were manifested by the appearance of small colonies (5 %), the disappearance of drops of exudate from the colonies center, or by differences in intensity of soluble pigment in the medium. No reliable explanation has been found for this phenomenon. It can probably be ascribed to microecological conditions (different composition of medium, temperature and the like). The growth of <b>lyophilizates</b> in a liquid medium (P— 2) owing to the almost complete anabiosis, was obviously somewhat slower (it averaged 10 — 16 hours) in comparison to the control cultures; the lyophilized asporogenous cultures, however, grew faster (4 — 6 hours) than the lyophilized sporogenous ones (see Table II). It has been proved that the remaining moisture in the <b>lyophilizates</b> is the limiting factor in attaining anabiosis and that, therefore, it is necessary to maintain the moisture within a narrow range and at a low level. The quality of cotton plugs considerably influences the process of lyophilization, especially at the stage of drying in the vacuum, so that full attention must be paid to the preparation of these plugs, particularly to their hardness. With regard to the stability in Oxytetracycline antibiotic yields (Table III), the tested <b>lyophilizates</b> have given different yields in comparison to the control cultures, in spite of the same testing conditions in {{the course of}} experiments, especially in the laboratory. Tests with some lyophilized cultures were repeated, and results obtained showed approximately the same differences (Table III, figures in brackets). The yields were often higher than those of the control. The obtained Oxytetracycline yields on a production scale were very favourable and uniform, even in the course of prolonged use of lyophilized cultures for the preparation of inoculum. The following conclusions are the result of many years of work and of data presented here: 1) The described process of lyophilization, as a whole, is suitable for a long term preservation of tested Oxytetracycline producing Streptomyces strains. 2) Both apparatuses used for lyophilization are suitable for the purpose described and produce <b>lyophilizates</b> of uniform quality. The model DELTA I/a is of higher capacity and therefore more suitable for production purposes, and for the maintaining of larger collections of cultures. 3) The optimum freezing temperature of the cultures is — 50 to — 55 °C. 4) The remainder of moisture in the <b>lyophilizates</b> — because it is a determinant factor in attaining anabiosis on which the stability of cultures depends — must be kept at the same, previously verified level. 5) Lyophilized cultures retained constant Oxytetracycline yields {{in the course of the}} four-year storage. 6) The porousness and the hardness of the microbiological cotton plugs must be standardized for the sake of more successful lyophilization process...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} design and investigation of two hybrid enantioseparation processes including an enzymatic racemization step {{in order to enhance}} the overall performance. Complementary to part I where the manufacturing and the characterization of an amino acid racemase (EC 5. 1. 1. 10) was emphasized (Würges et al., 2008), the work presented in this paper tends more towards developing a data base for potential process schemes for the manufacture of selected amino acids. The first proposed process concept (P-I) couples preferential crystallization (PC) and racemization for the production of L-asparagine (L-Asn) using racemic mixture of DL-asparagine (conglomerate-forming system) as a starting material, while the second concept (P-II) integrates chromatography and racemization for the preparation of L-methionine (L-Met) starting with racemic mixture of DL-methionine (compound-forming system). As mentioned in part I, a racemization unit, where the unwanted enantiomer will be converted into racemate, is incorporated into the hybrid processes for the sake of 100 % yield, theoretically. Besides the basic investigation according to the solid-liquid equilibria, preferential crystallization and chromatography, the focus of this paper is mainly on the kinetic studies of the racemization reaction. Initially, the solubility ternary phase diagrams of both examined systems were determined, leading into the idea for combination of the proposed process schemes. For P-I the concept of preferential crystallization of L-Asn was experimentally proven and the kinetics of the racemization was examined for D- and L-Asn in water using purified <b>lyophilizate</b> (PL). Concerning P-II, for the chromatographic unit the impact on the separation of DL-Met on eremomycin based stationary phase using KPi buffer and MeOH as mobile phase was evaluated in terms of resolution and selectivity at three different temperatures by varying the content of methanol (MeOH) in the mobile phase and the pH. The experiments for determination of the racemization kinetics were done for a compromised parameter set using crude <b>lyophilizate</b> (CL).

40|$|The {{demand for}} enantiopure substances, e. g. for {{pharmaceutical}} applications or fine chemical production, continues to increase. This {{has led to}} the development of numerous stereoselective synthesis methods. Nevertheless a large number of chemical syntheses still result in racemic mixtures making a subsequent enantioseparation step necessary and thus are restricted to a maximum yield of 50 %. Our work focuses on strategies to overcome this limitation by combining physicochemical separation processes with enzymatic racemization of the unwanted enantiomer in order to produce enantiopure amino acids. This paper deals with the production and characterization of a suitable amino acid racemase with broad substrate specificity (EC 5. 1. 1. 10) from Pseudomonas putida which we cloned into Escherichia coli. Two enzyme <b>lyophilizates</b> of different purity were obtained from which the crude (CL) was sufficient for the racemization of methionine (Met) and the pure (PL) was used for asparagine (Asn). Racemization reactions of D-/L-Asn in H 2 O and D-/L-Met in 95 vol. % 100 mM KP i -buffer, 5 vol. % methanol (MeOH) at different pH values and temperatures were characterized. The studied range of reaction parameters was chosen in dependency on planned enantioseparation processes.

30|$|This {{study is}} focused on the {{interaction}} of an aqueous suspension of laccase and a polyssacharide with a hydrophilic surface. The polysaccharide maltodextrin was added as a stabilizing and a <b>lyophilizating</b> agent to laccase enzyme formulation [15]. The involved mode of action was suggested to be based on hydrogen bonding, with the hydroxyl groups of maltodextrin having a role firstly as a stabilizing agent in the solution [15], and secondly by replacing the water molecules lost upon drying the protein material [16]. Biofilms produced by the thus resulting protein/polysaccharide complexes are used in industry for production of food packaging, sutures, wound dressings or for protein-carbohydrates based adhesives [17, 18], mainly because of their favorable cohesive and adhesive properties as well as their biodegradability and environmental safety [19] [20]. On the other hand, polysaccharides, such as dextrans, are used to avoid protein adsorption on biomedical devices, such as contact lenses and artificial blood vessels [21]. The anti-adhesion properties are related to the reduction of the interfacial energy, the large exclusion volume or influences on the system entropy impacted by the heavily solvated, the neutral and randomly oriented polymer chain and the sterical impediment, being similar to the effect of polyethylene glycol films [21 – 24]. However, adhesive properties also depend on the surface roughness of the adsorbent, the protein carbohydrate combination [25] or factors such as pH and ionic strength in the liquid phase [26, 27]. Therefore, the adsorption behavior is characteristic for each singular protein, and computer-based simulation may permit recommending trends or development directions [28]. For example, albumin adsorbs on both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, even if the polarity of charges on the protein and the surface is the same, whereas ribonuclease is reported to adsorb on hydrophobic surfaces under all conditions of charge, but to adsorb on hydrophilic surfaces only if the interaction is electrostatically favored [29].|$|R

This kindred possesses an amyloid β-protein (Aβ) precursor mutation within the Aβ coding region that results in the deletion of Glu 22 (ΔE 22). We report here results of studies of [ΔE 22]Aβ 40 and [ΔE 22] Aβ 42 that sought to elucidate the conformational dynamics, oligomerization behavior, fibril formation kinetics, fibril morphology, and fibril stability of these mutant peptides. Both [ΔE 22]Aβ peptides had extraordinary β-sheet formation propensities. The [ΔE 22] Aβ 40 mutant formed β-sheet secondary structure elements ≈ 400 -fold faster. Studies of β-sheet stability {{in the presence of}} fluorinated alcohol cosolvents or high pH revealed that the ΔE 22 mutation substantially increased stability, producing a rank order of [ΔE 22]Aβ 42 > Aβ 42 > [ΔE 22]Aβ 40 > Aβ 40. The mutation facilitated formation of oligomers by [ΔE 22]Aβ 42 (dodecamers and octadecamers) that were not observed with Aβ 42. Both Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptides formed nebulous globular and small string-like structures immediately upon solvation from <b>lyophilizates,</b> whereas short protofibrillar and fibrillar structures were evident immediately in the ΔE 22 samples. Determination of the critical concentration for fibril formation for the [ΔE 22] Aβ peptides showed it to be ≈ 1 / 2 that of the wild type homologues, demonstrating that the mutations causes a modest increase in fibril stability. The magnitude of this increase, when considered {{in the context of the}} extraordinary increase in β-sheet propensity for the ΔE 22 peptides, suggests that the primary biophysical effect of the mutation is to accelerate conformational changes in the peptide monomer that facilitate oligomerization and higher-order assembly. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Injectable {{thermosetting}} chitosan hydrogels {{are attractive}} systems for drug delivery and tissue engineering that combine biodegradability, biocompatibility {{and the ability}} to form in situ gel-like implants. Thermally-induced gelation relies advantageously on biopolymer secondary interactions, avoiding potentially toxic polymerization reactions that may occur with in situ polymerizing formulations.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of feeding protein-iron complex (PIC) on productive performance and indicators of iron metabolism, hematology parameters, antioxidant and immune status during first 35 days of a calf’s life. Preparation of the complex involved enzymatic hydrolysis of milk casein (serine protease from Yarrowia lipolytica yeast). Iron chloride was then added to the hydrolyzate and <b>lyophilizate.</b> Calves were divided into treated groups: LFe (low iron dose) 10 g/day calf of protein-iron complex, HFe (height iron dose) 20 g/day calf, and control group. Dietary supplements containing the lower dose of concentrate had a significant positive effect on iron metabolism, while the higher dose of concentrate resulted in increase of total iron binding capacity (TIBC), saturation of transferrin and decrease of and unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), which suggest iron overload. Additionally, treatment with the lower dose of iron remarkably increased the antioxidant parameters, mainly total antioxidant (TAS) and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx). Higher doses of PIC were related to lower total antioxidant status. IgG, IgM, insulin, glucose, TNFα and IGF- 1 concentration did not change significantly in either group after supplementation. In practice, the use of protein-iron complex concentrate requires taking into account the iron content in milk replacers and other feedstuffs...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{elaborate}} an efficient method for the micronization of the decapeptide cetrorelix (a GnRH-antagonist), in order to obtain a microsuspension as basis for other pharmaceutical preparations, such as e. g. inhalation aerosols. A modified pearl-mill coupled with a cryostat was used for the micronization of cetrorelix in fluid propellant and operated under different conditions. The obtained cetrorelix suspensions were analyzed for particle size distribution, purity of cetrorelix, and for metal contamination through abrasion from parts of the mill. The method allowed an effective micronization of cetrorelix. The mean particle size of the initial cetrorelix <b>lyophilizate</b> bulk ware was reduced from 52. 5 μ (Volume Mean Diameter, VMD) down to 14. 9, 6. 1 and 3. 1 μm, respectively, respectively. The HPLC analysis of all cetrorelix suspensions after micronization did not show signs of decomposition as compared to the initial product. The elementary analysis of the suspensions performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed a negligible amount of contaminants in the suspension (Zr=max. 0. 6 ppm; Fe, Cr, Ni, Ba, below limit of quantification, i. e. < 0. 14 ppm). The only appreciable contaminant. Aluminum (Al= 1. 1 ppm), was derived from the mechanical capping of aluminum canisters prior to analysis. The Zr determination in the suspension of 0. 6 ppm, is still considered to be negligible as compared to the legally tolerated limit of air contamination. By low-temperature micronization in fluid propellant, fine drug suspensions of cetrorelix for pMDIs can be directly manufactured in one-step procedure without destruction of the peptide structure and without appreciable product contamination...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Desmopressin is a {{standard}} treatment for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. Different formulations are promoted as bioequivalent, although these claims are not supported by comparative pharmacodynamic data in children. Food interaction is known to influence the bioavailability of desmopressin. We compared the pharmacodynamics of the 2 most frequently used desmopressin formulations, tablet and <b>lyophilizate,</b> with {{a standard}}ized meal, allowing extrapolation to clinical reality, where the interval between evening meal and medication intake is limited for school-age children. We hypothesized {{there would be a}} faster pharmacodynamic response, and greater concentrating and antidiuretic activity for the fast dissolving (melt) formulation compared to the tablet with simultaneous food intake. Materials and Methods: Two tests were performed on separate days in identical standardized conditions, starting with a 15 ml/kg water load. After achieving maximal diluting capacity a standardized meal was administered, followed by desmopressin tablet (t test) or melt (M-test). Diuresis rate and urinary osmolality were measured hourly. Paired data from 4 girls and 15 boys {{with a mean age of}} 12. 1 years were obtained. Results: In the early response phase more than 25 % of patients had a higher diuresis rate with tablet vs melt formulation, reaching statistical significance in the plateau phase (urine collected at hours 3 to 5, p < 0. 02) and in duration of action (urine collected at hours 5 to 8, p < 0. 005). For desmopressin melt smaller standard deviations in diuresis rate were remarkable. Concentrating capacity demonstrated no significant differences between formulations in the early response phase, in contrast to the plateau phase (p < 0. 036) and duration of action (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: With meal combination desmopressin melt formulation has a superior pharmacodynamic profile to tablet, making it more suitable for the younger age group with a limited interval between meal and drug administration...|$|E
40|$|Enzymes {{can be used}} to {{catalyze}} reactions in non-aqueous media, which can be particularly useful for the processing of materials with low water solubility. One such reaction is the lipase-catalyzed esterification between citronellol and acetic acid, in a medium of hexane. Both reaction conditions and special pretreatments on the lipase impact the lipase's catalytic performance. This project focuses on improving lipase performance by optimizing its pretreatment. The pretreatment factors studied include pH adjustment, lyophilization time, addition of buffer salts, non-buffer salts, denaturants or active site protectants to the <b>lyophilizate,</b> and flash-freezing in the presence of phase interfaces. The effectiveness of a particular pretreatment is presented in terms of 'relative performance' (RP), which is equal to the number of times faster the pretreated lipase catalyzes the reaction relative to untreated lipase. The individual and interactive effects of the pretreatment factors were studied in detail and compared. Buffer salts had a much stronger performance enhancing effect than non-buffer salts; pretreatment with 90 % (w/w) sodium phosphate yielded lipase with an RP of ∼ 64 (catalyzed the reaction ∼ 64 times faster that untreated lipase). A strong interaction between the treatments with sodium phosphate and pH adjustment was found. Both these treatments may mitigate the inhibitory effect of acetic acid, one of the substrates. Activating effects of phase interfaces and active site protectants are shown to be complementary to other treatments, demonstrating that they act by a distinct mechanism. An optimization process known as 'the method of steepest ascent' was used to simultaneously optimize the pH and buffer salt pretreatments, as well as the concentration of acetic acid in the reaction mixture, This process succeeded in rapidly developing pretreatment combinations that yielded lipase with RP as high as 170. Studies were also conducted to develop methods for recovery, reprocessing and reuse of lipase from completed reactions...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{freeze drying}} of protein {{preparations}} above the collapse temperature of amorphous or partially amorphous formulations {{has been the}} subject of great interest (Leukel et al. 1998. Effects of formulation and process variables on the aggregation of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) after lyophilization and on storage, Pharm. Dev. Technol., 3 (3) : 337 - 346; Pikal, M. J., Shah,S. 1990. The collapse temperature in freeze-drying: dependence on measurement methodology and rate of water removal from the glassy phase. Int. J. Pharm., 62 : 165 - 168; Wang, D. Q. et al., 2003. Effect of collapse on the sability of freeze-dried recombinant factor VIII and α- amylase. J. Pharm. Sci., 93 (5) : 1253 - 1263; Passot, S. et al. 2007. Effect of product temperature during primary drying on the long-term satability of lyophilized proteins. pharm. dev. Technol., 12 (6) : 543 - 533; Schersch K. et. al. 2010. Systematic Investigation of the effect of <b>lyophilizate</b> collapse on pharmaceutically relevant proteins I: stability after freeze drying. J. Pharm. Sci., 99 (5) : 2256 - 2277). It is understood that freeze drying in this way would generally result in shorter freeze drying cycles and therefore significant savings in operating costs. Freeze drying protein preparations above and below the critical temperature was assessed using two model proteins made up of either a mannitol or glycine based formulation in the presence of a variety of other excipients, such as sucrose and NaCl. All bulking agents were crystallized using an annealing step during freezing, as crystalline bulking agents are known to act as structural supports in lyophilized cake during the primary drying step (Shalaev, E. Y.; Franks, F. 1996. Changes in the physical state of model mixtures during freezing and drying: Impact on product quality. Cryobiology. 33 : 14 - 26). Protein X (150 kDa proprietary biopharmaceutical) was lyophilized using only a mannitol based formulation while Protein B (Fraction V BSA, 66 kDa) was lyophilized in conjunction with one of four formulations which were either mannitol or glycine based. It was found that freeze drying above the critical temperature resulted in a maximum 7 fold improvement in the degradation (aggregation) rate of BSA when freeze dried in a glycine: sucrose (4 %w/v : 1 %w/v) based buffer and stored for 6 months at 25 °C and 60 % relative humidity or at 40 °C and 75 % relative humidity. Other formulations provided varied results and the improvement in protein degradation seemed to be a function of excipient choice when dried below or above the critical temperature of the formulation. Formulations with mannitol: sucrose (4 %w/v: 1 %w/v) and NaCl seemed to experience improved degradation rates when dried above collapse than when using mannitol alone. Proprietary protein X with a mannitol: sucrose (4 %w/v: 1 %w/v) based formulation showed comparable degradation (aggregation) rates when dried below and above collapse. It was found that choice of excipients was a key factor in the ability of a protein formulation to dry above the collapse temperature without negatively affecting stability. Overall, the use of glycine: sucrose (4 %w/v: 1 %w/v) combination as excipients resulted in improved protein stability when dried above the collapse temperature and the presence of sodium chloride also was found to be a factor...|$|E
40|$|The {{extracts}} from six barley cultivars (Hordeum vulgarae L.) {{grown in the}} Canadian prairies, namely AC Metcalfe, Falcon, Phoenix, Tercel, Tyto, and Peregrine, were evaluated for their potential antioxidant, antiradical, and antiproliferative efficacies by various chemical and biological methods. Antioxidative compounds were solvent-extracted after optimizing extraction parameters (solvent composition, extraction temperature, and time) using response surface methodology (RSM). In addition, the distribution of antioxidative constituents in the barley grain was investigated by separately pearling two barley cultivars (Falcon and AC Metcalfe) into seven fractions (F 1 -F 7) in a layer-wise fashion up to 50 % of the kernel weight. Antioxidative efficacy of the layers and the remaining kernel (pearled grain) was evaluated using chemical and biological methods. Furthermore, phenolic compounds present in the six barley samples were separated into free, soluble conjugates, and insoluble-bound fractions using alkaline hydrolysis and the antioxidative potential {{of each of the}} fractions was also investigated. [...] The optimum conditions for extraction of antioxidative components from barley extracts were 80 % aqueous methanol, 60 °C, and 40 min as determined by RSM. Total phenolic content (TPC) of whole kernel extracts ranged from 13. 58 to 22. 93 and 0. 81 to 1. 38 mg ferulic acid equivalents per gram <b>lyophilizate</b> and defatted material, respectively. The order of TPC was Peregrine > AC Metcalfe > Falcon > Tyto > Phoenix > Tercel. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), as measured by Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), ranged from 3. 74 to 6. 82 μmol Trolox equivalents per gram defatted material. Antioxidant and antiradical efficacies of barley extracts were evaluated using different assays including 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORACFL), hydroxyl radical averting capacity (HORACFL), and photochemiluminescence (PCL). All six barley extracts showed significant antioxidant and antiradical activities although the order of their activity changed from assay to assay. Barley extracts exhibited substantial metal chelation activity as measured by 2, 2 '- bipyridyl competition assay. Evaluating the whole barley extracts using a number of model systems such as β-carotene/linoleate, bulk stripped corn oil as well as accelerated oxidation study, using Rancimat®, further revealed that the whole barley extract possessed strong antioxidant activity. Whole grain extracts exhibited strong inhibitory effects against copper-induced human LDL cholesterol oxidation as well as peroxyl and hydroxyl radical-induced DNA double strand scission. Barley extracts also exhibited substantial antiproliferative effect against growth of Caco- 2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. [...] In {{the second phase of the}} study involving fractionation, it was revealed that anti oxidative constituents were mainly located in the outer 9 % (w/w) of the kernel. TPC of Falcon and AC Metcalfe fractions ranged from 0. 51 to 6. 26 and 0. 17 to 4. 16 as ferulic acid equivalents per gram defatted material. TAC, as measured by TEAC, varied from 0. 45 to 60 and 0. 69 to 56 μmol Trolox equivalents per gram defatted material, respectively. Antioxidant efficacy gradually diminished from the outer layers to the inner layers. In general, antioxidant efficacy determined by other methods followed a similar trend to that of TAC. [...] In the last phase of the study involving hydrolysis of phenolic compounds, it was revealed that a greater proportion of antioxidative compounds were present in insoluble-bound form followed by soluble conjugate form. It was further revealed that the antioxidant and antiradical efficacies of insoluble bound phenolic compounds were the highest followed by soluble conjugates and free phenolic. The predominant phenolic acid detected in barley extracts was ferulic acid. The other phenolic acids detected were vanillic, caffeic, p-coumaric and sinapic acids...|$|E
