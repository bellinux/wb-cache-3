50|$|The van's layout enabled a flat <b>loading</b> <b>floor</b> only 40 cm off the ground. It {{was also}} {{fitted with a}} large single rear door fitted to hinges on the {{right-hand}} side.|$|R
5000|$|Lowboy ("British" [...] Low-loader) {{trailers}} are {{a type of}} flatbed {{in which}} the <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> {{is as close to}} the ground as possible, most commonly used to haul heavy equipment, cranes, bulldozers, etc.|$|R
50|$|Three-door van: Sold only in Europe. Uses {{the same}} {{bodyshell}} as the three-door hatchback, modified with solid panels {{in place of}} the rear quarter windows and a flat <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> replacing the rear seats.|$|R
50|$|Reflecting the matt paint {{finish of}} the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> offers {{flexible}} attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure {{is designed to}} carry mountain bikes.|$|R
50|$|Flatbeds {{consist of}} just a <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> and {{removable}} side rails and a bulkhead in front to protect the tractor {{in the event of}} a load shift. They can haul almost anything that can be stacked on and strapped down.|$|R
50|$|The {{system in}} turn creates a {{combined}} volume of 12 cuft L of under floor storage when second row seats are deployed. With both row folded, the vans have a flat <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> {{and a maximum}} cargo volume of 160.7 cuft L.|$|R
50|$|The Fit Shuttle {{comes with}} a double-hinged two-piece <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> that both allows access to an under-floor storage bin and also {{functions}} as a divider for the cargo area. Through better sound dampening and insulation, the Fit Shuttle is pledged to be as quiet as a mid-size sedan.|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} 9-5 was available with sedan and station wagon body styles. Aerodynamically, the sedan's drag coefficient is 0.29, and the station wagon's is 0.31 (U.S. version 0.33), which {{was introduced in}} 1999. It features such innovations as floor tracks to secure cargo and a sliding <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> to make <b>loading</b> easier.|$|R
2500|$|... 1971–1976 model {{full-size}} station wagons {{featured a}} 'Clamshell' design where the rear power-operated glass slid {{up into the}} roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), dropped below the <b>load</b> <b>floor.</b> The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage.|$|R
2500|$|Front {{and rear}} {{suspension}} components from the Fit are used including MacPherson struts {{at the front}} and an H-shaped torsion beam at the rear to keep the <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> low. Front and rear stabilizer bars are also installed. On EX models, the 175/65-15 low-rolling resistance tires are mounted on lightweight aluminum wheels, each weighing [...] together with the tire.|$|R
5000|$|An estate {{version of}} the Humber Sceptre was {{introduced}} at the London Motor Show in October 1974. [...] It featured a built-in roof rack and a carpeted <b>loading</b> <b>floor</b> protected by metal strips and illuminated by an additional interior light. Washer and wiper were provided for the rear window, a rare feature on UK-market estate cars of the time.|$|R
2500|$|The {{mechanics}} of the DisneySea tower are identical {{to those of the}} Californian and Parisian towers, with dual <b>loading</b> <b>floors,</b> horizontal push-back from the doors and into the drop tower, a [...] "hallway" [...] scene, and a mirror scene, but with thematic changes. The order of the mirror and hallway scenes is reversed compared to the American and European counterparts.|$|R

50|$|The TN360 uses an {{air-cooled}} two-cylinder 354 cc engine with {{a single}} overhead camshaft, and was adapted from the Honda CB450 motorcycle. The preceding T360 had been equipped with a very complex twin-cam four-cylinder unit, whereas this new engine (shared with the N360 sedan) was more fitted for mass production. The engine was redesigned to be mounted horizontally, residing midships beneath the <b>load</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Matador station wagons had an {{available}} rear-facing third-row {{bench seat}} increasing total seating {{from six to}} eight passengers. In addition, all wagons included a roof rack and a two-way tailgate that opened when the rear window was down either from the top {{to serve as an}} extended flat surface that was even with the <b>load</b> <b>floor,</b> or to swing open like a regular door hinged on the left side.|$|R
50|$|The Discovery Sport {{includes}} further {{changes to}} the platform {{in comparison with the}} Evoque, with a new compact multi-link suspension design to permit the folding rear seats and spare wheel well in the boot space, without requiring an unduly high and impractical <b>load</b> <b>floor.</b> The front suspension is a MacPherson strut design carried over from the Range Rover Evoque largely unchanged, and features steel lower and aluminium upper control arms.|$|R
50|$|In December 2006, all {{production}} {{and sales of}} the Acadia (and the Saturn Outlook) were temporarily stopped due to the engine mounts not having holes drilled to release accumulated water, {{as well as an}} issue with potentially faulty rivets in the <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> just forward of the vehicle's rear hatch. The assembly process was quickly adjusted, and dealership sales of the vehicles had resumed within days of the notice.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{calculation}} method about the radiant cooling <b>load</b> of <b>floor</b> {{which is based}} on radiant time series (RTS) method is presented: With the use of radiant time factors, radiant cooling load can be easily calculated from the radiant heat gain. Based on experimental data of total heat gain and total cooling loads collected within 24 -hours, radiant heat gain of floor can be calculated through convection and radiation separating method, using PRF/RTF Generator software to calculate the radiant time factor of floor; the radiant cooling <b>load</b> of <b>floor</b> is calculated and compared with the measured values. The results for the 5 experimental conditions show that the radiant cooling <b>load</b> of <b>floor</b> peak error is less than 2. 3 % comparing with the value which is calculated by radiant time series method, and average error is not more than 3. 2 %. Its mean absolute error is 1. 2 % and 1. 7 % respectively. The experimental study indicated that convection and radiation separating method on wall could calculate the radiant cooling <b>load</b> of <b>floor...</b>|$|R

A comparison of all domestic station wagons by Popular Mechanics noted that the intermediate-size models will not carry [...] by [...] plywood panels flat on the <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> because of width between the wheel well trim, but described the [...] "cargo space in the Rebel wagons is impressive" [...] featuring [...] of space.|$|R
50|$|The Schnellaster is of a one box or monospace {{configuration}} featuring {{front wheels}} set {{forward in the}} passenger cabin, a short sloping aerodynamic hood, front wheel drive, transverse engine, flat <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> throughout with flexible seating and cargo accommodations. These same features make the Schnellaster a precursor of the modern minivan, a body configuration subsequently popularized in notable examples such as the Renault Espace, or the Chrysler Voyager/Dodge Caravan and, mechanically, of the BMC Mini plus most modern cars.|$|R
50|$|Some {{vehicles}} offer configurable cargo conveniences {{such as a}} shelf or board. They often serve various purposes. The multiposition {{rear shelf}} on the Chrysler PT Cruiser {{can be used as}} a table for a picnic, a second cargo layer, or a security screen. The Citroën C3 has a foldable segmented false floorboard that compartmentalises the cargo area, makes loading easier, and evens out the <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> when the back of the rear seat is folded down.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with most}} Kei cars, the 200-series came in two primary variants: The [...] "V" [...] Series is a windowed van style {{intended}} for light commercial use. This variant featured a fold down {{rear bench seat}} without seat belts. The [...] "S" [...] series, intended for private use, is largely similar but the larger, more comfortable rear seats are equipped with belts and are further {{to the rear of}} the vehicle with more leg room. While the seats still fold down, unlike the [...] "V", the [...] "S" [...] does not offer a flat <b>loading</b> <b>floor.</b> These characteristics are due to Japanese tax preferences for commercial vehicles, which only allow for temporary accommodation in the rear and demand a flat <b>loading</b> <b>floor.</b> The range received a very subtle facelift of a more rounded overall appearance for 1993, it included altered front and rear lights, bumpers, and a new bonnet and front seats. This version was available to Japanese customers from August 1992 and also incorporated some changes to the lineup, including the new RV-4 model with crossover pretensions. Turbocharged automatics now received a four-speed transmission.|$|R
50|$|In December 2006, all {{production}} {{and sales of}} the Outlook (and the GMC Acadia) were temporarily stopped due to the engine mounts not having holes drilled to release accumulated water, {{as well as an}} issue with potentially faulty rivets in the <b>load</b> <b>floor</b> just forward of the rear hatch. The assembly process was quickly adjusted, and dealerships were told to fix the problems themselves before offering the Outlook (or the Acadia) for sale again. Sales resumed within days of the notice.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was also}} a two-door wagon, known as the [...] "Van", as is typical in Japan where wagons are {{traditionally}} only for commercial purposes, which featured a horizontally divided tailgate and a maximum 400 kg payload (200 kg with 4 passengers). The rear seat had steel backing and when folded down formed a flat <b>loading</b> <b>floor,</b> as per legal requirements for Japanese commercial vehicles. Strapping points were visible in the rearmost side windows. Its top speed is slightly lower, at 122 km/h.|$|R

50|$|New bumpers meant {{length and}} width were up {{marginally}} to 3120 mm and 1305 mm. Claimed top speed was 110 km/h, somewhat {{lower than that}} of the 360. With Honda withdrawing from the Kei market segment, Daihatsu became the only maker to offer a Kei car featuring front-wheel drive. The Van used the front end and front doors from the two-door Max, but with a more square-rigged rear end featuring a split tailgate (divided horizontally) and a folding rear seat which allowed for a flat <b>loading</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Boxer Cargo (Boxer Cargo) — The Boxer Cargo {{replaces the}} YPR-765 prv {{variant of the}} AIFV (Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle). It is {{equipped}} with a special <b>loading</b> <b>floor</b> to secure cargo during transport and can transport a maximum of two standard one tonne army pallets (max. load 2,5 t). The interior design of the vehicle allows adaptation as necessary for different kinds of missions. For conducting peace keeping missions or other peace time operations the set of vehicle equipment can be changed and tailored to suit as required. Crew consists of commander/gunner and driver.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hatchback}} {{with its}} lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat accounted {{for nearly half}} of all Vegas sold. The sedan, later named [...] "Notchback" [...] is the only Vega model with an enclosed trunk, and had the lowest base price.The Kammback wagon has a lower cargo liftover height and a swing-up liftgate. The panel express panel delivery model has steel panels in place of the wagon's rear side glass, an enclosed storage area under the <b>load</b> <b>floor,</b> and a low-back driver's seat. An auxiliary passenger seat was optional.|$|R
