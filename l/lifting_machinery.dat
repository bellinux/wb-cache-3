50|$|The War Department {{required}} the movable span {{on the grounds}} that large steamboats might venture up the Missouri during the month or so that the river was navigable that far north. A kerosene engine in the lift house could raise it 43 feet in about thirty minutes. In theory, the movable span might also be lifted by a hand-turned capstan.

50|$|In most reactor designs, as {{a safety}} measure, control rods are {{attached}} to the <b>lifting</b> <b>machinery</b> by electromagnets, rather than direct mechanical linkage. This means that in the event of power failure, or if manually invoked due to failure of the <b>lifting</b> <b>machinery,</b> the control rods fall automatically, under gravity, all the way into the pile to stop the reaction. A notable exception to this fail-safe mode of operation is the BWR, which requires hydraulic insertion {{in the event of an}} emergency shut-down, using water from a special tank under high pressure. Quickly shutting down a reactor in this way is called scramming.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The ETO product’s {{modularity}} manufacture {{needs the}} ETO product’s modular design as a foundation. By fully distinguishing and exploiting the geometry similarity, the structure similarity, the function similarity {{and the process}} similarity of the multi-ETO products, using the methods of standardization, modularization and serialization, the ETO products {{as well as the}} corresponding manufacture systems are modularized. In view of various standard components and parts produced by the modular design and manufacture, the products needed for the customers are directly assembled using a set of the advanced operation flow suitable for the modular assembly, and selecting the appropriate standard parts. Thus the production cost, the assembly cost as well as the inventory cost and so on are reduced. The modular manufacture is using the modular technology in the manufacture process to form the overall integrated production and assembly system of the components, and to recompose the manufacture process promptly according to the specific production. This paper proposed the optimization method of production organization, established the CAPP system’s architecture based on the modularity technique supporting the ETO product and developed the cooperative CAPP platform of the multi-functional hydraulic <b>lift</b> <b>machinery...</b>|$|R
40|$|Beam {{pumping units}} {{are widely used}} in the oil {{production}} industry, but the energy efficiency of this artificial <b>lift</b> <b>machinery</b> is generally low, especially for the low-production well and high-production well in the later stage. There {{are a number of}} ways for energy savings in pumping units, with the periodic adjustment of stroke speed and rectification of balance deviation being two important methods. In the paper, an energy saving system for a beam pumping unit (ESS-BPU) based on the Internet of Things (IoT) was proposed. A total of four types of sensors, including load sensor, angle sensor, voltage sensor, and current sensor, were used to detect the operating conditions of the pumping unit. Data from these sensors was fed into a controller installed in an oilfield to adjust the stroke speed automatically and estimate the degree of balance in real-time. Additionally, remote supervision could be fulfilled using a browser on a computer or smartphone. Furthermore, the data from a practical application was recorded and analyzed, and {{it can be seen that}} ESS-BPU is helpful in reducing energy loss caused by unnecessarily high stroke speed and a poor degree of balance...|$|R

Due {{to the complexity of}} the AE signals, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) has been exploited to decompose them. The results have demonstrated that the frequency feature band is low in the crack initiation. With the crack growth, the frequency feature band becomes higher. The total frequency range of the crack propagation is 25 KHz- 160 KHz. The research work has laid a theoretical foundation to application of the AE technology for safety evaluation of steel structures in <b>lifting</b> <b>machinery.</b> It also demonstrates that AE technique is an effective method for in-situ monitoring of the steel structures...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{failures}} in general can appear because of weak design, wrong handling, and problems during the manufacturing process, material problems etc. This paper {{is dealing with}} {{failures in}} <b>lifting</b> <b>machinery</b> gearboxes which appear because of material stresses and tribological problems. The study conducted is based on theoretical analysis and analysis of inspection results for failures that have appeared in cranes and other <b>lifting</b> <b>machinery</b> in southern part of Sweden. Investigation shows that besides the surface damages like abrasive and adhesive failures also cracks in the material in different parts appear. Since these types of gearboxes are made in short series, gearbox housings and sometimes also gears are made of welded steel. Hence welding process makes the weld joints brittle; cracks do start and developed until the part fails. Another problem that happens due to welding is wrapping which leads {{to changes in the}} geometrical tolerances and that does affect the parallelism of the shafts and the functionality of the gearbox...|$|E

With reduce a weight of beam, the contractor can using manpower to lift up the beam and the contractor can save money from rent or used <b>lift</b> <b>machinery</b> on site. The aim {{in this study was}} to investigate the performance of semi-precast Lightweight Foam Concrete beam in term of flexural strength, deflected shape and failure mode. Lightweight foam concrete in study was used sand cement ratio (sic) and water cement ratio (w/c) which is 1. 5 and 0. 5 respectively. The width and length of the beam was constant which are 150 mm and 3000 mm respectively. Four samples with different height which is 200 mm, 180 mm, 170 mm and 160 mm were designated as Beam 1, Beam 2, Beam 3 and Beam 4 respectively. All samples were painted and tested under four point test. Linear Variable Displacement Transducers (LVDT) was connected to data logger to determine the flexural strength and deflected shape. Four point tests also can be determining the ultimate load of concrete that it can stand before failure. Based on the result from those outcomes which can obtain- are the deflection measurements of the beam also the crack pattern by the observations.

40|$|AbstractUltra-high {{strength}} steels {{are becoming}} more common, particularly in <b>lifting</b> <b>machinery</b> and mobile equipment. However, elon- gation {{is a problem in}} ultra-high strength steels, which has been reported to be low in traditional material tests. Although in these tests, ultra-high strength steels have exhibited good local strain properties, which suggests that traditional material test procedures are inappropriate. In this paper, notched specimens were used to develop material models and to define failure criteria. The results were verified using welded components and tensile tests. The failure point and capacity levels were determined in welded and net section tests. We conclude that the strain properties of ultra-high strength steels are good, where the full capacity of the net section stress was reached in the tensile tests. The results also indicate that the current elongation requirements in different codes require adjustments or a new formulation...|$|E
40|$|In our {{companion}} paper Stojnicgscomp 16 we {{introduce a}} collection of fairly powerful statistical comparison results.
