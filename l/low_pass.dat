5|$|A {{few miles}} {{southwest}} {{from the head}} of Anderson Lake is Mount Birkenhead, {{on the north side of}} the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> connecting the valley of those lakes to that of the Birkenhead River. The river, the valley area near Mount Birkenhead known as Birken, and Birkenhead Lake at the summit of the pass were in turn named after the mountain, and not directly by Anderson.|$|E
5|$|The main access {{route to}} the summit leads {{through one of the}} ramps to the saddle between the main summit and its western trabant. The passage on the top cone is secured by ropes for {{unprepared}} tourists. One of the variants of the Polar Route follows the coast of Amerloq Fjord {{at the base of the}} southern wall of Nasaasaaq. The main summit is visited for its long-range view of the coast, although more limited to the north than that of Palasip Qaqqaa to the north of the town airport. An alternative {{route to the}} top of interest to mountaineers leads through the hard to find <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> to the east of the main summit, and from there directly on the summit cone ridge.|$|E

25|$|The block {{commonly}} called the PLL loop filter (usually a <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> filter) generally has two distinct functions.|$|E
25|$|Aliasing is {{generally}} avoided by applying <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> filters- anti-aliasing filters to the analog signal before sampling.|$|E
25|$|For {{analysis}} with orthogonal wavelets the {{high pass filter}} is calculated as the quadrature mirror filter of the <b>low</b> <b>pass,</b> and reconstruction filters are the time reverse of the decomposition filters.|$|E
50|$|Wind {{and weather}} {{observations}} {{will be different}} for a <b>low</b> <b>passing</b> {{to the north of}} the observer than for one passing to the south. When a <b>low</b> <b>passes</b> to the north, the winds typically pick up from the east, swing to southerly (possibly accompanied by light precipitation, usually not) with the passage of the lows warm front, and then switch to northwesterly or westerly as the cold front passes. Typically, if there is any heavy precipitation, it will accompany the passage of the cold front. When a <b>low</b> <b>passes</b> to the south, on the other hand, winds will initially pick up from the east, but will gradually shift to northerly. Overcast skies and steady precipitation often occur as the center of the <b>low</b> <b>passes</b> due south, but skies will clear and winds will gradually become westerly as the low moves off to the east. No observer will experience all the weather elements of a low in a single passage.|$|R

25|$|The Western Pacific Railroad {{operated}} a railroad through the Feather River canyon. This route {{was selected because}} it leads to a <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> over the Sierra Nevada mountains. The Western Pacific California Zephyr trains used this route and had a feather in their logo to represent the river.|$|E
25|$|Six {{minutes into}} the second half, Maradona cut inside from the left and played a {{diagonal}} <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> {{to the edge of}} the area to teammate Jorge Valdano and continued his run in the hope of a one-two movement. Maradona's pass was played slightly behind Valdano and reached England's Steve Hodge, the left midfielder who had dropped back to defend.|$|E
25|$|Mathematically, {{applying}} a Gaussian blur to an image {{is the same}} as convolving the image with a Gaussian function. This is also known as a two-dimensional Weierstrass transform. By contrast, convolving by a circle (i.e., a circular box blur) would more accurately reproduce the bokeh effect. Since the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian, {{applying a}} Gaussian blur has the effect of reducing the image's high-frequency components; a Gaussian blur is thus a <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> filter.|$|E

25|$|The CAS {{requires}} all {{candidates to}} qualify {{through a series}} of actuarial exams covering various aspects of actuarial practice. Passing Exam 1-6 as well as Exam S, the Course on Professionalism, the Validation by Educational Experience (VEE), and two online courses qualifies an actuary for the Associateship designation; passing three additional exams is required to become a Fellow. The exam process usually {{takes a long time to}} complete, often near a decade, due to the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> ratios and the difficulty of the syllabus material.|$|E
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the short runway and {{frequent}} winds, there have been very few safety incidents at the airport. However, at the air show held on opening day in 1959 there were two significant incidents. A Royal New Zealand Air Force Sunderland flying boat scraped its keel along the runway during a <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> in turbulent conditions; it returned to its base at Hobsonville and was beached for repair. A Royal Air Force Avro Vulcan bomber aborted its landing when it touched down short of the runway, rupturing its left main landing gear drag link, the wing attachments and engine fuel lines; the aircraft flew to Ohakea air base where it was stranded for several months being repaired.|$|E

25|$|In {{the rescue}} area two A-1 Sandys, after several {{strafing}} runs to drive off approaching troops, drew no {{fire on a}} final <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> over the area. O'Mara crested a ridgeline into the canyon and lowered his hoist {{to pick up the}} F-4's aircraft commander, Tempest 03A, with whom he was in radio communication. His helicopter was immediately hit from above by small arms fire, forcing O'Mara to pull out. Tempest 03A on his last transmission radioed that he had been hit in the chest. O'Mara made two further rescue attempts in the badly damaged HH-3E before his hoist was knocked out, forcing him to return to base. O'Mara was awarded the Air Force Cross in 1969 for his efforts.|$|E
25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E
25|$|Smyrna {{was located}} {{at the mouth of}} the small river Hermus and at the head of a deep arm of the sea (Smyrnaeus Sinus) that reached far inland. This enabled Greek trading ships to sail into the heart of Lydia, making the city part of an {{essential}} trade route between Anatolia and the Aegean. During the 7th century BC, Smyrna rose to power and splendor. One of the great trade routes which cross Anatolia descends the Hermus valley past Sardis, and then, diverging from the valley, passes south of Mount Sipylus and crosses a <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> into the little valley where Smyrna lies between the mountains and the sea. Miletus and later Ephesus were situated at the sea end of the other great trade route across Anatolia; they competed for a time successfully with Smyrna; but after both cities' harbors silted up, Smyrna was without a rival.|$|E

25|$|Southern Tunisia is {{a region}} of broken terrain, with rocky ridge lines and desert, which obstruct manoeuvre; {{opposite}} a bight where the north–south coast opens to the east, a semi-arid, scrub covered coastal plain is met inland by the Matmata Hills which run south to north. North of Gabès, the road to Sfax passes between {{the sea and the}} Chotts, the only route north for the Eighth Army. Across the plain in a line roughly south-west to north-east, lay the Mareth line, a fortification built by the French in the 1930s. In the north, the hills and line of forts terminated at the Tebaga Gap, a <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> between the Matmata Hills and the Djebel Tebaga, another line of high ground {{to the west of the}} gap running east–west. North and west of this feature is the Chott el Djerid and west of the Matmata Hills, dry Jebel Dahar country and then the impassable sand of the Grand Erg Oriental. Gabès lies on the coast, where the plain meets the route from the Tebaga Gap.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the typical}} circuit, the spark gap's short circuiting action {{prevents}} high-frequency oscillations from 'backing up' into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, high amplitude high frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply transformer's winding. This can induce corona discharges between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer's insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and spark gap to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as neon sign transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal leakage inductance. A normal (low leakage inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current. NSTs are designed to have high leakage inductance to limit their short circuit current to a safe level.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, {{while the}} airport was still named Uplands and a joint-use civilian/military field, {{it was the}} busiest airport in Canada by {{takeoffs}} and landings, reaching a peak of 307,079 aircraft movements in 1959, nearly double its current traffic. At the time, the airport had scheduled airline flights by Trans-Canada Air Lines (Toronto, Montreal, and Val-d'Or), Trans Air (Churchill), and Eastern Air Lines (New York via Syracuse and Washington via Montreal). With the arrival of civilian jet travel, the Canadian government built a new field south of the original one, with two much longer runways and a new terminal building designed to handle up to 900,000 passengers/year. The terminal building {{had been scheduled to}} open in 1959, but during the opening ceremonies, a United States Air Force F-104 Starfighter went supersonic during a <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> over the airport, and the resultant sonic boom shattered most of the glass in the airport (including the entire north wall) and damaged ceiling tiles, door and window frames, and even structural beams. As a result, the opening was delayed until April 1960. The original terminal building and Trans-Canada Airways/DOT hangar continued in private use on the airport's north field until the Fall 2011 when it was demolished.|$|E
