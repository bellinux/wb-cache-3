50|$|In 1933 the Blohm & Voss {{shipbuilding}} {{company in}} Hamburg was suffering {{a financial crisis}} from lack of work. Its owners, brothers Rudolf and Walther Blohm, decided to diversify into aircraft manufacture, believing that there would soon be a market for all-metal, long-range flying boats, especially with the German state airline Deutsche Luft Hansa. They also felt that their experience with all-metal marine construction would prove an advantage. It {{was at that time}} commonly believed that transatlantic air transport would soon take over the role filled by the luxury liners of that time. It was also thought that those planes would be seaplanes and flying boats as they could use the infrastructure and capacity of the seaports already in place, while land facilities at that time were unsuited to such <b>large</b> <b>aeroplanes.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} FE-analysis of <b>large</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> reveals one {{or several}} 2 - 4 Hz modes of the horizontal tailplane (HTP), termed coplanar modes. They describe a coplanar or a fore / aft {{motion of the}} HTP. Due to their low eigenfrequencies, these modes can be easily excited by lateral gust, in particular by continuous turbulence on the fin. As the aerodyamic damping of these modes is small, strong resonance phenomena occur, yielding high loads at the HTP root. Via a mode control system, consisting of a dynamic feedback of the x-acceleration at the HTP-tip to the rudder, active damping and thereby a loads reduction of more than 20 % is demonstrated. The system is termed HTP-contol(ler) ...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{dimensioning}} of a Pax-door of a single aisle aircraft like the Airbus A 320.

A model of the fuselage from the EU project MAAXIMUS can be used for the basic dimensioning of the door. The loads and load cases, are derived from the european Certification Specifications for <b>Large</b> <b>Aeroplanes</b> (CS- 25). Basically a topology optimization of an isotropic solid material is used to generate a design adequate to the load paths. This design is developed further, for being feasible with composites. Failure criteria are evaluated to find weak spots in the design. A manual optimization of the layup will be done to build a design, which can resist the applied loads and load cases. As a result it can be determined, that a design could be found, which _ts to the specifications and gained a weight reduction about 8, 15...|$|E
40|$|The report {{contains}} the design airspeeds and the preliminary loads based on manoeuvre and gust V-n diagrams for the ALLEGRA configuration. For the gust envelopes the Pratt formula of ACJ 25 was used. The ALLEGRA configuration {{is based on}} the final LamAiR configuration developed in the DLR project LamAiR. The ALLEGRA configuration has forward swept wings, a T-Tail, and rear fuselage mounted nacelles. The 150 passenger aircraft is originally designed for laminar flow and less fuel consumption. Within this report all necessary design speeds are given and all the relevant data for manoeuvre- and gust load analysis with respect to CS- 25 and JAR- 25 requirements are computed. For the manoeuvre V-n diagrams the actual requirements, the "Certification Specifications for <b>Large</b> <b>Aeroplanes</b> CS- 25 " from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) have been used. To avoid time consuming rational analysis, as required by CS- 25, gust V-n diagrams have been established by using the Pratt formula of JAR- 25. Therewith the gust load factors for the rigid aircraft are estimated...|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} design process of an adaptive wing trailing edge (ATED) was addressed {{in compliance with}} the demanding requirements posed by the implementation of the architecture on <b>large</b> <b>aeroplanes.</b> Fast and reliable elementary methods combined with rational design criteria were adopted in order to preliminarily define ATED box geometry, structural properties, and the general configuration of the embedded mechanisms enabling box morphing under the action of aerodynamic loads. Aeroelastic stability issues were duly taken in account in order to safely assess inertial and stiffness distributions of the primary structure as well as to provide requirements for the actuation system harmonics. Results and general guidelines coming from the preliminary design were then converted into detailed drawings of each box component. Implemented solutions were based on designer’s industrial experience and were mainly oriented to increase the structural robustness of the device, to minimize its manufacturing costs, and to simplify assembly and maintenance procedures. The static robustness of the executive layout was verified by means of linear and nonlinear stress analyses based on advanced FE models; dynamic aeroelastic behaviour of the stress-checked structure was finally investigated by means of rational analyses based on theoretical mode association...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{the design}} choices {{of the new}} {{generation}} aircraft are moving towards {{the research and development}} of innovative technologies, aimed at improving performance as well as to minimize the environmental impact. In the current “greening” context, the morphing structures represent a very attractive answer to such requirements: both aerodynamic and structural advantages are ensured in several flight conditions, safeguarding the fuel consumption at the same time. An aeronautical intelligent system is therefore the outcome of combining complex smart materials and structures, assuring the best functionality level in the flight envelope. The Adaptive Trailing Edge Device (ATED) is a sub-project inside SARISTU (Smart Intelligent Aircraft Structures), an L 2 level project of the 7 th EU Framework programme coordinated by Airbus, aimed at developing technologies for realizing a morphing wing extremity addressed to improve the general aircraft performance and to reduce the fuel burning up to 5 %. This specific study, divided into design, manufacturing and testing phases, involved universities, research centers and leading industries of the European consortium. The paper deals with the aeroelastic impact assessment of a full-scale morphing wing trailing edge on a <b>Large</b> <b>Aeroplanes</b> category aircraft. The FE (Finite Element) model of the technology demonstrator, located in the aileron region and manufactured within the project, was referenced to for the extrapolation of the structural properties of the whole adaptive trailing edge device placed in its actual location in the outer wing. The input FE models were processed within MSC-Nastran® environment to estimate stiffness and inertial distributions suitable to construct the aeroelastic stick-beam mock-up of the reference structure. Afterwards, a flutter analysis in simulated operative condition, have been carried out by means of Sandy®, an in-house code, according to meet the safety requirements imposed by the applicable aviation regulations (paragraph 25. 629, parts (a) and (b) -(1)) ...|$|E

25|$|The Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII was a bomber {{aircraft}} {{designed and}} built in Germany from 1916.

500|$|Possibly as {{a result}} of {{rough-running}} of one or more of its engines, the Amana was observed flying over Perth's outer-eastern suburbs at an unusually low altitude. No witness report was received from anyone along the next [...] of the Amana's track from Perth's outer suburbs to within [...] of the crash site. In the minute before it crashed, eight witnesses heard a <b>large</b> <b>aeroplane</b> in distress and reported unusual engine noise, including engine noise ceasing on at least one occasion, followed by the sudden return of very loud engine noise. This suggested that, on at least one occasion, none of the engines were producing power, followed by a resumption of power on some of the engines. The investigation team concluded that the Amana failed to reach its assigned altitude of 9,000 feet, and that it experienced intermittent engine problems of such severity that all engine power was lost on at least one occasion. Without power and with only one of its propellers feathered, a Douglas DC-4 loses altitude at a great rate, possibly as fast as 100 feet per second (6,000 feet per minute).|$|R
