Therefore, volume elements including the real microstructure of the materials are loaded bi- and triaxially beyond macroscopic yield. The shape of the obtained yield surfaces are compared to the surfaces of four continuum models which, amongst others, are proposed in literature to describe the inelastic behavior of gray cast iron with <b>lamellar</b> <b>shaped</b> graphite inclusions. It is found that the presented continuum models and the macroscopic yield surfaces obtained with microstructure-based finite-element models deviate. Furthermore, the initial inelastic flow direction is computed at the onset of macroscopic yielding. The analysis show that the inelastic flow is normal to the yield surface...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} a new {{anticorrosion}} pigment, synthesized on a core-shell basis. For its syntheses a starting substance is used that forms the <b>lamellar</b> <b>shaped</b> core; namely <b>lamellar</b> zinc. The cover of the core is represented by zinc oxide, which is in fact partly oxidized lamellar zinc core, and is created during the calcination of the pigment. The compound that forms {{the top layer of}} the core, a ferrite, is also formed during calcination. The formula for the prepared pigment is then defined as MexZn 1 -xFe 2 O 4 /Zn and the formula of thin ferrite layer is MexZn 1 -xFe 2 O 4 (where Me = Ca, Mg). Due to its shape, this anticorrosion pigment includes another anticorrosion effect, the so called “barrier effect”. The mechanisms of anticorrosion effect, corrosion efficiency and mechanical properties were investigated for epoxy-ester paint systems with 10 %pigment volume concentration (PVC). Mechanical tests were performed to determine the adhesiveness and mechanical resistance of paints and accelerated corrosion tests were carried out to evaluate efficiency against chemical degradation factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} {{effects of}} static magnetic fields (MFs) with intensity of 6 mT were investigated in lymphocytes and U 937 {{cells in the}} presence or absence of apoptosis-inducing drugs by transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy. Lectin cytochemistry of ConA-FITC conjugates was used to analyze plasma membrane structural modifications. Static MFs modified cell shape, plasma membrane and increased the level of intracellular [Ca++] which plays an antiapoptotic role in both cell types. Modifications induced by the exposure to static MFs were irrespective of {{the presence or absence}} of apoptotic drugs or the cell type. Abundant lamellar-shaped microvilli were observed upon 24 hrs of continuous exposure to static MFs in contrast to the normally rough surface of U 937 cells having numerous short microvilli. Conversely, lymphocytes lost their round shape and became irregularly elongated; <b>lamellar</b> <b>shaped</b> microvilli were found when cells were simultaneosly exposed to static MFs and apoptosis-inducing drugs. In our experiments, static MFs reduced the smoothness of the cell surface and partially impeded changes in distribution of cell surface glycans, both features being typical of apoptotic cells. Cell shape and plasma membrane structure modifications upon static MFs exposure were time-dependent. Lamellar microvilli were clearly observed before the distortion of cell shape, which was found at long times of exposure. MFs exposure promoted the rearrangement of F-actin filaments which, in turn, could be responsible for the cell surface modifications. Here we report data that support biological effects of static MFs on U 937 cells and human lymphocytes. However, the involvement of these modifications in the onset of diseases needs to be further elucidated...|$|R

We show that this threshold coincides with the predicted critical surface area for the elongation instability of the circular shape.

40|$|We study morphologies of {{thin-film}} diblock copolymers {{between two}} flat and parallel walls. The study {{is restricted to}} the weak segregation regime below the order-disorder transition temperature. The deviation from perfect <b>lamellar</b> <b>shape</b> is calculated for phases which are perpendicular and parallel to the walls. We examine the undulations of the inter material dividing surface and its angle with the walls, and find that the deviation from its unperturbed position can be much larger than in the strong segregation case. Evaluating the weak segregation stability of the lamellar phases, it is shown that a surface interaction, which is quadratic in the monomer concentration, favors the perpendicular lamellar phase. In particular, the degeneracy between perpendicular and unfrustrated parallel lamellar phases for walls without a preferential adsorption is removed.

It was found that inorganic filler agglomeration became more serious at higher-filler-content MMMs. In the case of PES/MMT MMMs, both the CO 2 and CH 4 permeabilities increased significantly with the increasing filler content and consequently the gas selectivity was greatly reduced. At high MMT loadings (P 10 wt. %), Knudsen diffusion became the predominant gas transport mechanism. A different trend was achieved {{in the case of}} PES/TiO 2 MMMs. The CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity increased from 24. 5 (pure PES membrane) to a maximum value of 38. 5 at 4 wt. % TiO 2 MMM and then decreased with a further increase in TiO 2 content (e. g. 17. 3 for 20 wt. %).

Among the insertions, the femoral insertion of the medial collateral ligament showed the lowest frequency and depth of interdigitations at the soft tissue-bone interface, but had the thickest zone of calcified fibrocartilage. An inverse relationship was found at the insertion interface of the cruciate and patellar ligaments.

The freezing temperature increases with increasing particle size while the blocking one decreases with particle size. The origin of these magnetic phenomena relies in the internal disordered character of samples and the competitive interaction of Fe and Mn atoms. The increase of their critical freezing temperature with increasing mean particle size is due to the increase of the magnetic dipolar interaction between the magnetic moment of each particle with the field produced by the other magnetic moments of their surrounding particles.

AZ 31 {{magnesium}} alloy profiles were prepared by continuous rheo-extrusion process, {{and effects of}} solution and aging treatments on the microstructures and mechanical properties was investigated by OLYMPUS optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectroscopy device and tensile machine. The results reveal that saturated solid solution was formed in the profile at a solution temperature of 415 °C and 16 hours. During aging treatment of saturated solid solution, β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase nucleates firstly at grain boundaries and takes on globular growth, which is mainly due to the lower interfacial energy in coherent or semi-coherent interface between β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase and matrix phase. Lower interfacial energy is favorable to the nucleation and growth of β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase at grain boundary. With the increase of aging time or the rise of aging temperature, β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase precipitates out gradually from grain interior and starts to grow in globular shape. After β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase grows to a certain extent, it grows in <b>lamellar</b> <b>shape</b> along the orientation of lower mismatch between β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase and matrix phase.

The pear-shaped gonads of 6 - 8 cm elvers assume, in 12 - 15 cm eels, a <b>lamellar</b> <b>shape</b> and enlarge by migration of germ cells, which we refer to as primary primordial germ cells. In the gonads of - 16 cm eels, the primary primordial germ cells multiply, giving rise to clusters of germ cells that have ultrastructural characteristics of the primary primordial germ cells but show giant mitochondria, enlarged Golgi complexes, and round bodies not limited by membranes We refer to these as secondary primordial germ cells. In 16 - 18 cm eels, syncytial clones of oogonia interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges are also observed. In 18 - 22 -cm-Iong eels, the gonads contain primordial germ cells, oogonial clones, early oocyte cysts, single oocytes in early growth stages, and primary spermatogonia. Such germ cells {{are present in the}} same cross section where they are either intermingled or are in areas of predominantly female germ cells close to areas with predominantly male germ cells. These gonads are juvenile hermaphroditic and should be considered ambisexual because in larger eels they differentiate either into an ovary or into a testis. Somatic cells always envelop the germ cells following their migration into the gonad. These somatic cells first show similar ultra- structural features and then differentiate either into early Sertoli cells investing spermatogonia, or into early follicular (granulosa) cells investing the early previtellogenic oocytes. In eels - 14 cm long, primitive steroid-producing cells also migrate into the gonad. In the ambisexual gonad they differentiate either into immature Leydig cells in the male areas, or into early special cells of the theca in the female areas. Nerve fibers are joined to the steroid-producing cells. Gonad development and differentiation are also associated with structuraI changes of the connective tissue characterized by the progressive appearance and deposition of collagen fibrils first in the mesogonadium, then in the gonad vascular region, and then in the germinal region. The collagen-rich areas are massive in the male areas and reduced in the female ones...|$|E

40|$|Shrinkage {{porosity}} {{and metal}} expansion penetration are two fundamental defects appearing at production ofcomplex <b>shaped</b> <b>lamellar</b> cast iron components. In previous work {{it has been}} shown that both shrinkageporosity and metal expansion penetration are related to the primary austenite dendrite network and itsformation mechanisms. The purpose of the present work is to study the morphology of primary austenite intest casting with a high tendency to form shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration. Simplified testmodels simulating the thermal and geometrical conditions similar to the conditions existing in complex shapedcasting have been successfully used to provoke shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration. Stereological investigation of the primary dendrite morphology indicates a maximum interdendritic space inconnection to the casting surface where the porosity and the penetration defect appear. Away from the defectformation area the interdendritic space decreases. Furthermore the local solidification times of the investigatedsamples were calculated in a 3 D simulation software. Comparison of the simulated local solidification timesand measured interdendritic space indicates a strong relation of the same shape as it is known from theliterature when dynamic coarsening mechanism is characterized. The main outcome of the present paper is theobserved gradient of increasing interdendritic space from sections with high local solidification to sectionswith low solidification time. The mechanism of increasing the interdendritic phase can be explained by thedynamic ripening process. The unfortunate thermal conditions with the slowest local solidification timesituated in the border between the casting surface and its surrounding are considered the reason to form anaustenite morphology which can promote the mass flow between dendrite provoking shrinkage porosity ormetal expansion penetration.

40|$|The limpet, Lepetodrilus fucensis McLean, {{is found}} in {{prominent}} stacks around hydrothermal vents on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. L. fucensis hosts a filamentous episymbiont on its gill lamellae that may be ingested directly by the gill epithelium. To assess the persistence of this symbiosis I used microscopy to examine the gills of L. fucensis from sites representing its geographic range and different habitats. The symbiosis is present on all the specimens examined in this study, including both sexes {{and a range of}} juvenile and adult sizes. Next, I aimed to determine if patterns in bacterial abundance, host condition, and gill morphology support the hypotheses that the bacteria are chemoautotrophic and provide limpets with a food resource. To do so, I compared specimens from high and low flux locations at multiple vents. My results support the above hypotheses: (1) gill bacteria are significantly less abundant in low flux where the concentrations of reduced chemicals (for chemoautotrophy) are negligible, (2) low flux specimens have remarkably poor tissue condition, and (3) the lamellae of high flux limpets have greater surface area: the blood space and bacteria-hosting epithelium are deeper and have more folds than low flux lamellae, modifications that support higher symbiont abundances. I next asked if the morphology of the lamellae could change. To test this, I moved high flux limpets away from a vent and after 1 year the <b>lamellar</b> depth and <b>shape</b> of the transplanted specimens resembled low flux gills. Last, I was interested in whether bacterial digestion by the gill epithelium is a significant feeding mechanism. As bacteria-like cells are rarely apparent in lysosomes of the gill epithelium, I predicted that lysosome number would be unrelated to bacterial abundance. My data support this prediction, suggesting that digestion of bacteria by the gill epithelium probably contributes only minimally to the limpet’s nutrition. Overall, the persistence and morphology of the L. fucensis gill symbiosis relates to the intensity of vent flux and indicates that specimens from a variety of habitats may be necessary to characterize the morphological variability of gill-hosted symbioses in other molluscs...|$|R
40|$|Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} (PET) bottles are {{plastic containers}} that are typically discarded, and thus, cause environmental pollution. To solve this problem, PET bottles are recycled in concrete. Previous studies have mostly used PET with straight or irregularly shaped fibers. It {{has been shown}} that PET has a weak interfacial bond with cement paste in the pullout load because of the <b>lamellar</b> <b>shape</b> of fibers. Therefore, ringshaped PET (RPET) fibers are introduced in this study to overcome the limitations of traditional straight, lamellar, or irregularly shaped fibers. RPET fibers are mainly designed with a special shape to mobilize fiber yielding rather than fiber pullout. RPET fibers are made directly from waste bottles. The diameter of RPET bottles is fixed at 60 ± 5 mm. The width of RPET fibers is fixed at 5, 7. 5, or 10 mm and designated as RPET- 5, RPET- 7. 5, and RPET- 10 respectively. This study mainly determines the optimum water– binder ratio and fiber content of RPET fiber concrete (FC) through self-compacting, as well as through compressive, tensile, and toughness strength tests. A water–binder ratio of 0. 55 and working ranges from 0. 25 % to 1 % of fiber content are successfully accepted for all sizes of RPET fibers. Result of the pullout test shows that RPET fiber interfacial bond strength ranges from 0. 502 MPa to 0. 519 MPa for RPET- 5 fiber, from 0. 507 MPa to 0. 529 MPa for RPET- 7. 5 fiber, and from 0. 516 MPa to 0. 540 MPa for RPET- 10 fiber. This study presented that the compressive and tensile strength of RPET fiber exhibited an increase of 17. 3 % and 35. 7 %, respectively compared to normal concrete. RPET FC shows improvement in first crack load for flexural toughness strength of RPET FC with increase of 24. 5 % compared to normal concrete specimen. Moreover, 156 FC cylinders were used to develop new equations for predicting the compressive and tensile strengths of RPET FC via multiple regression analysis. Two equations are obtained. These equations are included in calculating compressive and tensile strength of RPET FC limited up to 28 days In conclusion, incorporating RPET fibers when recycling waste PET bottles in concrete produces FC with An improvement performance comparable to that of normal concrete...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand of renewable biomass-derived fuels, generally known as biofuels, in order to overcome the need of fossil ones, and ultimately, deal with the environmental regulations imposed by the recent international agreements, which will hopefully lead to a limitation of global warming below 2 °C. The human being has used biomasses to solve its energetic and non-energetic needs for millennia before the Industrial Era, but in the 21 st century there {{is the need to}} go a little bit further, for this reason, it is born the concept of biorefinery, or biofactory, in contrast with the oil-based refinery. In a fully integrated biorefinery, biomasses with variable origin are transformed through chemical and biochemical processes in a plethora of chemicals, fuels like ethanol and FAMEs, but also polymer monomers, drug precursors and food additives. The biorefinery will provide the scale dimensions and production flexibility to compete with the oil industry and, ultimately, will cause a global change in the geography of the energy and chemical industry. However, the development of efficient models of biorefinery based on non-edible second generation biomasses is still economically tricky, and there the need to couple fuels production with high-value chemical building blocks. Particular attention should be addressed to lignin fraction which is the most underutilized component of lignocellulosic biomass. Despite lignin is an incredible source of aromatic compounds, it is commonly intended to landfill or, in the best case, used as solid combustible. In this sense, this work has dealt with the development of processes for the transformation of industrial lignin streams into chemicals of interest for the industry, as alternative to pyrolysis or mere combustion. On one hand, we investigated the reductive route which involves the use of H 2 firstly, to carry out the hydrogenolysis of lignin to give a phenols-rich bio-oil, and secondly, to transform this phenols mixture to other products through a hydrodeoxygenation reaction. On the other hand, we explored the oxidative route which involves the use of an oxidant to break down lignin matrix to functionalized phenols and carboxylic acids. Both pathways offer the opportunity to produce significant quantities of renewable building blocks, which will ultimately support the economic sustainability of the integrated biorefinery. The following paragraphs resume the content of the main chapters of this dissertation. The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol has been chosen as a model process for the upgrading of lignin-derived bio-oils. Tests were carried out in a batch reactor at 350 °C, 40 bar of H 2, in the presence of several Mo-based catalysts prepared by impregnation of ammonium molybdate on SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, NaY zeolite, MgO, activated carbon and graphite. These materials have been characterized by means of: N 2 physisorption, XRD, FESEM/EDS, XPS, TPR-H 2, TPD-NH 3, with the aim of correlating the physical and chemical properties of the prepared samples with the resulting features in the HDO reaction. Mo on activated carbon showed the best performances towards guaiacol demethoxylation, exhibiting complete conversion, 72 % of selectivity to phenol and 19 % to p- and o-cresol. The high surface area and low acidity of activated carbon allow good dispersion of MoOx which exhibits characteristic fragments with <b>lamellar</b> <b>shape,</b> capable to provide large active surface with localized acidity. A phenolic bio-oil, derived from an industrial hydrogenolysis facility treating 2 nd generation lignin, was used as starting material for the recovery of phenolic monomers by means of an ad hoc vacuum distillation apparatus. The initial 20 %wt content of monomers was efficiently separated with the 90 % of yield, showing guaiacol, phenol and ethylphenol as main components. Afterwards, the distillate was upgraded through an HDO reaction in order to narrow the compounds distribution and to improve the stability of the mix. The process was carried out under similar conditions as the ones adopted in Chapter 3, allowing achieving the complete demethoxylation of the mix with high selectivity. Notably, the presence of the Mo-base catalyst over activated carbon significantly enhanced the performances of the reaction. Wet air oxidation (WAO) of lignocellulosic biomasses is a promising route for the production of renewable and valuable compounds, involving air as primary oxidant and mild reaction temperatures. In this work, an industrial residue of bioethanol production, steam exploded lignin derived from wheat straw, undergoes a WAO process with the aim to achieve more insights on the process performances in terms of potential yields of aromatic compounds and carboxylic acids (CAs). The experiments were carried out in a pressurized 50 ml batch reactor loaded with water or other aqueous solutions as solvent, the standard conditions were 150 °C of temperature, 20 bar of initial air pressure and 2 h. Afterwards, several solvothermal pretreatments were applied in order to depolymerize and solubilize lignin under inert atmosphere; the residues-free solutions obtained in this way were used as substrate for the WAO reaction. The choice of the pretreatment temperature, solvent alkalinity and presence of perovskite catalysts were evaluated with regard to the mass yields of resulting aromatic compounds and CAs, their carbon content and the products distribution. Best performance exhibits a lignin dissolution ratio of 53 % with 1. 3 % of yield towards aromatic compounds where vanillin is the principal product (59. 1 %) but also the 32 % of yield in CAs with glycolic acid as major product (40. 9 %). Acetovanillone (AV) was selected as lignin model molecule in order to investigate its behavior under the WAO reaction conditions. The experiments were carried out in a pressurized 50 ml batch reactor loaded with NaOH 2 M as solvent, the reaction takes 1 h with temperatures ranging from 130 to 190 °C and air pressures between 5 and 30 bar. A heterogeneous catalyst, the perovskite-type mixed oxide LaFeO 3 was synthetized and used as catalyst in order to improve the activation of molecular oxygen. Vanillin yield resulted to benefit from high reaction temperature showing a maximum carbon yield of 22 %, instead the formation of carboxylic acids from the oxidative degradation of AV largely benefits from high pressure of air, exhibiting an overall carbon yield of 35 %. The produced compounds include oxalic, glycolic, lactic, malonic and levulinic acid...|$|E
40|$|Although {{lamellar}} granules {{are critical}} {{to the formation of}} the epidermal permeability barrier and are a known marker of late keratinocyte differentiation, very {{little is known about the}} physiologic regulators of lamellar granule assembly and extrusion. Ceramide glucosyltransferase (CGT), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of lamellar granule glucosylceramides (GlcCer; the precursors of the stratum corneum ceramides), is localized to the Golgi apparatus in other cell types. We have found that CGT is induced during keratinocyte culture differentiation coincident with increased GlcCer content and the appearance of lamellar granules. In this study we show that the differentiation-related CGT induction is likely mediated at the transcriptional level. In addition, all-trans retinoic acid, a well-known inhibitor of keratinocyte differentiation, prevents the appearance of lamellar granules and decreases culture CGT activity and GlcCer content without affecting sphingomyelin or total lipid content, indicating a specific inhibition of this enzymatic pathway. These data show a direct relationship between CGT activity and epidermal differentiation, suggesting that regulation of CGT expression is a critical part of epidermal barrier generation. The differentiation dependence of CGT activity, the key role of this Golgi-localized enzyme in epidermal GlcCer synthesis, and our previous finding that ceramides are converted to GlcCer in the Golgi apparatus in keratinocyte cultures, strongly suggest a Golgi origin for lamellar granules. In contrast to CGT, the activity of the lysosomal enzymes acid lipase and glucocerebrosidase is less clearly related to epidermal differentiation and the appearance of lamellar granules, although both enzymes show striking colocalization and enrichment in a subcellular lamellar granule fraction derived from pig epidermis. Acid lipase activity in the lamellar granule fraction was found to contain primarily a small lysosomal form of the enzyme, whereas total acid lipase secreted by keratinocyte cultures was found to contain a mannose- 6 -phosphorylated large prelysosomal form as well as a small lysosomal form. That secreted acid lipase activity is derived from both prelysosomal and lysosomal compartments suggests there may be multiple pathways by which lysosomal enzymes are secreted from keratinocytes. The combined secretion of lipid and lysosomal enzymes from lamellar granules places these organelles in the category of “dual-function” specialized secretory vesicles described in certain other cell types. Electron microscopic images of <b>lamellar</b> granules show <b>shapes</b> consistent with cross-sections of tubules or buds from tubules in addition to vesicles. These images provide evidence for the involvement of trans-Golgi network tubules and/or buds in lamellar granule synthesis and secretion.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{research}} activity, focused on two investigations topics, both {{addressed to the}} preparation and characterization of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) based nano-materials for biomedical applications, is reported. In particular, {{the research}} deals with the preparation of a new polymeric substrate for vaccine (line 1) and superparamagnetic nanoparticles-PLLA core-shell nanocomposites for targeted and controlled release of anti-tumor drugs (line 2). The polymer we used in both the researches, the poly (L-lactide) (PLLA), {{is one of the}} most investigated synthetic product in the biomedical field because of its good mechanical properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability. In this work the PLLA has been used in: - Line 1, as a possible biodegradable carrier for the development of a vaccine. We employed the polymer in guise of lamellar single crystals (PLLAsc) growth from dilute solution, characterized by a 1 D-nano- 2 D-micro morphology and by a high specific area. - Line 2, as the outer coating of micro-nano-superparamagnetic particles (MNPs) for the realization of nano-composites with core-shell morphology to be used for the preparation of drug-delivery systems. Line 1. In the last years, the research on innovative immunization systems took into account the use of polymer micro or nano particles as substrate, vehicle or/and adjuvant for development of new vaccines. In traditional vaccination systems, the conventional antigens are highly immunogenic and induce a strong and durable protective response in the individual immune system. At the same time, the antigen may be potentially harmful or induce dangerous side effects. In contrast, vaccines based on antigens composed of sub-molecular units, obtained by recombinant DNA techniques, usually has negligible side effects. Unfortunately, with rare exceptions, this type of antigen induces low antibody responses and need an "adjuvant" that can enhance the immunogenicity. The research in this field is boosted by the possibility to use immunotherapy for the tumors prevention and eradication. In fact, the cancer, during the malignant progression, is able to evade the body immune response by developing mechanisms that hide its presence to the host. If the immune system is activated by a proper vaccine against these tumours, the body could be able to kill the tumoral cells In this research, the E 7 protein of human papillomavirus (HPV 16), related to the formation of cervical cancer, has been used for the preparation of a polymer/antigen vaccine. PLLA single crystals (PLLAsc), characterized by an <b>lamellar</b> hexagonal <b>shape</b> with lateral dimensions of about 15 micron and thickness of 10 nm, were used as biodegradable antigene carrier. To increase the hydrophilicity and provide the PLLAsc of active sites useful to the subsequent protein adsorption, a controlled reaction of aminolysis with tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) was carried out on the surface ester bond of PLLAsc (APLLAsc). The pristine and functionalized single crystals were characterized and the effectiveness of the APLLAsc-E 7 vaccine was evaluated by tumour protection experiments on mice. It has been observed that, unlike the behaviour of non-functionalized single crystals, the lamellae have a strong adjuvant effect. The results opens interesting perspectives for a possible use of the APLLAsc-E 7 system as a single dose vaccine. Line 2. Superparamagnetic nano-particles (MNPs) represent the object of an extensive research in the material science and medicine fields. In fact, by a proper selection of the composition, it is possible to prepare hybrid inorganic core-polymer shell nanocomposites able to fulfill diagnostic and therapeutic tasks. The MNPs are magnetized only in presence of an external magnetic fields and show no residual magnetism when the field is removed, that is no hysteresis in the magnetization curve is observed. In this class of nanoparticles are included superparamagnetic iron oxides and iron oxides doped with + 2 cations (M: Mn, Co, Fe, Ni) to form MFe 2 O 4 spinel structures. The coating of MNPs by organic shell is mandatory to overcome their agglomeration driven by their high surface-to-volume ratio. Moreover, the outermost sheath can increase the nanoparticles circulation time in vivo before their clearance by macrophages in the reticulo-endothelial system. The MNPs can be directed toward a target organ or tissue by external magnetic field. Once they reach the target they can perform their therapeutic task by means physical or chemical process. As far as the former is concerned, when subject to alternating external magnetic field, magnetic nanoparticles absorb energy and convert it into heat through a mechanism called magnetic hyperthermia. The generated local temperature increase, up to 41 - 47 °C, can kills the surrounding tissue cells, such as cancer cells. As far the chemical action, MNPs can be loaded with a drug and used as drug delivery vehicles. The possibility to direct them on a specific target has the advantage to increase the potency of many therapeutics and reduce their possible systemic toxicity. Moreover, the drug release can be trigged by external stimuli. The local magnetic hyperthermia, for instance, can activate polymer transition, like volume collapse of a thermo-sensitive polymer shell, and induce an accelerative drug release. In this research, superparamagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), composed of manganese and iron oxides (MnFe 2 O 4) and synthesized by the technique of water-in-oil microemulsion, have been used. The obtained MNPs have sizes in the order of 10 nm and present superparamagnetic behaviour. Three different methods were used to coat the nanoparticles with PLLA and to obtain a core-shell nanocomposite: - Grafting from: -OH groups on the surface of nanoparticles have been used as initiators for catalyzed ring opening polymerization (ROP) of L-lactide. - Grafting to: a series of carboxylated-poly(L-lactide) with different molecular weight (CPLLAs), based on 2, 2 -bis(hydroxymethyl) propionic acid (DMPA) as initiator, have been prepared by ROP. Then, CPLLAs were adsorbed onto nanoparticles surface by exploiting the specific interaction of the carboxylic acid with the MNPs surface. - One step: the monomer (L-lactide), the initiator (DMPA), MNPs and the catalyst were reacted simultaneously. All the CPLLAs and the three types of nano-composites were chemical and physico-chemical characterized. Even if the grafting from and one step methods are more attractive from the scale-up point of view, they have provided low yields. The grafting to method was observed to be more controllable in terms of molecular weights and thickness of the shell. The nanocomposites were then loaded with an anti-tumor model drug (Usnic acid) and the static and dynamic release of the drug in PBS was evaluated...|$|R
