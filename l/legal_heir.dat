5|$|After her husband's death, Mary Shelley {{lived for}} a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa, where she often saw Byron and {{transcribed}} his poems. She resolved to live by her pen and for her son, but her financial situation was precarious. On 23 July 1823, she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her father-in-law enabled her to lodge nearby. Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson, Percy Florence, only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian. Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly. She managed instead to wring out of Sir Timothy a limited annual allowance (which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate), but {{to the end of}} his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers. Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband's poems, among other literary endeavours, but concern for her son restricted her options. Sir Timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published. In 1826, Percy Florence became the <b>legal</b> <b>heir</b> of the Shelley estate after the death of his half-brother Charles Shelley, his father's son by Harriet Shelley. Sir Timothy raised Mary's allowance from £100 a year to £250 but remained as difficult as ever. Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin's circle, but poverty prevented her from socialising as she wished. She also felt ostracised by those who, like Sir Timothy, still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E

25|$|This section's {{focus on}} Joseph is unusual. Swiss theologian Eduard Schweizer {{suggests}} that Matthew {{is far more}} concerned with proving Jesus' legal status as the stepson of Joseph, and thus a <b>legal</b> <b>heir</b> of David, than with proving the Virgin Birth. Schweizer feels this evinces Matthew's intended audience was of predominantly Jewish background, a pattern continuing throughout the Gospel, and the importance Old Testament references provides further evidence. Hill feels the quote from Isaiah was, in fact, the central element and believes the entire {{last part of the}} chapter was written to prove that Jesus' story matches the prophecy.|$|E

25|$|Compared with Henry's {{first two}} wives, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, Blount's {{importance}} to history was negligible. However, she was certainly {{more important than}} any other mistress the king had during his first marriage.

25|$|On 27 October 1430 Vytautas the Great, Grand Duke of Lithuania, {{suddenly}} died {{without leaving}} an heir or a will.

Vytautas' only daughter, Sophia of Lithuania, had married Vasily I of Moscow and had only one surviving son, Vasily II. He was Orthodox and could not lead the recently Christianized Catholic Grand Duchy. Their adherence to the Orthodox faith also prevented many other Gediminids from becoming pretenders to the throne.

25|$|In 1183 {{a general}} tax was levied {{throughout}} the kingdom, which was unprecedented in Jerusalem {{and almost all}} of medieval Europe to that point.

More troops were certainly needed, since Saladin was finally able to gain control of Aleppo, and with peace in his northern territories he could focus on Jerusalem in the south. King Baldwin was so incapacitated by his leprosy that it was necessary to appoint a regent, and Guy of Lusignan was chosen, as he was Baldwin's <b>legal</b> <b>heir</b> and the king was not expected to live. The inexperienced Guy led the Frankish army against Saladin's incursions into the kingdom, but neither side made any real gains, and Guy was criticized by his opponents for not striking against Saladin when he had the chance.|$|E
