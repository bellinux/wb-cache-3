5000|$|It {{centers on}} Sydney Fox, a {{professor}} {{who is also}} a globe-trotting [...] "relic hunter" [...] who looks for ancient artifacts to return to museums and/or the descendants of the original owner. She is aided by her <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistant</b> Nigel and occasionally by her somewhat air-headed secretary Claudia. She often ends up battling rival hunters seeking out artifacts for monetary gain. The series includes fantasy and science fiction elements, with many of the relics featured having supposed supernatural powers or being pieces of unusually advanced technology.|$|E
50|$|Born in Lemery, Batangas to Pedro Agoncillo and Feliza Andal, {{both from}} landed {{families}} in Batangas, Agoncillo obtained a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of the Philippines in 1934 and a master's {{degree in the}} arts from the same university the following year. He earned his living as a <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistant</b> at the Institute of National Language and as an instructor at the Far Eastern University and the Manuel L. Quezon University. In 1956, he published his seminal work, Revolt of the Masses: The Story of Bonifacio and the Katipunan, {{a history of the}} 1896 Katipunan-led revolt against Spanish rule and its leader, Andres Bonifacio. He garnered acclaim for this book, as well as criticisms from more conservative historians discomfited by the work's nationalist bent.|$|E
40|$|The Modern Language major of the Foreign Language Department of the University of El Salvador {{was created}} by 2001 and {{launched}} officially {{at the end of}} the year 2002 as an institutional project that was supported by the local French Embassy. The main objective was to promote French language learning among Salvadoran university students to become proficient in French and English languages during the whole five-year program as well as giving the option to take part in the Spanish teaching- assistant program in France among others. By the year 2004, the <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistants</b> of the local French Embassy started promoting the exchange among the rising number of students of the Modern Language major in order to encourage them to turn out to be successful students to be taken into consideration to be part of the selection process to become language assistants in France. It is indispensable to mention that the first massive participation of the students of the Modern Language major in this exchange took place until the year 2005 when about thirteen students were selected to take part in the program. In the previous years some students of different majors of the University of El Salvador participated in the selection process and later were selected as Spanish teacher-assistants to open the path for the students of the emerging major...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDialectal Arabic (DA) poses serious {{challenges}} for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The number and sophistication of tools and datasets in DA are very limited {{in comparison to}} Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and other languages. MSA tools do not effectively model DA which makes the direct use of MSA NLP tools for handling dialects impractical. This is particularly a challenge {{for the creation of}} tools to support learning Arabic as a living language on the web, where authentic material can be found in both MSA and DA. In this paper, we present the Dialectal Arabic <b>Linguistic</b> Learning <b>Assistant</b> (DALILA), a Chrome extension that utilizes cutting-edge Arabic dialect NLP research to assist learners and non-native speakers in understanding text written in either MSA or DA. DALILA provides dialectal word analysis and English gloss corresponding to each word...|$|R
5000|$|In a section, Lycian Inscriptions, of Appendix B of {{his second}} journal, Fellows {{includes}} his transliterations of TAM I 44, with remarks and attempted interpretations. He admits {{to being able to}} do little with it; however, he does note, [...] "some curious analogies might be shown in the pronouns of the other Indo-Germanic languages". He had already decided, then, that the language was Indo-European. He had written this appendix from studies performed while he was waiting for the firman in 1840. The conclusions were not really his, however. He quotes a letter from his <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistant,</b> Daniel Sharpe, to whom he had sent copies, mentioning Grotefend's conclusion, based on five previously known inscriptions, that Lycian was Indo-Germanic. By now he was referring to [...] "the inscription on the obelisk at Xanthus." [...] He had perceived that the deceased was mentioned as arppagooû tedēem, [...] "son of Harpagos," [...] from which the stele also became known as [...] "the Harpagos stele." [...] Fellows identified this Harpagus with the conqueror of Lycia and dated the obelisk to 500 BC on the historical Harpagus. His view has been called the Harpagid Theory by Antony Keen.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our {{recent advances in}} Ling-Wear, a wearable <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistant</b> for tourists. Ling-Wear allows uninformed users {{to find their way}} in for-eign cities or to ask for information about sightseeing, accommodations, and other places of interest. Moreover, the system allows the user to communicate with local residents through integrated speech-to-speech translation. Furthermore, the graphical user interface (GUI) of LingWear runs also on small hand-held devices (e. g. Compaq’s iPAQ). In this client-server solution the main components of the system are running on a wireless con-nected server. The user can query LingWear either by means of spontaneous speech or via touch screen and receive the system’s responds either by the integrated speech synthesis or by display messages. 1...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{advantages}} that object technology can provide to the software development community and its customers, the fundamental {{problems associated with}} identifying objects, their attributes, and methods remain: it is a largely manual process driven by heuristics that analysts acquire through experience. While a number of methods exist for requirements development and specification, very few tools exist to assist analysts in {{making the transition from}} textual descriptions to other notations for object-oriented analysis and other conceptual models. In this paper we describe a methodology and a prototype tool, <b>Linguistic</b> <b>assistant</b> for Domain Analysis (LIDA), which provide linguistic assistance in the model development process. We first present our methodology to conceptual modeling through linguistic analysis. We give an overview of LIDA's functionality and present its technical design and the functionality of its components. We also provide a comparison of LIDA’s functionality with that of other research prototypes. Finally, we present an example of how LIDA is used in a conceptual modeling task. 1...|$|E
40|$|Singers of indigenous, long {{narratives}} in the Philippines {{employ a}} number of tunes in setting the verses. In this paper, I examine the tunes that Datu Sinuhoy Kaligunan utilized in his UWAGING performance, lasting near 11 hours, that I recorded in May 2005. Datu Sinuhoy is a Pulangihon-Umayamnon Bukidnon speaker. His tunes are named according to: (1) non-lexical formulaic expressions, (2) {{the places where the}} tunes are perceived to originate, and (3) even names of individual beings–persons and spirits–from those places. An investigation of the recording of the Pulangihon-Umayamnon uwaging performance in its entirety reveals that some tunes are used to project the moods and feelings attendant to the actions of the narrative but they are not emblematic of the characters in the narrative per se as in the Palawan TULTUL. I argue that tunes are important in uwaging performance for they facilitate the linear grouping of words into verse units that generally span eight (musical) pulses, each of which is assigned one syllable each. Like most epics in the Philippines (e. g., ULLALIM, GASUMBI, HUDHUD, KATA-KATA, ULAGING, UWAEGING of Agusan Manobos), Pulangihon-Umayamnon Bukidnon uwaging has prosodic features that fit euphoniously with the tunes (e. g., the shapes of the tunes reinforce the sound parallelisms in the words). In addition, like the versions of the epic in Bukidnon, the Pulangihon-Umayamnon uwaging can be recited, MANTUKAW, minus the melody. This fact implies an important corollary; the internalization of uwaging prosody is acquired separately from the setting of words to tunes. In fact, singers internalize the prosody of the verses by reciting them from the memory of other singers’ performances, attempting to intone them (with the formulaic tunes) only after they have mastered and memorized a fair amount of verses. In my fieldwork, Datu Sinuhoy dictated to my <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistant</b> a set of textual epithets forming poems called “unturan ne ngaran” (what singers call in Cebuano, the lingua franca of the place, as “tag-as nga pangalan” or “long names”). This was done separately after the complete recording of the uwaging. This evidence suggests that Pulangihon-Umayamnon Bukidnon uwaging performance entails elaborate, pre-performance compositional activities, in which singers internalize the physical [read: material] sonic qualities of the epic. These studies enable singers to produce what Pulangihon-Umayamnon Bukidnon call SAMPAH ‘balance,’ a local ethnopoetic concept of beauty in the voice of sung story...|$|E
