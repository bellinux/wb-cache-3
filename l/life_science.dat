40|$|Mouse-related {{research}} in the <b>life</b> <b>sciences</b> has expanded remarkably {{over the last two}} decades, resulting in growing use of the term “mouse model”.

Here, we discuss the implications for the relationship between the <b>life</b> <b>sciences</b> community and society in Japan that may result from this ambiguity in the terminology.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} patenting and spin-off creation using survey data of 479 researchers in engineering and 449 researchers in <b>life</b> <b>sciences</b> funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). The results show that research novelty and laboratory size {{are the only two}} variables significantly explaining patenting and spin-off formation in both engineering and <b>life</b> <b>sciences.</b> Network capital explains spin-off formation in engineering and in <b>life</b> <b>sciences</b> as well as patenting in <b>life</b> <b>sciences,</b> but not in engineering. Furthermore, the results suggest that many categories of resources explain patenting and spin-off formation in engineering and in <b>life</b> <b>sciences,</b> but that the combinations of resources required differ for patenting and spin-off formation and between engineering and <b>life</b> <b>sciences.</b> The results of this paper suggest that customized policies would be required to accommodate differences between spin-off formation and patenting as well as between engineering and <b>life</b> <b>sciences.</b> Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007 Patents, Spin-offs, Universities, Research commercialization, Engineering, <b>Life</b> <b>sciences,</b> Research, Determinants of transfer, Survey data, O 34, L 26, O 31, O 32, D 83,...|$|R
