Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> and little swift.

5|$|The genus Sylvia, {{the typical}} warblers, forms {{part of a}} large family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. Fossils from France show that the genus dates back at least 20million years. The garden warbler and its nearest relative, the blackcap, are an ancient species pair which diverged very early {{from the rest of the}} genus, between 12 and 16million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become {{sufficiently}} distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the garden warbler in Epilais. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> and common whitethroat.|$|E

The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green hairstreak, brown argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to the pond, and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common whitethroat, <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|E

Nevertheless, I am not incapable of appreciating the greater music; all that is said in its praise, even to the extremest expressions of admiration of those who are moved to a sense of wonder by it, find an echo in me. But it is not only a delight to me to listen to the lark singing at heaven's gate and to the vesper nightingale in the oak copse--the singer of a golden throat and wondrous artistry; I also love the smaller vocalists--the modest shufewing and the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> and the yellowhammer with his simple chant. These are very dear to me: their strains do not strike me as trivial; they have a lesser distinction of their own and I would not miss them from the choir. The literary man will smile at this and say that my paper is naught but an idle exercise, but I fancy I shall sleep the better tonight for having discharged this ancient debt which has been long on my conscience.|$|E

40|$|The {{peculiarities of}} {{territorial}} behavior of Sylvia warblers (blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla, garden warblers S. borin, common whitethroats S. communis, and <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroats</b> S. curruca) were stidied in habitats with different population density. The {{study was conducted}} in the areas within the central parts of the breeding ranges of the studied species (Kaliningrad region (55 ° 12 ’N, 20 ° 50 ’E) and Mordovia (54 ° 44 ’N, 45 ° 30 ’E)) and their northern periphery (south Karelia, (60 ° 46 ’N, 32 ° 48 ’E), central Karelia (64 ° 27 ’N, 30 ° 17 ’E), and Murmansk region (67 ° 06 ’N, 32 ° 42 ’E)) in 2003 – 2017. The territoriality was investigated using the method of point mapping of territories as minimum convex polygons (Odum, Kuenzler, 1955). This method was partly modified in order to obtain more accurate data on sizes and configurations of territories at different stages of reproductive period. Particularly, all the observed bird’s movements were registered throughout the whole period of its staying in the studied area. Also, the height at which the observed bird sang was registered to get the information about the 3 D-configuration of the bird’s territory. The size of a territory was assessed as the area of its projection on the ground surface. The distance between neighboring territories was defined as the minimum distance between the closest borders of these territories. The areas of territories and the distances between them were calculated using Arc View GIS 3. 2 (Environmental research systems Institute, Inc. 1992 – 1999) and Google Earth Pro 7. 1. 8. 3036 (Google, 2016, 2017). Every day we observed up to 7 birds of each species were observed. In total, every season 1 – 19 settled males and 1 – 18 unsettled males of each species. It constituted about 20 000 hours of observations in nature, more than 80 000 points marking territories mapped, and 547 nests found. Our results suggest that the territorial behaviour of Sylvia warblers has a high degree of plasticity and depends on the population density which in turn depends on the specificity of habitats. As a rule, with increasing population density the territory size (in all species except the whitethroat) and distances between neighboring territories decrease. In limited areas of preferred habitats, territorial structures became more compact and labile. When the population density was high, the majority of varieties of behavioral patterns were observed, including variants atypical for these birds. At a very high and very low population density, territoriality reduces in a similar way (shortening of the period of territory advertising with singing, decline of singing activity, decreasing of aggressiveness and territory defense degree), but for different reasons. In habitats with a low population density the reduction of territoriality apparently optimizes time and energy budgets of birds in more severe conditions of the northern regions. The reduction of territoriality and labial territorial structures under high population density provides the opportunity to participate in reproduction for a larger number of individuals. In general, the variability in territorial behavior apparently leads to the maximum realization of reproductive potential of individuals in populations under various environmental conditions.

50|$|The desert {{whitethroat}} (Sylvia minula) is {{a typical}} warbler. Until recently, it was considered conspecific with the lesser whitethroat; today these are seen {{as members of a}} superspecies. The desert whitethroat together with Hume's whitethroat form an Asian lineage in the superspecies, which have diverged into species adapted to drier lowlands and moister mountain habitats respectively. The name small whitethroat has also been used by some authors, and desert <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> before it was split from <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rather, the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> and {{its closest}} {{relatives}} Hume's whitethroat {{and the small}} whitethroat appear more related {{to a group of}} morphologically quite dissimilar species.

The latter group occurs from the southern parts of the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> complex' range into Africa and include the Orphean warbler group, the Arabian warbler, and the brown and Yemen warblers sometimes placed in Parisoma. Thus, it rather appears as if the divergence of the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> complex and its closest living relatives is more ancient than assumed, and that it did not involve separation by ice sheets building up in Europe, but by aridification of the Arabian region (which also occurred throughout the Ice Ages).|$|E

50|$|Birds {{breeding}} in the Caucasus Mountains and northwestern Iran {{have sometimes}} been considered intermediate between lesser and Hume's whitethroats, but {{are now more}} clearly assigned to <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> as the subspecies Sylvia curruca caucasica or even not separated from typical European S. c. curruca.|$|E
50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from the <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat</b> by its slightly larger size (13-14 cm), slightly stouter bill, and the darker {{top of the head}} and darker grey-brown back, which gives it less contrast between its upper head to back region than in <b>lesser</b> <b>whitethroat.</b> The throat is white, {{and the rest of the}} underparts pale greyish-white. Their breeding ranges do not overlap; Hume's whitethroat inhabits upland regions from eastern Iran eastwards to the Tian Shan mountains of central Asia and the western ranges of the Himalaya. Hume's whitethroat breeds at altitudes of 2,000-3,600 m in open scrub, often with juniper, and in cultivated areas such as almond orchards. It migrates south to southern Pakistan and India in the winter, where it does overlap with wintering lesser whitethroats in some areas.|$|E
