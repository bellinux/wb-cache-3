40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of <b>road</b> <b>resistances</b> of a car. The first part deals with the theory of individual <b>road</b> <b>resistance</b> which counteracts the movement of the car. The chapters are given the formula for calculating individual <b>road</b> <b>resistance</b> and in the end is mentioned relationship of total <b>road</b> <b>resistance.</b> The second part is focused on the construction of tires, their signs and detailed description dimensions. This section also describes a tire according to the shapes of designs, their type and how to properly store them. The next part explains the theory of rolling the vehicle wheel according to the type of pads. The penultimate section describes the methodology for measuring the <b>road</b> <b>resistance</b> in real traffic. The conclusion describes experimental measurements of passive losses car at various inflation pressures made on vehicle testing institute of technology and automobile traffic. In this passage it is also a graphical and verbal evaluation of practical measurement...|$|R

Therefore, using the method of data fitting the traffic flow is forecast to be a more effective way to. In the article, fit the <b>road</b> <b>resistance</b> and <b>road</b> traffic flow, to accurately determine the parameters of the <b>road</b> <b>resistance</b> and the mathematical expressions of the traffic flow, fitting results are accurate response to changes in traffic flow values. The results facilitate the provision of traffic management on roads in different traffic flow control, to avoid the road congestion in the area. Improve prediction accuracy in the application of the road traffic...|$|R

40|$|Energy saving {{has become}} an {{important}} aspect of every business activity as it is important in terms of cost savings and greenhouse gas emission reduction. This study aims to develop a comprehensive artificial intelligence model for reducing energy consumption in the mining industry. Many parameters influence the fuel consumption of surface mining haul trucks. This includes, but not limited to, truck load, truck speed and total haul <b>road</b> <b>resistance.</b> In this study, a fitness function for the haul truck fuel consumption based on these parameters is generated using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This function is utilised to generate a multi-objective model based on Genetic Algorithm (GA). This model is used to estimate the optimum values of the haulage parameters to reduce fuel consumption. The developed model is generated and tested using real data collected from four large surface mines. It is found that for all four mines considered in this study, the haul truck fuel consumption can be reduced by optimising truck load, truck speed and total haul <b>road</b> <b>resistance</b> using the developed artificial intelligence model...|$|R
