50|$|Example: Given {{an eight}} <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> ANTIC Mode (Text Modes 2, 4, or 6) with the VS bit set on two {{adjacent}} Mode lines the scrolling region then {{consists of three}} Mode lines—the third line in the scrolling region is the first Mode line encountered without the VS bit set. When Vertical scrolling is not set in the Display List the three Modes lines would naturally result in 24 displayed <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> When the VS bits are set in the Display List Mode instructions as described and the VSCROL value is set to 2 then the first Mode line in the region begins displaying at <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> 2 showing <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> 2 to 7 (six <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> or 8 - VSCROL), the second Mode line is displayed completely (eight <b>scan</b> <b>lines),</b> and the final Mode <b>line</b> ends at <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> 2 showing <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> 0 to 2 (three <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> or VSCROL + 1).

40|$|The {{effect of}} laser energy density on the {{machining}} character of C/SiC composites by picosecond laser was investigated using two machining modes: single ring line and helical <b>lines</b> <b>scanning.</b> For single ring <b>line</b> <b>scanning</b> mode, the width {{and depth of}} machining grooves increased nonlinearly {{with the increase of}} laser energy density. Moreover, periodic surface structures (ripples) were generated at relative low laser energy density and disappeared at high energy density. With the increasing energy density, the oxygen content of machining debris increased dramatically. For helical <b>lines</b> <b>scanning</b> mode, the depth of machining grooves increased nonlinearly with the increasing laser energy density. With the increasing energy density, the oxygen content of machining debris also increased dramatically. The machining character showed as nano-scale laser-induced ripples, pores, strip structures and bubble pits.

50|$|Drop frame {{timecode}} originates from {{a compromise}} invented when color NTSC video was invented. The NTSC designers wanted to retain compatibility with existing monochrome televisions. To minimise subcarrier visibility on a monochrome receiver {{it was necessary}} to make the color subcarrier an odd multiple of half the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> frequency; the multiple originally chosen was 495. With a 30 Hz frame rate the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> frequency is (30 × 525) = 15750 Hz. So the subcarrier frequency would have been (495/2 × 15750) = 3.898125 MHz. This was the subcarrier frequency originally chosen, but tests showed that on some monochrome receivers an interference pattern caused by the beat between the color subcarrier and the 4.5 MHz sound intercarrier could be seen. The visibility of this pattern could be greatly reduced by lowering the subcarrier frequency multiple to 455 (thus increasing the beat frequency from approx 600 kHz to approx 920 kHz) and by making the beat frequency also equal to an odd multiple of half the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> frequency. This latter change could have been achieved by raising the sound intercarrier by 0.1% to 4.5045 MHz, but the designers, concerned that this might cause problems with some existing receivers, decided instead to reduce the color subcarrier frequency, and thus both the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> frequency and the frame rate, by 0.1% instead. Thus the NTSC color subcarrier ended up as 3.57954545 MHz (exactly 315/88 MHz), the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> frequency as 15734.27 Hz (exactly 9/572 MHz) and the frame rate 29.97 Hz (exactly 30/1.001 Hz).|$|E

50|$|That {{the output}} images are {{oriented}} {{the same way}} around (in the case of CCD image sensors).

In cameras using vacuum tube video pickup devices this was solved by merely reversing the connections for the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> coils; with CMOS imagers, the row or column address sequence is simply reversed. But with CCD sensors {{it is necessary to}} build a mirror image sensor for one channel. The Philips prism assembly (center right) has all three color channels laterally inverted and can thus use three similar CCDs.|$|E
50|$|When {{a regular}} repeating pattern is viewed on a CRT monitor {{as if it}} were a {{wallpaper}} autostereogram, it is usually possible to see depth ripples. This can also be seen in the background to a static, random-dot autostereogram. These are caused by the sideways shifts in the image due to small changes in the deflection sensitivity (linearity) of the <b>line</b> <b>scan,</b> which then become interpreted as depth. This effect is especially apparent at the left hand edge of the screen where the scan speed is still settling after the flyback phase.

5000|$|The highest {{resolution}} modes {{were only}} used in special, opt-in cases {{rather than as}} standard, especially where high line counts were involved. Standard VGA monitors had a fixed <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> (H-scan) rate"multisync" [...] monitors being, at the time, expensive exoticaand so the vertical/frame (V-scan) refresh rate had to be reduced {{in order to accommodate}} them, which increased visible flicker and thus eye strain. For example, the highest 800×600 mode, being otherwise based off the matching SVGA resolution (with 628 total lines), reduced the refresh rate from 60 Hz to about 50 Hz (and 832×624, the theoretical maximum resolution achievable with 256kb at 16 colors, would have reduced it to about 48 Hz, barely higher than the rate at which XGA monitors employed a double-frequency interlacing technique to mitigate full-frame flicker).|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} obtain spectromicroscopy data the {{following}} operating procedure is followed. The desired monochromator grating is selected along with photon energy {{in the middle of}} NEXAFS range. Refocus mirrors are adjusted to put the beam into the microscope and steered to maximize the flux passing through the zone plate. A pinhole is placed in the photon beam upstream in a transverse position to maximize transmission. Pinhole size is determined by demagnification {{to the size of the}} diffraction limit of the zone plate lens. An undersized pinhole is often used to reduce intensity which controls radiation damage. The order sorting aperture is positioned to eliminate transmission of unfocused zero order light, which would blur the image. Then an x/y <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> is defined across an intensity variation in the image. The x/y line scans are repeated with varying focus conditions.

By increasing the EB energy density an undesired delamination of the Si thin film was observed.

By finite element simulations, the reason for layer delamination could be revealed by calculating the temperature and stress field during the EB treatment of the thin film-substrate-system: Due to thermal expansion during the EB <b>line</b> <b>scans</b> the elastic strain energy density accumulates and reaches a critical level.
