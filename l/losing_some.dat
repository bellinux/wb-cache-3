5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning. The Russian troops {{successfully}} moved to the rear without being destroyed (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite of <b>losing</b> <b>some</b> areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops to retreat to the starting line. The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, <b>losing</b> <b>some</b> of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E

5|$|Because Tech {{committed}} a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following the touchdown, NC State {{was able to}} acquire good field position during the kickoff return, starting their drive at their 44-yard line. On the second play of the drive, Erik Kramer completed an 18-yard pass to Nasrallah Worthen, driving State into the Tech side of the field. After a short play, Kramer again completed a long pass, this time to Bobby Crumpler for 24yards. Now inside the Tech red zone, Kramer was tackled for a big loss, <b>losing</b> <b>some</b> of the yardage that he had gained with the previous play. NC State was unable to pick up another first down and sent in Mike Cofer to attempt a 33-yard kick, which was successfully completed. The field goal regained NC State a 2422 lead.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 21, {{the motion}} {{shifted to the}} north as it moved along the {{northwest}} periphery of the subtropical ridge. That general motion continued throughout the day, however, Helene began to turn more northeastward that evening {{along the edge of}} the subtropical ridge, east of Bermuda. A decrease in wind shear and relatively warm water around 81°F (27°C) kept the intensity mostly stationary, keeping Helene as a Category1 hurricane. The intensity held around 80mph (130km/h) before strengthening slightly late on September 22, despite <b>losing</b> <b>some</b> tropical characteristics (it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm for a brief period) as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic. A QuikSCAT analysis early on September 23 confirmed a high-end Category1 hurricane with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the heavy}} {{damage from the}} cyclone and other recent disasters, the World Bank enacted a plan for Andhra Pradesh in April 1997, {{consisting}} of repairing damaged infrastructure, an updated disaster plan, and technical assistance to the state government.

This plan ultimately cost about US$175million and was completed in July 2003, three years longer than expected but {{at a lower cost}} due to the Indian rupee <b>losing</b> <b>some</b> of its value.

5|$|The {{first such}} {{expedition}} occurred in 778 when, preempting an anticipated Arab raid, Lachanodrakon led a large army against Germanikeia. Although the city {{did not fall}} (Theophanes claims that the Arab commander bribed Lachanodrakon), the Byzantine army defeated a relief force, plundered the region, and took many captives, mostly Jacobites, who were then resettled in Thrace. In 780, Lachanodrakon ambushed and defeated an Arab invasion in the Armeniac Theme, killing {{the brother of the}} Arab commander Thumama ibn al-Walid. The Arab historian al-Tabari records that in 781 Lachanodrakon forced another Arab invasion, under 'Abd al-Kabir, to withdraw without battle, although Theophanes ascribes the success to the sakellarios John. In 782, however, he was defeated by the Arab general al-Barmaqi during a large-scale invasion led by the future caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), <b>losing</b> <b>some</b> 15,000 men according to Theophanes. In the aftermath of this defeat, and likely because of his iconoclast past, he was apparently removed from his command by the iconophile empress-regent Irene of Athens.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{sought the}} decisive engagement, {{for which they}} had amassed, {{according}} to some estimates, between 70 and 90 percent of all galleys in existence in the Mediterranean at the time. The fleets were roughly balanced: the Ottoman fleet was larger with 300 ships to the 200 Christian ones, but the Christian ships were sturdier; both fleets carried some 30,000 troops, and while the Christians had twice as many cannons, the Ottomans compensated by a large and skilled corps of archers. On 7 October, the two fleets engaged in a battle off Lepanto, {{which resulted in a}} crushing victory for the Christian fleet, while the Ottoman fleet was effectively destroyed, <b>losing</b> <b>some</b> 25,000–35,000 men in addition to some 12,000 Christian galley slaves who were freed. In popular perception, the battle itself became {{known as one of the}} decisive turning points in the long Ottoman-Christian struggle, as it ended the Ottoman naval hegemony established after the Battle of Preveza in 1538. Its immediate results however were minimal: the harsh winter that followed precluded any offensive actions on behalf of the Holy League, while the Ottomans used the respite to hurriedly rebuild their naval strength. At the same time, Venice suffered losses in Dalmatia, where the Ottomans attacked Venetian possessions: the island of Hvar was raided by the Ottoman fleet, with the Turkish forces burning down the towns of Hvar, Stari Grad and Vrboska.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Juan was a {{significant}} tropical cyclone that heavily damaged parts of Atlantic Canada in late September 2003. Juan is also the first hurricane name and one of two to be requested to be retired by the Meteorological Service of Canada (the other being Igor of 2010). It was the tenth named storm and the sixth hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Juan formed southeast of Bermuda on September24 from a tropical wave that had tracked across the subtropical Atlantic Ocean. It tracked northward and strengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, reaching Category2 strength on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale on September27. The hurricane peaked in intensity with sustained winds of 105mph (165km/h) that same day, <b>losing</b> <b>some</b> strength as it raced over cooler waters toward the coast of Nova Scotia. Juan made landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect in the Halifax Regional Municipality early on September29 as a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (160km/h). Juan retained hurricane strength while crossing Nova Scotia from south to north, though it weakened to a Category 1 storm over Prince Edward Island. It was absorbed by another extratropical low later on September29 near Anticosti Island in the northern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 1/2 November 1942, the Eighth Army {{attacked}} again in the north, with 2nd New Zealand Division in the lead. Freyberg placed 151 Brigade {{on the right and}} 152 Brigade on the left. The aim was to attack directly westwards across the Rahman track, with the infantry leading the night assault and 9th Armoured Brigade (now commanded by Brigadier John C. Currie) again passing through to break the enemy gun line and allow X Corps to break out. The assault went to plan except that opposition on the left was heavier than expected which slowed the advance. As a result, the advancing tanks were highlighted against the dawn sky in the east and began to be picked off by Axis anti-tank fire. The Regiment was in the centre of the 9th Armoured Brigade, and the CO lost touch with both his artillery support and close anti-tank support. In the growing light, the B squadron commander (Major M.StJ.V.Gibbs) realised that he was in a ring of enemy anti-tank guns, ahead and to both flanks. He gave the order to 'Charge' and B Squadron overran the anti-tank positions, <b>losing</b> <b>some</b> vehicles but destroying the enemy gun line. Meanwhile, the 21st Panzer Division was counter-attacking A and C Squadrons and at 4pm the Regiment (now down to four tanks) was withdrawn. The 1st Armoured Division from X Corps were just behind the 9th Armoured Brigade but there were no liaison officers between the units and 1st Armoured did not take the opportunity to push on through the broken Axis gun-line.|$|E
