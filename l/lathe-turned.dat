5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the <b>lathe-turned</b> pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|If {{the temple}} is small it {{will consist of}} only a closed mantapa (enclosed with walls {{extending}} {{all the way to}} the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed mantapa, well decorated inside and out, is larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four <b>lathe-turned</b> pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or Latticework) that serve as windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E
5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped <b>lathe-turned</b> pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E

500|$|The outer {{and inner}} mantapa (open and closed) have {{circular}} <b>lathe-turned</b> pillars having four brackets at the top. Over each bracket stands sculptured figure(s) called salabhanjika or madanika. The pillars may also exhibit ornamental carvings {{on the surface}} and no two pillars are alike. This is how Hoysala art differs from the work of their early overlords, the Western Chalukyas, who added sculptural details to the circular pillar base and left the top plain. The <b>lathe-turned</b> pillars are 16, 32, or 64-pointed; some are bell-shaped and have properties that reflect light. The Parsvanatha Basadi at Halebidu is a good example. According to Brown, the pillars with four monolithic brackets above them carry images of salabhanjikas and madanikas (sculpture of a woman, displaying stylised feminine features). This is a common feature of Chalukya-Hoysala temples. According to Sastri, the shape of the pillar and its capital, the base of which is square and whose shaft is a monolith that is lathe turned to render different shapes, is a [...] "remarkable feature" [...] of Hoysala art.|$|E
500|$|Puzzling {{features}} of the present instrument include the placing of the handle, which when turned is likely to obstruct a player of the keyboard. Ord-Hume, using the 1835 account, concludes that originally the handle (which is a nineteenth-century British replacement, probably of a French original) only operated the grunt and wail, while the organ was operated by pulling a string or cord to work the original bellows, now replaced. The keyboard, which is largely original, is [...] "unique in construction", with [...] "square ivory buttons" [...] with round <b>lathe-turned</b> tops instead of conventional keys. Though the mechanical functioning of each button is [...] "practical and convenient" [...] they are spaced such that [...] "it {{is almost impossible to}} stretch the hand to play an octave". The buttons are marked with small black spots, differently placed but forming no apparent pattern in relation to the notes produced and corresponding to no known system of marking keys. The two stop control knobs for the organ are located, [...] "rather confusingly", a little below the tiger's testicles. The instrument is now rarely played, but there is a V video of a recent performance.|$|E

The great open mantapa has 64 pillars, 24 of which are full pillars which start from the floor and support the main ceiling. The remaining are half pillars (or [...] "dwarf pillars") which start from the bench (parapet wall) that surrounds the mantapa and support the sloping eaves. The pillars in this hall bear similarities to the porch pillars at the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal and the <b>lathe-turned</b> pillars (whose rounded sections are <b>lathe-turned)</b> at the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, {{the figures}} {{underwent}} a drastic redesign, from simple <b>lathe-turned</b> shapes to sculpted bodies.

5000|$|Hale {{married a}} niece of {{chemical}} manufacturer William Weightman, the largest landowner in the city. Hale designed dozens of blocks of middle-class housing for Weightman, especially in North and West Philadelphia. His lively facades often contrasted sculpture, tile, inventive brick- and stone-work, in an exuberant high-Victorian style: [...] "Hale's genius {{was to take}} ... essentially identical rowhouses, with their mass-produced industrial parts and <b>lathe-turned</b> woodwork, and to make them distinctive." [...] He designed a country house for Weightman in Germantown: [...] "Ravenhill" [...] (now part of Philadelphia University).|$|E
50|$|Ber timber is hard, strong, fine-grained, fine-textured, tough, durable, and reddish in colour. It {{has been}} used to line wells, to make legs for bedsteads, boat ribs, {{agricultural}} implements, tool handles, and other <b>lathe-turned</b> items. The branches are used as framework in house construction and the wood makes good charcoal with a heat content of almost 4,900 kcal per kg. In addition, this species is used as firewood in many areas. In tropical Africa, the flexible branches are wrapped as retaining bands around conical thatched roofs of huts, and are twined together to form thorny corral walls to retain livestock.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally quaichs {{are made}} of wood, an artform known as [...] "treen". Some early quaichs are stave-built like barrels and some have {{alternating}} light and dark staves. The staves are held together by bands of willow or silver. They generally have two, and more rarely three or four, short, projecting handles. Other wooden quaiches were <b>lathe-turned</b> out of {{a single piece of}} wood and there was another group which were turned then carved outside in basket-weave pattern. In addition to wood, they {{are made of}} stone, brass, pewter, horn, and silver. The latter were often engraved with lines and bands in imitation of the staves and hoops of the wooden quaichs.|$|E
50|$|The Puradeshwara {{temple in}} the later Chalukya style is a trikutachala with three ardhamantapas, a common navaranga and two mukhamantapas. Gurlhosur Chidambar temple is also an {{historical}} temple. All three garbhagrihas with pierced windows have shivalingas. The shikhara, now damaged, over the central garbhagriha is in Kadambanagara style and the navaranga pillars are <b>lathe-turned.</b> Inside the niches of the navaranga are images of Parvati and Veerabhadra. This temple has been renovated very crudely. On the day of Ugadi, the rising sun's rays fall directly on the main shivalinga. The outer walls have fine sculptures depicting Hindu mythology and there are inclined chajjas all round. The open mukhamantapa, a later addition, {{is also in the}} same style with massive pillars.|$|E
50|$|The current church {{building}} is a large structure built in 1885 by the church's parishioners from ashlar cut stone that they had quarried at a nearby site. It has a stucco exterior and a square bell tower with a short octagonal steeple that is roofed with tin shingles. It has an unusually elaborate interior that is largely the work of John Sliemers, {{who served as the}} local parish priest from 1901 to 1903 and from 1914 to 1934. Both the main altar and side altars have elaborate carvings, while <b>lathe-turned</b> balusters support the chancel rail and the rear gallery. Religious scenes are depicted in stained-glass windows and in paintings on the interior walls.|$|E
50|$|The temple {{is housed}} inside an {{impressive}} high walled enclosure and {{the entrance to}} the complex is through a porch with tall <b>lathe-turned</b> pillars. The material used for the temple is soapstone (Green schist). The Keshava temple standouts out as one of the finest the Hoysala architects produced. Its symmetrical architecture, fine sculptures on equally prominent shrines, and panel sculptures form a cloister that speak of good taste. While there are Hoysala temples with better sculpture and others with better architecture, this temples satisfies all requirements. According to the Mysore archaeological reports, it was built by the famous architect and sculptor Ruvari Malithamma who was well known for his expertise in ornamentation.|$|E
50|$|The Chicago-based Reynolds Pen Company made 8 million pens in six weeks, {{cranking}} out <b>lathe-turned</b> pens in {{a manufacturing}} facility converted from an indoor tennis court. Thereafter came an era chronicled {{in the print}} media of the time as the “Pen Wars,” as latecomer Eversharp finally entered the market. Eversharp then sued Reynolds for patent infringement, and Reynolds countersued {{on the grounds of}} illegal restraint of trade. Ultimately, the main result of the legal battle was to generate reams of free publicity for both products. Reynolds capitalized on his sudden success by introducing a new model dubbed the “Reynolds Rocket” from the Reynolds International Pen Company. He shipped pens overseas while making partnership overtures, even buying a French estate, the Chateau Mesnil St. Denis in 1947, as an intended base of European operations.|$|E
5000|$|Barrel wear {{is also an}} {{important}} issue, particularly in high-powered firearms. High temperatures tend to erode the barrel at the throat, preventing the bullet from entering the rifling cleanly. One way to produce a long-lasting barrel is by the proper selection of materials. Stainless steels, such as 416, have been shown to have a longer life than the traditional 4140 chrome/molybdenum steels used for barrels. [...] While the stainless barrels are not any more accurate than a 4140 barrel, they will maintain their accuracy longer in many applications, as they are more resistant to erosion caused by the heat of firing high-powered cartridges. One notable exception to this is the [...]50 BMG cartridge; competition shooters often fire high-precision <b>lathe-turned</b> bullets made from harder brass, bronze, or steel in this caliber, and the 4140 steel will stand up to this better than stainless.|$|E
