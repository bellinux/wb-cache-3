5|$|In 1899, Hartford City Glass was {{acquired}} by the American Window Glass Company, which controlled 85 percent of the American window glass manufacturing capacity. During the next decade, the company began replacing its skilled and well–paid Belgian glass blowers with machines and less-skilled machine operators. The company used the Hartford City plant to test and refine the new technology. Most of the Belgian glass workers <b>left</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the election, the lame-duck session of the old 67th Congress met. Harding {{had come to believe}} that his early view of the presidency—that it should propose policies, but leave whether to adopt them to Congress—was not enough, and he lobbied Congress, {{although}} in vain, to get his ship subsidy bill through. Once Congress <b>left</b> <b>town</b> in early March 1923, Harding's popularity in the country began to recover. The economy was improving, and the programs of Harding's more able cabinet members, such as Hughes, Mellon, and Hoover, were showing results. Most Republicans realized that there was no practical alternative to supporting Harding in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Miles' storylines {{have often}} centred on his friendships and romantic {{relationships}} with other characters. He has become a surrogate father to several teenagers, including Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell). Miles and Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes) had a long relationship together, during which they lost an unborn child. Kirsty eventually <b>left</b> <b>town,</b> ending their relationship. After sharing a long friendship, Miles and Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) entered into a romantic relationship in 2011. Leah becomes pregnant and Miles proposes to her. Miles has earned a generally positive reception, while Quong Tart has been nominated for three Inside Soap Awards.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, {{the strikers}} seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which {{overlooked}} {{the town of}} Victor. The next day, at about 9am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp {{at the base of}} Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. A few moments later, the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and <b>left</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cooke {{resolved}} to kill Sharp herself. The next time Sharp was in Bowling Green on business, she {{sent a letter}} to him that denounced Beauchamp's actions and claimed she had broken off all contact with him. She asked Sharp to visit her at her plantation before he <b>left</b> <b>town.</b> Sharp questioned the messenger who delivered the letter, as he suspected a trap. He replied to her, saying he would visit at the time appointed. Beauchamp and Cooke awaited the visit, but Sharp never arrived. When Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green to investigate, he learned that Sharp had left for Frankfort two days earlier, leaving substantial unfinished business. Beauchamp concluded that Sharp would eventually have to return to Bowling Green to finish his business there. Determined to await Sharp's return, Beauchamp opened a legal practice in the city. Throughout 1822 and 1823, Beauchamp practiced law and waited for Sharp to return. He never did.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{method of}} honor killing {{in that day}} was a duel. Despite Cooke's admonition that Sharp would not accept a challenge to duel, Beauchamp traveled to Frankfort to gain an audience with him. He had recently been named the state's attorney general by Governor John Adair. Beauchamp's account of the interview states that he bullied and humiliated Sharp, that Sharp begged for his life, and that Beauchamp promised to horsewhip Sharp every day until he consented to the duel. For two days, Beauchamp remained in Frankfort, awaiting the duel. He discovered that Sharp had <b>left</b> <b>town,</b> allegedly destined for Bowling Green. Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green, {{only to find that}} Sharp was not there and was not expected. Sharp was saved from Beauchamp's first attempt on his life.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} {{of many of the}} mines. To compensate for the drop in prices, the mines' stockholders reduced the wages of the miners. Instead of striking again, the miners accepted this. In addition, the miners inadvertently dug below the water table, and the mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of the mines were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of the mines continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and <b>left</b> <b>town.</b> The Silver Reef mines produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, but none of these attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's mines were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone. One buyer dismantled the building he bought and discovered $10,000 in gold coins. News of the find spread quickly, and most of the buildings in Silver Reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold, but none was found.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} Lawrence, {{the guerrillas}} immediately killed {{a number of}} Union Army recruits and one of Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform. (Guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers.) They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but {{taking care not to}} shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, but he relented when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more {{than any of the other}} group. They <b>left</b> <b>town</b> at 9a.m., after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces, but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Nikki, Victor {{is known}} for his {{relationship}} with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). While Ashley was at a low point in her life, he had an affair with her. This led to her pregnancy, which he left Nikki for. However, Nikki was diagnosed with cancer and he returned to her, and Ashley aborted her baby; a move she regretted for many years. Ashley stole his sperm many years later, and had a child, Abby Carlton. Abby was believed to be Brad Carlton's (Don Diamont) daughter until she was five years old. Victor was married to Ashley from 1990 to 1993. In 2008, Victor married Sabrina Costelana (Raya Meddine), which was short-lived following her accidental death. Afterward, he <b>left</b> <b>town</b> and Ashley tracked him down when nobody else could. They reconnected their romantic relationship, later remarried and Ashley became pregnant. Davidson stated she was surprised by Ashley's pregnancy, but decided to like the storyline as it was unexpected. Victor and Ashley's second marriage ended after she miscarried the child.|$|E
5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} spoke {{for an hour}} and 45 minutes, setting a record for verbosity that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent that}} President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay <b>left</b> <b>town,</b> never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son Fletcher to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.|$|E

5|$|The plot {{begins on}} September 28, 1998, {{two months after}} the events of the first Resident Evil, in the Midwestern American {{mountain}} community of Raccoon City. Nearly all of its citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The game's two protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris. Having just arrived in the city, Leon and Claire {{make their way to the}} Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from the mutated population. There, they discover that most of the policemen have been killed already, and that Chris has <b>left</b> <b>town</b> to investigate the Umbrella headquarters in Europe. With no remaining motivation to stay, the two protagonists split up to look for other survivors and flee the city. While searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry, who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.|$|E
