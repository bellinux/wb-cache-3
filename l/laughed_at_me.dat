5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>me...</b> I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E

The band played mostly blues and ballads, but the most popular music among whites in the area was country. Berry wrote, [...] "Curiosity provoked me to lay {{a lot of our}} country stuff on our predominantly black audience and some of our black audience began whispering 'who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo?' After they <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a few times they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it." ...|$|E
500|$|To Steinhauer's {{apparent}} surprise, Lody appeared nonchalant {{about the}} danger {{that he was about}} to go into. [...] "Well, after all, one might as well die that way as any other," [...] Lody said, according to Steinhauer; [...] "I shall be rendering the Fatherland a service and no other German can do more than that." [...] At a final meeting at the Anhalter Bahnhof in Berlin, Steinhauer repeated his warnings, but Lody [...] "only <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and told me my fears were groundless." [...] Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as [...] "practically nil" [...] and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that [...] "as he had specially volunteered for the task– and I must admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him– they allowed him to go." ...|$|E

500|$|Interpretations of the song's meaning {{vary from}} one {{listener}} to the next; some people {{view it as}} a song about love and desire, while others understand it as a political metaphor, the lyrics being addressed as much to the Chinese nation as to a girlfriend. University of Florida scholar Jonathan Matusitz describes the song's lyrics as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that could not be stated through any other medium. In this interpretation, the lyrics near the beginning, [...] "I've asked you without end / When will you go with me / But you always <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> / for having nothing to my name" [...] ("") are taken to express the [...] "humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal freedom", the [...] "sense of loss and disorientation" [...] among China's youth in the 1980s. Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as [...] "recast the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole." [...] The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase yī wú suŏ yŏu, an idiomatic chengyu. It literally means [...] "to have nothing" [...] and has no grammatical subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as meaning [...] "I have nothing" [...] (implying that it is a song about two people), or [...] "we have nothing" [...] (understanding it as social commentary).|$|E
2500|$|On 28 June 2016, Farage made {{a speech}} in the European Parliament in which he claimed that a {{hypothetical}} failure for the EU to forge a trade deal with an exiting UK would [...] "be far worse for you {{than it would be}} for us", to heckling and laughing by Parliament members. He insulted his fellow MEPs, claiming that [...] "virtually none" [...] of them had ever had done [...] "a proper job" [...] in their lives. Media around the world covered Farage's speech, including his comment: [...] "... when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Well I have to say, you're not laughing now are you?" [...] and his prediction that Britain will not be the only country to leave the EU. [...] In response, Guy Verhofstadt compared Farage's referendum posters with Nazi propaganda and credited the Brexit campaign with causing a multi-billion loss in the stock exchange. Explicitly addressing Farage, Verhofstadt added, [...] "... Ok. Let’s be positive. Finally, we're {{going to get rid of}} the biggest waste in the budget of the (European) Union, that we have paid for 17 years, your salary." ...|$|E
