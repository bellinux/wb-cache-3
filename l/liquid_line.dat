50|$|Insulating the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> can {{be helpful}} if one can {{determine}} that heat is being absorbed throughout the piping. On the contrary, if the liquid in the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> is hotter than the air outside, insulating the pipes on that section might increase flash-gas as natural subcooling is partially decreased.|$|E

5000|$|The {{economizer}} {{concept is}} linked to subcooling as the condensed <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> temperature is usually higher than that on the evaporator, making it {{a good place to}} apply the notion of increasing efficiencies. Recalling the walk-in freezer example, the normal temperature of the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> in that system is around [...] or even higher (it varies depending on the condensing temperature). That condition is by far less hostile to produce refrigeration, than the evaporator at [...]|$|E
50|$|All {{previous}} systems {{produce an}} economizer effect by using compressors, meters, valves and heat exchangers within the refrigeration cycle. Depending on the system, in some refrigeration cycles {{it may be}} convenient to produce the economizer using an independent refrigeration mechanism. Such {{is the case of}} subcooling the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> by any other means that draw the heat out of the main system. For example, a heat exchanger that preheats cold water needed for another process or human use, may withdraw the heat from the <b>liquid</b> <b>line,</b> effectively subcooling the line and increasing the system’s capacity.|$|E
50|$|The heat may {{be absorbed}} {{not only from}} high {{temperature}} sources, but from diverse energy sources such as friction in the pipeline. On the other hand, pressure in the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> may also be upset by artifacts and conditions including vertically rising pipes that reach too high; gear {{too small for the}} size of the piping; devices pumping refrigerant through the line, and several other strangling obstructions. Eventually, heat absorption and pressure losses in the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> modify the saturation conditions of the refrigerant in such manner that the refrigerant may boil and produce flash-gas.|$|E
50|$|In refrigeration, flash-gas is {{refrigerant}} in gas form produced spontaneously {{when the}} condensed liquid {{is subjected to}} boiling. The presence of flash-gas in the <b>liquid</b> <b>lines</b> reduces {{the efficiency of the}} refrigeration cycle. It can also lead several expansion systems to work improperly, and increase superheating at the evaporator. This is normally perceived as an unwanted condition caused by dissociation between the volume of the system, and the pressures and temperatures that allow the refrigerant to be liquid. Flash-gas must not be confused with lack of condensation, but special gear such as receivers, internal heat exchangers, insulation, and refrigeration cycle optimizers may improve condensation and avoid gas in the <b>liquid</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

50|$|If such a {{magma chamber}} {{continues}} to cool, the minerals it forms and its overall composition will not match a sample <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> of descent or a parental magma composition.|$|E
50|$|Considering the {{saturation}} {{table for}} the refrigerant, if {{it is possible to}} confirm that a certain amount of condenser subcooling is being produced, and the glass still exhibits gas in the <b>liquid</b> <b>line,</b> one may identify this with flash-gas being produced between the condenser and the glass. The flash-gas phenomena may create a deceiving temperature drop on the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> that can be misinterpreted as subcooling. This {{is due to the fact}} that the refrigerant may use part of the heat obtained from lowering its temperature, to finish vaporizing itself to be able to occupy the volume of the pipes at those pressures.|$|E
50|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} flash-gas in the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> include a {{cautious}} {{design of the}} cooling system and its piping, but also the incorporation of gear that might help solve this type of difficulty. The inclusion of a refrigerant receiver is a common, cheap and simple way of decreasing the gas ratio in the <b>liquid</b> <b>line.</b> The incorporation of a subcooling stage after the receiver reduces even more the chances to observe flash gas. This subcooling may {{be done in a}} reserved portion of the main condenser, or separately with a heat exchanger. Some receivers may incorporate an internal heat exchanger that draws heat form the subcooled liquid to superheat the gas compressors suction. There are also many kinds of independent subcooling displays and applications such as refrigeration cycle optimizers; these help avoiding flash-gas in the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> by lowering the temperature away from the refrigerant’s saturation curves. Some systems deal with flash-gas by separating it from the refrigerant that goes to the evaporator, as that portion of the refrigerant alrealdy evaporated and will only increase superheating.|$|E

5000|$|When a melt {{undergoes}} cooling {{along the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> of descent, {{the results are}} limited {{to the production of}} a homogeneous solid body of intrusive rock, with uniform mineralogy and composition, or a partially differentiated cumulate mass with layers, compositional zones and so on. This behaviour is fairly predictable and easy enough to prove with geochemical investigations. In such cases, a magma chamber will form a close approximation of the ideal Bowen's reaction series. However, most magmatic systems are polyphase events, with several pulses of magmatism.

50|$|A {{saturation}} {{state is the}} point where a phase change begins or ends. For example, the saturated <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> represents the point where any further addition of energy will cause {{a small portion of}} the liquid to convert to vapor. Likewise, along the saturated vapor line, any removal of energy will cause some of the vapor to condense back into a liquid, producing a mixture. When a substance reaches the saturated <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> it is commonly said to be at its boiling point. The temperature will remain constant while it is at constant pressure underneath the saturation dome (boiling water stays at a constant of 212F) until it reaches the saturated vapor line. This line is where the mixture has converted completely to vapor. Further heating of the saturated vapor will result in a superheated vapor state. This is because the vapor will be at a temperature higher than the saturation temperature (212F for water) for a given pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Fresh magma {{changes the}} {{composition}} of the melt, changing the chemistry of the phases which are being precipitated. For instance, plagioclase conforms to the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> of descent by forming initial anorthite which, if removed, changes the equilibrium mineral composition to oligoclase or albite. Replenishment of the magma can see this trend reversed, so that more anorthite is precipitated atop cumulate layers of albite.|$|E
50|$|A {{system is}} said to be in a two staged set up if two {{separate}} gas compressors in serial display work together to produce the compression. A normal booster installation is a two staged system that receives fluid that cools down the discharge of the first compressor, before arriving to the second compressor’s input.

40|$|We use {{lubrication}} {{theory and}} matched asymptotic expansions {{to model the}} quasi-steady propagation of a liquid plug or bolus through an elastic tube. In the limit of small capillary number, asymptotic expressions are found for the pressure drop across the bolus and {{the thickness of the}} liquid film left behind, as functions of the capillary number, the thickness of the <b>liquid</b> <b>lining</b> ahead of the bolus and the elastic characteristics of the tube wall. These results generalise the well-known theory for the low-capillary-number motion of a bubble through a rigid tube (Bretherton 1961). As in that theory, both the pressure drop across the bolus and the thickness of the film it leaves behind vary like the two-thirds power of the capillary number. In our generalised theory, the coefficients in the power laws depend on the elastic properties of the tube. For a given thickness of the <b>liquid</b> <b>lining</b> ahead of the bolus, we identify a critical imposed pressure drop above which the bolus will eventually rupture, and hence the tube will reopen. We find that generically a tube with smaller hoop tension or smaller longitudinal tension is easier to reopen. This flow regime is fundamental to reopening of pulmonary airways, which may become plugged through disease or by instilled/aspirated fluids...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} causes driving the fluid {{to change its}} phase where in the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> are the {{excessive}} length of the pipeline, the small diameter of the pipelines, {{and the lack of}} subcooling. These create low pressure loci that may induce the fluid to begin changing its phase, especially if the pipeline is somehow exposed to heat absorption. If subcooling is not generous enough, the refrigerant remains in thermodynamic conditions close to saturation easing flash-gas appearance.|$|E

50|$|Partial melt extractionWith {{reference}} to the definitions, above, a magma chamber will tend to cool down and crystallize minerals according to the <b>liquid</b> <b>line</b> of descent. When this occurs, especially in conjunction with zonation and crystal accumulation, and the melt portion is removed, this can change the composition of a magma chamber. In fact, this is basically fractional crystallization, except in this case we are observing a magma chamber which is the remnant left behind from which a daughter melt has been extracted.|$|E
