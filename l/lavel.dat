40|$|Total {{pancreatic}} duct drainage {{has been}} recognized as a safe and leak-proof procedure after pancreatoduodenectomy and this procedure has improved morbidity and mortality. However, the impact of tube complications remains unknown. We treated a patient with an obstructed tube that impaired pancreatic drainage for 23 days. During this period, although serum amylase <b>lavels</b> were elevated, the patient was asymptomatic. On the 24 th postperative day (POD), a moderate amount of clear pancreatic juice was excreted abruptly and subsequent drainage was uneventful. During the late postoperative period, {{the response of the}} pancreatic juice to an oral diet was sustained and oral glucose tolerance was also maintained. These findings suggest that the effects of obstruction of the main pancreatic duct for 23 days on the residual pancreas are reversible in humans. Thus, in a case with tube complication, one possible strategy is to allow the matter to take its own course. This case illustrates the importance of careful ligature of the pancreatic tube. It is necessary to recheck the patency with a suitable guide-wire, especially one with a small inner diameter...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aims {{of present}} study were to {{evaluate}} nickel and chromium ions concentrations in salivary and serum samples from patients treated with fixed orthodontic appliances and their possible influences on hepatic enzymes. Materials and methods: Saliva and blood samples were collected from 36 patients {{ranging in age from}} 12 to 24 years. Three samples of saliva and two samples of blood were obtained. First saliva and blood samples were collected before inserting fixed appliances. Second salivary samples were collected at 1 week, third salivary sample and second blood sample after 4 weeks of appliance insertion. Serum was prepared by centrifuging blood samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Spectrophotometric determinations were carried out using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results and conclusion: In serum, significant increase in Ni and Cr ion concentration occurred in samples collected after 4 weeks. In saliva samples, nickel and chromium reached their highest <b>lavels</b> in first week. Mean liver function enzymes SGOT and SGPT were also significantly increased in 4 weeks. Fixed orthodontic appliances release measurable amount of nickel and chromium when placed in mouth, but this increase does not reach toxic levels for nickel and chromium in saliva and serum to cause harmful effects in human beings...|$|R
40|$|SALINITY AND NUTRIENTS IN THE EBRO DELTA COASTAL LAGOONS Seasonal {{changes of}} salinity, water level and nutnents were studied in coastal lagoons of the Ebro Delta. The data {{presented}} in this paper show the differences between these lagoons and others around the world. The freshwater from the nver and ncefields flows into the lagoons from Apnl to December. This is the cause of the low salinity values and the relatively high water <b>lavels</b> observed during this penod of the year in contrast to the values from January to Apnl. The intensity of these fluctuations depends on the flow rates. The lagoons are in an advanced process of eutrophication. The hydrological cycle patially controls the seasonal changes of phosphorus and nitrogen and two relative maxima are observed in al 1 the lagoons. Those of phosphorus occured in March and Oc-tober and those of nitrogen (dissolved inorganic oxydized nitrogen) in winter and spnng. These pattems of vanation are discussed for the different lagoons.

40|$|This {{research}} was aimed {{to study the}} chemical characteristic of goat cheese that used various concentrations of probiotic starter with combinations of Lactobacillus rhamnosus TW 2 and Lactobacillus plantarum TW 14 isolates. The experiment was conducted with a completely randomized design with a 4 x 4 factorial arrangement. The first factor was the concentration of probiotic starter consisted of 4 <b>lavels</b> i. e., 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, and 10 % v/v. All probiotic concentrations used the same ratio of L. rhamnosus TW 2 and L. plantarum TW 14, i. e. 1 : 1. The second factor was the duration of ripening process consisted of 4 levels i. e., 0 (no ripening), 10, 20, and 30 days at 5 oC. The observed variables were cheese chemical properties including water content, protein, fat, ash, pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), free fatty acids (FFA), and proteolysis profile. The results showed that addition of probiotic starter at a concentration of 5 % mixture of L. rhamnosus TW 2 and L. plantarum TW 14 increased (P< 0. 01) only on ash content. The duration of ripening process up to 30 d significantly increased (P< 0. 01) protein and fat. Combination of probiotic starter concentrations and duration of ripening process increased (P< 0. 01) fat and ash contents. Proteolysis profile showed that protein was degraded into 72 and 52 kDa proteins, but no 17 kDa protein was found in cheese ripened for 30 d. It is concluded that 30 d duration of ripening at 5 oC was the main contributing factor to chemical characteristics of cheese including chemical properties, pH, TTA, FFA, and proteolysis profile of probiotic goat cheese, while the concentration of mixed probiotics affected ash content, TTA and FFA of cheese...|$|R
40|$|The feeding interrelationships {{of three}} sparid fish was {{studied in the}} {{littoral}} zone during low tide at Clayton's Rocks in the Eastern Cape. The three species appeared {{in the study area}} only when between 9 and 10 mm long (SL), and remained resident until a length of approximately 120 fmm was reached. No sexually mature specimens occurred in the study area as large adults only use the intertidal zone for feeding purposes at high tide. From first recruitment into the littoral zone at 9 mm SL until some 35 mm long, the diet of Diplodus sargus consists of harpacticoid copepods and amphipods. Ingestion of amphipods and green algae increases with increased size of fish. Chironomid larvae, cirripede nauplii and an unidentifiable planktonic larva are important food items of small juveniles (50 mm), while diatoms are significant in larger juveniles (25 to 80 mm) in the spring/early summer season. The gut is short and the teeth are incisiform, backed by several rows of molars which increase in size and number with age. D. cervinus was almost completely carnivorous in the size range studied. The juveniles found on harpacticoid copepods and chironomid larvae while between 10 and 20 mm long. The diet then consists mainly of the shrimp Palaemon pacificus until the fish are 50 mm long and then amphipods until 100 mm long. All fish larger than this feed prodominantly on polychaetes. The gut is short and the teeth {{are similar to those of}} Q. sargus although there are fewer molars. From its first appearance at 10 mm, Sarpa salpa feeds mainly on harpacticoid copepods until 25 mm long. Diatoms then predominate in the diet, red algae also being taken until 75 mm long. Larger size classes are herbivores, feeding almost equally on red and green algae. Corresponding changes in gut length and dentition are reported, juveniles having a short gut and conical teeth and adults a long intestine and cuspidate, incisiform teeth. Marked ecological separation was observed between the three species. Spatial, temporal, behavioural and dietary differences were found. Q. sargus has continuous recruitment of juveniles into the littoral zone, S [...] salpa appears between July and early September and Q. cervinus is recruited from late September to November. Competition between small juveniles is reduced by cyclic abundances of food items important to each species and the sub-adults feed on different foods. Some competition exists between large juveniles of Q. sargus and Q. cervinus, but separation is maintained as individuals of the two species feed at different <b>lavels</b> of the water column and in different parts of the littoral zone...|$|R
40|$|The {{location}} of the cells of origin and the projection areas of descending fibre tracts of the spinal cord lateral columns were examined in rats. Unilateral micro-transections of subpopulations of lateral column fibres, at C 2 or T 10, with subsequent application of horseradish peroxidase to the severed axons, allowed identification, by retrograde labelling, of those cell groups projecting to the spinal cord through the lateral columns. Additionally, the pattern of fibre and preterminal degeneration {{below the level of}} transection was examined using the Fink-Heimer silver impregnation technique. The largest number of labelled cells was observed in the ventral portion of nucleus gigantocellularis, projecting ipsilaterally through both the anterolateral (AL) and dorsolateral (DL) columns. Labelled cells were observed in the dorsal portion of the lateral vestibular nucleus (lv) following a T 10 transection, and throughout the necleus following a C 2 transection. Protein marker was observed in the large Deiters' cells of the lv, ipsilaterally. Also following an AL, but not a DL, column transection, retrograde labelled cells occurred throughout necleus reticularis pontis oralis (rpoo), bilaterally. At the border of rpoo and the lateral lemniscus, a discrete group of labelled cells was observed bilaterally following a DL column transection. This group of reticulospinal cells was located in a position {{similar to that of the}} A 7 cell group reported in histofluorescence studies. The most extensive group of labelled cells following a DL column transection occurred in the magnocellular portion of the contralateral red nucleus. Although <b>lavelled</b> cells were observed in the red nucleus following either a C 2 or T 10 DL column transection, labelled cells were more numbeous and extended further rostrally and dorsally, following a high cervical transection. Labelled cells in nucleus raphe magnus were also more numerous following a DL column transection. Additional groups of labelled cells were seen following both an AL or DL column transection. These groups included necleus subcoeruleus ipsilaterally, and nucleus reticularis ventralis and the nucleus of the tract of spinal V, bilaterally. Labelled cells were observed as far forwards as the hypothalamus, occurring predominantly in the paraventricular nucleus, ipsilaterally. A few labelled cells were observed in the lateral hypothalamus. Some cell groups were labelled only after a C 2 transection. These included the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, ipsilaterally, the descending vestibular necleus and the deep layers of the superior colliculus, contralaterally, and the central grey matter and nucleus raphe pallidus. Fibre and preterminal degeneration resulting from unilateral AL or DL column transection was examined. Following an AL column transection degeneration was most intense in the ipsilateral laminae V, VI and VII [...] ...|$|R
