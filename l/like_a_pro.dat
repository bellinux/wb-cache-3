Most countries send their top four players of the tournament as representatives, though nations with minor Magic playing communities may send just one player. The World Championship also has a team-based competition, where the national teams compete with each other.|$|E

Not only that, she's doing it better than even diehard defenders would’ve predicted. At 29, the pop star whose career seemed in danger of ending just {{a couple years ago}} has shown that she's back– hopefully this time to stay." [...] Evelyn McDonnell of Spin said that [...] "the idol America loves to hate went all out. Her body perpetually moved, she sang steadfastly into her headset (okay, she's got plenty of digital support, but she doesn't merely lip-sync), and she shimmied through an endless parade of outfits. [...] Having been knocked down by the tabloid press and the public repeatedly in recent years, Spears is now desperately seeking our attention. And she earns it. Haters go home." [...] Kelley L. Carter of MTV commented that [...] "the Spears that captivated the audience at the Staples Center [...] was the old, fun-loving, free-wheeling Spears— with a sexy, showgirl twist. There wasn't much pretense, though those glamazon outfits blinded in the best way possible. Instead, there was just good dance music." [...] Carla Meyer of The Sacramento Bee stated that [...] "Though Spears performed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>pro</b> throughout the show, hitting all her marks, she had shown hesitancy in her movements— natural for the first stop on a tour.

[...] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote, [...] "If this is what the apotheosis of branded, big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015, we could be doing much worse. Unlike its title character, Age of Ultron most definitely has soul."

I mean, how many times can they save the world? But this is not that day." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Age of Ultron is a whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie.

But he recovers <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>pro,</b> devising a spectacle that's epic {{in every sense of the}} word." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, stating that despite being [...] "bigger, louder and more disjointed" [...] than its predecessor, [...] "it’s also got more personality—specifically Whedon's—than any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise." [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire praised the interactions between the characters, the action set-pieces and Whedon's ability as a director in her review, stating that the film [...] "redefines the scale we can expect from our superheroes." ...|$|E

He added that Clarkson managed to take the piano-driven song in a different direction with a [...] "stormy, hard blues vocal... avoiding the typical raised-key final chorus cliché along the way".

500|$|Critics praised Super Meat Boys {{platforming}} elements, {{and often}} {{commented on the}} game's difficulty. X-Play reviewer Alexandra Hall said the game had [...] "riveting platforming action", and added that [...] "Super Meat Boys designers are masters of their craft." [...] Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar felt the platforming was [...] "perfect". He wrote that [...] "while it's always tough and demanding, it never feels cheap, or like the game is cheating you." [...] A reviewer from GameTrailers stated that [...] "the difficulty rides the perfect line between driving you utterly bonkers when you fail and making you feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> platform <b>pro</b> when you succeed". Joystiq's Richard Mitchell echoed other reviewers' comments: [...] "Super Meat Boy is tough, as tough as the toughest nails in the toughest universe." [...] Gilbert cited the level of difficulty, which he believed made the game inaccessible to some players, as his reason for not awarding the game a perfect score. Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the game's [...] "precise control", [...] "excellent level design", and [...] "smooth difficulty curve". Reviewer Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer warned that Super Meat Boy is [...] "a hard game. It should {{make you want to}} throw the pad across the room".|$|R

[...] Phillip Mlynar of Spin gave the album a seven out of ten, saying [...] "This might all come across as critical nit-pickery on what's mostly a very good album, but the concept betrays the end listening experience, leaving the unshakable feeling that it could've been a six-track EP, not an over-padded full album. As one of Ghost's pals once put it, there's much virtue in being half-short and twice-strong." [...] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club gave the album an A-, saying [...] "Following his smart score for the 2009 blaxploitation homage Black Dynamite and this year’s joint effort with Delphonics singer William Hart, Adrian Younge Presents The Delphonics, Twelve Reasons is Younge’s first foray into rap, but he takes to the genre <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old <b>pro.</b> Without removing Ghostface from his sweet spot, he’s built a lavish new playground for the rapper to indulge his harried depictions of slit throats, severed tongues, and bullet-torn flesh. In an era where it increasingly seems like rap albums are being rendered obsolete by mixtapes, this tightly focused, wildly entertaining collaboration between two master craftsmen is a testament to how powerful the form can still be." ...|$|R

25|$|Some pros {{always had}} {{problems}} with how the ABA decided its number one pros for the year {{going back to the}} 1979 season. The biggest complaint that it was canted to have the points work out so that the number one pro would almost certainly be decided going into the ABA's Grand National in November with the lion's share of the points being doled out then (the points that were earned was {{the amount of money that}} was earned through the year. At that time the ABA AA pro who won the most money was declared No. 1 pro). The pros claimed that this benefited the ABA since it meant an exciting finish to the season, but it was detrimental to the <b>pros</b> in that <b>a</b> season of consistent wins and near wins could be undone by having an off day and/or a normally inconsistent rider having a great day and capturing the number one plate. Other issues <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bigger <b>pro</b> purse and that the purse be spread out over eight places instead of the top four at ABA Nationals which would ensure anyone making the pro main would get a share of the winnings were also a factor. The claim was while NBL, NBA and independent promotional races' purses have gone up over the years, the ABA's purses had remained relatively stagnant.|$|R

A classic tale of mistaken identities, the novel offers an outsider’s view of Iceland, that according to the author was “a fun challenge: To write about my home country as if I had never been there before”.|$|R
