Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man. [...] that protection is immoral.... Why, if protection builds up and elevates 63,000,000 [...] of people, the influence of those 63,000,000 of people elevates {{the rest of the}} world. We cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefiting mankind everywhere. Well, they say, 'Buy where you can buy the cheapest'.... Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: 'Buy where you can pay the easiest.' And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.|$|E

We're taking away the hard work the athlete puts in and saying he became great just because of steroids. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a perfect example. I have an identical twin brother, Ozzie. He {{is the closest thing}} to me genetically. And in my prime I was a super athlete". [...] "My twin brother used the same chemicals, same workouts, the same nutrition. Why didn't he make it in the big leagues? That is the perfect example that we are giving steroids way too much credit. If steroids are that great it would have made him a superstar." ...|$|E

Do not stop for any that call after thee, whether it be the world, the flesh, or the devil; for all these will hinder thy journey, if possible. 7.

60|$|Reader, here might I spend many {{sheets of}} paper, yea, I might upon this subject write {{a very great}} book, but I shall now forbear, {{desiring}} thee to be very conversant in the Scriptures, 'for they are they which testify of Jesus Christ' (John 5:39). The Bereans were counted noble upon this account: 'These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the Word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily,' &c. (Acts 17:11). But here <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>thee</b> one caution, that is, have a care that thou do not satisfy thyself with a bare search of them, without a real application of him whom they testify of to thy soul, lest instead of faring the better for thy doing this work, thou dost fare a great deal the worse, and thy condemnation be very much heightened, in that though thou didst read so often the sad state of those that die in sin, and the glorious estate of them that close in with Christ, yet thou thyself shouldest be such a fool as to lose Jesus Christ, notwithstanding thy hearing, and reading so plentifully of him.|$|R
