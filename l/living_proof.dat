60|$|The public {{greeted them}} with mock applause. In them they had quickly {{recognised}} the German barbarians whom the Cæsar had {{brought back from}} his last expedition as prisoners of war; in truth they were hardened malefactors who had been offered a chance of life {{in exchange for the}} pitiable masquerade. But this the public did not know. To the two hundred thousand holiday-makers, craning their necks to see the miserable wretches, they were but the <b>living</b> <b>proofs</b> of the Cæsar's prowess in the field. With ironical cheers they were bidden to advance, even whilst at no great distance from them the black panther sitting on its haunches was surveying them with lazy curiosity, licking its mighty jaws.|$|R
60|$|From all the {{authorities}} here quoted, {{and a variety}} of others which I have consulted, but which are omitted through fear of fatiguing the unlearned reader, I can only draw the following conclusions, which luckily, however, are sufficient for my purpose. First, that {{this part of the world}} has actually been peopled (Q.E.D.) to support which we have <b>living</b> <b>proofs</b> in the numerous tribes of Indians that inhabit it. Secondly, that it has been peopled in five hundred different ways, as proved by a cloud of authors, who, from the positiveness of their assertions, seem to have been eye-witnesses to the fact. Thirdly, that the people of this country had a variety of fathers, which, as it may not be thought much to their credit by the common run of readers, the less we say on the subject the better. The question, therefore, I trust, is for ever at rest.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{multilingual}} aspects which {{characterize the}} (Semantic) Web {{and the constant}} demand for more understandable and easy-to-share forms of knowledge representation, push for a more “linguistically aware ” approach to ontology development and foresees an environment where formal semantics could coexist with natural language, contributing to improve “shareability ” of the content they describe. As a consequence ontologies should be enriched to both cover formally expressed conceptual knowledge {{as well as to}} expose content in a linguistically motivated fashion. In this paper we present a suite of tools, libraries and ontologies, ranging from ontology development to language resources access and management, supporting the development of multilingual ontologies. The contribution of this work, going beyond mere tool presentation, is two-fold: the presented tools implicitly embody a new way (methodology?) of rethinking the development of ontologies in terms of making their content easy reusable and comprehensible; moreover, they represent <b>living</b> <b>proofs</b> of software engineering principles associated to software reuse, documentation, modularity, interaction analysis, applied to the domain of Knowledge Management Softwar...|$|R

Introduction: Centuries ago, in a wilderness, Moses {{gave to the}} Jewish people laws, which us as Christians {{are only}} {{beginning}} to formulate. The pillar of fire and cloud was leading them over scorching deserts and through malicious valleys, beneath the burning oriental sun. Travelling and camping in companies of thousands, only the laws of sanitation preserved them from extermination by pestilence. Today the well-known healthfulness and longevity of the Jews, despite marvelous persecutions, are <b>living</b> <b>proofs</b> of the immutability of the laws of health and heredity. In Greece Gallus taught the truths of hygiene, while in the ruins of Roman baths, aqueducts, and even us have witnessed of the goal and sanitary knowledge of the ancients. The laws of this science to the world was marked by “pestilence that walketh in darkness, and destruction that wasteth at noon day. Only in the accidental purity of country life was the health of the nations for many years. Later the sciences of chemistry, botany, and medicine combined have shown the relations of sanitation to man, and the reform sought by the philanthropists of all ages...|$|R

50|$|In her 2012 {{article in}} Skeptical Inquirer and book The AIDS Conspiracy: Science Fights Back, Nattrass {{examines}} {{the landscape of}} the AIDS denialist community and identifies four groups of characters: hero scientists (provide scientific credibility); cultropreneurs (promote non-evidence based, unproven alternative treatment); <b>living</b> icons (<b>proof</b> that HIV is not the cause of AIDS) and praise singers (journalists and film makers who promote the cause). She observes that they each fill their own important role in the intractable propagation of the movement and their intertwined and symbiotic relationships are established through their shared anti-science and conspiratorial stance, and beliefs in alternative medicine and treatment. Nattrass describes how pro-science activists fought back by deploying empirical evidence and giving political credibility to refute AIDS conspiracy theories, as part of the crucial project to defend evidence-based medicine and combat pseudoscience.|$|R

50|$|What {{little we}} know about the Imamate at Alamut is narrated to us by one of the {{greatest}} detractors of the Ismailis, Juwayni. According to the Ismaili version of the events, in the year following the death of the Imam-Caliph al-Mustansir, a qadi (judge) by the name of Sa’idi travelled from Egypt to Alamut, taking with him Imam Nizar’s youngest son, who was known as al-Hadi. Imam Hadi apparently lived in concealment in the Alamut valley, under the protection of Hasan-i Sabbah, then the chief da’i of the Nizari Ismaili state. Following him were Imam Muhtadi and Imam Qahir, also living in concealment from the general population, but in touch with the highest-ranking members of the Ismaili hierarchy (hudūd). These <b>living</b> and visible <b>proofs</b> of the existence of the concealed Imams are known in Ismaili doctrine as hujjat (proof). The period of the Imam’s concealment was marked by central direction from the chief da’i at the Alamut fortress across the Nizari Ismaili state. With the emergence of Imam Hasan ‘ala dhikri al-salam however, the period of concealment (saṭr) was now complete.|$|R
