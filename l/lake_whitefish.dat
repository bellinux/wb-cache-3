25|$|An {{unintended}} {{benefit of}} the round goby's introduction is that the Lake Erie watersnake, once listed as a threatened species, has found the goby to be a tasty addition to its diet. A recent study found the introduced fish now accounts for up to 90% of the snake's diet. The new food supply means that the water snake is now staging a comeback. Round gobies also serve as food {{for a variety of}} predatory fishes in the Great Lakes, including bass, lake trout, <b>lake</b> <b>whitefish,</b> burbot, and walleye.|$|E

In addition, many fish species have been either intentionally or accidentally introduced to Lake Superior: Atlantic salmon, brown trout, carp, chinook salmon, coho salmon, freshwater drum, pink salmon, rainbow smelt, rainbow trout, round goby, ruffe, sea lamprey and white perch.|$|E

The lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), goldeye (Hiodon alosoides), and bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) are fish species of the Saskatchewan river. Streams and ponds throughout the Saskatchewan prairies may be stocked with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brook (Salvelinus fontinalis), and brown trout (Salmo trutta morpha fario and S. trutta morpha lacustris). Catfish (Sluriformes) and carp (Cyprinidae) range through the Frenchman river.|$|E
25|$|Lake Michigan {{is home to}} a {{wide variety}} of fish species and other organisms. It was {{originally}} home to <b>lake</b> <b>whitefish,</b> lake trout, yellow perch, panfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and bowfin, as well as some species of catfish. As a result of improvements to the Welland Canal in 1919, an invasion of sea lampreys and overharvesting, there has been a decline in native lake trout populations, ultimately causing an increase in the population of another invasive species, the alewife. As a result, salmonids, including various strains of brown trout, steelhead (rainbow trout), coho and chinook salmon, were introduced as predators in order to decrease the alewife population. This program was so successful that the introduced population of trout and salmon exploded, resulting in the creation of a large sport fishery for these introduced species. Lake Michigan is now stocked annually with steelhead, brown trout, and coho and chinook salmon, which have also begun natural reproduction in some Lake Michigan tributaries. However, several introduced invasive species, such as lampreys, round goby, zebra mussels and quagga mussels, continue to cause major changes in water clarity and fertility, resulting in knock-on changes to Lake Michigan's ecosystem, threatening the vitality of native fish populations.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge {{was founded}} by congressional order. That {{paved the way for}} tighter {{restrictions}} on industries and allocated substantial amounts of government funding to clean up the river. However, there was little support toward cleaning up the river, because it would negatively affect Detroit's industrialism and economy. In 1970, the entire fishing industry in the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River, and Lake Erie had to be closed due to toxic levels of mercury found in the water. This, in turn, spurred a massive conservation effort aimed at cleaning up the Detroit River. For years before, conservation efforts were halted by the enormous multimillion-dollar cost of removing pollutants from the river. In addition to that, industries, which had significant political influence, detested the regulations necessary to lessen the amount of pollutants in the river. In 2001, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was absorbed into the much larger Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, which is a cooperative effort between the United States and Canada to preserve the area as an ecological refuge. Millions of dollars so far have been used to dredge pollutants out of the river, and the recent cleaning up and restoration of the Detroit River is remarkable, although other problems are still at hand. Today, many species of native animals are returning to the area after being driven out by human development. The Detroit River is home to a growing number of bird species, such as eagles (including reintroduced bald eagles), ospreys, and peregrine falcons. Fish species in abundance in the area include <b>lake</b> <b>whitefish,</b> sturgeon, silver bass, black bass, salmon, perch, and walleye. The Detroit River was designated as an American Heritage River in 1998 and a Canadian Heritage River in 2001 — the only river to have dual designations.|$|E

500|$|The {{historic}} native {{range of}} cutthroat trout {{has been reduced}} by overfishing, urbanization and habitat loss due to mining, livestock grazing and logging.

Scientists believe the westslope cutthroat trout will eventually be extirpated from the large lakes in Western Montana due to the trophic cascades resulting from lake trout and mysis shrimp introductions. The most serious current threats to several subspecies are interspecific breeding with introduced rainbow trout creating hybrid cutbows and intraspecific breeding with other introduced cutthroat trout subspecies. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the presence of lake trout [...] in Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park has caused a serious decline in [...] Outbreaks of whirling disease in major spawning tributaries within the native ranges have also caused declines.
