40|$|Early {{studies of}} flat-plate arrays have {{projected}} costs {{on the order}} of $ 50 /square meter for installed array support structures. This report describes an optimized low-cost frame-truss structure that is estimated to cost below $ 25 /square meter, including all markups, shipping an installation. The structure utilizes a planar frame made of members formed from <b>light-gauge</b> galvanized steel <b>sheet</b> and is supposed in the field by treated-wood trusses that are partially buried in trenches. The buried trusses use the overburden soil to carry uplift wind loads and thus to obviate reinforced-concrete foundations. Details of the concept, including design rationale, fabrication and assembly experience, structural testing and fabrication drawings are included...|$|R
25|$|Constructed of <b>light-gauge</b> painted <b>sheet</b> steel, Joroleman {{designed}} his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|R
40|$|<b>Light-gauge</b> steel <b>sheeted</b> {{diaphragms}} on wood frames {{may be used}} {{to transfer}} in-plane shear forces to the end walls in post frame structures. The amount of shear force transferred is dependent upon the in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm and the frame stiffness;The results of 31 full-scale cantilever diaphragm tests are presented. Two different sheet profiles and three fastener patterns were used. The results are compared with the predicted stiffness from a plane truss computer analog. Test variables include openings in the sheeting, recessing of purlins in from the sheet ends, seams in the length of the sheet and placing the purlins flat;An analytical method and an empirical equation to be used in conjunction with testing are presented. The analytical method predicts the stiffness of the control diaphragms within 1. 5 % of that predicted by the plane truss computer analog. The empirical equation was fitted to steel diaphragms on steel frames and can be used to adjust for different diaphragm lengths, purlin spacings, and sheet thicknesses;It was found that the location and size of an opening does influence diaphragm stiffness. Openings with sheeting on two sides only will reduce diaphragm stiffness approximately twice as much as openings with sheeting on three or four sides. Fastener stiffness and location have the largest impact on diaphragm stiffness. Increasing the number of fasteners at seams in the length of the diaphragm will off-set the effect of the discontinuous sheet length. Fasteners {{near the edge of the}} sheet have a much larger impact on stiffness than those near the center of the sheet. The plane truss computer analog predicted the test diaphragm stiffness reasonably well;Several methods of modeling the diaphragm frame interaction are reviewed. It was found that the plane frame/truss model will model frame-diaphragm interaction more accurately for complex structural systems if the diaphragms are represented by two spring elements. Also varying frame and diaphragm stiffness can be included easily...|$|R
