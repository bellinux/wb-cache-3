In {{the present}} work, the non-spherical dust grain {{characteristics}} of comet <b>Levy</b> <b>1990</b> XX with different silicate grain compositions (both pyroxene and olivine) are studied using the T-matrix method.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} of IR spectroscopy of Comet <b>Levy</b> <b>1990</b> XX over a three-day {{period when the}} comet was about 1. 54 AU from the sun roughly 70 days before perihelion. Comet <b>Levy</b> <b>1990</b> XX was bright, and for {{at least part of}} its inbound journey toward perihelion, active. At a distance of 1. 54 AU from the sun it showed strong structured silicate emission with peaks or shoulders at 9. 8 and 11. 2 microns. These features resemble those of Comets P/Halley and Bradfield 1987 XXIX. The comet was variable in brightness.

The molecules HCN, formaldahyde, and methanol were all detected in abundances that make them important minor constituents of the nucleus.

40|$|Viewers’ {{interpretations of}} romantic {{relationships}} portrayed between those with anxious and avoidant attachments can affect their opinions on what constitutes appropriate relationship behavior. I conducted a literature review on media impacts and offer {{an interpretation of}} the implications of the language used to describe characters, relationships and characters’ ends. The films studied - Sunset Boulevard, Sid and Nancy, and The Hustler - showed a pattern where in a relationship between an anxious and an avoidant character, the anxious character was punished, absorbed by their relationship, abandoned, trapped in their life, and cut off from the world. Viewers watch films to learn the norms of their community (<b>Levy,</b> <b>1990),</b> and an idealization of avoidant behavior, coupled with negative portrayals of romantic anxiety could lead to harmful beliefs about love. Further studies using questionnaires and focus groups are recommended to better understand the impact of these messages, viewer awareness, and sources of exposure...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have shown}} that the presence of emission bands at 9. 8 and 11. 3 Î¼m is a characteristic of many comets. Although their attribution to silicates is commonly accepted, a wide debate is open to identify the actual species responsible for the two bands. In a previous paper (Colangeli et al. 1995 a) we fitted emission spectra from comets P/Halley 1986 III and <b>Levy</b> <b>1990</b> XX in the 10 Î¼m band region by using spectroscopic data obtained in our laboratory on various silicate samples. In the present work we extend the simulation to available cometary spectra showing similar bands. We show that combinations of pyroxene-type and olivine-type submicron grains produce satisfactory fits. Despite the limited number of observational data available in the literature, our results evidence that spectral variations can be interpreted in terms of intrinsic and/or evolutionary differences among the comets...|$|E

30|$|The {{pyrogenic}} PAHs are {{of larger}} ring systems than the petrogenic PAHs. Most {{of them are}} naturally present in crude oil (Feng & Pisula, 2009; Laughlin & Neff, 1979; Harvey, 1996), coal (Harvey, 1996; Achten & Hofmann, 2010) and these compounds {{are referred to as}} petrogenic PAHs. PAHs enters the water primarily from sewage, runoff from roads (Durand, Ruban, & Amblès, 2004), the smelter industry (Beyer, Borgenvik, & Ravn, 1998; Næs & Oug, 1998; Smith & <b>Levy,</b> <b>1990)</b> and oil spills (Mascarelli, 2010; Redondo & Platonov, 2009), and produced water discharge from offshore oil installations (Røe Utvik, 1999). Research on PAHs concentration in the environment has received much attention by scientists, and regulators due to their persistent and toxic properties (IARC, 1983; NRC, 1983). They accumulate in sediments, aquatic pelagic and benthic food webs and pose a risk to human health (Baumard et al., 1998; Law & Klungsoyr, 2000; Abdolahpur Monikh, Hosseini, Kazemzadeh Khoel, & Ghasemi, 2014; Ayola, Olorunsanmi, & Oke, 2017).|$|E
40|$|Viewers’ {{interpretations of}} {{characters}} with anxious attitudes in romantic relationships can affect their opinions on what constitutes appropriate relationship behavior. This paper analyzes {{the impact of}} media on people through a literature review and offers an explanation of different portrayals of romantic anxiety in film: the language used to describe characters and characters’ ends. The films studied - Sunset Boulevard, Sid and Nancy, Hard Core Logo, Burnt Money, and The Hustler - all showed a pattern where a character with romantic anxiety was mistreated by the storyline or other characters, {{and most of these}} characters meet their end through suicide or murder. The impact of these types of negative portrayals have not yet been explored, but similar studies find that viewers watch films to learn the norms of their community (<b>Levy,</b> <b>1990),</b> and negative portrayals of romantic anxiety could lead to negative effects for anxious individuals. Further studies using questionnaires and focus groups are recommended in order to better understand the impact of these messages, viewer awareness, and sources of exposure...|$|E

30|$|Despite {{investigation}} {{linking the}} relationship between psychosocial stressors and tumor development or progression facing many obvious difficulties including the stage of disease {{and a number of}} side-effects associated with the cancer treatments (Andersen et al. 1994), a number of observations showed that stress-reducing interventions could improve immune function (Kiecolt-Glaser and Glaser 1992; Fawzy et al. 1990, 1993). Patients with stage I or II malignant melanoma, not having received any treatment after surgical excision of the cancer, showed significant relationship of reduced psychological distress with increased percent and cytotoxicity of NK cells compared with control groups. A 6 -year follow-up study of these patients showed a trend towards significantly lowered recurrence and mortality rate in the intervention patients compared to control group. Consistent results could also be found in the intervention study showing that continued therapy with self-hypnosis extended survival time in women with metastatic breast cancer (Spiegel et al. 1989). Although it is not known if these data reflect immunological alterations that influenced the course of the cancer, {{and a number of other}} interpretations are plausible, behavioral differences could have contributed to the observed outcomes.
