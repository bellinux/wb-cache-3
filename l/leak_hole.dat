50|$|Finally, the <b>leaking</b> of some <b>holes</b> {{can be used}} {{to destabilize}} low {{harmonics}}, causing higher harmonics to sound. On all recorders hole 0, the thumb hole, serves this purpose. Other holes may also be leaked to destabilize lower harmonics in place of hole 0, or to destabilize notes in which hole 0 is already leaked. This is demonstrated in the tables of Ganassi's Fontegara (1535), which use the simultaneous <b>leaking</b> of <b>holes</b> 0, 2, and 5 to produce some high notes. For example, Ganassi's finger table produces the 15th (third octave tonic) as the fourth harmonic of the fingering for the tonic, <b>leaking</b> <b>holes</b> 0, 2 and 5 and the 16th as the third harmonic of the fingering for the fifth, <b>leaking</b> <b>holes</b> 0 and 2. On some Baroque recorders, the 17th can be produced as the third harmonic of the sixth, <b>leaking</b> <b>hole</b> 0 as well as hole 1, 2 or both.|$|R

It is crucial to locate the <b>leak</b> <b>hole</b> timely and accurately for reasons of safety and maintenance. This paper presents the principle and application of a linear acoustic emission sensor array and a near-field beamforming technique to identify {{the location of a}} continuous CO 2 leak from an isotropic flat-surface structure on a pressurized vessel in the Carbon Capture and Storage system. Acoustic signals generated by the <b>leak</b> <b>hole</b> are collected using a linear high-frequency sensor array. Time-frequency analysis and a narrow-band filtering technique are deployed to extract effective information about the leak. The impacts of various factors on the performance of the localization technique are simulated, compared and discussed, including the number of sensors, distance between the <b>leak</b> <b>hole</b> and sensor array and spacing between adjacent sensors. Experiments were carried out on a laboratory-scale test rig to assess the effectiveness and operability of the proposed method. The results obtained suggest that the proposed method is capable of providing accurate and reliable localization of a continuous CO 2 leak...|$|E
40|$|The leakage process {{simulation}} of a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) storage tank requires the simultaneous {{solution of the}} NGL’s pressure, temperature and phase state in the tank and across the <b>leak</b> <b>hole.</b> The methods available in the literature rarely consider the liquid/vapor phase transition of the NGL during such a process. This paper provides a comprehensive pressure-temperature-phase state method to solve this problem. With this method, the phase state of the NGL is predicted by a thermodynamic model based on the volume translated Peng-Robinson equation of state (VTPR EOS). The tank’s pressure and temperature are simulated according to the pressure-volume-temperature and isenthalpic expansion principles of the NGL. The pressure, temperature, leakage mass flow rate across the <b>leak</b> <b>hole</b> are calculated from an improved Homogeneous Non-Equilibrium Diener-Schmidt (HNE-DS) model and the isentropic expansion principle. In particular, the improved HNE-DS model removes the ideal gas assumption used in the original HNE-DS model by using a new compressibility factor developed from the VTPR EOS to replace the original one derived from the Clausius-Clayperon equation. Finally, a robust procedure of simultaneously solving the tank model and the <b>leak</b> <b>hole</b> model is proposed and the method is validated by experimental data. A variety of leakage cases demonstrates that this method is effective in simulating the dynamic leakage process of NGL tanks under critical and subcritical releasing conditions associated with vapor/liquid phase change...|$|E
40|$|Leak {{localization}} {{is essential}} for the safety and maintenance of storage vessels. This study proposes a novel circular acoustic emission sensor array to realize the continuous CO 2 leak localization from a circular hole on the surface of a large storage vessel in a carbon capture and storage system. Advantages of the proposed array are analyzed and compared with the common sparse arrays. Experiments were carried out on a laboratory-scale stainless steel plate and leak signals were obtained from a circular hole in the center of this flat-surface structure. In order to reduce the influence of the ambient noise and dispersion of the acoustic wave on the localization accuracy, ensemble empirical mode decomposition is deployed to extract the useful leak signal. The time differences between the signals from the adjacent sensors in the array are calculated through correlation signal processing before estimating the corresponding distance differences between the sensors. A hyperbolic positioning algorithm is used to identify the location of the circular <b>leak</b> <b>hole.</b> Results show that the circular sensor array has very good directivity toward the circular <b>leak</b> <b>hole.</b> Furthermore, an optimized method is proposed by changing the position of the circular sensor array on the flat-surface structure or adding another circular sensor array to identify the direction of the circular <b>leak</b> <b>hole.</b> Experiential results obtained on a 100 cm × 100 cm stainless steel plate demonstrate that the full-scale error in the leak localization is within 0. 6 %...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper, in {{the view}} of indoor security, {{analyzes}} the leak variation and indoor R 32 concentration distribution when it leaks from the running indoor unit using experimental methods. The results show that the leak rate of R 32 decreases with the air conditioner operating. And the leak process of refrigerant under operating conditions can be classified into two stages, fast leak stage and slow leak stage. The concentration of test points increases at first, then decreases and gradually stabilizes. Near the <b>leak</b> <b>hole,</b> it is the highest and varies dramatically. And it is high in the supply air mine stream, but it is only about 15 % of the LFL. The concentration of the corner that the supply air cannot reached is the lowest. The indoor security during the leaking process of R 32 is evaluated, and the results show that the combustible zone only appears near the <b>leak</b> <b>hole,</b> and its duration is very short. Ignition experiment is took in the combustible region and the results show that the candle flame and spark diffuse slightly, but it cannot spread effectively. It can be concluded that the hazard of using R 32 as the refrigerant of air conditioner is low with the air velocity and angle keeping at 5. 8 m/s and 25 °. In order to improve the security of the indoor environment further, the paper also analysis the impact of exhaust on indoor R 32 concentration distribution and the results indicate that ventilation can reduce the indoor R 32 concentrationeffectively. Thus, it can reduce the risk of fire by opening the exhaust fan when R 32 leaks with the air conditioner running...|$|E

40|$|The common ways {{used to find}} leak include {{traditional}} bubbling test, ultrasonic positioning and helium mass-spectrometer detection, etc. However, each of {{them has}} deficiencies of varying degrees, especially low-efficiency in bubbling and mass spectrometry means and poor anti-jamming capability in ultrasonic means. In order to search a better approach to do this job, a new method is introduced in this paper, {{which is based on}} infrared thermography. In the experiment, test vessel is firstly aerated with absolute pressure of 0. 6 - 0. 7 Mpa and then the temperature field surround the vessel is monitored and acquired by an IR camera. On account of leakiness, compressed air expanses from the <b>leak</b> <b>hole</b> to ambient and heat-absorption effect has taken place around it on the basis of Joule-Thomson Effect, so the temperature difference between the leak area and normal area will be reflected in the thermal images. Moreover, Freon cooler is also set in the pneumatic circuit for the sake of enhancing the phenomenon. During the test, several frames of thermal images in time sequence are transferred to the computer for pre-processing and fusion operating by the use of local entropy difference algorithm. From results, it is shown that the method achieves a good resolution and sensitivity in the application of air-leakage detection and localization.

About 80 % of the patients diagnosed with this problem require surgery.

Therefore, an anastomotic leak represents a significant problem and increases the duration of hospital stay, which is associated with remedial treatment and recovery, causing, as a result, a negative financial impact. A number of techniques to treat, prevent and even detect an anastomotic leakage are under investigation. However, studies show that these techniques are not always able to prevent an anastomotic leak from occurring.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were used to}} investigate the potential of using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to detect water leaks in the underground distribution system. Leaks not only waste precious natural resources, they create substantial damage to the transportation system and structure within urban and suburban environments. Surface geophysical methods are non-invasive, trenchless tools used to characterize the physical properties of the subsurface material. This characterization is then used to interpret the geologic and hydrogeologic conditions of the subsurface. Many geophysical techniques have been suggested as candidates for detecting water leakage, including GPR, acoustic devices, gas sampling devices and pressure wave detectors. GPR is a reflection technique which uses high frequency electromagnetic waves to acquire subsurface information. GPR responds to changes in electrical properties, which are a function of soil and rock material and moisture content.

40|$|The {{internal}} {{surfaces of}} prestressed concrete pressure vessels are {{fitted with a}} steel liner to preserve the gas tightness of the primary circuit. Because of the high quality manufacture and the loading conditions a liner failure can be practically excluded. However, if it is hypothetically assumed, that a leak develops during reactor operation, {{it may be difficult}} to determine the position of the leak, because the liner area is very large. For tightness surveillance and for venting channel systems installed in close proximity to the liner are suitable. The suitability of such channels for leak detection, localisation and venting was investigated experimentally.

For the simulation of <b>leaks</b> <b>holes</b> were drilled into the liner. The experimental programm contained the following measurements: - determination of gas flow rates into the different leaks, - distribution of leakage gas over the array of channels, - determination of pressures into the concrete and immediatelybehind the liner. The experiments have shown, that channel arrays immediately adjacent to the liner are the most suitable systems for localisation and controlled exhaust of leakage gas. The suitability decreases, if the channels are set into the concrete somewhat distant from the liner...|$|R

5000|$|Keith D. Miller {{points to}} a {{possible}} cause for Corder’s less than luster reception within the discipline of rhetoric and composition, in his essay, “The Radical, Feminist Rhetoric of Jim Corder.” [...] Miller explains that “Corder constantly torpedoes genre distinctions between personal essays and scholarship, occasionally bemoaning others’ failure to blend the expressive with the intellectual”. Miller recounts: Corder once told me: ‘All taxonomies leak.’ But instead of constructing a better ship with tighter compartments, he places dynamite into the <b>leaking</b> <b>holes</b> of every available taxonomy and genre category. Exploding cargo-holds disorients readers by disrupting their expectations, which hinge on the stability of well-defined genres. Miller specifically highlights Corder’s defiance of genre expectations within Hunting Lieutenant Chadbourne, suggesting that “he fuses autobiography, postmodern rhetoric, and nineteenth-century American historiography”. The resulting concoction of mixed modes and blended genres makes the book {{as much of a}} history of Lt. Chadbourne as it is Corder’s argument against conventional academic discourse, particularly in the realm of historical research. Miller suggests that “to raid different genres and disciplines is to argue indirectly by prodding readers to ask: ‘What is going on?’”. That is, Corder wishes to challenge the ways that scholars conceive of and write about knowledge and history, and Hunting Lieutenant Chadbourne embodies both his critique and his argument for an alternative approach, one that “invites a reader to share his process of contemplating and weighing. Just as he patiently explores a problem, he implicitly argues, so should a reader”. However, particularly because he eschews pre-established genre structures, “Corder generates momentum by creating the impression of thinking aloud,” which allows him to subvert “standard academic discourse by creating a sense of puzzling over a problem with a reader instead of handing her solutions”.|$|R
