50|$|Emulation {{is similar}} to {{imitation}} in that after observing a demonstrator interacting with objects in its environment, an observer is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> act <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about a similar effect on those objects, but not necessarily through the same method. In a study with orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), researchers demonstrated that tool use was passed down through emulation. Humans demonstrated {{the use of a}} tool to a group of orangutans and then presented orangutans with the same tools and desirable, but out-of-reach, food. Orangutans used the tools to obtain food, but they did not use the same exact methods as the human demonstrators. This suggests that subjects paid attention to the general functional relationship between the task and the result, but did not adhere to the actual methods of tool use demonstrated, and were thus not imitating.|$|R

Women with low educational attainment entering the workforce in mass quantity lowered earnings for some men, as the women brought about a lot more job competition. The lowered relative earnings of the men and increase in birth control made marriage prospects harder for lower income women.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} the pretannin tea without requiring {{it all to}} be poured into cups, a second teapot may be used. The steeping pot is best unglazed earthenware; Yixing pots are {{the best known of}} these, famed for the high-quality clay from which they are made. The serving pot is generally porcelain, which retains the heat better. Larger teapots are a post-19th century invention, as tea before this time was very rare and very expensive. Experienced tea-drinkers often insist the tea should not be stirred around while it is steeping (sometimes called winding or mashing in the UK). This, they say, will do little to strengthen the tea, but is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the tannins out {{in the same way that}} brewing too long will do. For the same reason, one should not squeeze the last drops out of a teabag; if stronger tea is desired, more tea leaves should be used.|$|E

Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and intimidate Voorhees. On September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa. Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days and concluded he had antisocial personality disorder (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as sociopathy and psychopathy), was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> him into repeated conflict with society.

25|$|The Office of Vespers is {{the only}} one which has {{remained}} popular (excepting, of course, the Holy Sacrifice, which is not consider here as an Office) among Roman Catholics up to the present day. Matins and Lauds, on account of the hour at which they are celebrated, have always been more or less inaccessible to the faithful; likewise the little hours, except, perhaps, Terce, which serves as an introduction to the Mass. Vespers, on the contrary, occupies a privileged place {{towards the end of the}} day. On Sundays it is the Office most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the faithful together in church for the second time and thus becomingly completes the Divine Service for that day. It is quite conformable to tradition, moreover, to invest this Office with a particular solemnity. The Vesper psalms, as well as the hymns and antiphons, are well calculated to edify the faithful. Lastly, the ancient custom of having a lection or reading from the Old, or New Testament, or from the homilies of the Fathers, might well in certain cases and to a certain extent be re-adopted, or serve as the subject matter for the sermon which is sometimes delivered at this service.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{adhesion}} {{between high}} consistency silicone rubbers (HCR) and metal via a primer entails a complex chemistry not completely understood.

In this first study, different primer formulations were tested, thanks to a 900 peel test, showing different effectiveness toward silicone/metal attachment. Their basic components are organotitanate catalysts and a vinyltrialkoxysilane, whereas some other reactants, e. g. 3 -mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane, polydimethylsiloxane chains or tetraethoxysilane, are <b>likely</b> introduced <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> supplementary properties <b>to</b> the primer film or to enhance the co-vulcanization with the silicone elastomer.

2500|$|Individual {{therapy with}} the child seeks to {{identify}} and resolve underlying factors, including familial factors; encourage identification by sex assigned at birth; and encourage same-sex friendships. Parent counseling involves setting limits on the child's cross-gender behavior; encouraging gender-neutral or sex-typical activities; examining familial factors; and examining parental factors such as psychopathology. Longtime researchers of gender identity disorder, Kenneth Zucker and Susan Bradley, state {{that it has been}} found that boys with gender identity disorder often have mothers who to an extent reinforced behavior more stereotypical of young girls. They also note that children with gender identity disorder tend to come from families where cross-gender role behavior was not explicitly discouraged. However, they also acknowledge that one could view these findings as merely indicative of the fact that parents who were more accepting of their child's cross-gender role behavior are also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> their children to a clinical psychiatrist as opposed to parents who are less accepting of cross-gender role behavior in their children (Bradley, Zucker, 1997).

Grimkell, however, was only a member of Olaf’s household and no permanent sees were created until c. 1100.

2500|$|Using English {{words in}} daily conversation, advertising, and {{entertainment}} {{is seen as}} trendy and cool. However this use can often lead to misunderstandings due to problems with pronunciation, grammar or vocabulary. Modern use of Konglish has already created a linguistic divide between North Korea and South Korea. North Korean defectors can have trouble integrating into South Korean society {{because much of the}} Konglish used there is not used in North Korea. This can lead to confusion, misunderstandings and delay integration into the society. This is not the sole cause of the linguistic divide between the two nations as some Korean words are also used differently between the two countries. While Konglish problems exist between the North and South they also exist between the metropolitan and rural. Ahn Jung-hyo a Korean-English translator who is the author of [...] "A False English Dictionary" [...] was noted for saying that improper use of Konglish in other countries is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> shame to Korea. However, John Huer, a columnist for Korea Times, noted Konglish usage as one of his [...] "10 Most Wonderful Things About Korea". He felt that it was both inventive and clever. After that article Huer criticized Koreans for their bad English and improper use of loanwords, though. Modern Konglish usage could even be viewed as art, yet {{there is a difference between}} a cultural use of a word like [...] "Fighting!" [...] and the bad grammar and vocabulary seen on signs, packages, and TV around Korea. Sebastian Harrisan has suggested that calling these kinds of things Konglish masks the problem with English education in Korea. The Korean government has been criticized by civic groups for their use of Konglish in slogans and focusing too much on English education. They feel that the heavy focus on English will damage the Korean language and doesn't benefit international competitiveness. In contrast, Jasper Kim, a law professor at Ewha Womans University, wrote that Konglish is necessary in a global context and that strict adherence to grammatical rules shouldn't trump getting the message across.|$|E
