40|$|Peter Mares {{analyses}} Labor’s {{new policy}} on asylum seekers LABOR’S long awaited policy on refugees and asylum seekers reflects the tensions within {{the rank and}} file of the party over this contentious issue. In an effort not to frighten voters in marginal seats, the policy is couched very much in the same language of ‘border protection’ that has proved so politically effective for the Coalition. In this sense, Carmen Lawrence is right when she says that Labor is ‘playing on John Howard’s turf’ and allowing him ‘to define the territory and the argument’. The new policy fails to undo the far-reaching post-Tampa legislation that was rushed through parliament with Labor support in the dying days of the last parliament. That legislation fundamentally recast the rules of the refugee game in Australia. As Robert Manne has argued, the post-Tampa changes essentially shifted from a policy of deterrence based on the cruel treatment of on-shore asylum seekers (mandatory detention and temporary protection visas) to a policy of ‘naval deterrence at the border’. If elected, Labor would continue this policy, although a new coastguard would take over the role of the navy in intercepting boats and turning them around. Under such conditions, Australia is unlikely to see a renewed influx of asylum seekers arriving by boat from Indonesia. The number of asylum seekers arriving without authorisation by air is also likely to remain low, given the stringent pre-embarkation checks that Australia has implemented at airports in Southeast Asia. Overall Labor offers no fundamental challenge to the existing arrangements for dealing with onshore asylum seekers. Nevertheless, shadow minister Julia Gillard has been listening {{to a wide range of}} advice from critics within and outside the party and the detail of the policy reveals that she has come up with some creative and innovative proposals that deserve support. The following analysis is based on a quick reading of the ALP document and is organised around key subject areas. Direct quotes from the document are in italics. Foreword The language of the foreword is all about ‘border protection’, not about protecting the rights of vulnerable people. The policy paper details five new important steps that Australia will take, all of which use the language of policing and have to do with border control: Labor will crack down on illegal workers who are stealing Australian jobs; Labor will smash onshore and offshore people smuggling, impose harsher penalties, and focus on eradicating people trafficking. Labor will better protect our airports and seaports. Global approaches Labor says it create a fairer world wide refugee system by having the world adopt one processing system for refugee claims. If there was one world wide processing system this would be the ultimate deterrent to people smuggling and boat arrivals. Why pay a people smuggler and risk your life to get to a developed nation if, when you get there, you have no better chance of your claim being accepted? This is essentially the same claim that Philip Ruddock has made; it is an assertion that Australia’s refugee system is too generous, and therefore attracts people who are not refugees, or whose refugee claims are not strong enough to succeed elsewhere. Statistics do not necessarily back up this assertion. For example, while recognition rates for asylum seekers from Iraq have been higher in Australia than in some other countries in recent years, recognition rates for asylum seekers from Iran have been much lower than in comparable countries. The reason that many asylum seekers chose to risk the journey on to Australia rather than seek protection from the UNHCR in Jakarta was not necessarily that they thought they had a better chance of being accepted as a refugee in Australia, but because they knew that recognition by UNHCR in Jakarta would leave them in limbo, living on a handout of US$ 50 per month with little chance of resettlement or a permenant resolution to their plight Labor does however give greater recognition to the root causes of human displacement and acknowledge that global solutions are needed; the promises to increase funding to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to $ 25 million per annum, and to boost aid, including to countries of first asylum, are welcome and appropriate. Labor is also promising a bold step in monitoring the return of failed asylum seekers. Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock is correct when he argues that this will be difficult to implement but that does not mean that it should not be tried. For example, the UNHCR has long played a role in monitoring the return of ‘failed’ asylum seekers (as in the return to Vietnam of Indochinese boatpeople from camps in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong during the mid to late 1990 s). Labor will link aid with re-admission agreements: Labor will assist countries of first asylum with aid as part of a scheme of arrangements to facilitate return to such countries of secondary movers. This is a questionable use of the aid program and risks distortions in development spending as occurred under the so-called ‘Pacific solution’ where Nauru was rewarded for doing Australia’s bidding in locking up asylum seekers. Labor will broaden the role of the Ambassador for People Smuggling and mandate the Ambassador to work internationally to eradicate people trafficking. This is a welcome initiative. It should be backed up by a commitment by Labor to sign the relevant protocols of the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime which commit nations to offering protection to the victims of such crimes, for example so that victims of sexual slavery can testify against those who enslaved them. (Under current Australian law there is no such protection and women forced into sexual slavery in Australia are subject to being placed in immigration detention). Refugee intake Labor promises only to consider increasing Australia’s humanitarian program, but makes no firm commitment to lifting the intake. In fact it makes clear that any increase will be achieved within current immigration intake numbers - in other words, if Australia is to take more refugees, then it will take fewer skilled migrants or fewer family re-union migrants. An increased humanitarian intake is also made contingent on the extent that communities in regional Australia volunteer to have refugees resettled in their community although it does to provide extra resources to assist them to resettle refugees as part of their community. Bob Carr’s influence is apparent in the pledge that any increased intake of refugees will be part of Labor’s population dispersal policy designed to boost regional areas while taking the pressure off over-crowded places like the Sydney basin. Pacific solution Labor will end the processing of asylum seekers in Pacific Island countries, but use Christmas Island as the main processing centre instead. Christmas Island and other territories will remain excised from Australia’s migration zone. This means that asylum seekers held there would have no right to apply for refugee status under Australian law, nor to appeal negative decisions to the Refugee Review Tribunal. In other words, the so-called ‘Pacific solution’ becomes an ‘Indian Ocean solution’ - the only difference being that those found to be refugees under a Labor government would be settled in Australia immediately, rather than, as now, resettled only after months of fruitless searching by the Coalition government as it attempts to find another country willing to take them. Refugee Determination System Labor will abolish the Refugee Review Tribunal and give Australians a say in the determination of refugee claims by having a three person Refugee Status Determination Tribunal, with one <b>legally</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>member</b> and two members drawn from the community. This is a welcome reform, which promises a fairer, more independent review system than is currently available under the one-member RRT. However, there needs to be more detail about how appointments will be made, and for how long. Ideally the RSDT should be moved out of the immigration portfolio altogether and given to the Attorney General’s department to ensure that it really is independent of the Minister for Immigration. Labor opens up the prospect of one appeal from a Tribunal decision on points of law, which could be made to the Federal Magistrates Service. This is a limited re-introduction of some judicial oversight of the refugee determination process, which is the only way to ensure that decisions are just and lawful. However, this is highly conditional: firstly the appeal is by leave - in other words the Magistrate must agree to hear the case. Secondly, the appeal will only be granted if, in the opinion of the Court, the asylum seeker has done everything reasonably in his/her power to prepare for removal if the appeal is unsuccessful. This seems unreasonable and impractical. It is based on assumption that appeals are frivolous or vexatious, rather than a fundamental right under a system of law. It is also not clear how broad the grounds of appeal would be: unless the privative clause put in place by the current government (with Labor support) is revoked, then any appeal right is meaningless. And even before the privative clause, the previous Part 8 of the Migration Act ruled out any appeal against a Refugee Review Tribunal decision on the basis of a breach of ‘natural justice’ or ‘unreasonableness’. It barred appeals made on the basis that the tribunal took irrelevant considerations into account or failed to take relevant considerations into account. Neither could the court deal with allegations of ostensible bias or bad faith by the tribunal. Labor also promises that refugee claims which are manifestly unfounded will be placed on a special expedited decision making track by the Tribunal and disposed of quickly. This is a contentious area, since what is or is not manifestly unfounded is very hard to define. For example, the current Minister has ridiculed claims for asylum based on the experience of domestic violence; yet there is solid jurisprudence to support such claims in certain cases - where for example, state authorities or state laws fail to offer any form of protection against such violence and are more likely to blame the perpetrator than the victim (eg Pakistan). If claims really are manifestly unfounded then an effective and efficient system will deal with them quickly in any case. Labor promises to reform the system under which the Minister can intervene to grant a visa on compassionate grounds (under s 417 of the Migration Act). This is the only safety net in Australia’s refugee determination system to prevent the removal from Australia or people who are not refugees under the narrow definition of the 1951 Convention, but who are nevertheless at risk in their homeland. Labor promises to make the process transparent and ensure independent expert advice is obtained. This is an improvement but again it does not go far enough. It leaves Ministerial intervention on compassionate grounds at the end of the refugee determination system, meaning that an applicant must jump through all the bureaucratic and legal hoops, and tie up public resources before their case can be considered on compassionate grounds. What is needed is an alternative ‘humanitarian’ visa category that could be offered by Immigration department officials or Tribunal members up-front. Detention Labor has promised reforms to the detention system, including removing children from behind the razor wire (note - there is no razor wire at Baxter, only electric fences) returning management of detention to the public sector; ensuring that health services in detention are provided by independent medical professionals who will be free to speak out on issues; and granting media access to detention centres subject to agreed protocols. Labor has also promised to speed up processing so that 90 % of claims will be determined within 90 days. If a person is detained for more than 90 days, including on Christmas Island, then their case will be reviewed by an Asylum Seeker Claims Processing Review Committee. The case will be reviewed again after each subsequent month. This is an improvement and makes it less likely that people will be lost in the system for years at a time and could force action on cases of indefinite detention. However the Minister is not compelled to accept the Review Committee’s recommendations. (How often have we seen governments, Labor and Liberal, ignore the recommendations of HREOC, the Ombudsman and Senate Committees). Labor does promise to fund appropriate non-government agencies to provide case workers to work with asylum seekers to explain the process being undertaken and to manage expectations. Given that some element of detention is likely to remain in any system for managing asylum seekers, this is a welcome initiative that could help to achieve the return of non-refugees - that is ‘failed’ asylum seekers - under more dignified and humane conditions. Labor will remove responsibility for unaccompanied minors from the Immigration Minister and put them instead under the care of its proposed Children’s Commissioner. Labor will appoint an Inspector-General of Detention, an independent statutory office holder, who will hear and resolve complaints from detainees about detention conditions. Again, a much needed and welcome move. Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) Labor will keep TPVs but reform them. Labor will allow TPV holders to access settlement services including English language training and the Job Network. After the expiration of the short term TPV, Labor would grant permanent residence to refugees who still faced persecution in their homeland. This is an improvement on the current system, but the failure to define short term is a significant omission. The TPV system should have been scrapped altogether. THE CHANGES that Labor is offering show that the voices of disquiet within and outside the party about Australia’s treatment of asylum seekers and refugees are having some effect. The huge level of community activism on this issue has produced significant results - notably the belated commitment by Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock to make sure that unaccompanied minors are removed from detention and placed in foster care. His promise to extend the alternative detention arrangements for women and children first trialled at Woomera is also an important concession, even though those arrangements more closely resemble ‘house arrest’ than any form of ‘community release’. The detention of families and children has always been the weak-point in the government’s ‘democratic’ armour of majority support for the mandatory detention. Many of the Labor changes are welcome, but it is a bit like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. Labor may tinker with detention arrangements but if there are no boats arriving, then the only asylum seekers subject to mandatory detention on the mainland will be the few score who manage to slip past the Airline Liaison Officers with forged documents at foreign airports and reach Australia unlawfully by air. Political logic suggests that Labor will not move to rescind any of post-Tampa legislation that it supported in September 2001, in the dying days of the thirty-ninth parliament - not the tightened definition of a refugee in Australian law, not the bar on class actions, not the Border Protection legislation that empowers Australian military and customs officials to board boats, take over the helm and direct them elsewhere. The situation is not that different from November 1999, when Labor failed to use its numbers in the Senate to disallow the temporary protection visas; then, as now, Labor fears that such a stand would hand the Coalition a stick with which to beat it should any future boats arrive. The danger in this approach is that Labor will continue to see its support base erode, as more disenchanted voters shift their allegiance to the Greens. But Labor can countenance Green defections in safe seats. What it won’t risk is the loss of blue-collar votes to the Coalition in marginal electorates, which is what it fears would have happened if it offered a more fundamental policy change. Labor is probably right in that calculation - at least in terms of the next election. But the danger in its half-way approach is that it will satisfy no-one. Those who endorse a tough approach will stick with the Coalition, especially now that the Coalition has pinched key aspects of Labor policy in relation to women and children. On the other hand, as the resignation of Carmen Lawrence from the front bench indicates, Labor’s half-way approach will fail to win back Green defectors or to undo the perception that Labor has lost its idealism and its commitment to principle. There are many good initiatives in Labor’s policy, but Labor could have, and should have, gone further: 1. Labor should have promised to undo the excision of Xmas Island and other territories from the Migration Zone. Fiddling with Australia’s borders to deter asylum seekers is contrived and is a dubious approach to international law. 2. Labor should have scrapped the Temporary Protection Visa system altogether - it is cruel and as Labor acknowledges, counter-productive, since TPVs have actually encouraged people smuggling and unauthorised arrivals. 3. Labor should have taken up Carmen Lawrence’s suggestion of shifting from a policy of ‘mandatory detention’ to a policy of ‘mandatory processing’. 4. Labor should have promised to break the link between the ‘on shore’ and ‘off shore’ refugee intake. In other words, Australia’s commitment to resettling a certain number of people under the humanitarian component of the Migration program should be maintained regardless of fluctuations in the number of on-shore asylum seekers. Linking the two programs, as the current government has done, has been divisive and fostered resentment and antagonism towards asylum seekers and refugees. 5. Labor should have introduced a fall-back humanitarian visa category that can be introduced at any stage of the refugee determination system, to provide a safety net for those who are not refugees under the Convention, but who are nevertheless at risk. 6. Labor should have restored judicial oversight over the refugee determination system.
