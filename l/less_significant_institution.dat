40|$|Purpose - External and {{internal}} pressures are undermining the traditional bond between <b>Less</b> <b>Significant</b> Financial <b>Institutions</b> (LSFIs) and their local markets. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the impacts of service quality, motivation, satisfaction, and perceived value on customers’ behavioral intentions in LSFIs. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework of the relationship, either direct or indirect, between service quality, basic motivational determinants in consumers’ bank selection, satisfaction, and repurchase intentions of the customers is developed. The framework is tested with data from a sample of 600 customers of LSFIs in Italy. The hypotheses were tested with Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) techniques. Findings – Consumers’ decision-making process is a complex path and a more holistic view of its determinants should be considered to face those weaknesses that negatively affect a balanced management of LSFIs in the future. Research limitations/implications - The study is focused on a specific context, the Italian LSFIs’ sector, and results from other countries or other banking sectors should be added before a generalization of the findings can be made. Practical implications - The findings will be useful to policy makers and banks to improve strategies for enhancing customer satisfaction and purchase intentions in LSFIs. Adopting a simultaneous, holistic, and multivariate approach can also help LSFIs to better understand which are the main factors able to increase consumers’ purchase intentions. Originality/value - This is the first study to examine customers’ behavioral intentions in LSFIs even if they represent about 96...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{anisotropic}} {{effects on}} the mechanical response of AZ 31 B sheet at high strain rates have been analyzed. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} stress-strain behaviour of the alloy is highly anisotropic and rate sensitive. However, anisotropy of the mechanical properties of the alloy is <b>less</b> <b>significant</b> at higher strain rates. Under tensile loading, the anisotropic behaviour of the alloy is <b>less</b> <b>significant</b> as compare to its behaviour under compression. In both compression and tensile loading the alloy shows significant rate sensitivity as compare to quasi-static strain rates but at higher rates it is <b>less</b> <b>significant.</b> The maximum stress is observed to reach nearly 600 MPa for transverse direction impact. The tension-compression asymmetry is observed in the alloy...|$|R
