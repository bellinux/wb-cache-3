5|$|Poppaea now plans some deceit of her own, in {{an effort}} to divert Claudius's wrath from Otho with whom she has now reconciled. She hides Otho in her bedroom with {{instructions}} to <b>listen</b> <b>carefully.</b> Soon Nero arrives to press his love on her ("Coll'ardor del tuo bel core"), but she tricks him into hiding as well. Then Claudius enters; Poppaea tells him that he had earlier misunderstood her: it was not Otho but Nero who had ordered her to reject Claudius. To prove her point she asks Claudius to pretend to leave, then she summons Nero who, thinking Claudius has gone, resumes his passionate wooing of Poppaea. Claudius suddenly reappears and angrily dismisses the crestfallen Nero. After Claudius departs, Poppaea brings Otho out of hiding and the two express their everlasting love in separate arias.|$|E

Hagen {{goes on to say that}} in addition to being influenced by rich literary form, Angelou has also been influenced by oral traditions. In Caged Bird, Mrs. Flowers encourages her to <b>listen</b> <b>carefully</b> to [...] "Mother Wit", which Hagen defines as the collective wisdom of the African-American community as expressed in folklore and humor.|$|E

According to Niketas Choniates, a {{historian}} of Byzantium, Manuel was chosen over his elder surviving brother {{because of his}} ability to <b>listen</b> <b>carefully</b> to advice. Manuel was known for his lively and charismatic personality; he was known for his love for all things from Western Europe. Manuel arranged jousting matches, even participating in them, an unusual experience for the Byzantines. [...] Manuel himself is generally considered the most brilliant of the four emperors of the Komnenos dynasty; unusual for a Byzantine ruler, his reputation was particularly good in the west and the Crusader states, especially after his death. The Latin historian William of Tyre described Manuel as [...] "beloved of God... a great-souled man of incomparable energy", [...] "memory will ever be held in benediction". Manuel was further extolled by Robert of Clari as a [...] "generous and worthy man".|$|E
500|$|From August 6, 1995, to September 2, 1995, Nintendo, in {{collaboration}} with the St.GIGA satellite radio network, began broadcasts of a substantially different version of the original The Hyrule Fantasy: Legend of Zelda for a Super Famicom peripheral, the Satellaview—a satellite modem add-on. The game, titled , was released for download in four episodic, weekly installments which were rebroadcast at least four times between the game's 1995 premier and January 1997. BS Zelda was the first Satellaview game to feature a [...] "SoundLink" [...] soundtrack—a streaming audio track through which, every few minutes, players were cautioned to <b>listen</b> <b>carefully</b> as a voice actor narrator, broadcasting live from the St.GIGA studio, would give them plot and gameplay clues. In addition to the SoundLink elements, BS Zelda also featured updated 16-bit graphics, a smaller overworld, and different dungeons. Link was replaced by one of the two Satellaview avatars: a boy wearing a backward baseball cap or a girl with red hair.|$|E

The singer would usually show up at the concert venue at the last minute, walk out on stage and start to sing, having never heard the sound system.

2500|$|With the {{commencement}} of hearings {{in the case of}} Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services (Case #98-916V), the argument over whether autism is a vaccine injury moved into the vaccine court. [...] A panel of three special masters began hearing the first cases of the historic Omnibus Autism Proceedings in June 2007. There were six test cases in all, and the entire record of the cases is publicly available. The lead petitioners, the parents of Michelle Cedillo, claimed that Michelle's autism was caused by a vaccine. Theresa and Michael Cedillo contended that thiomersal seriously weakened Michelle's immune system and prevented her body from clearing the measles virus after her vaccination at the age of fifteen months. At the outset Special Master George Hastings, Jr. said [...] "Clearly the story of Michelle's life is a tragic one," [...] while pledging to <b>listen</b> <b>carefully</b> to the evidence. On February 12, 2009, the court ruled in three test cases that the combination of the MMR vaccine and thiomersal-containing vaccines were not to blame for autism. Hastings concluded in his decision, [...] "Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment." [...] The ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and upheld.|$|E

2500|$|Modern-day {{critics have}} {{received}} the Madetoja revival with enthusiasm. The American Record Guide's Tom Godell, for example, has applauded the recording efforts of both Volmer and Sakari, in particular praising Madetoja for his [...] "beautiful, swirling rainbows of vivid [...] color" [...] and his [...] "uncanny ability to instantly establish a mood or rapidly sketch vast, ice-covered landscapes". Writing for the same magazine, William Trotter reviews Volmer's [...] "absorbing" [...] five-volume set, pronouncing Madetoja a [...] "first-rate composer, touched sometimes with genius … who had to wait a long, long time before his work could emerge from under the dominating shadow of his teacher's [...] seven symphonies". Reviewing the Ondine song collection for Fanfare, Jerry Dubins notes music's nuanced emotional range, as Madetoja achieves [...] "moments of soaring ecstasy and searing pain", but without recourse to [...] "sentimental" [...] or [...] "cloying" [...] ornamentation. [...] "It is, quite simply", Dubins continues, [...] "some of the most gorgeous song-writing I have encountered {{in a very long}} time". Similarly, the American Record Guide's Carl Bauman has kind words for the Rannali interpretations of Madetoja's [...] "carefully written and polished ... unique" [...] solo piano miniatures, but in an echo of Parland, notes that Madetoja's [...] "natural, unpretentious tone" [...] means that [...] "one has to <b>listen</b> <b>carefully</b> in order to fully appreciate Madetoja's genius". A notable detractor in the sea of praise, however, has been Donald Vroon, chief editor of the American Record Guide. Arguing that Madetoja's three symphonies [...] "reflect the influences of Sibelius—but … without his blazing inspiration", Vroon describes Madetoja's music as [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "brooding … very Nordic, maybe written in winter when the sun is seldom seen". He concludes, [...] "I can't imagine anyone being thrilled by them [...] or considering Madetoja a great discovery".|$|E
