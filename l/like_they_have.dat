5|$|The Aristotle project, a multi-year {{initiative}} by Google Inc. {{aimed at}} defining {{the characteristics of}} an ideal team in the workplace, has found somewhat similar conditions for group effectiveness. They found that by far, most important factor is psychological safety. The other key factors in productivity are dependability, structure and clarity, personal meaning, and each team member feeling <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> an impact.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E

5000|$|... in 2004 White Hills had {{finished}} in {{second in the}} HDFL and had {{looked like it was}} going to win another premiership after a pretty long Final drought however they fell short to Colbinabbin who had won the flag three times in a row. But they were looking to get back up their in the next season (2005) but unfortunately fell short again and it looked <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> rejuvenated the squad again and was looking <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> their finals hopes up, but they haven't been the same since those early days in 1988.|$|R
5|$|The diet of {{the bird}} can be varied. They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy {{material}} that they find on the ground on in trees and shrubs. Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites, butterflies and other insects. They also eat nectar from flowers. One notable aspect of their feeding habits {{is the way they}} hunt flying insects, which is done by picking them up on their wing. They do, however, also eat their prey from the ground, and they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey, such as utility lines and the <b>like.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism, working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey. Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds, as is cooperative kleptoparasitsim in general.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening.|$|E
25|$|Binge eating {{disorder}} is an {{eating disorder}} characterized by frequent and recurrent binge eating episodes with associated negative psychological and social problems, but without subsequent purging episodes (e.g. vomiting). People who have this disorder can experience an uncontrollable urge to consume large amounts of food {{regardless of whether or}} not they are hungry and can feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no control while they are eating.|$|E
50|$|The rural {{constitution}} of 1946 {{as well as}} the Saxon {{constitution of}} 1947 established democratic values in Saxony again, <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> existed before the beginning of the Third Reich.|$|R
50|$|All of the contraptions {{were created}} using objects that might {{actually}} be found in an abandoned hotel, and {{in such a way}} that <b>they</b> looked <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been created by a gifted 13-year-old boy.|$|R

25|$|Some {{producers}} also {{profit from}} the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{control over their own}} lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.|$|E
25|$|Restless leg {{syndrome}} is a disorder in which patients feel uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs. These sensations usually {{occur in the}} evening, while the patient is sitting or lying down and relaxing. Patients feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to move their legs to relieve the sensations, and walking generally makes the symptoms disappear. In many patients, {{this can lead to}} insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. This is a very common problem and can occur at any age.|$|E
25|$|In the White House, President Lancelot R. Gilligrass, Vice President Elvira Tibbs, the president's best friend, chiefs, and the U.S. Cabinet see the Elevator {{dock with}} the Space Hotel, and fear it {{contains}} hostile agents {{of a foreign}} or extraterrestrial government, while the space shuttle containing the hotel staff and three astronauts approaches the Space Hotel. On the Hotel, Wonka and the others hear the President address them across a radio link as Martians, and Wonka therefore teases Gilligrass with nonsense words and grotesque poetry. In the midst of this, the hotel's own elevators open, revealing five gigantic amoeba-like monsters, which change shape: each forming a letter of the word 'SCRAM'. Recognising the danger, Mr. Wonka orders everybody off the Space Hotel. These shape-changers, Mr. Wonka tells the others, are predatory extraterrestrials called Vermicious Knids, waiting in the Space Hotel to consume its staff and guests. Mr. Wonka also explains that the Knids have tried to invade Earth and consume its inhabitants <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> done with many other planets but are always incinerated because of the atmosphere protecting the planet.|$|E

6000|$|One day the Warreners were strolling {{together}} through the town, {{and turned off}} from the more frequented streets, {{with a view of}} seeing what the lower-class quarters were <b>like.</b> <b>They</b> <b>had</b> gone some distance, when Ned said: ...|$|R
5000|$|NBC's White House {{correspondent}} Chuck Todd: [...] "It didnâ€™t seem <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a {{sense of}} urgency about it, a real sense of outrage," [...] and further; [...] "This is outrageous no matter what political party you are." ...|$|R
500|$|Kapoor often {{speaks of}} {{removing}} both {{the signature of}} the artist from his works {{as well as any}} traces of their fabrication, or what he refers to as [...] "traces of the hand". He aspires to make his works look <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> independent realities that he reveals rather than creates. For him, removing all the seams from Cloud Gate was necessary {{in order to make the}} sculpture seem as though it was [...] "perfect" [...] and ready-made. These effects increase the viewer's fascination with it and makes them wonder what it is and where it came from. His attempts to hide his works' seams as an artist stand in contrast to Frank Gehry's architectural designs in the park, Jay Pritzker Pavilion and BP Pedestrian Bridge, which display their seams prominently.|$|E
500|$|Michigan's defense forced three turnovers, sacked the Illinois quarterback four times, {{and held}} Illinois' offense to 37 rushing yards on 33 {{attempts}} {{for an average}} of 1.1 yards per carry. Mike Martin led the defense with nine tackles. After the game, Michigan's defensive coordinator Greg Mattison became emotional as he told reporters: [...] "That was a Michigan defense. ... Nobody knows what went on inside of these guys and for them to stick together and to play like they played tonight, and <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> tried in every game, it says a lot about them." [...] Defensive end Ryan Van Bergen, who recorded 2.5 sacks, three tackles for loss and seven tackles overall, was named the Big Ten's Co-Defensive Player of the Week. Toussaint's 65-yard touchdown run and his total of 192 rushing yards were career highs.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} other main games in the Dragon Quest series, Dragon Quest IIIs {{scenario}} was designed by Yuji Horii, whereas the artwork was done by Akira Toriyama, of Dragon Ball fame. Koichi Sugiyama composed all the music for Dragon Quest III. Chunsoft president [...] Koichi Nakamura, co-creator of Dragon Quest, stated he contributed about [...] "10%" [...] of the games programming. The game was released {{a year after the}} original, a longer period of development than its predecessor, and reflected the ever-lengthening game development process of the series. Yuji Horii, in a 1989 interview, said that developers had perfected the series' game structure in Dragon Quest III, and this was reflected by the transition from one character's quest to a party of heroes. The password system used on the first two Dragon Quest titles was dropped in favor of a save slot due in part to Horii's dislike of the long codes that players needed to memorize or record [...] Horii had a policy of removing any features from his games that had been used elsewhere, {{which turned out to be}} unworkable during Dragon Quest IIIs development when the game's world map concept was used first by another game maker in Mirai Shinwa Jarvas, but Horii's team was too far into development to change anything. Horii also preferred a silent protagonist to make the player feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> become the main character, but at one point in the story, Horii was forced to make the hero shout, [...] "Leave him to us! Run! Quick!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Participles {{were given}} the name [...] metokhá¸— [...] "sharing" [...] by Greek grammarians, because they share the {{characteristics}} of both adjectives and verbs. <b>Like</b> adjectives, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> gender, case, and number and agree with the nouns that <b>they</b> modify, and, <b>like</b> verbs, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> tense and voice.|$|R
50|$|However, the Redskin offense {{began to}} click upon Williams's return with 14:17 {{left in the}} second quarter, and much <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{in the second half}} of Super Bowl XXI against the New York Giants, the Bronco defense seemed to collapse.|$|R
5000|$|There were no agreed {{safeguards}} against consultations {{being used}} cynically by decision-makers {{to make it}} look <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> sought to canvass other opinions, while in fact having set a new policy in place even before it asked the question.|$|R
2500|$|Stan Freberg {{created a}} brief audio skit {{entitled}} [...] "The Honeyearthers," [...] in which Ralph, Alice, Norton and Trixie are aliens {{living on the}} moon. In keeping with 1950s ideas of what aliens would look <b>like,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> three feet, one eye, and antennae. [...] Ralph drives a rocket ship and Norton works in a [...] "green cheese mine." [...] At {{the end of the}} skit, Ralph offers to take Alice on a [...] "honeyearth" [...] to renew their marriage.|$|E
2500|$|Babies can {{recognize}} their mother's voice from {{as early as}} few weeks old. It seems <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a unique system {{that is designed to}} recognize speech sound. Furthermore, they can differentiate between certain speech sounds. [...] A significant first milestone in phonetic development is the babbling stage (around the age of six months). This is the baby's way of practicing his control over that apparatus. Babbling is independent from the language. [...] Deaf children for instance, babble the same way as hearing ones.|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian {{wrote that}} WikiLeaks, had along with {{individuals}} and groups on the hard right, {{been involved in the}} [...] "ruthlessÂ exploitation of [...] deathÂ for political purposes". The executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, an organization that advocates for open government, was critical of Wikileaks' fueling of conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich: [...] "On the death of staffer, thatâ€™s just to me so far over the line... If they feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a link to the staffer's death, they should say it and be responsible about it. The insinuations, to me, are just disgusting." ...|$|E
60|$|The company yawned all {{together}} and betook themselves to an aimless investigation of all Hummil's possessions,--guns, tattered novels, saddlery, spurs, and the <b>like.</b> <b>They</b> <b>had</b> fingered them a score of times before, but there was really nothing else to do.|$|R
5000|$|Bill {{was called}} before Huber, who then {{thought he was}} going home. It was then {{revealed}} that he was being [...] "rescued" [...] by the judges <b>liked</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> rescued the dogs at the animal shelter by helping them find new homes.|$|R
50|$|With these {{regulations}} in place, {{the tobacco industry}} could no longer directly market cigarettes to women as weight loss aids <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> in the past. Rather, they would come to rely upon more subversive forms of marketing to target womenâ€™s concerns with weight management.|$|R
2500|$|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a {{cognitive}} disorder, which comes about after overcoming a traumatic event. [...] It is a disease, which is extremely common to those {{participating in a}} sport at an elite level. When these athletes feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{come to the end}} of their journey as an athlete, and then try and slot themselves back into mainstream society, or after they have had to overcome a large hurdle within their chosen sport. These athletes develop feelings of alienation, depression, flashbacks or hyperarousal, and generally become evident after a couple of months after stopping or after the specific event has concluded.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, {{there seems}} to be bands that appear to be more lighthearted and less {{concerned}} over being described as deathcore. Scott Lewis of the San Diego-based deathcore band Carnifex started [...] "We're not one of those bands trying to escape the banner of deathcore. I know a lot of bands try and act <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a big problem with that, but if you listen to their music, they are very 'deathcore.' I {{know that there is a}} lot of resentment towards deathcore and kind of younger bands." [...] Also in a 2012 interview with Chelsea Grin, guitarist Jake Harmond said: [...] "Everyone likes to flap their jaw and voice their own opinion how 'embarrassing' it is to be in a band that can be labeled 'deathcore,' but honestly we have never given a fuck." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{broader context}} of the talks {{remained}} confused. The government of Southern Sudan views the talks {{as a means of}} ridding itself of a foreign army that is complicating their delicate relationship with the Khartoum government. The request by the Ugandan Government for ICC to suspend war crimes indictments against leaders of the LRA, condemned by international human rights groups but largely supported by leaders and civilians within northern Uganda, led some political analysts to see Ugandan Government's request as a ploy to gain local support. [...] The comment of a George Olara, an IDP living in a camp in Pader, was fairly typical: [...] "He [...] should not be taken to The Hague. Let him come back and live with the community because this is how reconciliation will be achieved. ... Peace will come if the talks succeed, but there is the potential that they may also fail <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> done before".|$|E
5000|$|Serbs (and Montenegrins) {{have lived}} in Alaska since the {{earliest}} days of American settlement in the 19th century. Many Serbs came in the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890s to seek fortune, just <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> done in the earlier California Gold Rush.|$|R
