25|$|Hedge fund legal {{structures}} {{vary depending}} on location and the investor(s). US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies.</b> Limited partnerships and other flow-through taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds {{are not subject to}} both entity-level and personal-level taxation. A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner. The general partner may be an individual or a corporation. The general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership, and has unlimited liability. The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions. Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests. As an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement, U.S. domestic hedge funds may be structured as <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies,</b> with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability.|$|E

25|$|Singapore {{took the}} step of nationalising {{companies}} {{that would not}} survive on their own, or could otherwise be detrimental for Singapore {{if they were not}} closely in line with government policy because they were a public service. Singapore Power, Public Utilities Board, SingTel and Singapore Airlines (SIA) are prominent examples. Such companies that were nationalized were often infrastructure or utility companies, companies meant to lay out services such as electricity or transport for the benefit of other companies. The extension of power infrastructure, for example, led to an increased attraction of foreign investors. Recently, the government has taken steps to privatize these previous monopolies - SingTel and Singapore Airlines are now publicly listed, <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies,</b> even though the government still holds large shares in them.|$|E

The Panic created financial difficulties for the company, and it floated bonds to stay alive. J.

The company took its name from J.
