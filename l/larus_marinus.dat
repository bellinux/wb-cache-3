5|$|The {{island has}} a {{significant}} breeding colony of over 4,000 pairs of lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus), 400 pairs of herring gulls (Larus argentatus), 2pairs of great black-backed gulls (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus)</b> and varying numbers of common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopodidae). The feeding habits of lesser black-backed gulls were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus),</b> the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E
5|$|Behind fish, {{the next}} most {{significant}} prey base for bald eagles are other waterbirds. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface. Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7% to 80% of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities. Exceptionally, in the Greater Yellowstone area, birds were eaten as regularly as fish year-around, with both prey groups comprising 43% of the studied dietary intake. Preferred avian prey includes grebes, alcids, ducks, gulls, coots, herons, egrets, and geese. Bird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium-sized, such as western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American coots (Fulica americana) as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with. American herring gull (Larus smithsonianus) are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior. Larger waterbirds are occasionally prey as well, with wintering emperor geese (Chen canagica) and snow geese (C. caerulescens), which gather in large groups, sometimes becoming regular prey. Other large waterbirds hunted at least occasionally by bald eagles have included common loons (Gavis immer), great black-backed gulls (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus),</b> sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), great blue herons (Ardea herodias), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), and fledging American white pelicans (P. erythrorhynchos). Colony nesting seabirds, such as alcids, storm petrels, cormorants, northern gannets (Morus bassanus), terns and gulls, may be especially vulnerable to predation. Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and can effectively cull large portions of a colony.|$|E

Another common predator of the Grass Grub is the Hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus whose intake of Grass Grub can be up to 40% of the total diet of an adult hedgehog. There are few invertebrate predators but they are not common in pastures.|$|E

5000|$|Guther's (or Gunther's) (Goothow, channels) (...) , is a {{small island}} which lies {{on the western side}} of the Eastern Isles and south of St Martin's. It has limited {{vegetation}} consisting of grass, docks and sea beet. Greater black-backed (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus)</b> and herring gulls (L. argentatus) nest as do common shags.|$|E
50|$|Cooper (2006) {{recorded}} a few {{great black-backed gull}} (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus)</b> nesting, a scattering of herring gull (Larus argentatus) and an overflow colony of kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) on the eastern cliffs, while Parslow (2007) records a large colony of lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) and a small colony of puffin (Fratercula arctica). The Seabird 2000 breeding seabird survey recorded five occupied nests of Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus).|$|E
5000|$|The {{great black-backed gull}} was one of {{the many}} species {{originally}} described by Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, Systema Naturae, and it still bears its original name of <b>Larus</b> <b>marinus.</b> The scientific name is from Latin. Larus appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific name marinus means [...] "marine". This predates Linnean taxonomy, as it had been called Larus ingens marinus by Carolus Clusius.|$|E
50|$|The {{great black-backed gull}} (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus),</b> {{also known}} as the greater black-backed gull, is the largest member of the gull family. It breeds on the European and North American coasts and islands of the North Atlantic and is fairly sedentary, though some move farther south or inland to large lakes or reservoirs. The adult great black-backed gull has a white head, neck and underparts, dark grey wings and back, pink legs and yellow bill.|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} a {{significant}} breeding colony of over 4,000 pairs of lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus), 400 pairs of herring gulls (Larus argentatus), 2 pairs of great black-backed gulls (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus)</b> and varying numbers of common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopodidae). The feeding habits of lesser black-backed gulls were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.|$|E
5000|$|The {{islands are}} largely managed as nature {{reserves}} by the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust, principally for breeding seabirds and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). There are eleven species of breeding seabirds with the European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and European storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) of national importance. The other species are kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), razorbill (Alca torda), guillemot (Uria aalge), cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), puffin (Fratercula arctica), {{great black-backed gull}} (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus),</b> lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) and herring gull (Larus argentatus).|$|E
50|$|Under the 1992 bird count {{there were}} 40,140 {{breeding}} pairs of guillemot (Uria aalge), representing at least 1.8 {{percent of this}} breeding East Atlantic seabird population. Smaller numbers of other seabirds nest at Fowlsheugh, including Atlantic puffin (Fratercula Arctica), razorbill (Alca torda), herring gull (Larus argentatus), and fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis). Occasionally a peregrine falcon disturbs nesting kittiwakes as it swoops by the cliff edges. Lesser numbers of lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), great black-backed gull (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus)</b> and common shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) are also to be found.|$|E
50|$|The SSSI {{citation}} lists five {{species of}} breeding birds {{on the island}} including the Puffin (Fratercula arctica). Other breeding seabirds are the Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus) and {{a small number of}} Greater Black-backed Gull (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus).</b> The seabird breeding colonies are in decline on the Isles of Scilly and in the years 2006-09 the Kittiwake has failed to breed on all the islands bar one chick raised on St Agnes in 2009. Of the species listed above, none have been recorded as breeding on Teän in 2009.|$|E

50|$|Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) {{and great}} black-backed gulls (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus)</b> {{are the most}} common gull species sighted on the refuge. They {{frequent}} all divisions throughout the year, but are most abundant in the autumn and winter when they roost on the marsh and tidal flats, and occasionally steal food from diving ducks in tidal creeks. Ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) also are common throughout the refuge, particularly during non-breeding season. During autumn and winter migration, Bonaparte's gulls (Larus philadelphia) feed and roost at the mouths of tidal creeks and rivers throughout the refuge, but they are most abundant on the Biddeford Pool, Upper Wells, and Lower Wells divisions.|$|E
50|$|Annet is {{considered}} to be of outstanding importance as a seabird colony. Twelve species nest here, of which two, European storm-petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) and lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) have nationally important breeding populations. The storm-petrel breeds amongst the boulders of the more stable storm beaches. The largest population of Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) in the islands breed here and the other annual breeding species are puffin (Fratercula arctica), greater black-backed gull (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus),</b> razorbill (Alca torda), kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), herring gull (L. argentatus) and shag (P. aristotelis). Common tern (Sterna hirundo) breed on the island most years as do cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and very rarely Arctic tern (S. paradisaea).|$|E

50|$|The refuge is {{home for}} {{to a wide}} array of bird species that either use the islands as nesting grounds or as a place of shelter. The great black-backed gull (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus)</b> is known to have a small {{breeding}} colony on Gravel Island, and historically on Spider Island. In 1994 the species was discovered on Spider Island, making it the westernmost breeding on record at the time. Large colonies of herring gulls (Larus smithsonianus) and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) are found on both islands, while a colony of Caspian terns (Sterna caspia) can be found on Gravel Island. Scattered populations of waterfowl nest on Spider Island; these include the Canada goose (Branta canadensis), American black duck (Anas rubripes) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).|$|E
50|$|The {{island was}} formed 350 million years ago, {{in a fashion}} similar to the mid-Atlantic ridge today, where lava flows from a split in the earth's crust, and cools rapidly to form large lumps known as pillow lava. Mullion Island was formed by a separtate (later) {{volcanic}} episode than the nearby Lizard complex rocks. The soil is highly manured by bird droppngs, rich in nitrogen and phosphate, and sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp maritima) and tree mallow (Lavatera arborea) are the dominate plants. Great black-backed gull (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus)</b> breed on the island, along with common guillemot (Uria aalge), Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) and possibly razorbill (Alca torda). European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) were also on the island during a visit by West Cornwall Ringing Group on 16 June 2015.|$|E
50|$|Mincarlo is {{the southernmost}} {{of the group}} 2 km west of Samson. Several species nest on the island {{including}} the largest breeding colony of Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) in the Isles of Scilly as well as Puffin, Great Black-backed Gull (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus),</b> Razorbill (Alca torda) and Common Shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis). The breeding colony of European Storm-petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) occupied 17 sites during the Seabird 2000 survey. Tree mallow, orache, common scurveygrass, rock sea-spurrey and sea beet have all been recorded. The rocks are a main pupping site for grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). The Arachnologist, W S Bristow visited the Isles of Scilly in 1928, 1929 and 1934 and landed {{on many of the}} uninhabited islands. On Mincarlo he recorded the following spiders; Trochosa terricola, Oedothorax fuscus, Lepthyphantes tenuis, Dismodicus bifrons, Xysticus kochi and Halorates reprobus which is associated with the nests of seabirds, especially cormorant and shag.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{southern}} part of the island large colonies of lesser black-blacked (Larus fuscus graellsii) and herring gull (Larus argentatus) breed, as do a small number of greater black-backed gull (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus).</b> Storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) and kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) no longer breed there. To protect and enhance the islands' seabirds, and to protect Annet (an important breeding site) from re-invasion, a feasibility study was carried out to see if it was possible to eradicate rats from the Isles of Scilly. A winter trapping survey on St Agnes and Gugh indicated that those islands had a population of 3,300 brown rats. It was found the rats foraged on a variety of food including Scilly shrew which were found in the stomach contents of 18% of the rats trapped. Furthermore, numbers of the shrew were higher in areas where the rats were controlled; an indication that rats are having an effect on their numbers. The survey showed that it was both feasible, and there are significant benefits, to remove the rats as they are preventing Manx shearwater and storm petrel from establishing on St Agnes and Gugh.|$|E
50|$|During {{the winter}} large flocks {{can be seen}} at (snow free) fields (agricultural or grass). Especially if the ground has a high degree of moisture. At first sight it appears that the birds are just {{standing}} there, but in a pair of binoculars it becomes evident that only their body is not moving - while the birds actually are trampling the soil, most likely in order to trick worms to crawl closer {{to the surface of the}} soil.During early spring and late autumn many herring gulls feed heavily on earthworms, but it is a very opportunistic bird that seems to have many sources of food. For instance in southern Scandinavia and Northern Germany this species has during the 20th century become the most common of all gulls, and the increase has mostly occurred in urban or semi-urban environments. The great black-backed gull (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus)</b> was around 1900 as common as the herring gull in the mentioned parts, but has not increased at all so much (if at all). There are though some signs of that the bigger gull has learned (adopted) some of the herring gull's behaviour within urban environments. Where the herring gull is breeding in coastal urban environment, the great black-backed gull seems to do the same, but in a far minor scale.|$|E
50|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (<b>Larus</b> <b>marinus),</b> the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground.
