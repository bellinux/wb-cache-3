50|$|A {{significant}} {{advance in}} construction techniques {{was developed by}} naval architect Albert Percy Cole. Instead of going for transverse frame sections which were unnecessarily strong, but held together by weak <b>longitudinals,</b> Cole went for extra strong <b>longitudinals</b> and weaker transverse frames.|$|R
50|$|Sculpture : {{there are}} about 45 <b>longitudinals.</b> These are hair-like, {{strongly}} sinuated, flexuous, for they advance markedly at the periphery, where they are each ornamented by an elongated curved tubercle, and on the base they again retreat so as to form a sinus. On the earlier whorls these <b>longitudinals</b> are much more distinct than on the later, and each starts from a little bead, which lie close to the suture, but these beads are very feeble on the body whorl. In the intervals of the <b>longitudinals</b> and parallel to them are very faint growth lines.|$|R

50|$|Sculpture: Longitudinals—the whole {{surface is}} covered with strong, puckered, oblique lines of growth, which are {{sharp-edged}} but flattened,. They are rather regular, with many minuter ones in the intervals. The <b>longitudinals</b> are crosshatched with spirals, which are stronger and more regular, but not perfectly uniform. They consist of square threads and furrows of equal breadth, and both scored by the <b>longitudinals.</b> On the earlier whorls these spirals disappear before the <b>longitudinals</b> do. And {{on the base of}} the shell they become on the outside feebler, closer, and finer, in the middle broader and flatter, and stronger again toward the centre of the shell.|$|R

5|$|A new {{construction}} technique {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the <b>longitudinal</b> ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E

5|$|One type of {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. This is good for <b>longitudinal</b> modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a <b>longitudinal</b> motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E
