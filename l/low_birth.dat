50|$|According to the 2011 Census, the Thiruvalla taluk {{is having}} the <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> rate and the Tirurangadi taluk {{is having the}} highest birth rate.|$|R
50|$|According to the CIA's The World Factbook, {{the country}} with the highest birth rate is Niger (at 51.26 births per 1,000 people). The country with the <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> rate is Monaco, at 6.72 births per thousand.|$|R
5|$|The {{red panda}} has a {{naturally}} <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> rate (usually one single or twin birth per year), {{and a high}} death rate in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Sperm whales {{can live}} 70 years or more. They are {{a prime example}} of a species that has been K-selected, meaning their {{reproductive}} strategy is associated with stable environmental conditions and comprises a <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> rate, significant parental aid to offspring, slow maturation, and high longevity.|$|E
5|$|Teenage pregnancies, {{especially}} among younger teens, are {{at greater risk}} of adverse outcomes including early birth, <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight, and death of the infant. In the United States 82% of pregnancies in those between 15 and 19 are unplanned. Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control are effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in this age group.|$|E
50|$|In general, Sardinia {{represents}} the Italian region {{with the lowest}} fertility rate (1.087 births per woman), and the region with the second <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> rate. These factors result positive towards {{the preservation of the}} natural environment.|$|R
25|$|Sociologist Phil Zuckerman's global {{studies on}} atheism have {{indicated}} that global atheism may be in decline due to irreligious countries having the <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> rates {{in the world and}} religious countries having higher birth rates in general.|$|R
50|$|After German reunification Saxony faced a {{significant}} population decrease. Since 1990 Chemnitz has {{lost more than}} 20 percent of its inhabitants. In 2006 the BBC reported the city of Chemnitz had the <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> rate in the world.|$|R
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of {{retinopathy of prematurity}} in infants is typically suggested by the clinical setting. Prematurity, <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight {{and a history of}} oxygen exposure are the principal indicators, while no hereditary factors have been shown to yield a pattern.|$|E
5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight, and problems with development during childhood. Lead is able {{to pass through the}} placenta and into breast milk, and {{blood lead level}}s in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2006–08 American Community Survey, 48.7% of New Englanders {{were male}} and 51.3% were female. Approximately 22.4% of the {{population}} were under 18 years of age; 13.5% were over 65 years of age. The six states of New England have the <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> rate in the U.S.|$|R

50|$|Currently, Spain {{has one of}} the <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> and {{fertility}} rates in the world, up to the point of heavily hampering the population replacement rates. One or two children families are pretty common, and the age of parents has been increasing. Only immigration can balance such a situation, simultaneously incorporating new values and lifestyles in the Spanish society.|$|R
5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} has {{not been}} seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{two billion}} {{people in the}} {{developing}} world are deficient in zinc. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many {{in the developing world}} have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
40|$|The {{oral cavity}} {{is the site}} of much {{infectious}} and inflammatory disease which has been associated with systemic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and pre-term <b>low</b> <b>births.</b> This article emphasizes on the oral-systemic disease connection which is now a rapidly advancing area of research. The possible systemic diseases which arise from oral microorganisms are hereby focused...|$|R
50|$|The {{average size}} of a family in Shanghai {{declined}} to fewer than three people during the 1990s, {{and it is clear}} that most of Shanghai’s population growth is driven by migration rather than natural factors based on high birth and fertility rates. Shanghai has for many years had the <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> rate in China, a rate lower than large American cities such as New York.|$|R
50|$|For {{the period}} between 2005 and 2010, El Salvador had the third <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> rate in Central America, with 22.8 births per 1,000. However, during the same period, it had the highest death rate in Central America, 5.9 deaths per 1,000. According {{to the most recent}} United Nations survey, life {{expectancy}} for men was 68 years and 74 years for women. Healthy life expectancy was 57 for males and 62 for females in 2003.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight. In addition, more women are waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
25|$|Currently, Spain {{has one of}} the <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> and {{fertility}} rates in the world, up to the point of heavily hampering the population replacement rates. One or two children families are most common, and the age of parents has been increasing. Only immigration can balance such a situation, simultaneously incorporating new values and lifestyles in the Spanish society. As of 2015, the total fertility rate in Spain was 1.49 children/born per woman, which is below the replacement rate.|$|R

30|$|As {{a result}} of these {{challenges}} and inefficiencies, cooperation and integration of ECEC emerged as the top priority policy tasks to boost efficiency of ECEC policy for young children, though initial discussion on the topic of service integration failed to progress in the mid 1990 s. ECEC integration has become ever more critical to efficiently expend the expanded ECEC budget because the ECEC budget in Korea is expected to rise continuously even amid the world’s <b>lowest</b> <b>birth</b> rate.|$|R
5|$|When {{warfarin}} (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) {{is given}} {{during the first}} trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, scoliosis, and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> weight and developmental disabilities.|$|E
5|$|During the {{criminal}} trial, {{all the major}} figures in the case were called on to give evidence. Le Gris and Carrouges began proceedings and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite {{and at least one}} of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel. As people of <b>low</b> <b>birth,</b> Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test the veracity of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion. Le Gris' case involved several strategies; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges' infamous temper and describing the case against him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations. Le Gris then provided alibis for the entire week in question, establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre. Finally he attempted to demonstrate in court that it was physically impossible for him to have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil, where the crime supposedly took place, in a single day, a round trip of approximately 50miles (80km).|$|E
5|$|Hilary was {{probably}} born around 1110, and was likely of <b>low</b> <b>birth,</b> {{but nothing is}} known of his ancestry. His brother was a canon of Salisbury Cathedral, and they both {{may have come from}} around Salisbury. Hilary served as a clerk for Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and as Dean of the church of Christchurch in Twynham, Hampshire, probably receiving both offices through the influence of Henry of Blois. Christchurch was a collegiate church of secular clergy, or clergy who were not monks, and Hilary was dean of the church by 1139. He was educated as a canon lawyer, and was an advocate, or lawyer, in Rome in 1144. While in Rome, he also served in the papal chancery, or writing office, in 1146. Some of his coworkers in the chancery were Robert Pullen, John of Salisbury, and Nicholas Breakspear who later became pope, as Adrian IV.|$|E
