30|$|Distribution {{system is}} that part of the {{electric}} power system which connects the high-voltage transmission network to the <b>low-voltage</b> <b>consumer</b> service point. It {{is an important part of}} an electric power system since the supply of electric power to consumers is ensured by an efficient distribution system. The capital investment in the distribution system constitutes a significant portion of the total amount spent in the entire power system. Due to the recent market deregulations, this portion had become even more important.|$|E

In the case that a surge protrctive device(SPD) {{is located on the}} load side of an residual current device(RCD), when the surge is injected from the source side of the RCD, most of injected surge currents are split into the RCD and the protection coordination between the SPD and RCD is improper, three of 6 specimens experience unintended operation due to test impulse currents. Also when the surges is injected from the load side, a lot of the surge currents is split into the SPD, but a half of test specimens causes nuisance trip. Coordination between SPD and RCD is not valid. When installing SPD, it is important to select SPD after due consideration of the protection voltage level of metal oxide varistor embedded in RCD. It is expected that the results obtained from this work could be useful to improve the protection effects o...|$|R
