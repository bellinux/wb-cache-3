40|$|The valence {{electron}} structure (VES) parameters affecting adiabatic shearing failure under high speed impact load using split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) were studied by empirical electron theory (EET) of solids and molecules. There {{is a problem}} of multiple solutions about VES parameters in EET. The statistics values of VES parameters related to adiabatic shearing sensitivity were calculated to substitute for the most probable value among the multiple solutions according to the view that the microstate statistics values can reflect the macro physical quantity. The research shows that the adiabatic shearing sensitivity is growing with the rise of the statistics value of bond energy of the strongest covalent bond, and is decreasing with the rise of the statistics value of the <b>lattice</b> <b>electron</b> number. The statistics value of bond energy of the strongest covalent bond in aluminum bronze (QAl 9 - 4) is larger than that in pure copper, and the statistics value of the <b>lattice</b> <b>electron</b> number in QAl 9 - 4 is smaller than that in pure copper. Therefore, QAl 9 - 4 is prone to adiabatic shearing failure, and the grains were only elongated due to the large deformation for pure copper without any adiabatic shear band (ASB). It is of great significance for the selection and design of material with different adiabatic shearing sensitivity to research the effect of alloy elements on adiabatic shearing sensitivity from the electronic structure perspective...|$|E

We concentrate on electronic heat and charge transport in different but connected metallic substances. The electrons hop between energy-cells located alongside the spatial extension of the metal wire. When changing energy level, the system exchanges energy with the environment. At equilibrium the distribution satisfies the Fermi-Dirac occupation-law. Installing different temperatures at two connections induces an electromotive force (Seebeck effect) and upon forcing an electric current, an additional heat flow is produced at the junctions (Peltier heat). We derive the linear response behavior relating the Seebeck and Peltier coefficients as an application of Onsager reciprocity. We also indicate the higher order corrections. The entropy production is characterized as the anti-symmetric part under time-reversal of the space-time Lagrangian...|$|E

The interacting fermion systems were investigated by C. N. Yang, and a detailed study and generalization of ODLRO were carried out [2]. It was shown that the superconductivity in interacting fermionic systems is characterized by non-vanishing off-diagonal long-range order in the reduced density matrix ρ 2 [2].

40|$|In the Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory (CDMFT), a {{strongly}} correlated system {{is represented by}} a small cluster of correlated sites, coupled to an adjustable bath of uncorrelated sites simulating the cluster's environment; the parameters governing the bath are set by a self-consistency condition involving the local Green function and the <b>lattice</b> <b>electron</b> dispersion. Solving the cluster problem with an exact diagonalization method is only practical for small bath sizes (8 sites). In that case the self-consistency condition cannot be exactly satisfied and {{is replaced by a}} minimization procedure. There is some freedom in the definition of the `merit function' to optimize. We use Potthoff's Self-Energy Functional Approach on the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models to gain insight into the best choice for this merit function. We argue that several merit functions should be used and preference given to the one that leads to the smallest gradient of the Potthoff self-energy functional. We propose a new merit function weighted with the self-energy that seems to fit the Mott transition in two dimensions better than other merit functions. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures...|$|E

The theory states that in copper oxide <b>lattices,</b> <b>electrons</b> from neighboring copper atoms interact to form a valence bond, which locks them in place. However, with doping, these electrons can act as mobile Cooper pairs and are able to superconduct.

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a broader study whose main goal is the study of the finite-energy {{spectral}} properties of the non-perturbative one-dimensional (1 D) Hubbard model and the evaluation of finite-energy correlation-function expressions. Here we study the deviations from the ground state values of double occupancy which result from creation or annihilation of holons, spinons, and pseudoparticles. The band-momentum dependence of the obtained double-occupancy spectra provides important information on the degree of localization/delocalization of the real-space <b>lattice</b> <b>electron</b> site distribution configurations associated with the pseudoparticles. We also study the band-momentum, on-site electronic repulsion, and electronic density dependence of the pseudoparticle energy bands. The shape of these bands {{plays an important role in}} the finite-energy spectral properties of the model. Such a shape defines the form of the lines in the momentum-energy/frequency plane where the peaks and edges of the one-electron and two-electron spectral weight of physical operators are located.

40|$|We {{give the}} details of the {{analysis}} for critical properties of spin-gap phases in one-dimensional <b>lattice</b> <b>electron</b> models. In the Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid theory, the spin-gap instability occurs when the backward scattering changes from repulsive to attractive. This transition point is shown to be equivalent to that of the level-crossing of the singlet and the triplet excitation spectra, using the c= 1 conformal field theory and the renormalization group. Based on this notion, the transition point between the TL liquid and the spin-gap phases can be determined with high-accuracy from the numerical data of finite-size clusters. We also discuss the boundary conditions and discrete symmetries to extract these excitation spectra. This technique is applied to the extended Hubbard model, the t-J model, and the t-J-J' model, and their phase diagrams are obtained.
