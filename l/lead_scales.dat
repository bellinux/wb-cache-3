By explicitly including, in the velocity-dependent evolution equations for the network, kinematic constraints associated with the formation of Y-shaped string junctions, we show how they <b>lead</b> to <b>scaling</b> solutions in regimes where they would not otherwise be found, thereby extending the range of parameters which <b>lead</b> to <b>scaling.</b> By incorporating these constraints we are able to study their general behaviour for networks with cosmic superstring interaction rules, and predict the scaling densities expected by these networks.

40|$|The {{study is}} a {{contribution}} to the validation of the Motivation to <b>Lead</b> <b>Scale</b> (MTL), recently proposed by Chan and Drasgow (2001) in order to reveal three types of motivation to be a leader. Participants are 624 university and post-degree specialization students, both male and female, who answered self-report structured questionnaires. The factorial structure of the MTL Scale was investigated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and via multi-sample procedures. Following the analyses, the original scale was reduced into a 15 -item form with satisfactory reliability. Other analyses showed the existence of correlations between the MTL Scale, the Social Desirability Scale and the McClelland Scales. Results indicate that the MTL Scale can be considered a useful research instrument in social, personality and organizational psychology. Correlations with the Social Desirability and McClelland Scales should be taken into consideration in order to improve and apply the MTL Scale...|$|R

Not all of the limestone that is calcined is converted to quicklime and carbon dioxide (in reaction II); the residual calcium carbonate and other components of the limestone become wastes. In addition, the salt brine used by the process is usually purified to remove magnesium and calcium ions, typically to form carbonates; otherwise, these impurities would <b>lead</b> to <b>scale</b> in the various reaction vessels and towers.
