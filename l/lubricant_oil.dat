40|$|Abstract: Diameter of {{nanoparticles}} plays a {{vital role}} in tribological properties of <b>lubricanting</b> <b>oil.</b> Three kinds of nano-copper with different diameters (50 nm, 65 nm, 80 nm) were produced using the electric explosion of metallic wire (EEW), and their diameters were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The tribological properties of the lubricating oils containing nano-copper additives were investigated using friction wear testing machine, and the wear scar morphology photographs were observed by means of continuously multiple microscope. The results show that <b>lubricanting</b> <b>oil</b> with the large diameter of 80 nm copper particles and the weight percentage of 1. 0 % ~ 1. 2 % has good characteristic of extreme pressure; while the <b>lubricanting</b> <b>oil</b> with the small diameter of 50 nm copper particles and the weight percentage of 1. 2 % provides good properties of anti-wear and friction reducing. This has a guiding role in selecting nanooil additives...|$|R

40|$|Two novel {{low-temperature}} {{ionic liquid}} processes are {{developed for the}} recovery of base <b>oils</b> from waste <b>lubricant</b> <b>oils.</b> One uses 3 -(triethoxysilyl) -propylammonium- 3 -(triethoxysilyl) -propyl carbamate (TESAC), in which the waste <b>lubricant</b> base <b>oil</b> is insoluble, and the other uses trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride (P 6, 6, 6, 14 Cl) in which the base oil is soluble. In the 3 -aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (TESA) /TESAC process, waste oil components, including the base oil, are dissolved in the solvent TESA which is converted, in situ, with carbon dioxide to TESAC, recovering the base oil as an insoluble layer. In the P 6, 6, 6, 14 Cl process, the base oil is separated from most additives as a solution in the ionic liquid from which it can be extracted with methanol. The recovered oils from both processes have properties consistent with <b>lubricant</b> <b>oils</b> in commercial use and the ionic liquids can be recovered for recycle minimising reagent use and providing a route to closed-loop base oil recovery and recycle...|$|R
