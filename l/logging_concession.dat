2500|$|On {{the issue}} of {{corruption}} and tax evasion, clear evidence exists from the 1980s.The infamous Thomas [...] Commission in 1989 laid out in excruciating detail how [...] and its agents systematically paid off PNG politicians who threatened their logging operations. Even current Prime Minister Michael Somare was implicated in the report. He was referred to the Ombudsman Commission for allegedly lying under oath about a <b>logging</b> <b>concession</b> held by the Sepik River Development Corporation (SRDC) in East Sepik Province. The Commission report also gave details of transfer pricing to escape taxes worth millions of Kina.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} twentieth century, the Mayagna {{community}} sued the Nicaraguan government for rights to their traditional land and its resources. They were in dispute as the government had granted a <b>logging</b> <b>concession</b> to private interests in Mayagna traditional territory without consulting with the people, and despite their complaints and requests to demarcate their land.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, logging {{increased}} in its concession area. Sabah Foundation has a 100-year <b>logging</b> <b>concession.</b> Conversion of forest areas to land for oil palms {{is a major}} threat for rainforests. Some forest areas are conserved, however. 14 Borneo pygmy elephants were found dead in a concession area of Sabah Foundation within two weeks in 2013, the cause likely being poisoning.|$|E
40|$|<b>Logging</b> <b>concessions</b> {{can affect}} {{wildlife}} populations through indirect or direct effects. However, if wildlife is appropriately {{taken into account}} in the forest management plans, then <b>logging</b> <b>concessions</b> can become an opportunity for conservation, as they can play a crucial role as buffers around protected areas. In the last decade, large blocks of the Gabonese forests have been surveyed by logging companies to implement the new forestry law. Large data sets were generated with this information but little was done in terms of analysis. In this study we show that this invaluable data, collected during routine management planning processes, can be used to understand the landscape factors that explain mammal distribution in <b>logging</b> <b>concessions</b> and provide very useful recommendations for taking wildlife populations into account in logging operations...|$|R

The {{imposing}} mountain is a protected natural park where wildlife such as pigs, deers and monkeys are hunted by local hunters despite by a local ban. During the 1960s, a <b>logging</b> <b>concession</b> was permitted to cut its virgin forests but the concessionaire never replanted trees. Locals exploited the situation by farming the logged area and creating coconut plantations.|$|E
40|$|Forest and {{peatland}} {{fires in}} Indonesia emit {{large quantities of}} smoke leading to poor air quality across Equatorial Asia. Marlier et al (2015 Environ. Res. Lett. 10 085005) explore the contribution of fires occurring on oil palm, timber (wood pulp and paper) and natural forest <b>logging</b> <b>concessions</b> to smoke emissions and exposure of human populations to the resulting air pollution. They find that {{one third of the}} population exposure to smoke across Equatorial Asia is caused by fires in oil palm and timber concessions in Sumatra and Kalimantan. <b>Logging</b> <b>concessions</b> have substantially lower fire emissions, and contribute less to air quality degradation. This represents a compelling justification to prevent reclassification of <b>logging</b> <b>concessions</b> into oil palm or timber <b>concessions</b> after <b>logging.</b> This can be achieved by including logged forests in the Indonesian moratorium on new plantations in forested areas...|$|R

In their description of the species, Turnbull and Middleton wrote that the specimen was deposited at Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens, but Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek were unable to locate it in 1995 and 1996, and write that it [...] "may never have been distributed".|$|E
50|$|The highest {{encounter}} rate of {{the species}} {{so far has been}} in the Sela’an-Linau Forest Management Unit (FMU), a <b>logging</b> <b>concession</b> in the Upper Baram, Sarawak, where fourteen images of the Hose's civet were obtained between 2004 and 2005 from four different sites in the concession. The previous largest series of encounters from one locality consisted of four specimens collected between 1945 and 1949 by Tom Harrisson in the nearby Kelabit Highlands, suggesting that this part of Sarawak may be the prime habitat of the species.|$|E

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 21 APR 2014 Indonesia contributes significantly to deforestation in Southeast Asia. However, much uncertainty remains over the relative contributions of various forest-exploiting sectors to forest {{losses in the}} country. Here, we compare the magnitudes of forest and carbon loss, and forest and carbon stocks remaining within oil palm plantation, logging, fiber plantation (pulp and paper), and coal mining concessions in Indonesia. Forest loss in all industrial <b>concessions,</b> including <b>logging</b> <b>concessions,</b> relate to the conversion of forest to nonforest land cover. We found that the four industries accounted for ∼ 44. 7 % (∼ 6. 6 Mha) of forest loss in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Papua, Sulawesi, and Moluccas between 2000 and 2010. Fiber plantation and <b>logging</b> <b>concessions</b> accounted for the largest forest loss (∼ 1. 9 Mha and ∼ 1. 8 Mha, respectively). Although the oil palm industry is often highlighted as a major driver of deforestation, it was ranked third in terms of deforestation (∼ 1 Mha), and second in terms of carbon dioxide emissions (∼ 1, 300 – 2, 350 Mt CO 2). Crucially, ∼ 34. 6 % (∼ 26. 8 Mha) of Indonesia's remaining forests is located within industrial concessions, the majority of which is found within <b>logging</b> <b>concessions</b> (∼ 18. 8 Mha). Hence, future development plans within Indonesia's industrial sectors weigh heavily {{on the fate of}} Southeast Asia's remaining forests and carbon stocks. Sinan A.

50|$|Chiquibul National Park was {{originally}} part of Chiquibul Forest Reserve, which was designated in 1956. In 1991, due to lobbying from conservationists, the {{three-quarters of the}} forest reserve {{that did not have}} active <b>logging</b> <b>concessions</b> was re-designated as a national park under Belize's National Parks System Act. The park's borders were re-defined in 1995. Caracol became surrounded by the national park.|$|R
50|$|In November 1988 {{heavy rains}} washed away {{the soil of}} newly deforested slopes, causing massive floods. Villages and {{agricultural}} land were swamped. Almost 400 people and thousands of domestic animals were killed. The Thai government banned logging on 14 January 1989, revoking all <b>logging</b> <b>concessions.</b> Unintended consequence: the price of timber tripled in Bangkok, unleashing an orgy of illegal logging.|$|R
50|$|The foundation's parent Htoo Group of Companies {{has been}} {{involved}} in massive timber extraction projects and continuously seeking extensive logging contracts from Myanmar government. According to The Irrawaddy, in Kachin State alone, Tay Za has been granted a 100,000-acre (40,000 hectare) <b>logging</b> <b>concession</b> by the government that would allow him to cut down vast swathes of valuable, pristine teak forest. In 2006-2007, Htoo Trading, a division of Htoo Holdings involved in teak log exports, was Burma's top private exporter and fifth largest overall, with gross revenues of $65.1 million.|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} an influx of several groups from the Bicol and Tagalog regions during the <b>logging</b> <b>concession</b> boom. The {{continuing}} acculturation of these groups brought about social changes in the locality. The once verdant forest slowly became barren and denuded with the ceaseless illegal logging and kaingin system employed by the local people and new migrants. When the national government decided to impose a total log ban, the ethnic groups decided to settle in the remote areas of the municipality to farm their lands. The Bicolanos and Tagalogs, on the other hand, {{went back to their}} own regions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{spite of}} efforts by various {{international}} agencies to influence decision making on encroaching civilization of local ethnic groups, a Philippines timber {{company has been}} granted a <b>logging</b> <b>concession</b> in their area, which is threatening their distinctive way of life.
