During the night of 31 May/1 June, the 4th Flotilla had a number of engagements with the German battlefleet. At about 22:30 hr, the {{flotilla}} encountered German cruisers and battleships. The Flotilla leader [...] was badly damaged by German shells (mainly from the battleship [...] ) and later sank, while the leading ships in the British formation fired a total of nine torpedoes, none of which hit.

Broke was badly damaged by fire from the cruiser [...] and Westfalen, and collided with the destroyer , which was also rammed by [...] and was later scuttled. Rostock was hit by a single torpedo, fired by Ambuscade or Contest, and was also later scuttled. The remains of the flotilla, by now led by , with Porpoise second in line encountered the German line again at about 00:10 hr. Fortune was heavily hit and sunk by German shells, while Porpoise, partly shielded by Fortune was hit twice. One shell, striking near her bridge, damaged the ship's steering, while a second shell, striking {{at the base of the}} aft funnel, burst the air chamber of Porpoises spare torpedo, which in turn severed her main steam main.

50|$|Like the OPR-1000 and {{preceding}} C-E designs, the APR-1400 has two {{reactor coolant}} loops. In each loop, heated primary coolant leaves the {{reactor pressure vessel}} (RPV) through one hot leg, passing through one steam generator (SG), returning to the reactor vessel through two cold legs, each equipped with a reactor coolant pump (RCP). In loop 2, there is one pressurizer (PZR) on the hot leg, where a steam bubble is maintained during operation. The loops are arranged symmetrically, so the hot legs are diametrically opposed on the RPV's circumference. Because the SGs are elevated relative to the RPV, natural convection will circulate reactor coolant {{in the event of}} RCP malfunction. The PZR is equipped with a pilot-operated relief valve which not only protects against Reactor Coolant System over-pressure, it also allows manual depressurization {{in the case of a}} total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>feedwater.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} small-break loss-of-coolant accident (SBLOCA) and the loss-of-feedwater accident (LOFW) in a scaled integral test facility of REX- 10. REX- 10 is a small integral-type PWR in which the coolant flow is driven by natural circulation, and the RCS is pressurized by the steam-gas pressurizer. The postulated accidents of REX- 10 include the system depressurization initiated by the break of a nitrogen injection line connected to the steam-gas pressurizer and the complete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> normal <b>feedwater</b> flow by the malfunction of control systems. The integral effect tests on SBLOCA and LOFW are conducted at the REX- 10 Test Facility (RTF), a full-height full-pressure facility with reduced power by 1 / 50. The SBLOCA experiment is initiated by opening a flow passage out of the pressurizer vessel, and the LOFW experiment begins with the termination <b>of</b> the <b>feedwater</b> supply into the helical-coil steam generator.

The 3 rd unit of Ringhals Nuclear Power Plant comprises a 3 -loops Westinghouse design pressurized water reactor on the Swedish West Coast. At first, the RELAP 5 model is presented. All the 157 fuel assemblies are modeled individually in the code input. The model is furthermore able to handle possible asymmetrical conditions of the flow velocity and temperature fields between the loops. The transient was initiated by a malfunction <b>of</b> the <b>feedwater</b> valve at the 2 nd steam generator.

Activation <b>of</b> the auxiliary <b>feedwater</b> provided proper amount of cooling from the secondary side, resulting in safe shutdown conditions. Capabilities of the RELAP 5 code were challenged in this transient. The calculated values of the parameters show good agreement with the measured data. A parametric study was performed In order to evaluate the dependence of the steam generator level on the injected auxiliary feedwater flow.

This thesis includes comparison to the results of a generic plant study published by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1974 using an earlier code, LOFTRAN, as well as Vogtle-specific analysis. The comparative analysis exposes and seeks to explain differences between the two codes whereas the Vogtle analysis utilizes data from the Vogtle FSAR to generate plant-specific data. The {{purpose of this study is}} to validate and update the previous analysis and gather more information about the plant actions taken in response to a LONF ATWS. As a result, now there is a new and updated evaluation of the LONF ATWS for both a generic 4 -loop Westinghouse plant and VEGP using a more advanced code. Beyond the reference case analysis, a series of sensitivity and parametric studies have been performed to show how well each type of plant is designed for handling an ATWS situation. These studies cover a wide range of operating conditions to demonstrate the dependability of the model. It was found that both the generic 4 -loop Westinghouse PWR system and VEGP can successfully mitigate a LONF ATWS throughout the core's operating cycle. M. S.

40|$|Propagating {{parameter}} uncertainty {{for a nuclear}} reactor system code is a very challenging problem. Numerous parameters influence the system response in complicated and often non-linear fashions, in addition to sometimes lengthy computational times. Combined with a statistical sampling procedure only compounds this issue since the code must be run many times. The number of parameters sampled must therefore be limited to as few as possible that still accurately characterize the uncertainty in the system response. A Quantitative Phenomena Identification and Ranking Table (QPIRT) was developed to accomplish this goal. The QPIRT consists of two steps: a “Top-Down” step focusing on identifying the dominant physical phenomena controlling the system response, and a “Bottom-Up” step which focuses on determining the parameters from those key physical phenomena that significantly contribute to the response uncertainty. The Top-Down step evaluates phenomena using the governing equations of the system code at nominal parameter values, providing a “fast” screening step. The Bottom-Up step then analyzes the correlations and models for the phenomena identified from the Top-Down step to find which parameters to sample. A statistical screening method is then used to further eliminate those parameters that do not significantly influence {{the uncertainty of the}} response. This last screening before performing the full uncertainty propagation provides statistical rigor to the parameter selection process. The QPIRT, through the Top-Down and Bottom-Up steps thus provide a systematic approach to determining the limited set of physically relevant parameters that influence the uncertainty of the system response. This strategy was demonstrated through an application to a Total <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> main <b>Feedwater</b> Flow (TLOFW) analysis using RELAP 5. Ultimately, this work is the first component in a larger task of building a calibrated uncertainty propagation framework. The QPIRT is an essential piece because the uncertainty of those selected parameters will be calibrated to data from both Separate and Integral Effect Tests (SETs and IETs). Therefore the system response uncertainty will incorporate the knowledge gained from the database of past large IETs. Idaho National Laboratory (Contract BEA 0063...|$|R
