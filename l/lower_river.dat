5|$|The Saw Mill {{was also}} known as the closest trout fishing river to New York City. In the early 2000s, it was stocked with a few hundred trout each year. The <b>lower</b> <b>river</b> {{specifically}} is a good trout river.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study in}} 2006, there were 37 fish species, 127 bird species, and 140 insect and {{invertebrate}} species found in the Merced River watershed. Due to differences in climate, {{there is a large}} disparity between species found in the upper watershed (above Lake McClure) and along the <b>lower</b> <b>river.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, when the upper Merced River basin lay mostly protected, the <b>lower</b> <b>river</b> {{was the subject}} of dam-building and {{irrigation}} diversions by the Merced Irrigation District. The District proposed the Exchequer Dam, completed in the mid-1920s and raised in the 1960s, as a water storage facility on the Merced River.|$|E
50|$|Other localized, small populations {{occur on}} the Amazon River (downstream of the Tapajós-Amazon confluence), and on four of its tributaries: the central Tapajós <b>River,</b> <b>lower</b> Madeira <b>River,</b> <b>lower</b> Rio Negro, and <b>lower</b> Ucayali <b>River.</b>|$|R

5|$|Much of the river's {{catchment}} area consists of cleared farmland with run-off captured in private dams to sustain farming over Adelaide's dry summer. Combined with the river's use for potable water this has greatly reduced the overall flow {{especially in the}} <b>lower</b> <b>river.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the <b>lower</b> <b>river</b> by about 94percent.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} 19thcentury, the Oregon Trail, a pioneer trail {{of which a}} major portion {{followed}} the Snake River, had been established by aspiring settlers and traders. Steamboats and railroads moved agricultural products and minerals along the river throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. The powerful, steep flow of the Snake River has been used since the 1890s to generate hydroelectricity, enhance navigation, and provide irrigation water from fifteen major dams built on the <b>lower</b> <b>river,</b> transforming it {{into a series of}} reservoirs. Several of these have been proposed for removal in order to restore some of the river's once-tremendous salmon runs.|$|E
5000|$|Red River: {{located in}} {{southwest}} Arkansas, flows southeast into Louisiana. Major tributaries include: Dorcheat Bayou, Bodcau Bayou, <b>Lower</b> Middle Red <b>River,</b> <b>Lower</b> Red <b>River,</b> Sulphur River, McKinney Bayou, Little River, and Mountain Fork ...|$|R
50|$|The {{confusing}} river {{names are}} the result of two major flood events, which both resulted in a significant shift in the course and flow of the <b>lower</b> <b>rivers.</b> The first of these events forced the river Meuse (Maas) to take a more northerly course and created a direct connection between the Meuse and the Merwede at the town of Woudrichem. The names of several stretches of the <b>lower</b> <b>rivers</b> were then changed to reflect this, for example the Oude Maas and Nieuwe Maas.|$|R

5|$|Deciduous forests cover 80% of the park's {{area and}} belong to 28 forest and 18 bush habitats. This variety {{is due to}} the <b>lower</b> <b>river</b> valleys, the sea coast and the karstic terrain. These include forests of oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), Strandzhan oak (Quercus hartwissiana), Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), common {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betulus), oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) with undergrowth of pontic rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), Caucasian whortleberry (Vaccinium arctostaphylos), cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), Black Sea holly (Ilex colchica), Himalayan meadow primrose (Primula rosea) and common heather (Calluna).|$|E
5|$|Iden Lock {{connected}} the Royal Military Canal to the river. The last commercial barge to pass from the Rother through Iden lock onto the canal was the Vulture, carrying 27 tons of shingle on 15 December 1909. After that, the lock {{was replaced by}} a sluice, severing the navigable connection. The river was used by pleasure craft in Edwardian times, when regular boat trips from Scots Float Sluice, then called Star Lock, to Bodiam Castle were offered. The <b>lower</b> <b>river</b> is currently used for moorings, and the Bodiam Ferry Company operate a trip boat from Newenden Bridge to Bodiam Castle.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The {{plan called for}} major cleanup of the <b>lower</b> <b>river</b> {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted to some of these issues. Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{created by}} plate {{tectonics}} about 35million {{years ago and}} subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods {{at the end of}} the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the <b>lower</b> <b>river</b> and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well.|$|E
5|$|The Environment Agency is the {{navigation}} {{authority for the}} river, which is navigable as far upstream as Crowland, and with very shallow draught to West Deeping Bridge, where further progress is hindered by the derelict lock around the weir. The traditional head of navigation was Wharf Road in Stamford. The management of the <b>lower</b> <b>river</b> has been intimately tied up with the drainage of Deeping Fen, and the river remains important to the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, for whom it provides the final conduit to the sea for pumped water.|$|E
5|$|To {{a limited}} extent, the Kootenay River {{has also been}} used for {{navigation}}. Commercial navigation began with steamboats in the 19th century to transport ores, lumber, passengers and other imported and exported products between the Kootenay River valley and the Canadian Pacific Railway station at Golden, British Columbia. Boat travel on the upper river ceased when a rail line was built along the Kootenay upstream of the big bend. Steamboats also operated briefly on the <b>lower</b> <b>river</b> and Kootenay Lake to service silver mines in the nearby mountains.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lower</b> Colorado <b>River</b> basin has {{a history}} of major flooding. The <b>Lower</b> Colorado <b>River</b> Authority built the dams to manage floods and {{generate}} hydroelectric power in the 1930s and 1940s.|$|R
5|$|Agricultural runoff {{containing}} {{pesticide residues}} {{has also been}} concentrated in the <b>lower</b> <b>river</b> in greater amounts. Toxins derived from pesticides have led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the Imperial Irrigation District with Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the New and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea {{are among the most}} polluted bodies of water in the United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds. Pollution from agricultural runoff {{is not limited to the}} lower river; the issue is also significant in upstream reaches such as Colorado's Grand Valley, also a major center of irrigated agriculture.|$|E
5|$|As {{commerce}} and industry flourished on the <b>lower</b> <b>river,</b> {{most of the}} original settlers acquired farms in the upper Willamette Valley. By the late 1850s, farmers had begun to grow crops {{on most of the}} available fertile land. The settlers increasingly encroached on Native American lands. Skirmishes between natives and settlers in the Umpqua and Rogue valleys to the southwest of the Willamette River led the Oregon state government to remove the natives by military force. They were first led off their traditional lands to the Willamette Valley, but soon were marched to the Coast Indian Reservation. In 1855, Joel Palmer, an Oregon legislator, negotiated a treaty with the Willamette Valley tribes, who, although unhappy with the treaty, ceded their lands to non-natives. The natives were then relocated by the government to a part of the Coast Reservation that later became the Grande Ronde Reservation.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with small}} bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers, Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Colorado River basin {{for at least}} 8,000 years. Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, the river and its tributaries fostered large agricultural civilizations – {{some of the most}} sophisticated indigenous cultures in North America – which eventually faded due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices. Most native peoples that inhabit the basin today are descended from other groups that settled in the region beginning about 1,000 years ago. Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16thcentury, when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area, which later became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821. Early contact between Europeans and Native Americans was generally limited to the fur trade in the headwaters and sporadic trade interactions along the <b>lower</b> <b>river.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four {{dams and}} locks on the <b>lower</b> Snake <b>River</b> to {{facilitate}} shipping. The <b>lower</b> Columbia <b>River</b> has likewise been dammed for navigation. Thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho. Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep-water ports on the <b>lower</b> Columbia <b>River,</b> such as Portland. Grain, mostly wheat, {{is the main}} product shipped from the Snake, and nearly {{all of it is}} exported internationally from the <b>lower</b> Columbia <b>River</b> ports.|$|R

50|$|Merrymeeting Bay {{is linked}} to the Gulf of Maine and the Atlantic Ocean by the <b>Lower</b> Kennebec <b>River,</b> a long {{saltwater}} tidal channel. The <b>Lower</b> Kennebec <b>River</b> and Merrymeeting Bay are known collectively as the Kennebec Estuary. Merrymeeting Bay's connection to the <b>Lower</b> Kennebec <b>River</b> is via a 280 yard m slot in the bedrock called The Chops, an area of converging water flows known to be hazardous to boaters.|$|R
5|$|In 1723, the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float Sluice, a timber {{lock on the}} <b>lower</b> <b>river.</b> He built a dovetailed sheet pile wall below the foundations, and the Commissioners offered him the job of maintaining the levels in 1725, for which he would be paid £65 per year. He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years. Silting of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s. Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet. Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s, {{so that all the}} runoff passed through Scots Float. Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as he was too busy with other engineering projects.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that this {{agreement}} marked a victory for Penda, ceding to him Cirencester and the areas along the <b>lower</b> <b>River</b> Severn. These lands to the southwest of Mercia had apparently been taken by the West Saxons from the Britons in 577, and the territory eventually {{became part of the}} subkingdom of the Hwicce. Given Penda's role in the area at this time and his apparent success there, {{it has been argued that}} the subkingdom of the Hwicce was established by him; evidence to support this is lacking, although the subkingdom is known to have existed later in the century. Bassett ("In search of the origins of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms", page 67) is more cautious, noting the lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|North of the Lewiston village limits, NY18F is {{the closest}} roadway to the Niagara River, a trait {{reflected}} in its name of <b>Lower</b> <b>River</b> Road. As it progresses northward along the eastern bank of the river, NY18F parallels both the Niagara Scenic State Parkway and NY18. At Stella Niagara, NY18F meets Pletcher Road, the first road north of Lewiston that provides a connection to all three roadways. NY18F continues on, passing through the western extent of Joseph Davis State Park south of the village of Youngstown {{in the town of}} Lewiston. In Youngstown, NY18F becomes Main Street and intersects the western terminus of NY93 in the village center. At the northern fringe of the community, NY18F intersects the southern entrance to the Fort Niagara State Park. NY18F bypasses the park, turning east onto Jackson Street, then north onto Lake Road as it follows the perimeter of the park.|$|E
