40|$|OBJECTIVE: Transient lower esophageal {{sphincter}} relaxations (TLESRs) are {{the main}} mechanism underlying gastroesophageal reflux. In the present study we evaluated the effect of <b>loxiglumide,</b> a specific cholecystokininA (CCKA) -receptor antagonist, on the occurrence of TLESRs evoked by gastric distension. METHODS: Eight healthy subjects underwent esophageal manometry using a 10 -lumen sleeve assembly during placebo or <b>loxiglumide</b> (10 mg/kg/h) in a randomized double-blind order. Gastric distension was induced by inflation of 400 ml of air. RESULTS: Basal lower esophageal pressure (LESP) and swallow-induced relaxation were not affected by <b>loxiglumide.</b> <b>Loxiglumide</b> significantly {{reduced the number of}} TLESRs, from 11. 5 (5. 8 - 18. 3) to 6. 0 (3. 3 - 14. 3) during the total recording period of 1 h, and from 5. 5 (4. 25 - 7. 5) to 2. 0 (0. 5 - 6. 8) during the first 15 min. The number of common cavities was significantly decreased by <b>loxiglumide,</b> from 8. 0 (4. 0 - 20. 0) to 5. 0 (2. 0 - 7. 8). TLESRs represented the main mechanism (60 % during placebo, 74 % during <b>loxiglumide)</b> underlying common cavities, followed by swallow-induced relaxation. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Loxiglumide</b> significantly reduces the number of TLESRs triggered by gastric distension without interfering with swallow-related relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, suggesting the involvement of CCKA receptors in the reflex pathway mediating TLESR...|$|E
40|$|To reduce weight, some morbidly obese {{patients}} {{are treated with}} an intragastric balloon, often resulting in increased reflux symptoms. As transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) are the major mechanism underlying reflux and can be reduced by cholecystokinin-A (CCKA) blockade, we hypothesized that the CCKA-receptor antagonist <b>loxiglumide</b> could reduce gastroesophageal reflux in these subjects. Postprandial manometric studies were performed in 12 obese subjects during infusion of placebo or <b>loxiglumide.</b> Before balloon placement, <b>loxiglumide</b> did not significantly reduce the rate of TLESRs but attenuated the postprandial decrease in LES pressure. After 10 weeks of balloon treatment, <b>loxiglumide</b> significantly reduced the rate of TLESRs. Postprandial LES pressure was significantly increased, whereas the meal-induced decrease in LES pressure was absent. Neither <b>loxiglumide</b> nor balloon placement affected gastroesophageal reflux. In conclusion, CCKA receptors {{play an important role}} in post-prandial LES pressure decrease and are involved in the reflex pathway underlying the triggering of TLESRs, at least after balloon placemen...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) in {{the regulation}} of gastric emptying and pancreatic enzyme secretion was evaluated by infusing the CCK-receptor antagonist <b>loxiglumide.</b> Gastric emptying rates and pancreatic secretory outputs were measured in five healthy volunteers by the double-indicator perfusion technique using a multiple-lumen tube in the duodenum. Placebo or <b>loxiglumide</b> (22 mumol. kg- 1. h- 1) was infused throughout each experiment. Five hundred-milliliter liquid intragastric meals of (a) fat, protein, and glucose (Ensure; Abbott, Chicago, IL); (b) glucose, 20 g/dL; and (c) guar gum, 1. 1 g/dL, were given in random order. In addition, {{the effect of a}} physiologic CCK- 8 dose (20 pmol. kg- 1. h- 1) after an intragastric 500 -mL saline meal (0. 154 mol/L) was tested. Intravenous CCK- 8 induced a marked retardation of the gastric emptying rate of the saline solution (P less than 0. 05) while stimulating pancreatic secretory outputs; both effects were completely abolished by the infusion of <b>loxiglumide.</b> <b>Loxiglumide</b> markedly accelerated the gastric emptying rates (by approximately 40 %) and simultaneously diminished lipase (by approximately 75 %) and trypsin (by approximately 50 %) outputs of both the mixed meal (P less than 0. 01) and the pure glucose meal (P less than 0. 05). Additional experiments using gamma camera scintigraphy confirmed the accelerating effect of <b>loxiglumide</b> on gastric emptying of the mixed meal (P less than 0. 01). The gastric emptying rate of the guar meal, which did not release CCK, was not influenced by the infusion of <b>loxiglumide.</b> <b>Loxiglumide</b> distinctly augmented plasma CCK levels after the mixed (2. 6 times) and the pure glucose (2. 1 times) meals while markedly reducing (approximately 76 %) pancreatic polypeptide release (P less than 0. 02).

40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} may {{be associated}} with duodenal ulcer (DU) and accompanied by enhanced gastrin release but the mechanism of this H pylori related hypergastrinaemia in DU patients is unclear. Cholecystokinin (CCK) has been implicated in the feedback control of gastrin release and gastric acid secretion in healthy subjects. This study therefore investigated if CCK participates in the impairment of postprandial gastrin release and gastric secretion in six DU patients. Tests were undertaken with and without elimination of endogenous CCK by <b>loxiglumide,</b> a selective CCK-A receptors antagonist, before and after eradication of H pylori with triple therapy (omeprazole, amoxicyllin, bismuth). In H pylori positive DU patients, the post-prandial decline in pH (with median pH 3. 5) was accompanied by a pronounced increment in plasma gastrin but the administration of <b>loxiglumide</b> did not affect significantly this postprandial rise in plasma gastrin and gastric pH profile. After eradication of H pylori, the plasma gastrin concentration was reduced while the median postprandial pH was significantly increased (median pH 4. 3). The administration of <b>loxiglumide</b> resulted in significantly greater increase in postprandial plasma gastrin and greater decrease in pH (median pH 3. 1) in these patients. This study shows that (a) infection with H pylori is accompanied by an enhanced gastrin release and gastric acidity in DU patients, (b) the failure of <b>loxiglumide</b> to affect plasma gastrin or gastric acid secretion in H pylori infected DU patients could be attributed, at least in part, to the failure of endogenous CCK to control gastrin release and gastric secretion by releasing somatostatin, and (c) the test with <b>loxiglumide</b> may be useful in the identification of patients with impaired feedback control of gastrin release and gastric secretion resulting from infection with H pylori...|$|E
40|$|Satiation, {{the process}} that brings eating to an end, and satiety, the state of {{inhibition}} over further eating, {{may be influenced by}} cholecystokinin (CCK). In animal and human studies, {{it has been shown that}} infusion of exogenous CCK decreases food intake, but the doses given may well have led to supraphysiological plasma concentrations. This study was done to discover if a low dose of intraduodenal fat releasing physiological amounts of endogenous cholecystokinin exerts satiation or satiety effects, or both and if these effects could be inhibited by the CCK receptor antagonist <b>loxiglumide.</b> In 10 healthy lean volunteers (5 F, 5 M, mean age 26) three tests were performed in a randomised blind fashion. Intralipid 20 % (6 g/h) (experiments A and C) or saline (experiment B) were given intraduodenally from 1030 until 1300. The subjects received saline (experiments A and B) or <b>loxiglumide</b> (experiment C) a specific CCK-receptor antagonist (10 mg/kg/h) intravenously from 0930 until 1300. At 1200 a meal was served. At regular time intervals hunger feelings were measured using visual analogue scales and food selection lists and plasma CCK was measured by radioimmunoassay. Food intake (mean (SEM)) during intraduodenal fat (206 (35) g) was lower than in the control study (269 (37) g, p = 0. 09). <b>Loxiglumide</b> largely prevented the inhibitory effect of intraduodenal fat on food intake (245 (30) g). From 1030 until the meal at 1200 there was a significant satiating effect of intraduodenal fat compared with the control and <b>loxiglumide</b> experiments according to the food selection lists, which was because of the satiating effect for the fat rich items (p< 0. 05). Also feelings of fullness were significantly higher during intraduodenal fat than in the control or <b>loxiglumide</b> experiments (p< 0. 05). During intraduodenal fat there was a significant increase of plasma CCK from 2. 4 (0. 3) to 4. 8 (0. 4) pM (p< 0. 001). <b>Loxiglumide</b> led to an exaggerated CCK release to a peak concentration of 16 (2. 4) pM before the meal.

40|$|The {{postprandial}} contractions of {{the gall}} bladder {{result from the}} interaction of neurohormonal factors but their relative contribution is unknown. This {{study was designed to}} determine the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in gall bladder contractions using a highly selective and potent CCK-receptor antagonist, CR- 1505 (<b>loxiglumide)</b> in healthy men either infused with exogenous CCK in graded doses (1. 56 - 50 pmol/kg/h) or subjected to modified sham feeding (MSF) and ordinary feeding tests. The gall bladder volume measured by real time ultrasonography showed dose dependent decrease in the gall bladder volume in 10 subjects when CCK 8 was infused iv in graded doses reaching about 15 % at 1. 56 pmol/kg/h and 91 % at 50 pmol/kg/h. Close correlation between the decrease in gall bladder volume and the dosage of CCK or the increments in plasma CCK-bioactivity was observed. After pretreatment with <b>loxiglumide,</b> CCK resulted in similar increments in plasma CCK-bioactivity but failed to affect the gall bladder volume at CCK doses up to 6. 25 pmol/kg/h and caused only 53 % reduction at 50 pmol/kg/h.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the role of cholecystokinin in the control gastric acid secretion in men using <b>loxiglumide,</b> a specific cholecystokinin receptor blocker. Three groups of healthy subjects (A, B, and C) were used; group A [...] for studies with postprandial gastric secretion, group B [...] for studies with exogenous gastric secretagogues and group C [...] for 12 hour intragastric pH-metry. Cephalic phase stimulated by modified sham feeding in group A subjects increased gastric acid secretion to about 50 % of pentagastrin maximum and the treatment with <b>loxiglumide</b> in a standard dose (20 mumol/kg iv loading dose plus infusion of 20 mumol/kg/h afterwards) failed to affect this secretion. Gastric acid response to a 5 % peptone meal instilled intragastrically greatly enhanced gastric acid secretion and plasma gastrin concentration but the addition of <b>loxiglumide</b> in the standard dose resulted in further increase in both gastric acid and plasma gastrin responses to peptone meal. Infusion of caerulein in gradually increasing doses (15 - 120 pmol/kg/h) and gastrin releasing peptide (25 - 200 pmol/kg/h) resulted in a dose dependent stimulation of gastric acid secretion reaching about 35 % and 25 % of maximum attained with pentagastrin. When <b>loxiglumide</b> was added in a standard dose, the acid responses to caerulein and gastrin releasing peptide were further increased two to three fold attaining the peak reaching, respectively, about 100 % and 50 % of pentagastrin maximum. In group C subjects, 12 hour pH-metry revealed the usual increase in gastric pH after each meal in tests with placebo. <b>Loxiglumide</b> (1200 mg tablets tid, po) resulted in significantly lower pH after each meal and this was accompanied by significantly higher gastrin responses than in placebo tests.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{physiological}} {{relevance of}} duodenal bile acids {{in the control}} of cholecystokinin release and pancreatic enzyme secretion is still unknown. AIMS: To provide a near physiological situation by perfusing a bile acid mixture mimicking the individual endogenous bile acid composition of the person under investigation. For maximal reduction of endogenous bile output the CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>loxiglumide</b> was infused intravenously. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven healthy volunteers were studied on four different days by a duodenal marker perfusion technique. The individual bile acid composition in duodenal juice and test meal stimulated bile acid output was assessed on day 1. Bile acids were perfused at an amount of 30 or 100 % as determined on day 1 {{in combination with the}} test meal in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>loxiglumide.</b> Pancreatic enzymes, bilirubin, and bile acid output were determined in duodenal juice. Plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) and plasma pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were measured radioimmunologically. RESULTS: Bile acid perfusion did not significantly alter stimulated pancreatic enzyme, bilirubin or bile acid output or plasma CCK. <b>Loxiglumide</b> did not alter basal CCK release but increased test meal stimulated CCK output fourfold (p < 0. 05). The addition of bile acids to the test meal at a dose resembling 30 % of bile acid output as determined on day 1 prevented this increase. Plasma PP concentration remained unchanged by bile acids and were mostly undetectable during <b>loxiglumide</b> infusion. CONCLUSIONS: The CCK producing cell is under constant suppression by intraduodenal bile acids which cannot be further enhanced by a physiological bile acid mixture. However, removal of duodenal bile acids by inhibition of gall bladder contraction unmasks this suppression leading to a dramatic increase in plasma CCK levels. As little as one third of postprandially released bile acids completely reverse this effect. Bile acids are the most important luminal regulator of CCK release in humans...|$|E

Using a totally isolated, vascularly perfused rat colon, we investigated: (1) the roles of CCK and PYY on colonic motility, (2) to determine if CCK modulates PYY release from the colon to influence the motility and (3) to clarify whether the action of CCK and PYY on colonic motility is mediated via the influence of cholinergic input. Methods An isolated whole rat colon was used. Luminal pressure was monitored via microtip catheter pressure transducers from proximal and distal colon. After a control period, CCK- 8 or PYY was administerd intraarterially with or without an anti-PYY serum, <b>loxiglumide</b> or atropine at 12, 60 and 240 pM.

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{cholecystokinin}} {{has been}} reported to be important in regulating the growth of pancreatic cancer. We investigated the effect of <b>loxiglumide</b> (LXG), a cholecytskinin receptor antagonist, on the invasiveness of two human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Cells were treated with LXG for 24 h, and examined in the invasion assay. The expression and activity of MMP- 9 in supernatants from cancer cells were analyzed by Western blotting and zymogram. Interestingly, the invasiveness of cancer cells and expression of MMP- 9 were decreased by LXG in a dose-dependent manner. LXG may be a useful therapeutic agent against pancreatic cancer...|$|E
40|$|A {{reduction}} in voluntary feed intake {{is a major}} factor in the lost productivity of grazing lambs infected by gastrointestinal parasites yet the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Potential pathways involved in parasite-induced feed intake depression were investigated in lambs with minimal previous exposure to parasites and artificially infected by the small intestinal parasite Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Six in vivo experiments were conducted on lambs housed in individual pens or metabolism crates with similar feeding and experimental procedures. In Experiment 1 (Chapter 4) the effect of T. colubriformis infection on short term feed intake in lambs and of some pharmacological agents on feed intake depression were investigated. Prior to and for the duration of infection, lambs were fed once per day and feed intake recorded at regular intervals over the day (8 h). Following the onset of feed intake depression in the infected group (9 weeks after commencing dosing), all animals were treated with an analgesic (codeine phosphate per os), an anti-inflammatory agent (indomethacin per os), a CCK antagonist (L 364 - 718 by subcutaneous injection) or saline (control) in a replicated Latin square design (n = 8). Although the pattern of feed consumption was similar in infected and non-infected lambs, average daily intake was reduced 32 % and short term intake (recorded at 10 minute intervals for the first hour of feeding, 15 minute intervals for the second hour and hourly for the next 6 hours of feeding) reduced 40 % by infection. This identified the key component by which intake was depressed and enabled the use of a short term intake model and short duration of action compounds to identify the pathways involved in intake depression in this sequence of experiments. None of the pharmacological treatments increased intake in the infected group. These results suggest a {{reduction in}} the rate of consumption due to reduced hunger signals, rather than change of meal eating patterns, is the major cause of feed intake depression. Specific conclusions about the pathways investigated using the pharmacological agents could not be obtained. Experiment 2 (Chapter 5) was designed to investigate the roles of pain and osmolality on feed intake depression. Digesta samples collected prior to and during parasite infection and before and after feeding had similar osmolalities (240 - 260 mosmol/l) which indicated that feeding or infection had no effect on osmolality of digesta. Following the onset of feed intake depression in infected animals, all animals were treated in a Latin square design (n = 4) with no treatment, saline, local anaesthetic (xylocaine) or analgesic (codeine phosphate) solution 15 minutes before feeding, by slow injection into the duodenum. There was no effect of these treatments on food intake. In the second part of the experiment, hyperosmotic solutions (mannitol and NaCI) markedly depressed short term intake in non-infected animals, suggesting a role for osmoreceptors in intake regulation. However these effects were not blocked by local anaesthetic so the depressed intake may have resulted from generalised malaise rather than from specific osmoreceptor effects. In Experiment 3 (Chapter 6) the role of peripheral CCK on intake depression was examined by a dose-response study utilising the CCK antagonist, <b>loxiglumide.</b> Intravenous injection of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg LW of <b>loxiglumide</b> to infected lambs 10 - 15 minutes before feeding (n = 6) had no effect on feed intake at any of the dose levels. In experiment 4 (Chapter 7) <b>loxiglumide</b> was infused intravenously for 10 minutes (30 mg/kg/h) before feeding and for the first 2 h (10 mg/kg/h) after feed was offered to minimise any effect of the rate of clearance of <b>loxiglumide</b> on the lack of feed intake response. As well, the rate of marker disappearance from the abomasum was recorded in both infected and non-infected animals. Continuous infusion of <b>loxiglumide</b> did not attenuate parasite induced intake depression nor did it have any effect on abomasal emptying. Abomasal volume was reduced by infection (66. 3 vs 162 ml) as was the fractional outflow rate (2. 2 vs 2. 8 ml/min) but these differences were accounted for by the lower level of feed intake in the infected animals. In Experiment 5 (Chapter 8) brotizolam, a benzodiazepine appetite stimulant, thought to act on the hypothalamus, was administered in a dose-response study to infected and non-infected animals (n = 4) immediately prior to feeding or following termination of the first meal (45 minutes after feeding) and the feed intake response recorded. Brotizolam elevated both the short term (0 - 0. 75 h), daily (22 h) intake and all time intervals in the first 5 h after feeding in infected and non-infected animals when administered after the first meal but when administered prior to feeding elevated intake only over the first 6 h of feeding. In both cases the magnitude of the response was greater in infected animals than in non-infected animals. Brotizolam appeared to increase the rate of eating without having a major impact on meal eating patterns when administered before feeding. Where administration was after the first meal, the effect was due to an "extra" meal being consumed. These findings showed that infected animals can respond to central stimulators of intake although the mechanism of the response is not known. Opioids were implicated in intake depression as the rate of intake rather than meal patterns appeared to be the major parameter depressed under parasitism. This was examined in experiment 6 (Chapter 9) where animals (n = 6) were fasted for 26 h or not fasted, then treated with saline (control), brotizolam (intake stimulant) or naloxone (opioid antagonist) immediately prior to feeding. Fasting stimulated feed intake in the short term (100 % increase in 75 min) and over the day (12 % increase) in both infected and non-infected animals. Following fasting, infected animals ate a similar amount of feed to the non-infected, fasted animals and more than the non-infected, non-fasted animals. The signals resulting from a one day fast were sufficient in the short term to override parasite induced mechanisms causing feed intake depression. Naloxone suppressed the intake stimulatory effects of a 26 h fast in both infected and non-infected animals, which supports a role for endogenous opioids as hunger signals. Where animals were not fasted, naloxone reduced intake only in the non-infected animals which suggested endogenous opioid levels may be lower in infected animals than in non-infected animals. In the final experiment (Experiment 7, Chapter 10) the role of central hunger and satiety mechanism were investigated. Infected and non-infected animals (n = 6) were treated with naloxone or saline by intravenous injection, or saline and met-enkephalinamide (an opioid analogue) by intracerebral infusion, or naloxone and the opioid analogue simultaneously to investigate the role of central opioids in feed intake depression. To determine the role of CCK induced satiety signals on feed intake at a central level, <b>loxiglumide</b> and CCK were infused separately and in combination for 30 minutes prior to feeding and for the first 60 minutes of feed on offer, into a lateral cerebral ventricle of the brain of infected and control animals (n = 6). The opioid analogue tended to increase intake in infected animals but the effect was not significant probably because the dose used was too low to elicit a response in sheep. Naloxone depressed intake only in the infected animals, which conflicted with the results of Experiment 4. As a consequence these results were inconclusive because of the single low dose of opioid analogue used and the conflicting naloxone responses. CCK alone depressed intake by 39 - 52 % only in infected animals and this effect of the 90 minute infusion was evident over the 8 h short term recording period. <b>Loxiglumide</b> attenuated the feed intake depressive effects of CCK in the infected animals to the extent that intake was elevated above control levels. <b>Loxiglumide</b> alone was an intake stimulant in both infected and non-infected animals. Intake was increased over the entire 8 h but mostly in the second hour when intake was increased by 188 % in infected animals and by 16 % in the non-infected animals and resulted in almost continuous eating. These results showed <b>loxiglumide</b> will temporarily block the effect of parasite infection on feed intake in sheep when administered centrally and the fact that it blocked the effects of exogenous CCK on intake indicated that the effect is mediated via CCK receptors. In conclusion GIT parasite infection reduced both short term and daily feed intake apparently by a change in rate of intake rather than any alteration in meal patterns. It was further suggested that anyone of a number of potential peripheral pathways, including changes to osmolality, gut emptying, pain and inflammation of the gut, alone is not involved in anorexia in sofar as the compounds used could block these factors and the results support the idea that intake depression is mediated via a central mechanism. Intake in infected animals responded to a much greater extent when fasting, i. c. v. <b>loxiglumide</b> or brotizolam were employed. Feed intake thus appears to be regulated through the same mechanisms in infected and non-infected animals. The results from compounds affecting the central mechanism suggest central CCK receptors are important in parasite induced anorexia, possibly by changing the onset of satiety or by interacting with endogenous opioids to reduce the rate of feed intake. Secondly reduced endogenous opioids may be causing the reduction in the rate of feed consumption alone or as a result of other interactions. It was concluded that intake in parasitised animals could be increased to that of control animals by employing procedures and compounds thought to act on the hypothalamus...|$|E

MethodsSixty rats were separated into six groups of ten animals each (ACGJ+ND, RCGJ+ND, ACGJ+HCHOD, RCGJ+HCHOD, ACGJ+ND+LOX, and RCGJ+ND+LOX). On the seventh day, scintigraphic measurements of solid gastric emptying were made at 1, 30 and 60 min. ResultsAccording to the 60 -min results, the RCGJ+ND group exhibited delayed emptying compared to the ACGJ+ND group (p= 0. 023). Gastric emptying of ACGJ+HCHOD rats was delayed compared with the other ACGJ groups (compared to ACGJ+ND: p= 0. 000, and ACGJ+ND+LOX: p= 0. 015). Gastric emptying was more effective in the RCGJ+ND+LOX group than the other RCGJ groups (compared to RCGJ+ND: p= 0. 003, and RCGJ+HCHOD: p= 0. 001).

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that human appetite is under multifactorial control, and that investigation of each facet implicated in appetite regulation {{is required to}} develop understanding in this area. The current research aimed to investigate subjective appetite ratings and ad libitum food intake in response to manipulated preloads, while simultaneously measuring the hormone and metabolite response and gastric emptying rate of those preloads. This tripartite approach was then used to explore {{the relationship between the}} gastrointestinal hormones GLP- 1 and CCK, and appetite. Manipulated preloads differing in their carbohydrate and fat content were used to investigate the post-prandial response. Increasing the carbohydrate and energy content of a preload was shown to decrease ad libitum food intake, although there were no obvious effects on subjective appetite ratings. In addition the secretion of GLP- 1, GIP, insulin and glucose were significantly increased as preload carbohydrate and energy content increased. The gastric emptying of the preload was slower as carbohydrate and energy content increased. The manipulation of preload fat and energy content showed a similar pattern of response, with decreased ad libitum energy intake and delayed gastric emptying as preload fat and energy content increased. Hormone and metabolite responses showed significant increases in CCK and GLP- 1 with increasing preload fat and energy content. To investigate further the role of GLP- 1 in the regulation of human appetite, appetite responses during a GLP- 1 infusion were assessed against a saline control. The infusion of GLP- 1 did not {{have a significant effect on}} self rated appetite or ad libitum energy intake, and was not supportive of a major role for GLP- 1 as a satiety hormone in man. However GLP- 1 infusion significantly delayed gastric emptying of a water load, supporting the role of GLP- 1 as a regulator of gastric emptying. The role of CCK in human appetite was similarly investigated, using an infusion of the CCKA receptor antagonist <b>loxiglumide</b> against a saline control. <b>Loxiglumide</b> infusion significantly increased ad libitum energy intake, and significantly increased the rate of gastric emptying of a high energy liquid preload. The infusion was also found to significantly increase GLP- 1 and insulin responses, and the increased ad libitum energy intake was observed in spite of high GLP- 1 levels with <b>loxiglumide</b> infusion. The ad libitum test meal intake data from the manipulated preload studies showed that a small number of subjects did not adjust their intake according to preload energy intake. Thus the role of habitual exercise levels on food intake response was assessed to determine if this poor response was related to lifestyle differences. Individuals who participated in regular recreational exercise were found to better adjust ad libitum energy intake in response to manipulated preloads than those who undertook no regular recreational exercise. These data provide support a role for exercise in the regulation of food intake. Taken together these data provide evidence that the differing hormonal responses to manipulated preloads are involved in the regulation of appetite response. Investigations of the roles of GLP- 1 and CCK in appetite suggest that CCK is a more potent regulator of appetite than GLP- 1. The role of exercise in determining the appetite response to manipulated preloads suggests that the investigation of lifestyle differences is also of importance in the understanding of human appetite...|$|E

Failure of this anti-reflux barrier results in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and may lead to complications such as oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus and eventually oesophageal carcinoma. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation is the main mechanism underlying gastro-oesophageal reflux. It involves a prolonged relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter, mediated by a vago-vagal neural pathway, synapsing in the brainstem. Several drugs, such as atropine, baclofen and <b>loxiglumide,</b> have been shown to reduce the rate of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and concomitantly the number of reflux episodes. These findings illustrate that transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations may represent a potential new target for the pharmacological treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

It should be emphasized, however, that other factors, such as low lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, the presence of a hiatal hernia and impaired oesophageal peristalsis, are also of great importance.

40|$|Background—Exogenous {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) inhibits antral motility and slows gastric emptying (GE) but {{the effect}} of endogenous CCK on the gastric motor mechanisms responsible for GE remains unclear.  Methods—The effect of the CCK-A antagonist <b>loxiglumide</b> (LOX) on GE and motility was studied using magnetic resonance imaging in six healthy volunteers after ingestion of 500 ml Intralipid 10 % (550 kcal). Subjects were studied in the supine position on two occasions during intravenous infusion of LOX (66 µmol/kg/h for 10 min followed by 22 µmol/kg/h) or placebo. GE was determined every 15 minutes using transaxial abdominal scans and motility was studied by means of 120 coronal scans, 1. 2 seconds apart. For each coronal image the proximal and distal (antral) diameters were measured at a fixed point in the stomach to determine contraction frequency (ACF) and amplitude (AMP).  Results—GE was faster during LOX infusion than placebo (t 1 / 2 31 (22) versus 115 (67) minutes, p< 0. 03). There was little variation in {{the diameter of the}} proximal stomach with either LOX or placebo. In the distal stomach marked contractile activity was observed during LOX (ACF 2. 9 (0. 2) versus 1. 5 (2. 9) during placebo, p< 0. 01). AMP also increased during LOX compared with placebo (56 (22) % versus 27 (16) %, p< 0. 001).  Conclusion—The increases in antral motility are likely to contribute to the acceleration of GE and suggest that CCK may regulate GE by acting on the distal stomach although an effect on the proximal stomach cannot be excluded. ...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{control of}} cell {{proliferation}} by gastrin {{has been investigated}} in a rat pancreatic tumour cell line, AR 4 - 2 J. Exogenous gastrin, 10 - 12 to 10 - 8 M, stimulated cell growth of thymidine-synchronised AR 4 - 2 J cells cultured over 48 h in serum-free medium. Cell lysates of AR 4 - 2 J cells contained an average of 4. 5 and 3. 5 pg gastrin per 106 cells, when grown in serum-supplemented or serum-free media, respectively, as revealed by radioimmunoassay.

40|$|Although it {{is unclear}} to what extent {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms represent a normal perception of abnormal function or an abnormal perception of normal function, many believe that IBS constitutes the clinical expression of an underlying motility disorder, affecting primarily the mid- and lower gut. Indeed, transit and contractile abnormalities have been demonstrated with sophisticated techniques in a subset of patients with IBS. As a consequence, drugs affecting gastrointestinal (GI) motility have been widely employed {{with the aim of}} correcting the major IBS manifestations, ie, pain and altered bowel function. Unfortunately, no single drug has proven to be effective in treating IBS symptom complex. In addition, the use of some medications has often been associated with unpleasant side effects. Therefore, the search for a truly effective and safe drug to control motility disturbances in IBS continues. Several classes of drugs look promising and are under evaluation. Among the motor- inhibiting drugs, gut selective muscarinic antagonists (such as zamifenacin and darifenacin), neurokinin 2 antagonists (such as MEN- 10627 and MEN- 11420), beta 3 -adrenoreceptor agonists (eg, SR- 58611 A) and GI-selective calcium channel blockers (eg, pinaverium bromide and octylonium) are able to decrease painful contractile activity in the gut (antispasmodic effect), without significantly affecting other body functions. Novel mechanisms to stimulate GI motility and transit include blockade of cholecystokinin (CCK) A receptors and stimulation of motilin receptors. <b>Loxiglumide</b> (and its dextroisomer, dexloxiglumide) is the only CCKA receptor antagonist that is being evaluated clinically. This drug accelerates gastric emptying and colonic transit, thereby increasing the number of bowel movements in patients with chronic constipation. It is also able to reduce visceral perception. Erythromycin and related 14 -member macrolide compounds inhibit the binding of motilin to its receptors on GI smooth muscle and, therefore, act as motilin agonists. This antibiotic accelerates gastric emptying and shortens orocecal transit time. In the large bowel a significant decrease in transit is observed only in the right colon, which suggests a shift in fecal distribution. Several ‘motilinomimetics’ have been synthesized. Their development depends on the lack of antimicrobial activity and the absence of fading of the prokinetic effect during prolonged administration. 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 4 agonists with significant pharmacological effects on the mid- and distal gut (such as prucalopride and tegaserod) are available for human use. These ‘enterokinetic’ compounds are useful for treating constipation- predominant IBS patients. 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists also possess a number of interesting pharmacological properties that may make them suitable for treatment of IBS. Besides decreasing colonic sensitivity to distension, these drugs prolong intestinal transit and may be particularly useful in diarrhea-predominant IBS. Finally, when administered in small pulsed doses, octreotide, besides reducing the perception of rectal distension, accelerates intestinal transit, although other evidence disputes such an effect...|$|E
40|$|Electrical bio-impedance can be {{considered}} as a physiological measurement of significant value in research and clinical applications. This is because certain structures of living organisms and the human body such as tissues and membranes are characterized by their specific impedance, which can be easily measured with existing technology. In addition, many body functions (physiological processes) involve changes in their ionic and electrolytic content and size, features that are followed by changes in their electrical characteristics indicated by their impedance values. The use of surface electrodes for measuring impedance in humans makes the method more attractive. Thus, during the 2 nd half of the last century, impedance techniques have been developed to measure the blood flow in limbs, to form cross-sectional images of human body sections and to define body composition. The imaging techniques suffer from poor resolution due to the anisotropic electrical properties of the tissues. Epigastrography, based on determination of electrical impedance changes, is a simple, inexpensive, radiation free technique, which can be repeated many times without any trauma to the patient and is a valuable research tool. This work involves the generation, analysis and interpretation of epigastric electrical impedance signals. The signals recorded represent the epigastric impedance of a fasting volunteer before, during the oral intake of a liquid meal of typically 450 mL and for periods between 45 minutes to 2 hours post-prandially. The half emptying times (T 50 s) were calculated for a variety of test meals, and the statistically significant differences between the T 50 s were found for meals which varied in calorific content in a total of 7 studies with at least 9 subjects per study. Significant differences between T 50 s were found also when testing the same meal but under different conditions, namely, intravenous infusion of peptides (GLP- 1, <b>loxiglumide)</b> or placebo (physiological saline) and the release in the gastric cavity of amino acids, free or bound with an orally taken gelatine capsule. However, the impedance T 50 s calculated were found to be considerably shorter than half emptying times presented in the literature using other techniques. Simultaneous application of scintigraphy confirmed that the T 50 s based on impedance were in comparison shorter. Similarly when experiments were carried out, simultaneously with the octanoic acid breath test and application of paracetamol absorption the same shorter, in comparison, values of T 50 s were obtained. The comparison with scintigraphy strengthened the suspicion that impedance values were being strongly influenced by the presence of gastric acid. Gastric acid studies undertaken for a number of conditions supported the considerable influence that gastric acid played. In vitro measurements of conductivity and pH of mixtures of test meals with gastric juice aspirations from subjects showed the acid influence. Finally, the physiology of the gastric mucosa from the resting state to secretion leads to the hypothesis that epigastric impedance is in the main controlled by the conductivity of the gastric content rather than by the volume of the meal content in the stomach and is supported by the laws of physics underlying the electrical impedance of a bulk object. In conclusion, both experimental and clinical results from the studies and investigations undertaken in this research convinced the author that the epigastric impedance reflects the conductivity and the acidity of the gastric content. Further by carrying out signal processing of the epigastric impedance signals employing fast Fourier transformation information was extracted about the gastric contractions in the range of 2. 5 to 4. 5 cycles per minute, confirming the usefulness of the technique in the study of gastric motility. In addition studies are necessary, to establish the validity of the results in the clinical environment and to answer conclusively the question "whether epigastric impedance can be developed as an external monitoring technique of gastric acidity and motility"...|$|E
