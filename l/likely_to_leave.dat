5|$|Gregarious German {{cockroaches}} show different behavior when {{reared in}} isolation from when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals {{or the fact that}} the isolated individuals hadn't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae.|$|E
40|$|Using nationally {{representative}} {{data on the}} employed, we assess the effects of gender {{as well as the}} intersection of race and gender on family leave taking post-FMLA. We find that White men are significantly less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take family <b>leaves</b> than White women and men and women of color. Although men across race are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take <b>leaves</b> for newborns, they are almost as <b>likely</b> as women <b>to</b> take <b>leaves</b> for seriously ill children and parents and as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take <b>leaves</b> for spouses. Men, regardless of race, tend <b>to</b> take shorter <b>leaves</b> than women. Our results have important implications for the design of leave policy: the broadening of family leaves beyond parental leaves reduces inequality in likelihood of leave; the introduction of leaves for routine family demands probably does little to reduce gender inequality; unpaid leaves mandated by the FMLA may sustain inequality...|$|R

The data used {{is from the}} First Social Image Survey in 2009, which focused on work situation, cross-strait relations, interpersonal trust, institutional trust, and other related issues. The sample ages are from 19 to 89. The method used is probit modelling for examining the influences on unpaid leave. The main empirical results find that older workers, people with highest educational attainment, widows and widowers, middle class workers, and workers living in eastern areas are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take unpaid <b>leave</b> from the labour market. In particular, male Mainlander workers are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take unpaid <b>leave.</b> Moreover, female workers with highest educational attainment, widowed, and of middle class are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take unpaid <b>leave.</b> Finally, workers with high earnings are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take unpaid <b>leave,</b> but female workers with high family income and female workers who are divorced or separated {{have a higher probability}} of unpaid leave...|$|R
5|$|The Mikea {{live in a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with the neighboring Masikoro farmers and herders, and the Vezo fishing clan. The Mikea live primarily on food scavenged from the forest but also grow seasonal crops. Their mobility and reliance on scavenging as opposed to crop growing shifts in response to changes in environmental and economic pressures on availability of resources within the Mikea {{community as well as}} those of their Vezo and Masikoro neighbors. The Mikea sell their forest products, as well as woven mats and food animals they raise, at weekly Vezo and Masikoro markets in nearby villages to obtain the necessities they cannot scavenge, such as clothing and medicine. Some Mikea migrate for periods of time to work in local villages or the town of Morombe. They are also hired to work for Vezo and Masikoro villagers, such as by cutting forest for villagers or other Mikeas' corn fields, or guarding villagers' zebu herds. They occasionally acquire one or more zebu in addition to or in lieu of payment, as these are seen as a form of wealth and are mainly sacrificed in ancestral ceremonies rather than eaten as food. The rainy season is the time when Mikea are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their scavenging encampments for wage labor opportunities in villages or for the corn harvest. This is also the time when Masikoro and Vezo villagers are most likely to move into the forest to grow corn.|$|E

In his opinion, these trends indicate counter urbanisation rather than white flight.|$|E

Although these episodes may seem a flattery towards the emperor Tiberius, Lepidus' activities in the senate show an independent mind. In 21 AD he made a strong speech {{against the death penalty}} for an irreverent poet. Nevertheless, the poet was executed by order of the senate: this allowed Tiberius to praise Lepidus' moderation (as well as the senate's zeal in persecuting any offence against the emperor).|$|E

25|$|Forced {{prostitution}} and sexual slavery are considered contemporary manifestations of this historical crime, {{and can be}} found anywhere in the world. Women are often entrapped by deceit or coercion with the promise of better life and remain entrapped by force or debt bondage. Forced marriage can also be considered a form of slavery, notably when the bride has no right or opportunity to refuse marriage. This form of marriage can also result out of a kidnapping of girls in order to sell them as brides, a widespread phenomena in China. Once married and raped, there girls are often kept under lock and key until they have a child, at which time they will be less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> because {{they do not want to}} abandon their child.|$|E

This can be the case where a statutory term evaluated by the authority is so general and ambiguous that reasonable people may peg different meanings to it. In such a situation, it is generally left to the authority to evaluate the meaning of the term. This is illustrated by Puhlhofer v. Hillingdon London Borough Council (1986), which involved a public authority that bore a statutory responsibility for providing homeless people with accommodation. The applicants were a married couple who lived with their two children in a single room in a guest house. Their application for permanent accommodation was rejected because the authority claimed they were not [...] "homeless" [...] within the meaning of the statute. The House of Lords upheld this decision, determining that the issue of whether the applicants had accommodation was a question of fact to be determined by the public authority: ...|$|E

500|$|Through {{the winter}} months of the 2007–08 season, Gilberto started {{a limited number of}} games for the Gunners, though he kept his place in the Brazil team, {{starting}} several games for A Seleção. After becoming more and more frustrated with not playing regularly, Gilberto admitted in February 2008 that he had been made to feel [...] "totally useless" [...] by Wenger. Despite this, he declined to make a decision on his future; something which prompted Wenger to promise talks with Gilberto. Amidst Gilberto's frustration at Arsenal, he targeted playing in Brazil's Olympic team in Beijing during August 2008; a competition which he had never played in. Off the pitch, Gilberto was reported to have passed his UK Citizenship test, and that he would subsequently apply for a British passport. April saw Gilberto's season take a turn for the better; making 5 starts – a substantial portion of his seasonal total of 12 – even managing to score a goal. The goal came against Reading on 19 April, and despite its deflective nature leading to some classing it as a possible own goal, the Premier League's Dubious Goals Committee eventually credited the goal to Gilberto. However, Gilberto's return to favour did not stop Arsenal's 2007–08 season ending trophyless. The club subsequently faced the possibility of several players leaving; among those rumoured to leave was Flamini, the player who had kept Gilberto out of the first team. The Frenchman ended up moving to A.C. Milan on 6 May, and a subsequent gap was left in the Arsenal midfield. Gilberto became less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the club during Summer 2008 as a result, and Wenger remarked that he wanted to keep Gilberto; Gilberto saying he wanted to stay and possibly even renew his contract at Arsenal. Gilberto finished the 2007–08 season with 36 appearances for Arsenal, albeit only 12 of these being Premier League starts.|$|E

500|$|The French {{withdrawal}} was not announced and {{was supposed}} to be secret, but the local church leadership found out quickly and the local Catholic community had already begun to move to the ports before end of talks in Geneva. By the time the accords were signed, 45,000 Catholic refugees were already waiting in Hanoi, Haiphong or Hải Dương. According to the records of the Catholic Church, over 70% of Catholics in Bui Chu and Phat Diem left, compared to around 50% in most other areas. The Catholic records claim that only a third of Hanoi Catholics left, and that around 80% of all clergy left. In all areas, a higher proportion of priests left than laypeople, which has been attributed to the communists inflicting heavier punishments on more prominent opposition figures, such as clerics. The departure rate was also lower in areas further removed from the coastal areas and departure ports; in Hưng Hóa, only 11.8% of Catholics were recorded by their diocese as have migrated. It has been speculated that the low rate of Hanoi residents choosing to depart may have been because the city was relatively untouched by the decade of fighting, and that the varying and high rate of departures among rural Catholics was due to the influence of the local clergy; priests in northern Vietnam were noted to be more theocratic and involved in civic decision-making. They used a variety of ways to persuade their disciples to migrate; some explained their belief that circumstances would be difficult for people who did not immigrate, some simply gave dogmatic reasons such as [...] "God is not here any more", while others gave no reason at all and made declarations such as [...] "We are leaving tomorrow" [...] in the expectation that their followers would obey without question. Surveys on the immigrants suggested they were largely content to follow the recommendation of the local priest. In some areas, the bishop in charge of the diocese told Catholics to stay, but laypeople were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> or stay depending on the stance of the local priest with whom they had regular contact; in many cases, such as in Hanoi, a majority of priests ignored their bishop and left anyway.|$|E
