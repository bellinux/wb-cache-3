25|$|As Honda {{entered into}} {{automobile}} manufacturing {{in the late}} 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a <b>little</b> <b>differently</b> than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport {{which was part of}} a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire {{to be the first to}} try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable valve timing technology, Honda calls VTEC.|$|E
25|$|Velvet worms are {{segmented}} {{animals with}} a flattened cylindrical body cross-section {{and rows of}} unstructured body appendages known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). The animals grow to between 0.5 and 20cm (.2 to 8in), with the average being about 5cm (2 in), and have between 13 and 43 pairs of legs. Their skin consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin s, excretion organs and concentrations of nerve cells. The individual body sections are largely unspecialised; even the head develops only a <b>little</b> <b>differently</b> from the abdominal segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same gene as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during embryonic development, at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the protostome group, their early development has a deuterostome trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.|$|E

500|$|In {{original}} {{performances of}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{the actor who}} played Egeus and the actor who played Philostrate were probably one and the same. This can be gathered through discrepancies between the First Folio and earlier quarto versions of the play. In Act V, scene 1, for example, the quartos say [...] "Call Philostrate" [...] in several places where the 1623 Folio says [...] "Call Egeus". This would be an easy mistake to make if one actor had spoken both parts in this scene. One actor filling both roles explains the jumbled dialogue in this scene. Howard Furness, editor of several Shakespeare editions, interprets this a <b>little</b> <b>differently,</b> saying that Shakespeare may not have originally intended both roles to be played by the same person, but that directors combined the roles to save money. In any case, Act V, scene 1 is the only scene in which both men are present at the same time. In cases where one actor was playing both roles, Egeus' character would probably have filled both roles in this scene, absorbing Philostrate's lines into his own.|$|E

[...] Jackson also felt that the couple's relationship was crucial to Lucky's growth and acceptance of his parents, stating to Soaps In Depth in 1999: [...] "I think it was through that relationship and that love that Lucky obtained a sense of peace that made him want to mend things with his parents more. I don't think he would have done it otherwise." [...] When Jackson left the series in April 1999, Lucky and Elizabeth's teenage romance ends as Lucky is presumed dead in a fire. The couple attempts reconciliation from 2000 to 2002 during Jacob Young's tenure, and reunites in 2005 while Greg Vaughan played the role. Lucky and Elizabeth have an on-and-off relationship throughout the years that includes marriages, infidelity and children.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{article is}} based on {{selected}} themes in my keynote at the 20 th conference of The Nordic Network of Music Education Research (NNMPF) held at The Royal College of Music in Stockholm, 23 April 2014. Starting from the development of music education as an academic area in Sweden this article discusses challenges to music education research (henceforth referred to as MER) viewed through Swedish glasses. The complexity of MER, still a rather young but by now a well-established multi-disciplinary research area and academic subject/profile, respectively, calls for reconsideration of topics of interest. The maturity of MER also calls for careful navigation in a landscape with changing conditions for music learning and teaching. Challenges, strengths and dilemmas common to MER and to educational science in general are discussed as well as challenges concerning learning and teaching in music, topics that may remain <b>little</b> or <b>differently</b> explored in other academic domains. Keywords: Music education, knowledge formation, learning, teaching, educational science...|$|R

Problems with requirements and with setting up the right processes to deal with them are the area of Requirements Management. Over the years there was defined a few best practices within this scope. This thesis describes some basic techniques, methods and rules. There is also a requirements splitting into five types.
