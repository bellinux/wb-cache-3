40|$|Catch shares or Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) are {{economic}} instruments used in fisheries {{to address}} common pool problems. They attempt to increase economic yield from the fishery by allocating exclusive and secure fishing rights and by promoting catch constraints {{that will lead}} to stock rebuilding. The catch shares are transferable, which results in a market for both sales and temporary <b>leasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> within the fishery. Fishers are expected to make their decisions in line with good stewardship practices because they benefit from future improvements in the stock, and efficiency of harvesting increases as quota is transferred to more efficient operators. There is empirical evidence that some successes towards these goals has been achieved by ITQs, such as fleet rationalization, however, some issues arise when fishers do not behave as expected. Therefore, knowing how fisheries respond to ITQs and how the incentives change with changing stock abundances is critical in assisting fisheries managers when designing polices. In this thesis the total allowable catch (TAC) setting process in Australian and New Zealand ITQ fisheries were analysed to identify factors that prevent fishers exercising good stewardship. The Tasmanian rock lobster fishery (TRLF) was then used as a case study to analyse the sale and lease quota market. Changes in quota transfers and interactions between operators in response to changes in stock abundance were assessed. Finally, an experimental economic approach was used to assess factors that may promote cooperation when restocking is used as a tool to address stock and congestion externalities that result in spatial stock heterogeneity. The aim of the thesis was get a higher understanding of factors that may prevent expected outcomes emerging from ITQ systems. A fundamental and expected outcome of ITQ systems is resource stewardship through the setting of conservative TACs. This is anticipated to be promoted by increase in catch share values that results from higher catch rates, in combination with security and exclusivity. Despite most of the analysed fisheries behaving as expected, a nontrivial fraction consistently showed lack of stewardship, keeping constant and even increasing the TACs when stock status and asset values were trending downward. Several reasons were identified as a cause of this behaviour, the most frequent being a lack of understanding or acceptance of the principle underlying the ITQ systems. For instance, TAC constraints were interpreted as a reduction in profitability which indicated no understanding or value placed on the economic benefit of higher future catch rates. This analysis showed that despite the fact that stewardship is possible in ITQ fisheries, it is not inevitable and additional conditions are required to promote stewardship. Stock abundance can change as a consequence of a lack of stewardship and/or natural causes such as recruitment failures. This can potentially be reflected in the quota markets, as they are expected to respond to variations in economic rent from the fishery. Since the ITQ system was introduced in the TRLF, the stock has shown two periods of trends in abundance - a period of stock growth between 1998 and 2006, followed by a period of stock decline between 2007 and 2011. These changes affected quota markets in the fishery with a trend of increasing activity in the permanent quota trade market during the period of stock growth and during both periods in the quota lease market. The transfer of quota units was not associated with the operators’ technical efficiency (i. e. catching capability) as predicted for ITQ fisheries, but linked to their financial capacity (i. e. number of owned quota units). The stock decline changed fishers’ behaviour, with those previously active reducing their activity in the quota lease market, and those inactive becoming involved in the market, resulting in an expanding fleet with more small operators. Stock abundance changes also affected the lease quota trade network with increased interactions during the period of stock growth, which lasted until the second year of the period of stock decline. Individuals had greatest level of connection (traded quotas) with other fishers at this time, following which the trend reversed as the stock declined. The social capital of active operators and position in the lease quota trade network was mostly influenced by the fishing operation characteristics, and by quota ownership in the case of investors. Different dimensions of social capital influenced the success of operators in the fisher and caused them to modify their trading interactions in response to changes in stock abundance. There were some indications of asymmetry in bargaining power, such as between small and large quota owners and this relationship changed when the stock declined and the lease quota trade market became less competitive. In addition to temporal variations, stock may vary spatially in terms of abundance and/or resource quality. ITQ systems do not delineate who can fish in each specific patch; therefore, fishers target more profitable areas, which generates stock and congestion externalities. An economic experiment was used to assess the effect of different factors promoting cooperation, including when restocking was used to address stock and congestion externalities and the consequent rent dissipation. When policies involved compulsory actions and economic punishment some extent of cooperation was reached. The highest level of cooperation occurred when the policy design gave the option of choosing between getting involved in the restocking plan or not. Nonetheless, evidence showed that the voluntary option should be complemented with a measure that provided those individuals who are intrinsically cooperative with security that those liable to free-riding are either physically excluded from or punished for fishing in the restocked area. When the design only included a voluntary setting, free-riders dominated. Thus, depending on signals conveyed by the rules, intrinsically cooperative individuals may lead the economic exchanges to an equilibrium of low rent dissipation and vice versa. This research makes a contribution to the discussion of factors that affect fishers’ decisions, and how in some cases these decisions prevent expected outcomes of the ITQ system. This provides guidance on the design of management policies in the context of ITQ systems...|$|E

The {{debate in}} {{commercial}} fishery management {{has evolved from}} whether well-defined rights are necessary for sustainability to evaluating {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of different rights based system designs. Two of Latin America's largest fisheries, the Chilean Jack Mackerel and Peruvian Anchovy, allocate quota at the vessel-level and restrict the <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> other than within firms and through the optional formation of associations. Transfer of a permanent allocation can only occur via vessel sale or removal from the fishery. This design impacts the divisibility and transferability of the right. Thus, incentives for permanent quota transfers and leases differ from those under a traditional individual transferable quota program. We use data on the Chilean Jack Mackerel fishery and examine multiple performance margins, tracking the evolution of the fishery after program implementation to explore the extent to which associations serve as a mechanism for fishery consolidation. We find evidence of consolidation, with the number of vessels decreasing to less than a third of the pre-program number by the 5 th year of the program. We also investigate vessel and trip characteristics, as well as trip costs and revenues. We estimate that the program led to a measurable increase in variable fishing profits, on the order of 33 - 35 % of ex-vessel revenue. Accompanying the increase was a movement toward higher value products, consolidation of catch on larger vessels, and vessels taking longer trips with greater catch-per-trip. Finally, we examine the performance of these defacto markets, considering both within firm and within association transfers over time...|$|R

40|$|Understanding how fishers behave {{and make}} {{decisions}} is critical in determining how best to manage fisheries. If the response of fishers to management measures can be predicted, unexpected and undesirable outcomes can be avoided. Individual transferable quota (ITQ) management has been introduced in many international fisheries, {{with the purpose of}} accounting for human behaviour, as it theoretically generates behavioural incentives that are aligned with management objectives (e. g. reducing fishing costs). The ability of ITQ systems to meet continuing economic, ecological and social objectives therefore is centred on ensuring fisher behavioural incentives remain aligned with those objectives. This thesis used the Tasmanian southern rock lobster (TSRL) fishery in Australia as a case study to assess changing fishing practices and behaviour of fishers under ITQ management and how this had evolved through time. The aim was to improve general understanding of how ITQ implementation and design may affect fisher decision-making and improve certainty in fishery management outcomes. It is critical that an ITQ system is able to manage interactions with all ecosystem components (e. g. non-target species) as required under ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM) principles. The TSRL fishery to some extent, was more successful than other fisheries in accounting for these interactions, due to the selective and benign nature of potting. In many sustainably certified fisheries, input controls continue to be used in place of ITQ systems to manage ecosystem components, particularly in non-selective fisheries (e. g. trawl). The continued use of input controls however, can reduce the security of a fisher’s ITQ right through loss of access and potentially separate their incentives and behaviour from management objectives. Successful ITQ management also requires the managing authority to set a binding total allowable catch (TAC). Between 2008 and 2010, the TSRL had a non-binding TAC, which reduced the price <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> on the market and caused a reactivation of latent effort, increase in fleet capacity, reduction in economic efficiency and dissipation of economic rent, as fishers engaged in a competitive race to fish during times of high revenue. Changing fishing practices such as “double night fishing” during these years also had the potential to lead to localised stock depletion through concentration of effort, however the format of the commercial logbook prevented a precise assessment of the fleet-wide extent and impact of double night fishing. Consequently, this research highlighted the importance of being able to collect fine-scale spatial and temporal data on fishing effort in order to enhance decision-making. It is also important in an ITQ system that those actively fishing own the majority <b>of</b> their <b>quota</b> units. An implicit assumption behind the theory of ITQs is that those fishing are quota owners, however in many developed ITQ fisheries, with free transferability <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> units, the majority of the fishing is undertaken by lease quota fishers. Following analysis of the physical risk tolerance <b>of</b> both <b>quota</b> owners and lease quota fishers in the TSRL fishery, it was evident that their behavioural drivers were divergent. Lease quota fishers were more responsive to changes in expected revenue than quota owners, leading in some areas to significantly higher risk tolerance levels. In other words lease quota fishers were more prepared to take greater risks at sea than quota owners when expected revenue was high. This result was not entirely unexpected as lease quota fishers face high costs <b>of</b> <b>leasing</b> <b>quota</b> and an increasing “cost price squeeze” between what that must pay to lease quota and what they are paid for their catch. Consequently, their behavioural incentives and underlying business structures are likely to be different. This was also evident in a series of economic experiments that were conducted to examine the propensity of groups with varying numbers <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> owners and <b>lease</b> quota fishers, to coordinate to prevent assignment problems that cause economic rent dissipation. Heterogeneous groups <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> <b>quota</b> fishers and quota owners were less successful in coordinating with communication than homogenous groups <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> owners. This was because lease quota fishers were less likely to adopt a socially-optimal strategy for preventing rent dissipation compared with quota owners due to having: (i) inequality in wealth; (ii) insecurity of tenure and; (iii) asymmetric information exchange. It was only through the institution of income-sharing cooperatives that lease quota fishers chose to coordinate because income-sharing offset the incentive to over-appropriate the resource, if participants doubt that others would do the same. While requiring external validation in the field, the results highlight the importance of recognising and understanding the differing behavioural incentives <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> <b>quota</b> fishers and quota owners. They also highlight the need for managers to consider the trade-offs associated with allowing free transferability <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> units and whether this meets overarching management objectives. While contributing to further discussion and debate on {{the costs and benefits of}} ITQ management, this research highlighted the importance of understanding behavioural incentives of different types of fishers in order to inform management decision making. This type of research now and in the future has the potential to inform and ultimately improve the design and implementation of ITQ management systems...|$|R
40|$|Fisheries {{management}} decisions {{have the potential}} to influence the safety of fishers by affecting how and when they fish. This implies a responsibility of government agencies to consider how fishers may behave under different policies and regulations {{in order to reduce the}} incidence of undesirable operational health and safety outcomes. In the Tasmanian southern rock lobster fishery, Australia, the expansion <b>of</b> the <b>quota</b> <b>lease</b> market under individual transferable quota (ITQ) management coincided with a rise in the number of commercial fishing fatalities, with five between 2008 and 2012. A discrete choice model of daily participation was fitted to compare whether physical risk tolerance varied between fishers who owned the majority <b>of</b> their <b>quota</b> units (quota owners) and those who mainly leased (lease quota fishers). In general, fishers were averse to physical risk (wave height), however this was offset by increases in expected revenue. Lease quota fishers were more responsive to changes in expected revenue than quota owners, which contributed to risk tolerance levels that were significantly higher than those <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> owners in some areas. This pattern in behaviour appeared to be related to the cost <b>of</b> <b>leasing</b> <b>quota.</b> Although ITQs have often been considered to reduce the incentive for fishers to operate in hazardous weather conditions, this assumes fishing by quota owners. This analysis indicated that this doesn't hold true for lease quota fishers in an ITQ system, where in some instances there remains an economic incentive to fish in conditions with high levels of physical risk...|$|R
