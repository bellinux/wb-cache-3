Round the clock Internet access is available. Apart from this, the University campus is Wi - Fi enabled with 18 ‘hot spots’ spread across the campus providing users with instant Internet access on their personal computers and laptops.

50|$|The e-network {{is made up}} of a large undersea {{cable network}} and {{satellite}} connectivity provided through C-Band transponders of the INTELSAT-904 or RASCOM satellites. A Hub Earth Station of the project, located in Senegal, is connected to the participant universities and super specialty hospitals, through an International Private <b>Leased</b> <b>Circuit</b> (IPLC) that links it to a submarine cable landing station in India. Each partner nation from Africa has a tele-education terminal, a telemedicine terminal and a VVIP communication node for the head of State linked to the network. The network, designed to have 169 terminals and a central hub that delivers services, uses state of the art technology that is compatible with broadband technologies like Wi-Fi and WiMax. The network can also be scaled up to support increases in user numbers and to cater to different applications. The project is being implemented by the Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) which is responsible for the project's design, operationalisation and maintenance. A data centre at its office in New Delhi acts as a hub for all Indian sites. As a precursor to e-Network project, a pilot project was successfully undertaken in Ethiopia in 2006 that provided education services from IGNOU at New Delhi and telemedicine services from CARE Hospital, Hyderabad.|$|E

40|$|Data {{delivery}} in the Deep Space Network (DSN) involves transmission {{of a small}} amount of constant, high-priority traffic and a large amount of bursty, low priority data. The bursty traffic may be initially buffered and then metered back slowly as bandwidth becomes available. Today both types of data are transmitted over dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>circuits.</b> The authors investigated the potential of saving money by designing a hybrid communications architecture that uses <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> for high-priority network communications and dial-up circuits for low-priority traffic. Such an architecture may significantly reduce costs and provide an emergency backup. The architecture presented here may also be applied to any ground station-to-customer network within the range of a common carrier.

By 1995, NASCOM was the largest of five wide-area networks operated by NASA, with 900 <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> and a budget of $63 million. It employed 21 civil servants and 210 contracted personnel under two contracts. Soon after, NASA undertook an effort to consolidate these networks, in order to realize cost savings. In its FY1995 Nascom System Development Plan, the NASA Communications Division underwent reorganization, with contractors taking over operations and maintenance roles previously performed by civil servants. The plan expressed the need to convert to standardized network systems.|$|R
50|$|The SWAN is {{required}} to be an open standards based, scalable, high capacity network to carry voice, data and video traffic between the designated State Government offices at the State, district and sub division / block levels.

50|$|BTC has a {{telecommunications}} infrastructure {{that is one}} of the most modern in Africa. Its network, composed of an all-digital microwave and fibre optic system with digital exchanges at the main centres, provides a high quality service. The current network comprises 7 300 kilometers of microwave radio and fibre optic links between 12 main processors, each serving a specific area of the country. The switching units have a capacity of about 117 000 lines. Current services provided include national and international telephony, managed and data networks, very small aperture terminal (VSAT), private wires, <b>leased</b> <b>circuits,</b> toll free services, Internet, paging, public telephones, voice messaging, telex, packet switching, telegraph and customer premises. International access is provided from Botswana to almost every country in the world.|$|R
50|$|As pair gain {{electronics}} and point-to-point microwave radio links came into widespread use throughout the public switched telephone network, telephone companies filed tariffs to eliminate their past responsibility of providing <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> with direct current continuity. If {{the base station}} were located across town in an area served by a different telephone exchange, the only available circuits reaching the distant exchange might be a single voice-grade channel in a D-4 channel bank on a DS-1 or a single microwave radio baseband channel. Tone remotes became necessary with the wide use of telephone carrier or multiplexing equipment. They require only a voice-grade audio path with roughly flat equalization from 300-3,000 Hz. A circuit that could pass audio in both directions {{could be used for}} remote control.|$|R
40|$|Fibre Channel (FC) based Storage Area Networks (SANs) {{have gained}} great success in local data centers (accounting {{for more than}} 90 % of all SAN {{installations}} world wide).

There are two approaches currently available, one is through IP networks called Storage over IP (SoIP), the other is through <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> (SONET/SDH circuits or WDM lightpaths). The former is low-cost and low-performance while the latter is high-performance and high-cost. We propose an approach between these two, {{which is based on}} dynamic SONET circuits.

40|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{revised the}} Public Telecommunications Law and issued the relevant Act and Ordinance on 23 October 1982. Ten {{years have passed}} since the first liberalization opened up the public networks for data communication. The newly revised Law paves the way for more liberal use of <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> and networks from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (NTT). Further, it permits activities of specialized telecommunications service agencies to compete with the government-owned and monopolized NTT in the domestic data communication market. Industrial and financial circles have demanded both, as they would like to spread their computer communication networks more extensively, and offer some specialized telecommunication services within their own community. The historical and social background to this remarkable liberalization were discussed in a recent article in Telecommunications Policy. ...|$|R
50|$|Besides GMPLS, {{the main}} {{competitors}} to MPLS are Shortest Path Bridging (SPB), Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB), and MPLS-TP. These also provide {{services such as}} service provider layer 2 and layer 3 VPNs. L2TPv3 has been suggested as a competitor, but has not reached any wider success. Some internet providers are offering different services to customers along with MPLS. These services mainly include National Private <b>Lease</b> <b>Circuit</b> (NPLC), ILL, IPLC etc.As an example of NPLC, consider City A and City B. An organisation has an office in each city. The organisation requires connectivity between these two offices. The ISP {{will have access to}} a PoP in each city and therefore has a link between the PoPs.
