40|$|The {{mobility}} figures used in {{this thesis}} come from a national mobility survey carried out in Austria in 1995. I carried out a poll with employees and students {{in order to get}} results referring to my field of research - mobility at the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration in general and its effects on the relocation. To ensure better opportunities of comparison with my own data, two separate studies concerning students and employees were used. The deviation between the different sets of data was only minimal. In general, public transport is made good use of, but employees also tend to use their cars. Biking and walking are rarely used options. While employees often have <b>long</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and rather choose a direct <b>way</b> <b>to</b> their place of work, students often settle close to the university and are prone to trip chaining. Moving the university to a new building is definitely to be approved of. In this way all the departments can be located in one building and ways within the grounds can be shortened. Furthermore a new location provides the latest technical equipment and infrastructure. As the study shows, many students attend university several times a day and thus the Prater Park would surely add recreational value. Nevertheless the results also show that students and employees alike have ambivalent attitudes towards the - 83 - relocation as they are afraid of longer journeys. There is a high likelihood of them if the system of public transport is not better developed. ( [...] .) In conclusion one can emphasize that the relocation is a great opportunity to change traffic behaviour positively - towards ecofriendly public transport, biking and walking - and to make public transport more attractive through alterations or extensions.

40|$|Voting {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} cornerstones of a demo-cratic nation. The right to cast a ballot is one that denotes full civil membership in our society. It is also an essential building block of a minority community’s political infrastructure and a major asset that can advance as well as protect its group interests. The right to vote, of course, has been contested throughout much of Ameri-can history. The struggles through civil rights litigation, legisla-tion, and activism have been fought to ensure minority groups and women have the same voting rights and opportunities as all other citizens. There has been progress, but more needs to be done. For Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs), the de-velopment of a viable and influential electorate is perhaps the most formidable challenge to their political empowerment. AAPIs have gained increasing visibility with the over 2, 000 AAPI elected and major appointed officials across the nation. They include Washing-ton Governor Gary Locke, presidential cabinet secretaries Elaine Chao and Norman Mineta, members of Congress, and a number of state legislatures and municipalities (Nakanishi and Lai 2003 b).
