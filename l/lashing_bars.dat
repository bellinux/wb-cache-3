40|$|This paper {{solved the}} problem that <b>lash</b> <b>bars</b> were {{difficult}} to be quickly and accurately counted,and proposed a kind of <b>lash</b> <b>bar</b> count algorithm based on image recognition through observation and study of the morphology of <b>lash</b> <b>bars,</b> namely the algorithm that combines cross type algorithm and flexible T type algorithm. Firstly,the color image is processed by graying and threshold method binarization. Secondly,the cross type discriminance {{is used in the}} middle section of the binary image. Thirdly,the flexible T type discriminance is used to detect on the boundary. Experimental analysis indicates that the detection algorithm saves time, which can be identified and gives the number of bars in a time less than 3 s. The accuracy of bar count is as high as 98 %. After joining the artificial modification, it can reach 100 %...|$|R
