5|$|The global {{economic}} {{depression of the}} early 1930s affected Ireland <b>less</b> <b>because</b> of the partial recovery following {{the civil war and}} because industry was protected behind tariff barriers established in the Anglo-Irish Trade War (1932–1938). The need for extra sea capacity was readily met by British and other foreign ships. Foreign ships were used, rather than preserving the home fleet. Banks were reluctant to lend to Irish industry, preferring British government gilts.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{can form}} {{multiply}} bonded chains, a property it shares with its lighter homolog, carbon. Its {{capacity to do}} so is much <b>less</b> <b>because</b> the Pb–Pb bond energy is over three and a half times lower than that of the C–C bond. With itself lead can build metal–metal bonds of an order up to three. With carbon, lead forms organolead compounds similar to, but generally less stable than, typical organic compounds (due to the Pb–C bond being rather weak). This makes the organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide-ranging than that of tin. It predominantly forms organolead(IV) compounds, even when starting with inorganic lead(II) reactants; very few organolead(II) compounds are known. The most well-characterized exceptions are Pb2 and Pb(η5-C5H5)2.|$|E
5|$|In {{regions of}} the Old World where they are indigenous, honeybees (Apis mellifera) {{are among the most}} {{important}} pollinators, vital to sustain natural habitats there in addition to their value for human societies (to sustain food resources). Where honeybee populations decline, there is also a decline in plant populations. In agriculture, some plants are completely dependent on honeybees to pollinate them to produce fruit, while other plants are only dependent on honeybees to enhance their capacity to produce better and healthier fruits. Honeybees also help plants to reduce time between flowering and fruit set, which reduces risk from harmful factors such as pests, diseases, chemicals, weather, etc. Specialist plants that require honeybees will be at more risk if honeybees decline, whereas generalist plants that use other animals as pollinators (or wind pollinating or self-pollinating) will suffer <b>less</b> <b>because</b> they have other sources of pollination.|$|E

25|$|The gradual slowing of the Earth's {{rotation}} {{affects the}} date of the equinox: drift in ecclesiastical full moons calculated by the Gregorian method compared to the true full moons is far <b>less</b> <b>because</b> the increase in the length of the day is almost exactly compensated for by the slowdown in the length of the month as tidal braking reduces the energy in the system.|$|E

25|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs cause {{temporary}} {{regression of}} fibroids by decreasing estrogen levels. Because {{of the limitations}} and side effects of this medication, it is rarely recommended other than for preoperative use to shrink {{the size of the}} fibroids and uterus before surgery. It is typically used for a maximum of 6 months or <b>less</b> <b>because</b> after longer use they could cause osteoporosis and other typically postmenopausal complications. The main side effects are transient postmenopausal symptoms. In many cases the fibroids will regrow after cessation of treatment, however, significant benefits may persist for much longer in some cases. Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency. Several add-back regimes are possible, tibolone, raloxifene, progestogens alone, estrogen alone, and combined estrogens and progestogens.|$|E

Entering and exiting the same station within three hours accrues an excursion fare of $5.75.

To make the film, however, Kiarostami coaxed the antagonists to re-stage scenes occurring between them, including the arrest. While such a technique clearly precludes labeling the film as a documentary, by re-staging events between the deceiver and the deceived Kiarostami implicitly poses questions about the validity and significance of what the audience sees. Because these are the actual participants in a drama played out in criminal court, it dawns on the audience that these re-stagings {{are also part of}} the real life of these people, especially since both the impersonator and the family he fooled were interested in working in cinema. If these re-enactments constitute a kind of [...] "evidence", this is <b>less</b> <b>because</b> they show us what took place to cause the arrest than because the audience is witness to a scene in which the actors are in fact continuing the story of their confrontation and/or reconciliation.|$|E

500|$|Cleveland's term {{as mayor}} was spent {{fighting}} the entrenched {{interests of the}} party machines. Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street-cleaning bill passed by the Common Council. The street-cleaning contract was open for bids, and the Council selected the highest bidder at $422,000, rather than the lowest of $100,000 <b>less,</b> <b>because</b> of the political connections of the bidder. While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo, Mayor Cleveland {{would have none of}} it. His veto message said, [...] "I regard it as the culmination of a most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money." [...] The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder. Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted. For this, and other actions safeguarding public funds, Cleveland's reputation as a leader willing to purge government corruption began to spread beyond Erie County.|$|E
