5|$|Harajuku Lovers Live was {{released}} {{in conjunction with the}} promotion for The Sweet Escape, which was also released on December 5, 2006. The DVD received mixed reviews, with reviewers praising Stefani's musical performances and stage presence, but criticizing the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> and the long costume changes. The DVD was certified gold in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association and platinum in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.|$|E
5|$|Hurd {{was cast}} after having {{appeared}} in other television shows by Law & Order creator Dick Wolf. Although Wolf promised her Jeffries would develop more over time, Hurd grew {{frustrated with the}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> for her character. The show's producers hesitated to keep her as Munch's full-time partner and considered eliminating the character from the show altogether. Hurd eventually departed herself to join the drama television series Leap Years. The actress earned some critical praise for her performance as Jeffries, but several commentators said the character was never properly fleshed out.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{started in}} December 1971 at Morgan Studios, London. Unlike {{previous}} albums, where Anderson had generally written songs in advance, only the initial {{section of the}} album had been worked out when the band went into the studio. The remainder of the suite was written during the recording sessions. To compensate for a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material,</b> Anderson got up early each morning to prepare music {{for the rest of}} the band to learn during that day's session. The lyrics were written first, with the music constructed to fit around them. Anderson recalls the album took about two weeks to record and another two or three for overdubs and mixing. The final work spanned the entire length of an LP record, split over two sides.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1972, Marvin Gaye was {{suffering}} from writer's block. Following the release of his most commercially successful album up to that point, What's Going On (1971), and the soundtrack album to the blaxploitation film Trouble Man (1972), Gaye had struggled {{to come up with}} new material after Motown Records had renegotiated a new contract with him. The contract provided him with more creative control over his recordings. The deal was worth $1 million, making him the highest-earning soul artist, as well as the highest-earning black artist, at the time. He was also struggling with deciding whether or not to relocate to Los Angeles, following Motown-CEO Berry Gordy's move of the record label and replacement of the Detroit-based Hitsville U.S.A. (Motown Studio A) recording studio with the Hitsville West studio in Los Angeles. Amid relocation and his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material,</b> Gaye was struggling with his conscience, as well as dealing with expectations from his wife, Gordy's sister Anna. Gaye's separation from Gordy pressured him emotionally. During this time, he had also been attempting to cope with past issues that had stemmed from his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Stefani's {{performance}} in late November 2005 {{in her home}} town of Anaheim, California was recorded and released on DVD as a video album Harajuku Lovers Live. It was released on December 5, 2006, the same release date as Stefani's second album, The Sweet Escape. The DVD was directed by Sophie Muller. The concert features performances of all twelve songs from Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and two new songs from her second studio album, The Sweet Escape, as well as interviews with the musicians and dancers and a documentary of tour preparation. The DVD received similar mixed reviews to the concerts themselves. Reviewers praised Stefani's musical performances and stage presence, but criticizing the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> and the long costume changes. The DVD was certified gold in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association and platinum in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.|$|E

This includes {{the writings of the}} Apostolic Fathers, Apologists, Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus of Lyons, Origen of Alexandria and the New Testament Apocrypha, among others. In contrast, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (consisting mainly of Augustine, Jerome and Chrysostom) fills twenty-eight volumes.|$|E

Construction was halted in 1942 due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material,</b> but began again in 1943. The {{building}} of the two ships was constantly delayed due to damage from aircraft raids, material supply delays and shortages of copper, among other problems, resulting in very slow progress. The two ships were blown up in 1945 by Allied troops. The other three ships: Z48, Z49, and Z50 were ordered on 12 June 1943, but never laid down.|$|E

Kabakov interpreted the work as a simple but universal metaphor about the individual who is always waiting for something, but never receives anything. Instead, the Italians and critics of communism interpreted the work as signifying Soviet culture and its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> reward. The publicity Kabakov received prevented him from getting work as an illustrator for four years, forcing him to work under someone else’s name.

During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Meucci claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834. In 1886, {{in the first of}} three cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's evidence in this case was disputed due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> evidence of his inventions as his working models were reportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph (ADT) of New York.

25|$|Oberst (Colonel) Leibrock, {{commander}} of BRIR 6, {{had been taken}} prisoner; after the war, he published {{a report on the}} fate of the regiment. He wrote that the regiment had not been placed under the command of the 28th Reserve Division and 12th Division, until the British-French preparatory bombardment had begun, {{that there had been a}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> to build dug outs and obstacles and the work could not be done in daylight. The regiment had been split, battalions assigned elsewhere and companies had been used piecemeal as reinforcements. On 1 July, the commander lost telephone communication with most of the regiment and had no control over the supply of food and ammunition. Leibrock wrote that it would have been better to move the regiment into line as a unit and move neighbouring units sideways. The infantry had fought a determined defensive battle and had been overwhelmed. In 2005, Sheldon wrote that the 2nd Army had lost the initiative on the Somme during the preliminary bombardment, rather than on 1 July and that the defence of the area south of the Albert–Bapaume road was conducted in an atmosphere of crisis, in which units were thrown into battle to plug gaps rather than as formed units, which increased German loses.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{purchasing}} new rolling stock for the Gråkallen Line, the city trams were to start {{operating on the}} line. Trondheim Sporvei needed buses for {{the closing of the}} Singsaker Line, and made a deal with Graakalbanen, where the latter would purchase four new Büssing buses and rent them out to Trondheim Sporvei for the amortization cost, in exchange for renting excess trams. Each bus cost NOK 237,000. However, there was a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> in Trondheim Sporvei, and not until 7 November 1966 could a TS Class 7 city tram be taken into use. This was supplemented with a trailer on 6 February 1967. Also, there was operated a direct route from Lian to Lade during the morning rush hour. Seven additional buses were ordered in 1968, financed through a NOK 1.750,000 loan. In exchange the company got five additional trams. However, Trondheim Sporvei had problems delivering the trams. With this deal in place, the oldest trams could be retired. However, during from 30 June to 19 August 1968, Trondheim Sporvei needed the trams again, and the old Class 1 was back in service. The final run of the Class 1 in regular service was on 29 November 1968. From 19 May 1969 the trams lost their conductors.|$|E

He was {{concerned}} over the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> the band had to {{record for the}} album. The idea of reworking [...] "Back on the Chain Gang" [...] into a Spanish-language cumbia song captivated him and he asked Vela to write its translation. After discovering that Selena had sampled her song, Pretenders' vocalist Chrissie Hynde prevented the band from releasing Amor Prohibido because of her copyrights and demanded a translation from Vela before she approved a rights agreement. At the time of Hynde's refusal, the band had $475,000 (1994 USD) of pre-sale copies in a warehouse that included [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos". Noticing it was the shortest track on Amor Prohibido, musicologist James Perone felt that [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] had [...] "stripped some of the edge off of Hynde's text but retained the basic premise of [...] ".

Nonetheless, he praised the compilation for highlighting [...] "the sheer athleticism and skill that propelled Carey’s early work. She took very simple songs—both in terms of arrangements and theme—rooted in pop, gospel, and R and turned them into feats of strength, granting them dynamism and drama with a voice that juggled power, clarity, and agility with ease".|$|E
500|$|Michelle Hurd had {{appeared}} on the television series Law & Order, making a guest appearance on the seventh season episode [...] "Entrapment" [...] in 1997. Hurd also previously appeared in the television shows New York Undercover and Players, {{both of which were}} produced by Law & Order creator Dick Wolf. When Wolf approached Hurd to play the part of Monique Jeffries, he warned her that the part was small at first but had the potential to develop, telling her, [...] "Think of her as a flower, she'll bloom later, but for the pilot she's just got a scene." [...] The character also had less screen-time than others in the series, in part so that Hurd could accept theater roles. However, Hurd felt the Jeffries character never received the development promised, claiming she [...] "just read instructions" [...] while playing the part. While she liked being part of the cast, Hurd said she was frustrated with the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> for her character, particularly when guest stars had more developed roles than Jeffries herself.|$|E
