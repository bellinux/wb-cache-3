30|$|<b>Landmarks</b> can be {{categorized}} depending on {{their participation in the}} verification process. Deployment of location verification may involve two types of landmarks: active and passive. Active <b>landmarks</b> initiate measurements, collect RTT values, and may follow a learning process and derive distance from RTT values. Passive <b>landmarks</b> only reply to probing requests when they are solicited by active <b>landmarks</b> to collect RTT values. All approaches analyzed in this paper use active <b>landmarks</b> except the one proposed in [23], which deploys only passive <b>landmarks</b> and measurements are performed by a virtual machine located on CSP.|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on the {{physical}} and architectural features of <b>landmarks.</b> Other studies mentioned the cognitive and semantic aspects of <b>landmarks.</b> It can be noted that there is a methodological and/or onthological dichotomy in the determination of landmarks: subjective <b>landmarks</b> and objective <b>landmarks.</b> In addition, even though there are some studies that classify <b>landmarks</b> considering their locations, there is no study that focuses on the placement of <b>landmarks</b> in syntactical spatial configuration. The syntactical location is important especially in historical cities. <b>Landmarks</b> generally exist in the centre (or in integrated areas) of the old city.
