40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experimental and}} numerical procedures to estimate friction torque on a rotating shaft due to radial elastomeric seals. Two different test rigs have been built, {{in order to}} highlight {{the relationship between the}} overall friction and the local behaviour of each <b>lip</b> <b>portion</b> in presence of dynamic eccentricities. A direct measurement has been performed with a rotating shaft machine and results have been compared with the torque calculated as product of a global frictional coefficient and the normal stress on the lip surface. The latter has been computed by an improved FEM simulation which has been specifically optimized in order to evaluate the lip deformation due to mounting interference. Previous experimental results about radial and tangential oscillation of a limited lip region allowed to calculate the frictional coefficient as the ratio of the friction force and the force pressing the lip on the shaft surface...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the sealing {{mechanism}} of an oil seal, {{it is necessary to}} know its fundamental properties and movement now in action. There are two subjects in this study. One is to reveal the temperature dependence of fundamental properties, mainly wringing force, average wringing pressure and lip contact width, and the other is to know the lip temperature now in action and to know how the lubrication is carried out at the <b>lip</b> <b>portion.</b> The measurements were carried out with our devised instruments for the former subject and with a thermocouple for the latter. A simple analysis of the lip temperature obtained was made in order to know a mechanism of the lubrication. The results indicate that with the rise of temperature of oil seal, the wringing force and the average wringing pressure decrease because of the reduction of rubber elastic modulus and of thermal expansion of spring, and the lip contact width hardly varies, and also indicate that under a constant temperature of lubricating oil, the lip temperature never rises so high {{as in the case of}} free rising of oil temperature, and that the fluid lubrication is carried out at the lip...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe lateral intraparietal area (<b>LIP),</b> a <b>portion</b> of monkey {{posterior}} parietal cortex, {{has been}} implicated in spatial attention. We review recent evidence from our laboratory showing that LIP encodes a priority map of the external environment that specifies the momentary locus of attention and is activated {{in a variety of}} behavioral tasks. The priority map in LIP is shaped by task-specific variables. We suggest that the multifaceted responses in LIP represent mechanisms for allocating attention, and that the attentional system may flexibly configure itself to meet the cognitive, motor and motivational demands of individual tasks...|$|R

5000|$|A {{plate is}} a broad, concave, but mainly flat vessel on which food can be served. [...] A plate {{can also be}} used for {{ceremonial}} or decorative purposes. Most plates are circular, but they may be any shape, or made of any water-resistant material. Generally plates are raised round the edges, either by a curving up, or a wider <b>lip</b> or raised <b>portion.</b> Vessels with no lip, especially if they have a more rounded profile, are likely to be considered as bowls or dishes, as are very large vessels with a plate shape. Plates are dishware, and tableware. Plates in wood, pottery and metal go back into antiquity in many cultures.|$|R

Described as [...] "an elaborately choreographed spectacle," [...] it {{aimed to}} {{recreate}} the award-winning, innovative music videos of Rhythm Nation 1814 and those of its predecessor, Control. Anthony Thomas served as the tour's main choreographer, while Chuckii Booker became its musical director and opening act.

Daryl Hall only <b>lip</b> syncs the <b>portions</b> of the song that he sings in harmony with John Oates during the video (none of the parts where he sings solo), while John Oates does lip sync his solo parts. Towards the end of the video, Oates rises, dons a jacket with long cuffs, and proceeds to emulate the song's guitar solo with his hands completely covered by the sleeves of his jacket, which makes it appear as if he has fish fins for hands.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel {{design for a}} viable two stroke hydrogen engine that delivers excellent fuel economy and low emissions within the constraints of today&# 039;s cost, weight and size. The engine features asymmetrical port timing through a translating and rotating piston mechanism. The engine is externally scavenged and supercharged, has wet sump and oil pressure lubrication, direct injection, it is lightweight, easy to build, with minimal number of parts, low production cost, ability to be balanced and compact design. The two stroke mechanism produces a linear motion of the pistons {{as well as an}} elliptical path {{on the surface of the}} cylinder. This allows the piston to sweep as well as travel past the ports. The piston has a raised <b>lip</b> around <b>portion</b> of its circumference that communicates with the inlet and exhaust ports through its sweep and linear motion that assist in creating the port&# 039;s asymmetry to make the exhaust port to open first and to close first. The inlet port opens approximately 23 ° after the exhaust port opens, and remains open for some 20 ° after the exhaust port closes. The inlet port remains open to complete the cylinder charging and allow supercharging. The piston generates a perfect sinusoidal motion. Direct fuel injection and jet ignition are adopted for best results over a wide range of speeds and loads. The load is controlled by the quantity of fuel injected and changing the supercharger speed through a continuously variable transmission. This paper includes design details as well as result of engine performance simulations. The engine has better than traditional two stroke engines (1) top brake efficiency in the high 30 % range and (2) range of speed and loads where the efficiency is above 30 %...|$|R
40|$|Congenital {{double lip}} anomaly is an {{infrequent}} developmental abnormality affecting the lips, more commonly the upper lip. 5 cases of double lip are being {{reported for the}} first time from Iran and all confined to the upper lip. A new surgical excision is being introduced which is called transverse cupid bow-like elliptical incision. The previous traditional method was a simple elliptical excision. The new method gives the cupid’s bow a more natural apperance and keeps the normal shape of the upper lip. Surgical excision with transverse cupid bow-like elliptical excision in undertaken with regional nerve block anesthesia. It was interesting to observe that in the upper <b>lip,</b> the buccal <b>portion</b> of the double lip appeared on either side with a midline constriction. Surgical excision with the new method under regional nerve block anesthesia provides good result. The embryology and clinical appearances are discussed with a review of the literature. Congenital doble-lip anomaly is rare, and 5 cases are beint reported. All the patients were males, and there was no hereditary history, relation of the parents or any obvious acquired etiologic factor for the development ot this molformation...|$|R
6000|$|February 18th.--On Saturday there {{called on}} me an elderly Robinson-Crusoe sort of man, Mr. H------, shipwright, I believe, of Boston, who has lately been {{travelling}} in the East. About {{a year ago}} he was here, after being shipwrecked on the Dutch coast, and I assisted him to get home. Again, I have supplied him with five pounds, and my credit for an outside garment. He is a spare man, with closely cropped gray, or rather white hair, close-cropped whiskers fringing round his chin, and a close-cropped white mustache, with his under <b>lip</b> and a <b>portion</b> of his chin bare beneath,--sunburnt and weather-worn. He has been in Syria and Jerusalem, through the Desert, and at Sebastopol; and says he means to get Ticknor to publish his travels, {{and the story of}} his whole adventurous life, on his return home. A free-spoken, confiding, hardy, religious, unpolished, simple, yet world-experienced man; very talkative, and boring me with longer visits than I like. He has brought home, among other curiosities, [...] "a lady's arm," [...] as he calls it, two thousand years old,--a piece of a mummy, of course; also some coins, one of which, a gold coin of Vespasian, he showed me, and said he bought it of an Arab of the desert. The Bedouins possess a good many of these coins, handed down immemorially from father to son, and never sell them unless compelled by want. He had likewise a Hebrew manuscript of the Book of Ruth, on a parchment roll, which was put into his care to be given to Lord Haddo.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} study of 55  subjects with Smith-Magenis syndrome, aged 9  months to 35  years. Each person has been {{evaluated}} with an assessment of "gestalt" and detailed facial measurement, using previously published methodology, with compilation of Z score pattern profiles.  The facial phenotype of SMS is quite distinctive, even in the young child. The overall face shape is broad and square. The brows are heavy, with excessive lateral extension of the eyebrows. The eyes slant upwards and appear close set and deep set. The nose has a depressed root and, in the young child, a scooped bridge. With time, the bridge becomes more ski jump shaped. The height of the nose is markedly reduced while the nasal base is broad and {{the tip of the}} nose is full. The shape of the mouth and upper lip are most distinctive. The mouth is wide with full upper and lower <b>lips.</b> The central <b>portion</b> of the upper lip is fleshy and everted with bulky philtral pillars, producing a tented appearance that, in profile, is striking. With age, mandibular growth is greater than average and exceeds that of the maxilla. This leads to increased jaw width and protrusion and marked midface hypoplasia.  Craniofacial pattern analysis supports these subjective impressions. After mid-childhood, mandibular dimensions consistently exceed their maxillary counterparts. Craniofacial widths are greater than corresponding depths and heights. Nasal height is reduced while nasal width is increased. There is mild brachycephaly. The most marked age related changes are increased width of the nose and lower face (mandibular width) with reduction in nasal height and midfacial depth.    Keywords: Smith-Magenis syndrome; facial measurement...|$|R
