The requirement for SA is essential for a process shortly {{before the onset of}} the HR-caused cell death 5 to 6 h after infection with bacteria. SA given 10 to 12 h after infection or preincubation cannot rescue the completion of the cell death program. SA does not inhibit catalase or ascorbate peroxidase in soybean.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{variations in}} serum <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxide</b> activities {{in relation to}} various clinical entities of liver disease. METHODS: Serum lipid peroxides were measured fluorometrically in eight patients with acute hepatitis, six with liver steatofibrosis, five with chronic persistent hepatitis, 15 with chronic active hepatitis, 28 with liver cirrhosis, 22 with hepatocellular carcinoma; 19 patients with extrahepatic disease (six malignant, 13 benign) were used as controls. RESULTS: Higher serum <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxide</b> concentrations were found in patients with acute hepatitis (4. 52 (SEM 0. 56)) nmol/ml than in all other groups of patients (p < 0. 01). No {{significant difference was found}} among the mean values detected in the groups of patients affected by chronic liver disease and extrahepatic diseases. A history of chronic alcohol consumption was not associated with higher <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxide</b> concentrations. A significant correlation (R 2 = 0. 4538, R = 0. 6737, F = 7. 617, p = 0. 0000) was found between serum lipid peroxides and a set of indices of inflammation (ESR, total leucocyte count, C-reactive protein) and of hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or bilirubin). Of these, bilirubin was the most significant indicator of inflammation. Analysis of covariance showed a significant difference in <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxide</b> values among groups, even when bilirubin was chosen as an independent variable. CONCLUSIONS: Raised serum <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxide</b> concentrations can be found during acute inflammatory liver disease. Acute change in liver function, reflected by high bilirubin concentrations, seems to be more important for intravascular liberation of lipid peroxides than existence of specific aetiological factors or of severe longstanding global liver damage...|$|E

The <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxide</b> production activity (△TBARS) in hyperglycemics (0. 06 ± 0. 04 nmol/ 10 (6) cells) was lower(P< 0. 05) than that of normal controls (0. 10 ± 0. 07 nmol/ 10 (6) cells). The <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxide</b> production activity (△TBARS) was proportionate to the superoxide production activity(r= 0. 570, P< 0. 02). Therefore, the △TBARS may depend on superoxide production. There {{was no significant difference}} in superoxide dismutase(SOD) activity between hyperglycemics and normal controls. The SOD activity was proportionate to the superoxide production activity in normal controls, and thus, SOD activity seems to depend on superoxide production...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{damage has}} been {{proposed}} {{as one of the}} possible mechanism involved in the nephrotic syndrome. Strengthening the defense system by antioxidants may provide protection against oxidative damage. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate oxidant and antioxidant status with copper, zinc and homocysteine in nephrotic syndrome patients and the effect of antioxidants, minerals and B-complex vitamins on oxidant and antioxidant status. The blood samples were analyzed for quantitation of malondialdehyde as index of <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxide,</b> vitamin C, total antioxidant capacity, copper, zinc, and homocysteine. Significantly increased levels of serum <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxide,</b> homocysteine and decreased levels of serum total antioxidant capacity, copper, zinc and plasma vitamin C were noticed in the patients with nephrotic syndrome as compared to control subjects. However, significant reduction in <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxide,</b> homocysteine and improvement in vitamin C, total antioxidant capacity, copper, and zinc activity were observed after treatment of antioxidants and minerals with Bcomplex vitamins.

40|$|Studies of ferriheme cyclooxygenase, {{using two}} {{different}} assay systems, {{show that a}} variety of peroxides can trigger a rapid acceleration of cyclooxygenase activity to produce prostaglandins. Lipid hydroperoxides formed by lipoxygenase were the most potent activators tested, followed by prostaglandin G 2, which was slightly less potent. Peroxides nonspeciflcally generated during arachidonate autoxidation were as potent as the enzymatically formed <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxides.</b> These findings have important implications for cell function since any process which generates peroxides may activate the cyclooxygenase. Thus the balance between formation and removal of cellular <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxides</b> sets a peroxide tone that can regulate the rate of prostaglandin formation in cells...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the common}} inhibitors of enzymatic {{activity}} (for PON 1 and PON 3) is <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxides</b> found in the plasma. <b>Lipid</b> <b>peroxides</b> can inhibit Paraoxonase activity as an arylesterase and antioxidant, though the specific inhibition {{is dependent on the}} type of lipid head group. An important implication of this fact is that, in decreasing the activity of PON1 and PON3, the productivity of preventing oxidation of LDL. Enzyme activity is also regulated by a substrate-dependent polymorphism that occurs at position 192. There are two known isoforms, one having an arginine residue at the 192 position and the other a glutamine, which are associated with high and low enzymatic activity respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Oct-1-en-3-one (CH2=CHC(=O)(CH2)4CH3), {{also known}} as 1-octen-3-one, is the odorant that is {{responsible}} for the typical [...] "metallic" [...] smell of metals and blood coming into contact with skin. Oct-1-en-3-one has a strong metallic mushroom-like odor with an odor detection threshold of 0.03-1.12 µg/m3 and it is the main compound responsible for the [...] "smell of metal", followed by decanal (smell: orange skin, flowery) and nonanal (smell: tallowy, fruity). Oct-1-en-3-one is the degradative reduction product of the chemical reaction of skin <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxides</b> and Fe2+. Skin <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxides</b> are formed from skin lipid by oxidation, either enzymatically by lipoxygenases or by air oxygen. Oct-1-en-3-one is a ketone analog of the alkene 1-octene.|$|R
