40|$|Trusses {{used for}} roof support in coal mines are {{constructed}} of two grouted bolts installed at opposing forty-five degree angles into {{the roof and}} a <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> that ties the angled bolts together. The load on the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is vertical, which is transverse to the longitudinal axis, and therefore the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is loaded in the weakest direction. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the vertical load capacity and deflection of three different types of <b>cross</b> <b>members.</b> Single-point load tests, with the load applied {{in the center of}} the specimen and double-point load tests, with a span of 2. 4 m, were conducted. For the single-point load configuration, the yield of the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> was nominally 98 kN of vertical load, achieved at 42 cm of deflection. For cable <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> yield was not achieved even after 45 cm of deflection. Peak vertical loads were about 89 kN for 17 mm cables and 67 kN for the 15 mm cables. For the double-point load configurations, the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> yielded at 150 kN of vertical load and 25 cm of deflection. At 25 cm of deflection individual cable strands started breaking at 133 and 111 kN of vertical load for the 17 and 15 mm cable <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> respectively.

The truss structure includes a series of bays, each bay having sets of battens connected by longitudinal <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> which give the bay its axial and torsional stiffness.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{infrared}} (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of advanced high-strength steels (AHSSs). Though the IR local heating method saves heating energy because it utilizes focused IR rays to heat only the plastic deformation zone, there has yet to be an attempt to show that the heating method can be applied to industrial manufacturing processes. In this work, the IR local heating method is used to manufacture a seat <b>cross</b> <b>member.</b> Seat <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> require high strength because they are responsible for protecting passengers from broadside collisions. Although AHSS is preferred in seat <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> the large amount of springback of AHSS makes a problem in the accuracy of the shape. This work verifies that the IR local heating method is able to make the seat <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> with the target shape in the manufacturing process. A thermo-mechanical analysis was also conducted with the finite element method to discuss the springback results...|$|R

30|$|The {{focus of}} many recent {{research}} {{studies on the}} treatment of these fractures has been pin configuration. Biomechanical testing has demonstrated a theoretical advantage of both medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>cross</b> pinning; however, these initial findings have not translated into clinical results [9, 10, 11]. The concern for iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury during the placement of a medial pin discourages this configuration.

50|$|In 1930 Teichfuss {{produced}} the LT.10, a strengthened but otherwise little changed {{version of the}} much imitated Zögling. His 1940 Allievo Pavullo was a strengthened Zögling with a plywood skinned nacelle {{in place of the}} original exposed, girder supported seat. This nacelle contained the open cockpit, placed just ahead of the wing leading edge and extended up to the wing behind the cockpit and rearwards to enclose the forward <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> of the simple girder fuselage. As on the Zögling these <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> ran in the vertical plane between a horizontal upper beam and a lower beam which sloped upwards to the tail, though their angles were altered {{so as not to be}} normal to the top girder. Again like the Zögling, on the wire braced Allievo Pavullo two forward <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> continued above the wing to form a triangular cabane, faired in on the Teichfuss development, to which some wires were attached. This was dispensed with on the strutted variant, which also had an extra frame strut towards the rear and normal to the lower girder.|$|R
