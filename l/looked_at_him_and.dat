5|$|Joe Shea got up {{and started}} calmly with {{a report on the}} state of the investigation. But within a minute, he was rambling, and in another thirty seconds, he was incoherent. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> saw my father, in the grip of {{dementia}} praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time.|$|E
500|$|One {{example of}} his dogged pursuit of {{excellence}} is that while in high school, Scheyer refused to leave the gym one night until he made 50 consecutive free throws. [...] After finally hitting 49 in a row, he missed on his final attempt. [...] His father encouraged him to join him and go home, but – as his coach recalled – “Jon <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> said, ‘No. I’m starting over.’ Then he stayed until he made 50 in a row.” ...|$|E
500|$|As {{chief of}} staff, Emanuel {{would make his}} staff laugh. During a staff meeting, when Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra gave uniformly upbeat reports, Emanuel {{is said to have}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> said: [...] "Whatever you're taking, I want some." [...] Emanuel had a hand in war strategy, {{political}} maneuvering, communications and economic policy.

500|$|When he {{graduated}} from high school in 1997, Youkilis weighed about 227 pounds and was 6' 1". He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> said, Well, we need somebody", said Cleary. [...] "I'd love to tell you I saw something no one else did, but he was just better than what we had." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speculation {{remains as}} to Grans' {{knowledge}} of Haarmann's intentions towards Franke {{when he made}} this comment to the two female acquaintances.

Al-Damri [...] "shot an arrow at one of them and killed him", and he then called on the other spy to surrender. After he surrendered, he tied him up, brought him to Muhammad and told him what {{happened}} after being questioned about it.

2500|$|After {{two and a}} {{half years}} of dating, Pickler became engaged to {{songwriter}} Kyle Jacobs on June 15, 2010, the day of her late grandmother's birthday, after he proposed on a beach at sunset.

[...] On January 1, 2011, she and Jacobs eloped and married in a [...] "small, intimate ceremony on a private island in the Caribbean".|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, H. C. Sanders, {{owner of}} a nearby gas station, {{reported}} 20 years earlier {{he ran out of}} gas at night near the Red River across from the Bell Witch Cave. He began to walk towards town when a rabbit came out of the woods and began to follow him. Sanders walked faster, but the rabbit kept pace even as he broke out into a run.

2500|$|The closing track, {{the longest}} {{composition}} ever released by Dylan, the 16-minute [...] "Highlands", most probably took its central motif ("My heart's in the highlands") from {{a poem by}} Robert Burns called [...] "My heart's in the highlands" [...] (published in 1790). In Jim Dickinson's account, [...] "I remember, when we finished 'Highlands'—there are two other versions of that, the one that made the record is the rundown, literally, {{you can hear the}} beat turn over, which I think Dylan liked. But, anyway, after we finished it, one of the managers came out, and he said, [...] "Well, Bob, have you got a short version of that song?" [...] And Dylan <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> said: 'That was the short version.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Foley said in {{his first}} book that his wife cried during a post-match phone {{conversation}} between the two, and this made Foley strongly consider retiring from wrestling. He also said that after the match, Vince McMahon thanked him for all he had done for the company, but made Foley promise to [...] "never {{do anything like that}} again." [...] He also made mention in the book of a rather humorous exchange he and Undertaker had while being checked out more thoroughly by Petit in the backstage area. Foley, still somewhat dazed from the concussion he sustained, turned to The Undertaker and asked, [...] "Did I use the thumbtacks?", which was a staple of a number of Foley's early matches. The Undertaker <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> rather sternly replied, [...] "Look at your arm, Mick!", at which point Foley discovered a significant number of thumbtacks still lodged in his arm. On the 2011 DVD release OMG! - The Top 50 Incidents in WWE History, the match was ranked at number one.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crossing}} gate struck {{the top of}} Brody's SUV before sliding down its rear and becoming stuck. Hope backed up to give her room to do the same. He instead saw Brody get out and walk to the rear, apparently trying to free it. [...] "What struck me was how calm she was—she didn't seem to be panicking, or in a hurry at all, even though the gate was down," [...] he said later. [...] "She wasn't in a hurry at all, {{but she had to}} have known that a train was coming." [...] Brody <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> he motioned to her to come back in his direction, although he allows that she may not have seen him due to the glare from his headlights. Brody then returned to her vehicle and, according to Hope, seemed to pause as if she was adjusting her seat belt. The train was getting closer and the situation more urgent. [...] "The thing's dinging, red lights are flashing, it's going off," [...] he said. [...] "I just knew she was going to back up—never in my wildest dreams did I think she'd go forward." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Pinnegar <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> did not speak.

But Miss Pinnegar, the engine of wrath, felt she would burst.|$|E
