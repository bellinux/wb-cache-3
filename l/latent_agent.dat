40|$|A urea-soluble extract of cyst-rich {{material}} from rat lung heavily infected with Pneumocystis carinii was evaluated in an enzyme-linked immunosorption assay for antibody in 461 human sera. The {{highest level of}} reactivity occurred in sera submitted for serodiagnosis from proved or highly suspect cases. However, the range of reactivities in these groups, {{many of whom were}} on immunosuppressive therapy, was very wide. A more restricted lower range of reactivity was observed in both hospital-family contacts and healthy Serum Bank donors. Because of the overlap in levels of reactivity between the pneumocystosis and control groups, no concise cutoff value to separate infected from noninfected individuals could be made. Specificity of the reactions was shown by absorption of patients' and control sera with uninfected and P. carinii-infected human and rat lung tissue. The data support the concept that P. carinii is highly prevalent as a <b>latent</b> <b>agent</b> in the general population and is provoked to cause clinically manifest disease in the compromised host.

40|$|Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) {{was first}} {{isolated}} as a <b>latent</b> <b>agent</b> from apparently healthy mice (1, 2), and pulmonary disease was produced only by intranasal inoculation of lung material and serial blind passage. Evidence {{of a high}} incidence of inapparent PVM infection has been found in a number of laboratory mouse colonies {{from a variety of sources}} (2 - 4), and antibodies have also been detected in other mammalian species (3, 5). The virus is highly thermolabile (2, 6), ether sensitive (7), and combines with a lung tissue component from a variety of mammalian species (8). PVM agglutinates mouse and hamster erythrocytes (9, 10), but unless special precautions are taken when harvesting infected lungs (11), combination of the virus with the tissue component occurs, and hemagglutination can be detected only after the virus is freed by treatment such as heating to 70 Â°C (9). The multiplication of PVM in the mouse lung is inhibited by polysaccharides obtained from several bacteria (12), and the first example of successful chemotherapy of a virus infection in an animal was reported in 1951 by Ginsberg and Horsfall (13) who used the capsular polysaccharide of Friedl~nder bacillus type B in mice infected with PVM.

During the past few years, numerous papers have appeared in which viruses encountered in the respiratory tract of seemingly healthy mice were described. Some of these <b>latent</b> <b>agents</b> cause pneumonia. One of them, which we have called pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) (1), is strikingly different in a number of its characteristics from other viruses also capable of inducing pneumonia, which have been studied in detail.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{previous}} studies (1 - 3) have shown that pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) is a <b>latent</b> infectious <b>agent</b> present in the lungs of apparently normal mice, but capable of producing fatal pulmonary infection in animals {{of at least three}} species. That this virus is widely disseminated in nature was indicated by the finding of neutralizing antibodies against it in serum obtained from certain members of nine mammalian species, including man (3). The obscure activity of this latent pneumotropic virus, its unusual properties, and its apparent widespread distribution have seemed sufficiently interesting to warrant further investigation. It appeared possible that additional information concerning the agent might yield knowledge of value in the study of respiratory infections, and perhaps serve also to elucidate the r 61 e in such diseases of <b>latent</b> infectious <b>agents.</b> The discovery (4, 5) that influenza viruses possess the capacity to agglutinate erythrocytes provided a valuable tool for the study of these agents. It is now known that certain other viruses, including those of vaccinia (6), Newcastle disease (7), fowl plague (8), and mumps (9) are also capable of agglutinating erythrocytes. Recently Mills and Dochez (10) discovered that suspensions of lungs from mice infected with a virus which appears to be identical with pneumonia virus of mice, could agglutinate mouse erythrocytes, but only after the suspensions had been heated. Their finding suggested that hemagglutination might be usefully applied to the study of PVM, and the phenomenon was therefore investigated further. * The Bureau of Medicine and Surgery of the U. S.

No rises occurred to cytomegalovirus, only 1. 2 percent to herpes simplex virus, and 8. 5 percent to varicella zoster virus. Rises to measles antibody were found in 7. 5 percent of patients and to rubella in 10. 4 percent; these may represent natural infections or immunizations. A few patients also showed rises to respiratory viruses but there was no apparent connection to IM. Acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) is accompanied by the appearance {{of a wide variety of}} humoral antibodies in addition to those directed against the causative agent, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

The current study was carried out to determine if changes in antibody titers to herpes viruses other than EBV, or to other viral antigens, occurred during or after acute infectious mononucleosis (IM), such as that seen in immuno-suppressed renal transplant patients [3].

40|$|Epoxy resins {{constitute}} {{a class of}} thermosets which contains more than one epoxide group per molecule, which are very reactive to many curing agents like aromatic or aliphatic amines, acid anhydrides or isocyanates. They are used as reinforced composites, adhesives, high performance coatings and encapsulating materials. Epoxy thermosets have excellent electrical and mechanical properties, good adhesion to many metals and resistance to moisture and thermal and environment exposure. Curing agents that show no activity under normal conditions but show activity by external stimulation, like temperature, can be called ââlatent curing agentsâ. Among the thermal <b>latent</b> curing <b>agents</b> dicyandiamide (DICY) {{is one of the}} most employed in epoxy resin technology. The latent nature of this type of curing agents is due to the insolubility in epoxy resins at room temperature. The use of dihydrazides as curing agents has been scarcely reported in scientific literature but there are some dihydrazides commercially available as <b>latent</b> curing <b>agents.</b> In the present study a series of dihydrazides with different structures were prepared by reaction of dicarboxylic diester with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol. These compounds were studied as curing agents in DGEBA/dihydrazide 2 : 1 (mol/mol) formulations demonstrating their latent character. In the dihydrazides we have prepared, with aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic moieties a relationship between the melting point of the dihydrazides and the initial curing temperature was observed with the exception of the cycloaliphatic dihydrazide, which was amorphous but initiate the cure at the highest temperature.

The articles are grouped into five pathogenic tracks: infectious agents, immune system, skeletic muscle, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychiatric factors. Although a particular infectious agent {{is unlikely to be}} responsible for all CFS cases, evidence is shown that host-parasite relationships are modified in a large proportion of patients with chronic fatigue. Antibody titres against infectious agents are often elevated and replication of several viruses could be increased. Chronic activation of the immune system is also observed and could be due to the reactivation of persistent or <b>latent</b> infectious <b>agents</b> such as herpes viruses (i. e.

40|$|Summary. -The HT 29 R colonic {{adenocarcinoma}} xenograft {{has been}} shown to be rich in the enzyme p-glucuronidase. Experiments in rodent systems have demonstrated a marked anti-tumour effect of the drug aniline mustard (AM) on tumours with high levels of this enzyme (e. g. the plasmacytomas PC 5 and PC 6). We have found that AM is no more effective than its analogue paramethyl aniline mustard (PMAM) or other alkykating agents against the HT 29 R xenograft. Amongst the possible explanations for this may be: (1) The wide shoulder on the cell-survival curve shown for exposure to alkylating agents of HT 29 R in vivo. (2) Lack of correlation between physiological availability of P-glucuronidase and the high levels measured by the standard assay. (3) Increased p-glucuronidase levels in host mouse marrow, making the latter potentially more susceptible to AM damage. ONE APPROACH TO THE problem of the lack of selectivity of cytotoxic drugs has been to attempt to synthesize agents which are activated more efficiently in tumours than in normal tissues (Harper, 1959; Ross, 1974; Workman & Double, 1978). The rational design of such <b>latent</b> anti-tumour <b>agents,</b> however, has been hindered by the lack of appropriate information on the comparative biochemistry of such vital normal tissues as marrow and intestinal mucosa (Workman & Double, 1978). Also, until recently, only animal tumours have been available for the pre-clinical development and testing of these agents. However, human tumour xenografts now provide a potentially more relevant system for investigating the mechanisms of biochemical selectivity of chemotherapeutic agents. Such experiments in these systems, however, are necessarily conducted against the background of mouse biochemistry and pharmacokinetics. A frequently cited example of biochemical selectivity is seen with the alkylating agent aniline mustard (N,N-p-di- 2 chloroethylaniline; AM). This drug {{has been shown}} to be particularly active against tumours with high levels of the enzyme / 3 -glucuronidase in animal systems such as the ADJ/PC 5 mouse plasmacell tumour, normally fairly resistant to alkylating agents (Whisson & Connors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCombination {{antiretroviral}} therapy (cART) {{has led to}} a major {{reduction in}} HIV-related mortality and morbidity. However, HIV still cannot be cured. With the absence of an effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine, increasing numbers of infected people, emerging new toxicities secondary to cART and the need for life-long treatment, there is now a real urgency to find a cure for HIV. There are currently multiple barriers to curing HIV. The most significant barrier is the establishment of a latent or "silent" infection in resting CD 4 + T cells. In latent HIV infection, the virus is able to integrate into the host cell genome, but does not proceed to active replication. As a consequence, antiviral agents, as well as the immune system, are unable to eliminate these long-lived, latently infected cells. Reactivation of latently infected resting CD 4 + T cells can then re-establish infection once cART is stopped. Other significant barriers to cure include residual viral replication in patients receiving cART, even when the virus is not detectable by conventional assays. In addition, HIV can be sequestered in anatomical reservoirs, such as the brain, gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract. Achieving either a functional cure (long-term control of HIV in the absence of cART) or a sterilizing cure (elimination of all HIV-infected cells) remains a major challenge. Several studies have now demonstrated that treatment intensification appears to have little impact on latent reservoirs. Some potential and promising approaches that may reduce the latent reservoir include very early initiation of cART and the use of agents that could potentially reverse <b>latent</b> infection. <b>Agents</b> that reverse <b>latent</b> infection will promote viral production; however, simultaneous administration of cART will prevent subsequent rounds of viral replication.

40|$|International audienceA {{straightforward}} and original methodology allowing {{the synthesis of}} Janus-type dendrimer-like poly(ethylene oxide) s (PEOs) carrying orthogonal functional groups on their surface is described. The use of 3 -allyloxy- 1, 2 -propanediol (1) as a latent AB(2) -type heterofunctional initiator of anionic ring-opening polymerization (AROP) of ethylene oxide (EO) and of selective branching agents of PEO chain ends served to construct the two dendrons of these dendrimer-like PEOs, following a divergent pathway. Thus, the first PEO generation of the first dendron was grown by AROP from 1 followed by {{the reaction of the}} corresponding alpha-allyl,omega,omega'-bishydroxy-heterofunctional PEO derivative with 2 -(3 '-chloromethybenzyloxymethyl) - 2 -methyl- 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxane (2) used as a branching agent. This afforded the dendron A with four latent peripheral hydroxyls protected in the form of two ketal rings. The remaining alpha-allylic double bond of the PEO thus prepared was transformed into two hydroxyl groups using OsO 4 in order to create the first PEO generation of the dendron B by AROP of EO. Allyl chloride (3) was then used as another (<b>latent)</b> branching <b>agent</b> to react with the terminal hydroxyl of the corresponding PEO chains. Deprotection under acidic conditions of the ketal groups of dendron A, followed by AROP of EO, afforded the second PEO generation on this face. This alternate and divergent procedure, combining AROP of EO and selective branching of PEO branches, could be readily iterated, one dendron after the other up to the generation six, leading to a Janus-type dendrimer-like PEO exhibiting a total mass of around 300 kg/mol and possessing 64 peripheral groups on each face. The possibility of orthogonal functionalization of the surfaces of such Janus-type dendritic PEOs was exploited. Indeed, a dendron of generation 4 was functionalized with hydroxyl functions at its periphery, whereas the other was end-capped with either tertiary amino or disulfide groups. In a variant of this strategy, azido groups and acetylene could also be orthogonally introduced at the periphery of the fourth generation Janus-type dendrimer-like PEO and subjected to polycondensation by a 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reaction. This afforded a necklace-like covalent assembly of dendrimer-like PEOs through the formation of stable [1, 2, 3]-triazole linkage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Combination {{antiretroviral}} therapy (cART) {{has led to}} a major {{reduction in}} HIV-related mortality and morbidity. However, HIV still cannot be cured. With the absence of an effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine, increasing numbers of infected people, emerging new toxicities secondary to cART and the need for life-long treatment, there is now a real urgency to find a cure for HIV. There are currently multiple barriers to curing HIV. The most significant barrier is the establishment of a latent or "silent" infection in resting CD 4 + T cells. In latent HIV infection, the virus is able to integrate into the host cell genome, but does not proceed to active replication. As a consequence, antiviral agents, as well as the immune system, are unable to eliminate these long-lived, latently infected cells. Reactivation of latently infected resting CD 4 + T cells can then re-establish infection once cART is stopped. Other significant barriers to cure include residual viral replication in patients receiving cART, even when the virus is not detectable by conventional assays. In addition, HIV can be sequestered in anatomical reservoirs, such as the brain, gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract. Achieving either a functional cure (long-term control of HIV in the absence of cART) or a sterilizing cure (elimination of all HIV-infected cells) remains a major challenge. Several studies have now demonstrated that treatment intensification appears to have little impact on latent reservoirs. Some potential and promising approaches that may reduce the latent reservoir include very early initiation of cART and the use of agents that could potentially reverse <b>latent</b> infection. <b>Agents</b> that reverse <b>latent</b> infection will promote viral production; however, simultaneous administration of cART will prevent subsequent rounds of viral replication. Such drugs as histone deacetylase inhibitors, currently used and licensed for the treatment of some cancers, or activating latently infected resting cells with cytokines, such as IL- 7 or prostratin, show promising results in reversing latency in vitro when used either alone or in combination. In order to move forward toward clinical trials that target eradication, there needs to be careful consideration of the risks and benefits of these approaches, agreement on the most informative endpoints for eradication studies and greater engagement of the infected community. </p...|$|R
40|$|Prominent immune {{alterations}} {{associated with}} aging include {{the loss of}} naÃ¯ve T-cell numbers, diversity and function. While genetic contributors and mechanistic details in the aging process have been addressed in multiple studies, the role of environmental agents in immune aging remains incompletely understood. From the standpoint of environmental infectious <b>agents,</b> <b>latent</b> cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection {{has been associated with}} an immune risk profile in the elderly humans, yet the cause-effect relationship of this association remains unclear. Here we present direct experimental evidence that mouse CMV (MCMV) infection results in select T-cell subset changes associated with immune aging, namely the increase of relative and absolute counts of CD 8 T-cells in the blood, with a decreased representation of the naÃ¯ve and the increased representation of the effector memory blood CD 8 T-cells. Moreover, MCMV infection resulted in significantly weaker CD 8 responses to superinfection with Influenza, Human Herpes Virus I or West-Nile-Virus, even 16 months following MCMV infection. These irreversible losses in T-cell function could not be observed in uninfected or in vaccinia virus-infected controls and were not due to the immune-evasive action of MCMV genes. Rather, the CD 8 activation in draining lymph nodes upon viral challenge was decreased in MCMV infected mice and the immune response correlated directly to the frequency of the naÃ¯ve and inversely to that of the effector cells in the blood CD 8 pool. Therefore, latent MCMV infection resulted in pronounced changes of the T-cell compartment consistent with impaired naÃ¯ve T-cell function...|$|R
40|$|Information-based {{theories}} of rationality offer a widely accepted system {{for evaluating the}} rationality of an agent's choice. All such models {{have to deal with}} seemingly irrational choices and with choices that do not reflect in actuality what the system predicts in theory. Hyperintensionality (where intensionality is not derived solely from an informational processing asymmetry, as, we will argue, in framing effects) doesn't find easy or natural solutions within the information-based framework provided by such theories. Such theories, that is, aim to solve the problems of intensionality and hyperintensionality by recourse to an information-based explanation â generally grounded in the concept of <b>latent</b> information: the <b>agent</b> regarded as salient and processed, as information, some information to which the experimenter or the theoretician was insensitive. We wish to spell out how some abilities peculiarly linked to modal cognition (i. e. our grasping of modal features such as possibility or necessity) allow for a finer analysis of these phenomena than an information-based understanding allows. The particular scope of this paper, then, is to give a taste of how an agent's sense of possibility (and modality generally) leads him to biases in choices that a purely information-based understanding will relate to some form of irrationality on his part. We argue that this conclusion by information-based theories is due to their not taking into account the modal aspects of the situation at hand. We rather see features of modal cognition as being a significant ingredient of our characterization as rational beings: the explanatory reduction to irrationality of the agent's choice loses some of the richness of that choice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{quantitative}} impact of ambiguity on the historically observed equity premium. We consider a Lucas-tree pure [...] exchange economy {{with a single}} agent where we introduce two key non-standard assumptions. First, the agent's beliefs about the dividend/consumption process is ambiguous, i. e., she is uncertain about the exact probability distribution governing the realization of future dividends and consumption. Second, the agent's preferences are sensitive to this ambiguity, a property formalized using the smooth ambiguity model. The consumption and dividend process is assumed to evolve according to a hidden state model, popularized by Bansal and Yaron (2004), where a persistent latent state variable describes temporary shocks to the mean of consumption growth prospects. We further extend the model to allow for uncertainty about {{the magnitude of the}} persistence of the <b>latent</b> state. The <b>agent's</b> beliefs are ambiguous due to the uncertainty about the conditional mean of the probability distribution on consumption and dividends in the next period. We show that in this model ambiguity is endogenously dynamic, for example, increasing during recessions. This results in an endogenously volatile and (counter-) cyclical equity premium. We calibrate the level of ambiguity aversion to match only the first moment of the risk-free rate in data, and ambiguity to match the uncertainty conditional on the historical growth path, and evaluate the model using moderate levels of risk aversion. We find that this simple modification of a Lucas-tree model accounts for {{a large part of the}} historical equity premium, both in terms of its level and variation over time.

40|$|Natural {{products}} have a longstanding history as clinical therapeutics, making them a valuable source of biomedically-relevant research tools. This dissertation describes {{the application of}} natural products as tools for drug discovery. By covering four different research projects, this thesis will cover a renovated approach to the classical utilization of marine natural products as screening compounds for primary hit identification, and semi-synthesis for lead development. 	Chapter 1 gives {{an overview of the}} current success and future challenges of natural products, with emphasis on marine-derived natural products. This chapter also includes a set of current literature examples that focus on identifying natural products with target selectivity in mind. The second chapter discusses the application of marine natural products in the discovery of antimalarials. This chapter includes the discovery and structure elucidation of the salinipostin A, a novel antimalarial chemotype with a bicyclic phosphotriester. The chapter ends with the secondary assays that were attempted to identify the mechanism of action of salinipostin A. 	The third chapter describes the development of the endoperoxide merulin A for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis. The chapter closes with site localization studies of a merulin A-derived fluorophore in order to give insight into the mechanism of action of endoperoxides against T. brucei. 	Chapter 4 reports the development of a modular high-content high-throughput P. aeruginosa biofilm inhibition/dispersion screen. Assay development includes the assessment of the innate antibiotic tolerance from preformed biofilms. The results from a large scale screening campaign of a marine natural product library yield the identification of a new biofilm inhibitor skyllamycin B. The chapter ends with the evaluation of skyllamycin B and azithromycin as a co-dosing agent to eradicate preformed biofilms. 	The final chapter concentrates on the identification of abyssomicin II as a <b>latent</b> HIV reactivating <b>agent.</b> This is the first example of a bacterially-derived natural product to possess latent HIV reactivating activity. While potency excludes abyssomicin II from being a lead compound, mechanistic studies reveal that abyssomicin II reactivates latent HIV through protein kinase C and histone de-acetylase independent manner. These data suggest that the mechanism of latent HIV reactivation is novel...|$|R
40|$|Lanthanide compounds, {{specifically}} those containing europium and terbium can exhibit luminescent properties {{when combined}} with ligands that promote this characteristic. Lanthanide luminescence has proven to have an array of useful applications, {{one of which is}} the formation of luminescent powders for exposure of latent fingerprints. The aim {{of this study was to}} synthesise a novel ligand to support luminescent character in europium and terbium compounds, and then dope these compounds in to talcum powder. This resulting powder would ideally give exposure of latent fingerprints that can then be enhanced, through excitation of the luminescent compounds dispersed in the powder. A novel (Me) âCN(CHâP(O) Phâ) â ligand (p=o) was synthesised, and in turn was used to synthesis a range of Ln(Î²âdiketonate) â(p=o) compounds. These compounds were assessed for potential luminescent activity, and doped into talcum powder. These powders were then appraised for their prospective use as <b>latent</b> fingerprint exposing <b>agents.</b> Through modification of a published procedure, the (Me) âCN(CHâP(O) Phâ) â ligand was synthesised, and characterised by Electrospray Ionisation (ESI) Mass spectrometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Infraâred (IR) spectroscopy, melting point analysis and elemental analysis. With Î²âdiketonate ligands acetylacetone (acac) and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (tta), lanthanide metals lanthanum, europium and terbium and the (p=o) ligands a series of novel compounds were synthesised (Ln(Î²âdiketonate) â(p=o)). These compounds were characterised by the methods listed above. Using the neutral ligands 1, 10 âphenanthroline (phen) and 2, 2 âbipyridine (bipy), a series of Eu/Tb(acac/tta) â(phen/bipy) compounds were synthesised and doped into talcum powder, to investigate the effects on particle and structure character of the doped talcum powders. Talcum powder was also sonicated to investigate the effect of this on particle size, along with effect on use as a fingerprinting agent. Laser diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy studies informed of a notable decrease in particle size with sonication, and an increase in specific surface area. However the effect of this process on increasing exposure of latent fingerprints was deemed too insignificant to justify the procedure. The compounds Eu/Tb(acac/tta) â(phen/bipy), (Eu/Tb(Î²âdiketonate) â(p=o) and [HâNMeâ]â[Eu/Tb(2, 6 âdpa) â]. 2 HâO were investigated for luminescent activity. Fluorescence spectroscopy determined the dominant emission wavelengths from 254 nm and 312 nm excitation were at 510 nm and 625 nm respectively. The talcum powders, doped with the luminescent compounds were analysed for luminescent activity. Direct screening with an ultraâviolet (UV) lamp with emission wavelengths of 254 nm and 312 nm informed of the powders with the most intensely observed luminescent emissions. From these results, Eu(tta) â(p=o), HâNMeâ]â[Eu(2, 6 â dpa) â]. 2 HâO, Tb(acac) â(p=o) and HâNMeâ]â[Tb(2, 6 âdpa) â]. 2 HâO were chosen as the most promising candidates for more inâdepth investigation of latent fingerprint exposure potential. Furthermore, it was determined that the novel (Me) âCN(CHâP(O) Phâ) â ligand was successful as a neutral ligand for supporting luminescence. The powders were trialled by several variables, including surface, powder quantity, age of latent print, temperature, and the brush used to determine their effectiveness. Powders were compared to commercial Greenwop and Redwop fingerprint powders, as these were the most similar industrial samples in terms of use. Through trials in the laboratory and the police fingerprinting laboratory, it was determined that the doped talcum powders were inferior to the commercial âwopâ samples in terms of latent print definition under UV conditions. However, the talcum powders had several useful applications, specifically the dual effect of exposing prints clearly under UV and nonâUV conditions. It was concluded the best application for the fingerprint powders was on smooth surfaces such as glass, with a gradual application of powder. Small amounts of powder gave more clarity under nonâUV print exposure, but higher quantities of powder were required to get ample luminescent intensity under UV conditions...|$|R
