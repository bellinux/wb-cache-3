30|$|Swarm is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission {{consisting}} of three low Earth orbiting satellites {{designed specifically to}} measure magnetic and electric fields to a greater accuracy than ever before (Friis-Christensen et al., 2006).

40|$|A primary {{objective}} of the Swarm constellation mission is to resolve the lithospheric magnetic field with the best achievable accuracy in order to bridge the spectral gap between satellite and airborne/marine magnetic surveys. In a series of end-to-end simulations, the possibilities of high degree field recovery were investigated. The proposed constellation consists of a higher and a <b>lower</b> pair of <b>satellites.</b> It was soon found that a constellation as such does not yet guarantee improved high degree field recovery. Of crucial importance is the orbit constellation of the <b>lower</b> pair of <b>satellites.</b> If the <b>lower</b> <b>satellites</b> follow each other, as investigated in Constellation 1, the gain of a constellation {{turns out to be}} marginal, compared to a single satellite. For Constellation 2, the <b>lower</b> <b>satellites</b> were separated in the E/W direction. In this setup, one can use the instantaneous E/W magnetic field gradient between the satellites, as well as the N/S along track gradients. Incorporating this vector gradient information results in significantly improved field resolution. Indeed, the final simulation suggests that the envisaged Swarm constellation will enable the recovery of the lithospheric field to beyond spherical harmonic degree 130.

30|$|A major {{improvement}} {{compared with}} CHAOS- 5 is {{the inclusion of}} field spatial differences (i.e. approximate gradients) as data, along-track for both CHAMP and Swarm Alpha, Bravo and Charlie, and also east–west between Swarm’s <b>lower</b> <b>satellite</b> pair Alpha and Charlie. Along-track field differences approximate north–south gradients in non-polar regions (Kotsiaros et al. 2014; Sabaka et al. 2015), while the east–west differences provide information on the longitudinal gradient of the field (Olsen et al. 2015). We constructed along-track field differences from data points from the same satellite track, separated by 15  s. East–west difference data were found by searching Swarm L 1 b 1 Hz magnetic data for a datum from Swarm Charlie, with latitude closest to a selected Swarm Alpha datum, within a maximum time difference of 50  s.

30|$|The {{performed}} simulation {{is described}} in more detail in Olsen et al. (2007), which is an extension of the work of Olsen et al. (2006). In a first step we calculated synthetic orbits. We assumed all three satellites to be in circular near-polar orbits with injection altitude of h 0 = 450 km altitude and orbital inclination i = 87.4 ° for the <b>lower</b> pair (Swarm <b>satellites</b> A and B) and of h 0 = 530 km altitude and orbital inclination i = 88 ° for the third satellite Swarm C. The two <b>lower</b> <b>satellites</b> were assumed separated in longitude by 1.4 °.

This simulates the requirement that “The maximum time difference between Swarm A and Swarm B when crossing the equator shall be 10 seconds”. The chosen orbital configuration is similar (though not identical) to the one that is presently foreseen for Swarm (h 0 = 460 km and i = 87.35 ° for Swarm A and B; h 0 = 530 km and i = 87.95 ° for Swarm C, and a Local Time of the Ascending Node of about 14 : 30).|$|R

The third satellite, Bravo, has an orbital inclination of 88 ^∘ and is flying at an altitude of approximately 520  km. The different orbital inclination of the satellites results in different drift rates in local time (LT).

30|$|As {{explained}} in the previous section, equatorial scintillation is most intense in the hours after sunset. Around February and October–November 2014, the Swarm descending equator crossings are during these post-sunset hours, while around March 2015, the ascending equator crossings experience the post-sunset local time (van den IJssel et al. 2015). Around June 2014 and July 2015, the equator crossings are also during the post-sunset hours. However, during summer there is minimum ionospheric scintillation and this explains {{the absence of a}} dip in GPS tracking during these periods. For Swarm-B, the two larger dips are slightly delayed compared with the two other Swarm satellites, which {{can be explained by the}} slow drift between the orbital planes of the high flying Swarm-B satellite and the lower pair, which leads to a growing difference in local time. Because of its higher altitude, Swarm-B is also less affected by scintillation than the lower pair, and therefore the dips in GPS tracking are smaller for this satellite. Around December 2015, the ascending equator crossings of the <b>lower</b> <b>satellite</b> pair are again during the post-sunset hours. However, Fig.  1 shows no dip in the GPS tracking of these satellites around this time, which confirms the improved robustness of the updated tracking loops.|$|E

40|$|Signal count {{rates and}} orbital time bias {{estimates}} vary widely {{over the range}} of satellite altitudes. In order to obtain an acceptable photon count rate for the higher satellites (e. g.

For <b>lower</b> <b>satellites,</b> the uncertainty in the satellite angular position and the signal count rates are both relatively high. Thus, the SLR 2000 design targets a nominal range of beam divergence half angles between 4 arcsec (larger than the combined effects of mount pointing jitter and atmospherically induced spreading and beam wander) for high satellites and 13 arcsec (adequate to accommodate time bias uncertainties) for LEO satellites. A modified commercial beam expander in the transmitter is used to maintain a constant transmitter beam size at the telescope exit aperture for eye safety while simultaneously varying the beam divergence to accommodate the various satellite altitudes and angular uncertainties...|$|R

30|$|More than 2  years of {{magnetic}} field data {{taken by the}} three-satellite constellation mission Swarm are used to derive a model of Earth’s magnetic field and its time variation. This model is called SIFMplus. In addition to the magnetic field observations provided by {{each of the three}} Swarm satellites, explicit advantage is taken of the constellation aspect of Swarm by including East–West magnetic intensity and vector field gradient information from the <b>lower</b> <b>satellite</b> pair. Along-track differences of the magnetic intensity {{as well as of the}} vector components provide further information concerning the North–South gradient. The SIFMplus model provides a description of the static lithospheric field that is very similar to models determined from CHAMP data, up to at least spherical harmonic degree n= 75. Also the core field part of SIFMplus, with a quadratic time dependence for n < 6 and a linear time dependence for n= 7 – 15, demonstrates the possibility to determine high-quality field models from only 2  years of Swarm data, thanks to the unique constellation aspect of Swarm. To account for the magnetic signature caused by ionospheric electric currents at polar latitudes we co-estimate, together with the model of the core, lithospheric and large-scale magnetospheric fields, a magnetic potential that depends on quasi-dipole latitude and magnetic local time.|$|E
30|$|However, this {{algorithm}} {{does have}} its limitations that should be clearly stated. The simplicity of the model {{and the desire to}} release the results in near-real time mean that spurious signals could contaminate output. Fictitious periods of one day and harmonics are possible due to inaccurate a priori models used to isolate the magnetospheric signal in the Swarm data. Of particular importance is the core-field model, where secular variation errors could manifest themselves as daily and shorter harmonic periods in the FTMM. At longer periods, local-time dependent magneto-spheric signals, not modelled by the FTMM, can still manifest themselves due to the periodicities in the satellites ’ own local-time sampling, particularly {{at the start of the}} mission before the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>satellite</b> orbits diverge. However, it has been shown, in principle, that at least some of the unmodelled signal can be filtered out by using data from all local times. Finally, it is also possible that some unmodelled signals (such as the 27 -day period found by Kunagu et al., 2013) may have strong radial gradients, perhaps from field-aligned currents not modelled by TDS- 1, that could result in different fields being measured by the upper versus lower two Swarm satellites. An attempt to quantify and perhaps mitigate some of these effects could be attempted using existing CHAMP and Øersted data or by using more detailed models of the magnetospheric field (e.g. Tsyganenko and Sitnov, 2005).|$|E

The overarching {{goal of this}} work was to estimate particulate organic carbon (POC) export across three fronts: the Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF), the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) and the Southern Polar Front (SPF). Steady state export fluxes of 234 Th in the upper 100 m ranged from 1600 to 2600 dpm m− 2 d− 1, decreasing with increasing latitude. Using large particle (> 53 μm) C/ 234 Th ratios, the 234 Th-derived POC fluxes at 100 m ranged from 25 to 41 mmol C m− 2 d− 1. Observed C/ 234 Th ratios decreased with increasing depth north of the APF while south of the APF, ratios remained similar or even increased with depth. These changes in C/ 234 Th ratios are likely {{due to differences in}} the food web. Indeed, satellite images, together with macronutrients and dissolved iron concentrations suggest two different planktonic community structures north and south of the APF. Our results indicate that higher ratios of POC flux at 100 m to primary production occurred in nanophytoplankton dominated surface waters, where primary production rates were <b>lower.</b> <b>Satellite</b> images prior to the expedition suggest that the higher export efficiencies obtained in the northern half of the transect {{may be the result of}} the decoupling between production and export (Buesseler 1998). Transfer efficiencies to 400 m, i. e. the fraction of exported POC that reached 400 m, were found to be higher south of the APF, where diatoms were dominant and salps largely abundant.

40|$|The GPS {{receivers}} on-board three identical SWARM satellites provide dual-frequency carrier-phase and code-pseudorange measurements {{primarily for}} orbit determination. Since the ionosphere is a dispersive medium, i. e. refraction effects are frequency dependent. Hence, by combining measurements at {{two or more}} frequencies the propagation delay or ionospheric total electron content (TEC) can be estimated along the SWARM-GPS paths. The phase derived TEC is precise and smooth but biased by an unknown phase ambiguity constant whereas the code derived TEC is not ambiguous but noisy and less precise. Therefore, we use the low-noise carrier phase derived relative TEC to smooth the code-derived relative TEC. However, the differential carrier phase and code measurements are biased by receiver and satellite instrumental delays. Here we present a new method for bias estimation of GPS receivers installed on board the SWARM satellites for slant TEC calibration. Used are the daily estimates of GPS satellite biases that are publicly available from the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE) in Bern. Additionally, high quality CODE post processed vertical TEC maps are used together with a multi-layer mapping function approach to initialize TEC for the highest elevation angle ray-path in the SWARM-GPS connected arc. An exponential decay of electron density with altitude is used to model the plasmaspheric electron content above the SWARM satellite height. We successfully tested and validated the method for the GPS receiver bias estimation on board COSMIC satellites. Although the SWARM satellites (~ 460 - 530 km) fly far below of the orbit of the COSMIC satellites (~ 700 - 800 km) the initial investigation shows that the method can also be applied for receivers onboard <b>lower</b> <b>satellite</b> orbit height due to usage of actual vertical TEC maps and advanced mapping function approach...|$|E
30|$|One other {{important}} feature from Fig.  4 {{is that the}} estimates derived from both ROTI and RODI data for both post-sunset and post-midnight periods from the SWA satellite differ from the corresponding SWB observations. Several factors {{can contribute to the}} observed satellite-to-satellite differences. First is an altitude difference of ~ 50  km between two satellites with possibility that the upper satellite can cross the plasma density irregularities with lesser intensity than the <b>lower</b> <b>satellite.</b> We should also note that both ROTI and RODI values are based on absolute differences and for the cases of generally lower TEC and Ne values at higher orbit altitudes for SWB satellite the derived ROTI and RODI might be lower here comparing with the lower SWA satellite. The second and more important reason is the temporal/longitudinal separation between the satellites. As shown in Fig.  1, SWA satellite flew in the post-sunset sector earlier than SWB and for the most covered seasons (September 2014, March 2015, June 2015 and December 2015) SWA provided more observations for 20 – 23 LT temporal range. Progressive longitude separation of the satellites becomes more essential for the evening LT sector in February 2015 and reaches more than 1.5  h in LT. This means that SWB satellite appears over the same region up to several hours after SWA and in the case when SWA could be able to cross plasma irregularities near the peak of their occurrence rate, the successive SWB could cross the decaying plasma bubbles and the obtained estimates of the occurrence probability should be lesser for SWB. This difference between SWA and SWB results could be clearly observed while comparing the December 2014 and December 2015 solstices (Fig.  5 a, c, right panels), where an increased separation between satellites (from 0.7 – 1.0 to 2.6 – 2.9  h) leads to a much smaller values of the occurrence rates derived from the SWB observations.|$|E

40|$|Hetons are {{baroclinic}} vortices able {{to transport}} tracers or species, and {{which have been}} observed at sea. This paper studies the offset collision of two identical hetons, often resulting {{in the formation of}} a baroclinic tripole, in a continuously stratified quasi-geostrophic model. This process is of interest since it (temporarily or definitely) stops the transport of tracers contained in the hetons. Firstly, the structure, stationarity and nonlinear stability of baroclinic tripoles composed of an upper core and of two <b>lower</b> (symmetric) <b>satellites</b> are studied analytically for point vortices and numerically for finite-area vortices. The condition for stationarity of the point vortices is obtained and it is proven that the baroclinic point tripoles are neutral. Finite-volume stationary tripoles exist with marginal states having very elongated (figure- 8) upper core. In the case of vertically distant upper and lower cores, these latter can nearly joint {{near the center of the}} plane. These steady states are compared with their two-layer counterparts. Then, the nonlinear evolution of the steady states shows when they are often neutral (showing an oscillatory evolution); when they are unstable, they can either split into two hetons (by breaking of the upper core) or form a single heton (by merger of the <b>lower</b> <b>satellites).</b> These evolutions reflect the linearly unstable modes which can grow on the vorticity poles. Very tall tripoles can break up vertically due to the vertical shear mutually induced by the poles. Finally, the formation of such baroclinic tripoles from the offset collision of two identical hetons is investigated numerically. This formation occurs for hetons offset by less than the internal separation between their poles. The velocity shear during the interaction can lead to substantial filamentation by the upper core, thus forming small, upper satellites, vertically aligned with the lower ones. Finally, in the case of close and flat poles, this shear (or the baroclinic instability of the tripole) can be strong enough that the formed baroclinic tripole is short-lived and that hetons eventually emerge from the collision and drift away.
