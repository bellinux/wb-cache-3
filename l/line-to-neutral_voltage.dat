In some ways, the high leg delta service provides {{the best of both}} worlds: a line-to-line voltage that is higher than the usual 208 V that most three-phase services have, and a <b>line-to-neutral</b> <b>voltage</b> (on two of the phases) sufficient for connecting appliances and lighting. Thus, large pieces of equipment will draw less current than with 208 V, requiring smaller wire and breaker sizes.

50|$|Many areas, {{such as the}} USA, {{which use}} (nominally) 120 V make use of three-wire, {{split-phase}} 240 V systems to supply large appliances. In this system a 240 V supply has a centre-tapped neutral to give two 120 V supplies which can also supply 240 V to loads connected between the two line wires. Three-phase systems can be connected to give various combinations of voltage, suitable for use by different classes of equipment. Where both single-phase and three-phase loads are served by an electrical system, the system may be labelled with both voltages such as 120/208 or 230/400 V, to show the <b>line-to-neutral</b> <b>voltage</b> and the line-to-line voltage. Large loads are connected for the higher voltage. Other three-phase voltages, up to 830 volts, are occasionally used for special-purpose systems such as oil well pumps. Large industrial motors (say, more than 250 hp or 150 kW) may operate on medium voltage. On 60 Hz systems a standard for medium voltage equipment is 2400/4160&nbsp (2300/4000 in USA);V whereas 3300 V is the common standard for 50 Hz systems.|$|E

For example, PWM-based three-phase voltage source inverters (VSI) convert DC power to AC power with variable voltage magnitude and variable frequency. This thesis discusses the advantages and drawbacks of three different PWM techniques: the sinusoidalPWM(SPWM) technique, the third-harmonic-injection PWM(THIPWM) technique, and the space-vector PWM (SVPWM) technique.

The THIPWM and SVPWM techniques in the under-modulation region can both increase the fundamental output voltage by 15. 5 % over the SPWM technique.

40|$|Electrical {{energy is}} a product and, like any other product, should satisfy the proper quality requirements. If {{electrical}} equipment is to operate correctly, it requires electrical energy to be supplied at a voltage that is within a specified range around the rated value. A {{significant part of the}} equipment in use today, especially electronic and computer devices, requires good power quality (PQ). However, the same equipment often causes distortion of the voltage supply in the installation, because of its non-linear characteristics, i. e. it draws a non-sinusoidal current with a sinusoidal supply voltage (see Section 3. 1 of this Guide). Thus, maintaining satisfactory PQ is a joint responsibility for the supplier and the electricity user. According to standard EN 50160 [1] the supplier is the party who provides electricity via a public distribution system, and the user or customer is the purchaser of electricity from a supplier. The user is entitled to receive a suitable quality of power from the supplier. In practice the level of PQ is a compromise between user and supplier. Where the available PQ is not sufficient for the user’s needs, PQ improvement measures will be needed and will be the subject of a cost-benefit analysis (see Section 2. 5 of this Guide). However, the cost of poor PQ usually exceeds the cost of measures required for improvement - it is estimated that losses caused by poor power quality cost EU industry and commerce about € 10 billion per annum (see Section 2. 1 of this Guide). However, electrical energy is a very specific product. The possibility for storing electricity in any significant quantity is very limited so it is consumed at the instant it is generated. Measurement and evaluation {{of the quality of the}} supplied power has to be made at the instant of its consumption. The measurement of PQ is complex, since the supplier and user, whose sensitive electrical equipment is also a source of disturbances, have different perspectives. Standard IEC 038 [2] distinguishes two different voltages in electrical networks and installations: supply voltage, which is the line-to-line or <b>line-to-neutral</b> <b>voltage</b> at the point of common coupling, i. e. main supplying point of installation, utility voltage, which is the line-to-line or <b>line-to-neutral</b> <b>voltage</b> at the plug or terminal of the electrical device. The main document dealing with requirements concerning the supplier’s side is standard EN 50160, which characterises voltage parameters of electrical energy in public distribution systems. This is a European standard but it is supplemented in some regions or countries by other supplemental standards, such as [3] in Germany, or [4] in Poland. Many regional codes, such as the German TAB [3] apply to an individual utility, but these are being unified as part of the liberalisation of the German electricity market. According to IEC 038, both standard EN 50160 and rules [3, 4] concern the supply voltage, i. e. that measured at the point of common coupling. On the user’s side, it is the quality of power available to the user’s equipment that is important. Correct equipment operation requires the level of electromagnetic influence on equipment to be maintained below certain limits. Equipment is influenced by disturbances on the supply and by other equipment in the installation, as well as itself influencing the supply. These problems are summarised in the EN 61000 series of EMC standards, in which limits of conducted disturbances are characterised. Equipment sensitivity to utility voltage quality, as well as mitigation measures, are presented in Section 3 (Harmonics) and Section 5 (Voltage Disturbances) of this Guide. The subject of this section is a detailed presentation of standard EN 50160 and an analysis of its requirements according to the operation of chosen equipment. Methods of measuring supply voltage parameters are also presented...|$|E
