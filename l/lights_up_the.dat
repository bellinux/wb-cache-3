500|$|The Doctor {{learns that}} the ship escaped {{destruction}} {{at the moment of}} the collapse of the Dalek flagship Crucible after it fell through Time by accident, leaving it nearly drained of power. The Daleks' objective is to restart the Progenator, which contains pure Dalek DNA, thus restoring their race; since these particular Daleks were created by Davros from his DNA, the Progenator could not properly accept them as [...] "Daleks", and thus they required a testimony from their greatest enemy to activate it. The Doctor threatens to destroy the ship, including himself, before the Progenitor completes, but the Daleks fire an energy beam at London that <b>lights</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> entire city minutes before an air raid by the Luftwaffe, leaving the Doctor's allies vulnerable and creating a stalemate.|$|E
500|$|The Off-Broadway {{production}} {{opened on}} October 22, 2013, to positive reviews. Ben Brantley of The New York Times {{spoke of the}} musical's emotional impact, artistry and universality, calling it a [...] "beautiful heartbreaker of a musical". [...] "Fun Home isn’t just a coming out story or a coming-of-age story. Its universality comes from its awareness of how we never fully know even those closest to us, and of the undercurrent of grown-up secrets, intuited by children, that exists to some degree in every family. Fun Home finds a shining clarity that <b>lights</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> night." [...] Brantley praised both writer Kron and composer Tesori for their work. Of Kron he says: [...] "her book and resonantly precise lyrics give this show its essential spine", and of Tesori's score [...] "her best and most varied score to date... captures [...] haunting ambiguity." [...] Brantley later listed Fun Home {{as one of his}} top 15 shows of 2013.|$|E

500|$|Early {{publicity}} {{for the character}} gave her name as Eliza Clark. This was ultimately changed to Faye Morton, and although Faye did not first appear on-screen until January 2007, the announcement that Patsy Kensit had been cast in the role was made on 14 December 2005. Holby City executive producer Richard Stokes and series producer Emma Turner spoke of their delight at Kensit's casting, describing her as [...] "a talented and popular actress who <b>lights</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> screen." [...] Kensit took the role in Holby City {{after two years of}} working on the ITV soap opera Emmerdale, commenting that she was [...] "thrilled" [...] to be offered the part, and was looking forward to working in London. Having formerly worked in Yorkshire to film Emmerdale, working in London reduced the actress' daily commute to 45 minutes. Television critic Jim Shelley noted that Kensit's casting in the role followed a trend of Holby City producers for hiring established actors, including comedian Adrian Edmondson and Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the song}} is 4 minutes and 27 seconds long, the video is 3 minutes and 17 seconds long due to the {{omission}} of the second verse. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine and Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the fact that Beyoncé wears several different clothes including the dress that was worn during her performance at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. The clip starts with a casually dressed Beyoncé moving in coordination with her male back-up dancers who are also wearing casual clothes and Nike Dunks. Wearing a black body suit with black hose, Beyoncé puts on a display of footwork before breaking into the song. About halfway through, the visuals suddenly switch to night as the singer <b>lights</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> space in various formal looks, including a gold pantsuit, white suit, and finally a tuxedo complete with coattails, top hat, and cane. The choreography from here resembles that of the 1960s male groups. The wardrobe changes in fact correspond with every key change, except the final one. The video ends with Beyoncé yelling [...] "cut!" [...] and the shot returns to them at rehearsal.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the earlier}} names of Nagpur was [...] "Fanindrapura". It derives its origin from the 'Fana' or hood of a cobra. In fact, Nagpur's first {{newspaper}} was named 'Fanindramani', which means a jewel that {{is believed to be}} suspended over a cobra's hood. It is this jewel that <b>lights</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> darkness, hence the name of the newspaper. The river Nag flows through the city. B. R.

2500|$|In 2011, Rampal {{played the}} titular {{negative}} role in Anubhav Sinha's science fiction movie Ra.One. The movie became a successful film in India and overseas and received mixed reviews. Rampal's new bald look {{earned him a}} lot of appreciation and popularity within the audiences. Majority of the fans considered his [...] "Ra. One" [...] look to be better than that of the protagonist [...] "G.One". He earned critical acclaim for his villainous performance. Martin D'Souza praised Rampal's performance and considered him to be the savior of the film that was being flawless in the second half. He wrote: [...] "It's only after the interval that the plot meanders a bit, loses it sting and almost falls apart like a pixelised image, before Arjun <b>lights</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> screen." [...] Arthur J Pais of Rediff.com wrote: [...] "The best person to gain from the film directed by Anubhav Sinha with more inane and crude sexual jokes than in any recent Hindi film, is Arjun Rampal. His body language and brooding face creates a quietly menacing villain." [...] Raja Sen wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal is the best thing in the biggest budget Indian feature of all time." [...] Aseem Chhabra considered Rampal to be the [...] "most interesting element of the film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing for The Village Voice, Stephanie Zacharek praised Jennifer Lawrence's performance, {{writing that}} the actress is [...] "both {{on fire and}} in the process of becoming, and it’s {{magnificent}} to watch."

Katniss is a character worth a handful of sequels. And Lawrence <b>lights</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> screen. You'll follow her anywhere." [...] He also commended supporting actors Sam Claflin and Jena Malone. Reviewing on Roger Ebert's website, Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today awarded the film three out of four stars, praising the acting of Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer and Jena Malone and referring to the challenges of the arena as [...] "visually intriguing." [...] Wloszczyna writes: [...] "...the one truly fresh invention—and the one that matters most—is Katniss herself. With each on-screen chapter, the poor girl from District 12 continues to fulfill her destiny as an inspiration and a rebel fighter." [...] Ian Nathan of Empire gave the film 4 stars out of 5 and noted that it was even better than the first film. He praised director Lawrence for [...] "taking a more muscular approach" [...] and [...] "sensibly downplaying" [...] the love triangle, noting that [...] "neither , quite frankly, are fit to lay a pinky on [...] quiver". One fault he did find was in Philip Seymour Hoffman's [...] "surprisingly ineffective performance".|$|E
