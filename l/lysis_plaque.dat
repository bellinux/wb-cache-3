40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{putative}} autoantigen in Graves' ophthalmopathy (Go) remains an enigma but the sequence similarity between thyroglobulin (Tg) and acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) provides a rationale for epitopes which are common to the thyroid gland and the eye orbit. In an attempt to define the shared epitope, we have screened a lambda gt 11 human thyroid cDNA library using a polyclonal antibody to Torpedo ACHE and isolated two clones, which upon sequencing, were shown to contain Tg segments, corresponding to portions of the C terminal part of the molecule which has a high similarity with ACHE. Having demonstrated {{the existence of an}} epitope common to Tg and ACHE, the clones have been further tested and found to be positive in <b>lysis</b> <b>plaque</b> assays with 1 / 10 sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), 8 / 8 from patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy and 0 / 8 normal sera. We have investigated the physiological significance of this common epitope by in situ immunolocalization studies in which the polyclonal antibody to Torpedo ACHE (which was used for screening the library) and immunoglobulins (Igs) from 6 Go patients tested were shown to bind to end plate regions of human foetal muscle fibres which were concurrently shown to be rich in cholinesterase activity: Igs from 3 normal individuals and 2 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis did not bind. The results demonstrate and characterize an epitope which is common to Tg and ACHE and show that Go patients Igs contain antibodies which bind to muscle end plates rich in cholinesterase. The significance of these findings to the pathogenesis of Go is discussed. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|The NS 3 -NS 4 A serine {{protease}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) mediates four specific cleavages of the viral polyprotein and its activity is considered {{essential for the}} biogenesis of the HCV replication machinery. Despite extensive biochemical and structural characterization, the analysis of natural variants of this enzyme has been limited {{by the lack of}} an efficient replication system for HCV in cultured cells. We have recently described the generation of chimeric HCV-Sindbis viruses whose propagation depends on the NS 3 -NS 4 A catalytic activity. NS 3 -NS 4 A gene sequences were fused to the gene coding for the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein {{in such a way that}} processing of the chimeric polyprotein, nucleocapsid assembly, and production of infectious viruses required NS 3 -NS 4 A-mediated proteolysis (G. Filocamo, L. Pacini, and G. Migliaccio, J. Virol. 71 : 1417 - 1427, 1997). Here we report the use of these chimeric viruses to select and characterize active variants of the NS 3 -NS 4 A protease. Our original chimeric viruses displayed a temperature-sensitive phenotype and formed <b>lysis</b> <b>plaques</b> much smaller than those formed by wild-type (wt) Sindbis virus. By serially passaging these chimeric viruses on BHK cells, we have selected virus variants which formed <b>lysis</b> <b>plaques</b> larger than those produced by their progenitors and produced NS 3 -NS 4 A proteins different in size and/or sequence from those of the original viruses. Characterization of the selected protease variants revealed that all of the mutated proteases still efficiently processed the chimeric polyprotein in infected cells and also cleaved an HCV substrate in vitro.

40|$|Objective: Viral {{recombination}} can dramatically change virulence {{properties of}} the viruses and has been evidenced in silico for different human NoV strains isolated from clinical cases. Previously, a recombinant Wu 20 /CW 1 strain was obtained after in vitro coinfection of RAW 264. 7 cells with parental MuNoV strains CW 1 and Wu 20 (Mathijs et al 2010). The recombinant strain showed reduced plaque size compared to the parental strains and {{it was suggested that}} this was due to modified virulence properties in vitro. The aim {{of this study was to}} observe and molecularly characterize the natural genetic evolution of the recombinant MuNoV strain across in vitro replications. Methods: MNV strains used in this study were CW 1, WU 20 (Thackray et al., 2007, kindly provided by prof. H. Virgin) and Rec MNV (Mathijs et al., 2010). RAW 264. 7 cells (ATCC TIB- 71) grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) complemented (DMEMc) with 10 % heat inactivated FCS (BioWhittaker), 2 % penicillin (5000 U /ml) and streptomycin (5000 mg/ml) (PS; Invitrogen) and 1 % HEPES buffer (1 M; Invitrogen). The recombinant strain was serially replicated in vitro in RAW 264. 7 cells (up to 14 passages). RAW 264. 7 (Mouse leukaemic monocyte macrophage) cells were infected with MNV for 72 hours and afterwards lysed by freeze and thaw and viruses purified by ultracentrifugation of both cells and supernatant. Viral plaque sizes of early and late progenies (30 for each virus) were compared with the Image J software. The experiment was repeated two times. RNA was extracted from 140 ml purified suspension 1 : 5 diluted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini KitTM (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated using a poly-A primer tagged GCCAACGACCGGGAGGCCAGC(T) 20 previously described (Müller et al 2007) using superscript ii reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen®) treated with RNase H or with other antisense primers using iScript select kit (Bio-Rad®). For the genetic characterization two different studies were conducted. The first study aimed to develop a sequencing strategy in order to obtain the complete genome of the recombinant MNV. Then, in the second study, sequences obtained from different viral passages into RAW cells (e. g. P 5 and P 14) were compared in order to study the viral adaptation. Primers were designed using the Primer Express® software and netprimer® (Premier biosoft). PCR was performed using taq polymerase with thermopol buffer (new England biolabs) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Afterwards, fragments were excised from agarose gel and DNA purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction KitTM (Qiagen) and cloning using the PGEM T easy cloning kit (Promega) plasmid DNA was transferred to sequencing by GATC Biotech (Koblenz, Germany). Results: The size of the <b>lysis</b> <b>plaque</b> surface of P 2 and P 14 showed a considerable divergence. The average plaque size increased from the earlier to the later progenies (from 0. 1 mm 2 to around 0. 5 mm 2). A significant difference was demonstrated between them with the Mann and Whitney non parametric statistical test. The genetic characterization of the recombinant strain obtained in vitro was previously based on partial genomic sequences, which provided limited information. Accordingly to our initial molecular analysis of 1. 5 kb partial genomic sequence comprising the part of the RdRp and the part of the VP 1 did not show any genetic modifications between passage 4 (accession number HM 044221) and passage 14 recMNV. Therefore, a strategy for sequencing the complete genome of the different MNV strains was established. The genome of the recombinant MNV was divided into seven regions and the amplification was performed using either new designed or previous published primers. Molecular analysis using the nearly complete genome of the recombinant MNV passage 14 and the two parental strains (CW 1 and WU 20) showed nine modifications in the genome, comprising three aminoacid changes. Accordingly, two modification were in the RdRp region aa position 1384 Glycine (G) instead of Aspartic acid (D) and aa position 1393 Serine (S) instead of Asparagine (N) and one modification was in the capsid region one modification on aa position 296 Glutamic Acid (E) instead of Lysine. Conclusion: Even preliminary, our data provide evidence of virus adaptation to a new environment (here a cell culture system) after a recombination event. In order to specify whether these hints of genetic mutations could explain fitness modifications during in vitro evolution we need to compare the sequences of passage 14 and the previous viral cellular passages. In addition, two other parameters of in vitro virulence modification will be investigated: (i) virus production and (ii) growth kinetics. The data should provide interesting information about genetic evolution in the genus Norovirus, especially regarding recombination events and explain how a recombinant strain, first disadvantaged compared to its parental strains, could regain fitness by genetic evolution.

To further understand the patho-genic role of these viruses, we aimed to isolate them from a patient presenting with pneumonia. Methods. We cultured, on Acanthamoeba polyphaga amoebae, pulmonary samples from 196 Tunisian patients with community-acquired pneumonia during the period 2009 – 2010. An improved technique was used for Mimivi-rus isolation, which used agar plates where the growth of giant viruses is revealed by the formation of <b>lysis</b> <b>plaques.</b> Mimivirus serology was tested by microimmunofluorescence and by bidimensional immunoproteomic analysis usingMimivirus strains, to identify specific immunoreactive proteins. The newMimivirus strain genome sequencing was performed on Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium, then AB SOLiD instruments. Results. We successfully isolated aMimivirus (LBA 111), the largest virus ever isolated in a human sample, from a 72 -year-old woman presenting with pneumonia. Electron microscopy revealed a Mimivirus-like virion with a size of 554 ± 10 nm. The LBA 111 genome is 1. 23 megabases, and it is closely related to that of Megavirus chilensis.

40|$|A mutational {{and genetic}} {{analysis}} of the poliovirus protein 3 A {{has led to the}} identification of a single amino acid mutant virus with a restrictive phenotype to form plaques in Vero cells. This mutant (I 46 T 3 A) can be grown and amplified in HeLa cells, where virus replication takes place at wild-type levels. However, Vero cells infected with this virus cannot complete the growth cycle. I 46 T 3 A virus has a defect in the ability to kill Vero cells, as estimated by FACS analysis of propidium iodide uptake by dead cells. Since these defects are observed under conditions where no abnormalities in the rate of synthesis and processing of the mutant polyprotein occur, the inability to induce the cytopathic effect in infected Vero cells denotes the existence of a defect in the activity of 3 A, but not the level of expression of the viral genome. As a consequence of this impaired capability to generate the cytopathic effect, I 46 T 3 A mutant viruses cannot be titrated by plaque assay in Vero cells. Only revertant viruses with the wild-type sequence arise and form <b>lysis</b> <b>plaques</b> in Vero cells. Our results suggest a role for the 3 A protein (or a precursor thereof) in the virusinduced cytopathic effect.

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) NS 3 protease cleaves the viral polyprotein {{at specific}} sites {{to release the}} putative components of the HCV replication machinery. Selective inhibition of this enzyme is predicted to block virus replication, and NS 3 is thus considered an attractive candidate for development of anti-HCV therapeutics. To {{set up a system}} for analysis of NS 3 protease activity in cultured cells, we constructed a family of chimeric Sindbis viruses which carry sequences coding for NS 3 and its activator, NS 4 A, in their genomes. HCV sequences were fused to the gene coding for the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein via an NS 3 -specific cleavage site, with the expectation that processing of the chimeric polyprotein, nucleocapsid assembly, and generation of viable viral particles would occur only upon NS 3 -dependent proteolysis. Indeed, the chimeric genomes encoding an active NS 3 protease produced infectious viruses in mammalian cells, while those encoding NS 3 inactivated by alanine substitution of the catalytic serine did not. However, in infected cells chimeric genomes recombined, splicing out HCV sequences and reverting to pseudo-wild-type Sindbis virus. To force retention of HCV sequences, we modified one of the initial chimeras by introducing a second NS 3 cleavage site in the Sindbis virus portion of the recombinant polyprotein, anticipating that revertants not encoding an active NS 3 protease would not be viable. The resulting chimera produced infectious viruses which replicated at a lower rate than the parental construct and displayed a marked temperature dependence in the formation of <b>lysis</b> <b>plaques</b> yet stably expressed NS 3...|$|R
40|$|Biofilm formation, one of {{the most}} {{important}} virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria, protects bacteria against desiccation, antibiotics, phages and host immune responses. However, phage-derived depolymerases show antibiofilm activity and demonstrate great potential to treat infections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria. In this study, the Escherichia coli phage vB_EcoM_ECOO 78 was isolated and characterised, and we observed its ability to lyse five out of 34 tested E. coli clinical isolates. The highest phage titre was observed at a multiplicity of infection of 10 - 5 and a burst size of approximately 74 plaque forming units (PFU) /infection. Electron micrographs indicated that vB_EcoM_ECOO 78 belongs to the family Myoviridae. The presence of increasing halos surrounding the <b>lysis</b> <b>plaques</b> formed by vB_EcoM_ECOO 78 indicated that this phage may encode a depolymerase. Based on a sequencing analysis, the complete genome of vB_EcoM_ECOO 78 was found to be 41, 289 bp in size, with a GC content of 53. 07 %. Additionally, vB_EcoM_ECOO 78 has 56 predicted open reading frames, 51 (91. 07 %) of which are assumed to be functional. A BLAST analysis indicated that ORF 42 of vB_EcoM_ECOO 78 (Dpo 42) has low identity with other reported phage-associated depolymerases. Dpo 42 was expressed and purified as a soluble protein using E. coli BL 21. The biofilm formation ability of E. coli isolates and the antibiofilm activity of Dpo 42 were tested by performing spot assays and using a 96 -well micro-titre plate method. Dpo 42 degraded the capsular polysaccharides surrounding E. coli and exhibited dose-dependent biofilm-formation prevention activity. Based on these results, Dpo 42 appears to be a novel phage-derived depolymerase that represents a new potential strategy for preventing E. coli biofilm formation...|$|R

The antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has an efficient action against {{a wide range of}} microorganisms and can be viewed as an alternative approach for treating microbial infections. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if a model target virus (T 4 -like bacteriophage), in the presence of the tricationic porphyrin 5, 10, 15 -tris(1 -methylpyridinium- 4 -yl) - 20 -(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin tri-iodide (Tri-Py(+) -Me-PF), can develop resistance to aPDT and recover its viability after photodynamic treatments. To assess the development of aPDT resistance after repeated treatments, a suspension of T 4 -like bacteriophage was irradiated with white light (40 W m(- 2)) for 120 min in the presence of 5. 0 mu M of Tri-Py(+) -Me-PF (99. 99 % of inactivation) and new phage suspensions were produced from the surviving phages, after each cycle of light exposure. The procedure was repeated ten times. To evaluate the recovery of viral viability after photoinactivation, a suspension of T 4 -like bacteriophage was irradiated with white light for 120 min in the presence of 5. 0 mu M of Tri-Py(+) -Me-PF on five consecutive days. In each day, an aliquot of the irradiated suspension was plated and the number of <b>lysis</b> <b>plaques</b> was counted after 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h of dark incubation at 37 degrees C. The profile of bacteriophage photoinactivation did not change after ten consecutive cycles and no recovery of viability was detected after five accumulated cycles of photodynamic treatment.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{relationship between}} receptor binding and hormone secretion at the single-cell level {{was investigated in}} the present study by combining a reverse hemolytic plaque assay for measurement of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion from individual pituitary cells with an autoradiographic assay of 125 I-labeled gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist binding to the same cells. In the plaque assay, LH secretion induces complement-mediated lysis of the LH-antibody-coated erythrocytes around the gonadotropes, resulting in areas of <b>lysis</b> (<b>plaques).</b> LH release from individual gonadotropes was quantified by comparing radioimmunoassayable LH release to hemolytic area in similarly treated cohort groups of cells; plaque area was linearly related to the amount of LH secreted. Receptor autoradiography was performed using 125 I-labeled GnRH-A (a superagonist analog of GnRH) both as the ligand and as the stimulant for LH release in the plaque assay; the developed silver grains appearing over cells in the center of plaques were measured microscopically. The grains appeared to represent specific and high-affinity receptors for GnRH because no pituitary cells other than gonadotropes bound the labeled ligand and grain development was progressively inhibited by coincubation with increasing doses of unlabeled GnRH-A. Despite high correlations between mean grain number and mean plaque area in dose-response curves, the correlation coefficients for these parameters were low (range 0. 02 - 0. 38) in the individual cells comprising these groups. We conclude that GnRH receptor number for any individual gonadotrope is a weak determinant of the amount of LH it can secrete; nevertheless, full occupancy of all its GnRH receptors is required for any gonadotrope to reach its full LH-secretory capacity. Apparently the levels of other factors comprising the steps along the secretory pathway determine the secretory capacity of an individual cell...|$|R

We have investigated the ultrastructural changes of Sulfolobus solfataricus P 2 associated with infection by Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV). A time course of a near synchronous STIV infection was analyzed using both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Assembly of STIV particles, including particles lacking DNA, was observed within cells, and fully assembled STIV particles were visible by 30 h postinfection (hpi). STIV was determined to be a lytic virus, causing cell disruption beginning at 30 hpi. Prior to cell lysis, virus infection resulted in the formation of pyramid-like projections from the cell surface. These projections, which have not been documented in any other host-virus system, appeared to be caused by the protrusion of the cell membrane beyond the bordering S-layer.

Maximal <b>lysis</b> and <b>plaque</b> production was found to occur on a medium with a Tryptone concentration of 2. 0 to 2. 5 %.

Examination of five strains of Pseudomonas, which routinely exhibited the autolytic phenomenon, indicated that all were both lysogenic and pyocinogenic when tested against other Pseudomonas strains on both 2 and 0. 5 % Tryptone. Culturing of autolytic strain Pa- 1 on a simple medium composed of glucose and inorganic salts appeared to be inadequate for “auto-plaque” formation, although lysis occurred occasionally when a yeast extract concentration of 1 % was incorporated into the medium.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{appearance}} of plaques on a bacterial lawn {{is one of}} the enduring imageries in modern day biology. The seeming simplicity of a plaque has invited many hypotheses and models in trying to describe and explain the details of its formation. However, until now, there has been no systematic experimental exploration on how different bacteriophage (phage) traits may influence the formation of a plaque. In this study, we constructed a series of isogenic λ phages that differ in their adsorption rate, lysis timing, or morphology so that we can determine the effects if these changes on three plaque properties: size, progeny productivity, and phage concentration within plaques. Results We found that the adsorption rate has a diminishing, but negative impact on all three plaque measurements. Interestingly, there exists a concave relationship between the <b>lysis</b> time and <b>plaque</b> size, resulting in an apparent optimal lysis time that maximizes the plaque size. Although suggestive in appearance, we did not detect a significant effect of <b>lysis</b> time on <b>plaque</b> productivity. Nonetheless, the combined effects of plaque size and productivity resulted in an apparent convex relationship between the lysis time and phage concentration within plaques. Lastly, we found that virion morphology also affected plaque size. We compared our results to the available models on plaque size and productivity. For the models in their current forms, a few of them can capture the qualitative aspects of our results, but not consistently in both plaque properties. Conclusions By using a collection of isogenic phage strains, we were able to investigate the effects of individual phage traits on plaque size, plaque productivity, and average phage concentration in a plaque while holding all other traits constant. The controlled nature of our study allowed us to test several model predictions on plaque size and plaque productivity. It seems that a more realistic theoretical approach to plaque formation is needed in order to capture the complex interaction between phage and its bacterium host in a spatially restricted environment. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{temperate}} bacteriophage, designated r 1 t, was inducible {{from the}} group N lactic streptococcus, Streptococcus cremoris R 1, by ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C treatment. Induced lysates produced plaques on lawns of three closely related S. cremoris strains, AM 1, SK 11, and US 3. Strain SK 11 was readily lysogenized. S. cremoris AM 1 was the most reliable indicator strain, although {{the age of the}} culture used for seeding plates was critical.

Phage levels were still very low (1 plaque-forming unit on AM 1 per 10 induced cells) in induced lysates of R 1 cultures. These low levels of detectable phage may be attributable to an inadequate indicator, lysogenization of the indicator, adsorption of induced phage to cellular debris, concurrent induction of other undetectable phages, or the production of high proportions of defective phages.

After infection, these cells were examined for the presence of replicating HSV- 1 in Vero cell overlays. Virus plaques were found, suggesting that latency may have been established...|$|R
40|$|Most bacteriophages (phages) {{release their}} progeny through {{the action of}} holins that form lesions in the cytoplasmic {{membrane}} and lysins that degrade the bacterial peptidoglycan. Although the function of each protein is well established in phages infecting Streptococcus pneumoniae, the role—if any—of the powerful bacterial autolysin LytA in virion release is currently unknown. In this study, deletions of the bacterial and phage lysins were done in lysogenic S. pneumoniae strains, allowing {{the evaluation of the}} contribution of each lytic enzyme to phage release through the monitoring of bacterial-culture <b>lysis</b> and phage <b>plaque</b> assays. In addition, we assessed membrane integrity during phage-mediated lysis using flow cytometry to evaluate the regulatory role of holins over the lytic activities. Our data show that LytA is activated {{at the end of the}} lytic cycle and that its triggering results from holin-induced membrane permeabilization. In the absence of phage lysin, LytA is able to mediate bacterial lysis and phage release, although exclusive dependence on the autolysin results in reduced virion egress and altered kinetics that may impair phage fitness. Under normal conditions, activation of bacterial LytA, together with the phage lysin, leads to greater phage progeny release. Our findings demonstrate that S. pneumoniae phages use the ubiquitous host autolysin to accomplish an optimal phage exiting strategy...|$|R
40|$|Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), {{particularly}} Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, {{are resistant}} to b-lactam antibiotics, b-lactam combinations and often non-b-lactam antibiotics. ESBL-E infections are associated with longer hospital stays and often poorer outcomes. Alternative or complementary therapies for ESBL-E infections are required. In response to the global emergence of antibiotic resistance, there is renewed interest in bacteriophage treatment of bacterial infections. Bacteriophages have high specificity (owing to narrow host ranges), modes of action unrelated to antibiotic targets and self propagating and self-limiting activities, facilitating low dosing and bacteriophage elimination following infection resolution. We determined the in vitro susceptibility of 100 previously characterized ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC) to four bacteriophage cocktails, used as part of standard clinical practice in the Republic of Georgia. ESBL production by ESBL-EC was confirmed according to EUCAST criteria in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland and ESBL-EC were mainly isolated from urine, blood and respiratory specimens. As found for other ESBL-EC collections, the majority belonged to phylogenetic groups B 2 and D (80 / 100, 80 %), but groups A and B 1 were also represented. The activities of four bacteriophage cocktails (Pyo, Intesti, Enko and Ses) were determined against each isolate using in vitro spot tests. Isolates were susceptible if confluent, semi-confluent or opaque <b>lysis</b> or individual <b>plaques</b> (n≥ 1) were observed (single plaques may be propagated to generate bacteriophages with improved lytic spectra) and resistant if lysis was not visible. The bacteriophage cocktails originated in Georgia and are sterile filtrates of phage lysates of bacterial species, including E. coli serovar O 25 b...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 5 (BoHV- 5) is an alphaherpesvirus {{responsible for}} meningoencephalitis in young cattle {{and it is}} antigenically and genetically related to bovine herpesvirus 1. BoHV- 5 outbreaks are sporadic and restricted in their geographical distribution, being mostly detected in the Southern hemisphere. The N 569 and A 663 strains are prototypes of the "a" and "b" subtypes of BoHV- 5, however, scarce information about their in vitro and in vivo properties is currently available. Methods For the in vitro comparison between BoHV- 5 A 663 and N 569 strains, viral growth kinetics, <b>lysis</b> and infection <b>plaque</b> size assays were performed. Additionally, an experimental infection of cattle with BoHV- 5 A 663 and N 569 strains was carried out. Viral excretion, development of neurological signs, presence of specific antibodies in serum and nasal swabs and presence of latent BoHV- 5 DNA in trigeminal ganglion, were analyzed. Histopathological examination of samples belonging to inoculated animals was also performed. Results The lytic capacity and the cell-to-cell spread was lower for the A 663 strain compared to the N 569 strain, however, the production of total infectious viral particles was similar between both strains. Concerning the in vivo properties, the A 663 and N 569 strains are able to induce similar degrees of pathogenicity in cattle. Conclusions Our {{results show that the}} A 663 strain used in this study is less adapted to in vitro replication in MDBK cells than the N 569 strain and, although slight differences were observed, both strains are able to induce a similar degree of virulence in the natural host. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rex-Centric Mutualism The Rex Exclusion Phenotype, encoded by the rexA-rexB {{genes of}} {{bacteriophage}} lambda {{is defined as}} the inability of the mutant bacteriophage T 4 rll to generate plaques on a lysogenized E. coli(λ) host. Although the phenotype was first observed more than four decades ago, few advancements {{have been made in the}} elucidation of the Rex mechanism. The current model for Rex exclusion proposed in 1992 by Parma et aI., states that the Rex system functions as an altruistic bacterial apoptotic module triggered by T 4 rll infection of the lysogenized host. We asked whether Rex exclusion confers a protective or a cell-killing phenotype to the host and found that following T 4 rll infection, the Rex system can channel lysogenic cells into a temporary arrested growth phase that gives an overall protective effect to the host even at enormous multiplicities of infection compared to nonlysogens, despite some associated killing. We termed this phenomenon Rex-centric mutualism. In 1989, Snyder and McWilliams demonstrated that the Rex-mediated arrest of cell growth can be triggered in the absence of infection by over-expressing rexA relative to rexB. We noted that plasmid expression of rexA in Rex⁺ cells in the absence of infection resulted in similar cellular viabilities as that observed following T 4 rll infection. We visualized lambda Rex⁺ lysogens, infected by T 4 rll and found that they were much delayed in colony formation, contracted in length, formed aggregates with adjacent cells, and released flagella. These phenotypes were accentuated in nonlysogenic cells carrying a specific multicopy rexA-rexB plasmid: cells were about two-fold contracted in length, expressed membrane-bound and secreted flagellar structures, were odorous, were insensitive to infection by a variety of phages, and they extensively clumped/adhered when grown up in culture. Lysogenic cells mutated for rpoS stationary phase sigma factor were abrogated for Rex-centric mutualism, exhibiting more than 400 -fold lower viability compared to the wild type, following infection by T 4 rll. These phenotypes show that the Rex system can impart a stationary phase like response that protects the host from T 4 rll killing. RexB Inhibition of T 4 rll Lysis Inhibition Phenotype We add to the activities and phenotypes of RexB. Expression of rexB from either a multicopy plasmid, or a rexA⁻-rexB⁺ phage is capable of suppressing the Lysis Inhibition Phenotype (LIN) seen upon infection of E. coli K strains by T 4 rll at high MOl. We also show that host mutations in either the periplasmic "tail-specific protease" tsp, or the 10 Sa RNA ssrA completely abrogates the establishment of LIN inT 4 rll and T 4 alike. We found that over-expression of rexB in cells suppresses both T 4 t⁻ and λS⁻ holin mutations, increasing the plating efficiency of the mutant phages by up to 10 ⁵ fold. Prophage level expression was noted to suppress the λS⁻ mutation to a lesser degree, but only from a rexB⁺-rexA⁻ prophage and co-expression of rexA with rexB on the prophage, or on a multicopy plasmid inhibited this activity of RexB. We also determined that nonlysogenic cells carrying the multicopy rexB plasmid are leaky for cytoplasmic proteins, whereas lysogenic (λrexB⁺-rexA⁻) cells are not leaky but did reveal an unusually high concentration of cytoplasmic β-galactosidase in the periplasm. Electron microscopy was used to visualize cells transformed with a rexB, or rexA-rexB multicopy plasmid. The rexB plasmid conferred gross distortions to the outer surface of the cell, while the rexA⁺-rexB⁺ plasmid imparted a shrunken, but otherwise normal appearance to cells. Our findings are consistent with RexB function as a pore forming unit, but RexB activity is inhibited by RexA. We propose a model for RexB suppression of T 4 rll lysis inhibition and the involvement of Tsp and 10 Sa RNA in lysis timing and the establishment of LIN. The Conditional Rex Exclusion Phenotype The cl-rex operon of bacteriophage λ is expressed from the PM maintenance promoter of the prophage as PM-cI-rexA-rexB-timm message and confers a T 4 rII mutant phage exclusion phenotype to the lysogen (Rex exclusion). Derepression of the prophage results in very strong PE-cI-rexA-rexB-timm transcription, terminating at timm. Replication and excision defective, cryptic λcI[Ts] 857 cro 27 lysogens exhibit a conditional Rex[Ts] exclusion phenotype. At temperatures where the C 1857 repressor is functional, rexA-rexB expression from PM confers full Rex exclusion. However, upon thermal inactivation of the repressor little or no Rex exclusion is observed, despite a much higher level of transcription from PE, stimulated by CII. The same conditional Rex exclusion phenotype was observed in cells harbouring a low copy plasmid encoding a PTet-PM-c 1857 -rexA-rexB-timm fragment, but not with a cl⁺ derivative plasmid, that imparted a Rex⁺ phenotype. Thermally derepressed λcl[Ts] 857 cro 27 lysogens exhibited very high PE transcription levels that abated dramatically toward the C-terminal of rexA, showing a powerful polar effect on downstream rexB. Renaturation of C 1857 following prophage induction did not reestablish repressor activity, although there was a 20 - 30 fold increase in transcription compared to that seen from the repressed prophage. Introduction of a rho mutation into our conditional Rex[Ts] strains partially suppressed Rex thermosensitivity, increasing Rex exclusion at 43 °C by up to 10 ⁴ fold, while mutation of hflA to stabilize CII and heighten CII-dependent PE transcription conferred only a slight increase. Partial suppression of the conditional Rex[Ts] phenotype was also imparted by ssrA⁻and clpP⁻ null mutations, which suggests that Rex may be subject to 10 Sa RNA tagging and ClpP(X) degradation. We propose two possible models to account for cI-rex polarity and correlation between CI activity and Rex exclusion. RexA:RexB Stoichiometry and the Rex Exclusion Phenotype We examined the influence of disrupting Rex stoichiometric balance on Rex activity to account for how polarity in the PTet-PM-cl 857 -rexA-rexB-t imm operon can abrogate the Rex exclusion phenotype. Cultured λ rex⁺ lysogenic cells were transformed with low-copy, and multicopy plasmids constitutive, or inducible for rexA⁺, rexB⁺, or rexA⁺-rexB⁺ expression. Lambda rex⁺ lysogenic cells transformed with a low-copy plasmid constitutively expressing rexA⁺, conferred only a minor attenuation of Rex exclusion, while transformation of rex⁺ cells with a constitutive, or induced multicopy plasmid expressing rexA⁺, or rexB⁺ completely suppressed the Rex exclusion phenotype. In contrast, multicopy and low-copy rexA⁺-rexB ⁺ and rex⁻ plasmid derivatives did not abrogate Rex exclusion in transformed rex⁺ cells. Furthermore, phage T 4 rll exhibited large rapid <b>lysis</b> <b>plaques</b> on the thermally induced Cro⁺ conditional Rex exclusion phenotypic lysogen, resembling plaques formed on λ lysogens carrying the multicopy constitutive rexB plasmid. Plaques formed on the isogenic cro⁻ derivative were tiny and nonsymmetrical; identical to T 4 rll plaque morphology on λ lysogens carrying the multicopy constitutive rexA⁺ plasmid. Our results suggest that an induced Cro⁺ λ prophage escapes Rex exclusion by over-expressing rexB relative to rexA, while a derepressed λcro⁻ prophage suppresses Rex exclusion phenotype by over-expressing rexA relative to rexB. CI Repressor Modulation of the Rex Exclusion Phenotype Bacteriophage λ mutants defective for ren and red (exo or bet) are sensitive to restriction by λ rex genes, but exclusion is modulated by the cl repressor allele of the prophage. λspi 156 nin 5 forms plaques with 10 ⁵ fold higher efficiency on a cl⁺-rex⁺ lysogen than on cl[Ts] 857, or cl[Ts] 2 derivatives. Exclusion in cl[Ts] lysogens is suppressed by complementation with cl⁺ plasmid...|$|R
40|$|Strains of lactic streptococci {{characterized}} as bitter cheese starters multiplied rapidly during normal cheesemaking and reached high {{populations in the}} curd before salting. The multiplication of starter strains which are typically non-bitter was inhibited by the cooking temperatures used in normal Cheddar cheesemaking, even though acid production continued. The populations reached were substantially lower than with bitter starters. If manufacturing conditions were altered so that non-bitter strains reached high numbers in the curd, cheeses were bitter. Conversely, bitterness was absent, or of reduced intensity, when growth of conventionally bitter starters was restricted during cheese manufacture, either {{by the use of}} raised cooking temperatures, or by bacteriophage attack. The results of 60 cheesemaking trials with 10 starter strains confirmed this association between the size of starter population reached during cheesemaking and {{the presence or absence of}} bitterness. A new model is proposed to account for the development of bitterness in Cheddar cheese. Unlike other schemes where the production of bitter peptides is attributed directly to rennet action on casein, the new hypothesis considers that the starter strain is responsible for the formation of bitter-flavoured peptides and does not merely act to remove them. All starters are potentially able to produce either bitter or non-bitter cheese, depending upon the conditions of manufacture (including bacteriophage development) and, hence, the population reached. The response to selected manufacturing conditions rather than any single difference between particular starter strains determines the likelihood of bitterness development. The key cheesemaking trials were repeated using aseptic techniques under controlled bacteriological conditions. Previous studies of aseptically manufactured cheese utilize starters which gave little Cheddar flavour or exhibited pronounced flavour defects. In this investigation, cheese made aseptically with Streptococcus cremoris AM 2 alone, possessed full Cheddar flavour and no off-flavours provided that normal manufacturing procedures were followed. Cheeses made with AM 2 at a low cooking temperature (33 °C) and ML 8 cheeses made at the normal cooking temperature (38 °C) were extremely bitter and lacking in Cheddar flavour. When appropriate levels of bacteriophage were present during manufacture, bitterness was abolished entirely from both the ML 8 and low-cook AM 2 cheeses. There were accompanying increases in Cheddar flavour scores. A search for temperate bacteriophages and lysogenic strains in the lactic streptococci used as starters in cheesemaking showed that the occurrence of lysogeny or defective lysogeny could be relatively widespread. A temperate bacteriophage was inducible from Str. cremoris R 1 by ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C treatment. Induced lysates produced plaques on lawns of 3 closely related Str. cremoris strains, AM 1, SK 11 and US 3. Strain SK 11 was readily lysogenised. Str. cremoris AM 1 was the most reliable indicator strain, although the age of the culture used for seeding plates was critical. Zones of <b>lysis,</b> but no <b>plaque</b> formation were observed on lawns of 9 additional Str. cremoris strains. Several other strains of both Str. cremoris and Str. lactis were inducible by either treatment but no indicator strains for the induced phages were found. The significance of lysogeny in cheesemaking cannot yet be assessed...|$|R
