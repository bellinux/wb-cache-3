In addition, the winter season of 1987–1988 was drier than usual, with the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem receiving only 31% of the normal snowpack.

By June, the rainfall stopped and little was recorded in the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the next four months. By July, the worst drought in the history of Yellowstone National Park began. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer soon turned to dry tinder. Relative humidity levels fell further, desiccating the forest. Fuel moisture content in dead and fallen timber was recorded as low as 5%. By mid-August, humidity levels were averaging below 20% and were recorded as low as 6% on one occasion. To compound the lack of rainfall, the majority of Yellowstone's soils are rhyolitic volcanic rocks and soils which have poor moisture retention. A series of strong but dry storm fronts also led to the rapid spread of a number of the largest fires.|$|E

Furthermore, forest fires occur naturally and are critical to the long-term survival of many forests, since many trees will only grow once they detect that a fire has occurred since this gives them access to sunlight.

50|$|Handcrews are diverse {{teams of}} career and {{temporary}} wildland firefighters. The crews typically consist of 18 - 20 {{men and women}} but can also contain 4 to 6 and 8 to 10. These crews have the responsibilities of constructing firelines - strips of land cleared of flammable materials and dug down to mineral soil. These lines are generally constructed around wildfires to control them. Another type of line handcrews create is saw line. This is line where all trees limbs are removed up to shoulder height and all small trees and brush is cut down. All the limbs and trees are then carried outside the line and scattered. These are also called <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> that allow the fire to climb up into the canopies which makes controlling a fire much more difficult. Sawyers do the cutting and swampers do the moving of the debris. Depending {{on the size of}} the crew there can be between 1 and 5 swampers per sawyer. Other jobs include, burn outs, gridding for spot fires, and mop up after the fire is controlled.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} LiDAR and <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> in the northern Sierra Nevada, California USA. <b>Ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> are often targeted in hazardous fuel reduction treatments due to their role in propagating fire from the forest floor to tree crowns.

After establishing that landscape fuel treatments reduced canopy and <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> at our site, we tested which LiDAR-derived metrics best differentiated treated from untreated areas. The percent cover between 2 and 4 m had the most explanatory power to distinguish treated from untreated pixels across a range of spatial scales.

Evidences of positive seedling-shrub relationships in the natural recruitment of ponderosa pine suggest that {{the net effect of}} shrubs on tree seedling recruitment is positive (Keyes and Maguire 2005), as they shelter seedlings from moisture stress and reduce the high seedling mortality rates that typically occur during summer months (Keyes et al. 2007, 2009). In the WNRA, this dynamic was visually suggested by the many seedling and sapling clusters that were observed throughout dense shrub-tanoak areas. Subsequent study of this issue, where a shrub layer exists but an understory tree cohort is not apparent, would help identify ecosystem changes that are underway but not yet readily evident.|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{effort to}} reduce fuel hazards in western forested ecosystems places significant emphasis on surface and small <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels.</b> Changes in canopy density, for purposes of either reducing potential crown fire impacts or insect/pathogen-related mortality, are less frequently considered.

40|$|Forests {{historically}} {{associated with}} frequent fire have changed dramatically due to fire suppression and past harvesting {{over the last}} century.

Despite the importance of <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels,</b> methods for quantifying them are limited and imprecise.

30|$|Fire {{behavior}} modeling that utilizes pre- and post-treatment fuel measurements allows {{managers to}} assess the effectiveness of completed fuel treatments to reduce undesirable fire behavior. Specifically, modeled fire type can be used {{to assess the}} effectiveness of completed fuel treatments to alter predicted fire behavior based on changes to surface, <b>ladder,</b> and crown <b>fuels.</b> Mechanical treatments significantly reduced tree density, canopy cover, and canopy bulk density and increased canopy base height and 75 th percentile quadratic mean diameter for all three forest types, which is consistent with past studies (Pollet and Omi 2002, Stephens and Moghaddas 2005 a, Harrod et al. 2007). These changes in stand metrics correlate to reductions in both <b>ladder</b> and canopy <b>fuels.</b> Levels of surface fuel loads are dependant on the type of mechanical treatment utilized and are often higher than pre-treatment conditions (Stephens 1998, Raymond and Peterson 2005, Stephens and Moghaddas 2005 b, Stephens et al. 2009). General trends in this study suggest that mechanical treatments will result in a decrease of <b>ladder</b> and canopy <b>fuels,</b> and an increase in larger diameter surface fuels.|$|R
30|$|Among {{the most}} {{immediate}} threats to the WNRA’s relict forests {{appears to be a}} high susceptibility to stand-replacing wildland fire that the presence of the encroachment cohort has introduced in the form of ladder fuel continuity. Crown fires were historically rare in ponderosa pine dominated forests, primarily due to the scarcity of <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> (Skinner and Chang 1996). As is common for ponderosa pine forests, the forests of the WNRA are believed to have evolved under a regime of frequent fire occurrence that kept those <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> at bay (USDI 2003). The incidence of fires that would have kept those <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> at bay diminished substantially around 1925 (Fry and Stephens 2006). The current arrangement of understory and mid-story strata has resulted in greater vertical connectivity of fuel complexes in WNRA relict forests; in many cases, there is no spatial segregation of surface and aerial fuel complexes. Given the park’s inherently high risk of fire occurrence (presence of a major highway through the park; close proximity to the city of Redding), this hazard presents an acute condition that chronically threatens the WRNA’s relict forests.|$|E
30|$|At {{the stand}} level, fuelbreak {{construction}} (and fuels reduction and forest restoration projects in general) should follow a step-wise progression of {{working from the}} ground up rather than the crown down. Moreover, the pathway for making fuels reduction projects serve programmatic long-term forest restoration goals is to slowly raise up the canopy over time through multiple light entries of thinning-from-below, rather than rapidly opening up the canopy in a single intensive overstory treatment. This means that surface and <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> reduction should be the initial treatments (Graham et al 2004). Functionally this may involve reducing <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> by manually pruning lower limbs or mechanically thinning understory shrubs and pole-sized trees before implementing pile-burning or broadcast understory burning. Reducing surface fuels and treating <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> raises the ground-to-crown base height and disrupts the vertical continuity of fuels. This has the combined effect of lowering potential heat output and flame lengths, with the goal of keeping them below a threshold of conditions necessary to initiate crown fires (Agee 1996, Omi and Martinson 2002). In some stands, simply treating the surface and understory layers of the fuels profile could greatly decrease the risk of uncharacteristic crownfire while maximizing the retention of ecologically valuable overstory trees.|$|E

5000|$|Conifer {{trees in}} the region have been industrially logged, {{sometimes}} illegally, for more than a century. Clear cutting was particularly common with Siberian pine, which was seen as particularly valuable. [...] The removal of these trees is a cause of increased soil erosion {{due to a lack of}} roots. [...] Fire also is a disturbance that is most common in areas with Scots pine stands and is expected to increase in frequency as temperatures rise due to climate change. [...] Forest regeneration in these areas is hindered by the faster growth and spread of grasses, particularly the genus Calamagrostis. Insect outbreaks are a threat to many of the tree species in the region. One example of this type of disturbance is the Siberian silkmoth, a species of moth that eats the leaves and needles of broadleaf and coniferous trees respectively. Its most recent outbreak was in 2002.

30|$|Mature {{sugar pine}} cones, with flame lengths > 1 m and flame {{duration}} of 3 min to 6 min, clearly {{have the potential}} to contribute to surface fire behavior and spread (Fonda and Varner 2004). Under some circumstances, flaming mature cones might also ignite shrubs and tree saplings. Burning cones also contribute to fire spread when they roll downhill beyond the fire perimeter, {{part of the reason for}} the practice of cup-trenching fire lines on steep terrain. Cones that smolder for long periods, such as the approximately 35 min smoldering times observed here for classes I through III, become potential ignition sources in the litter and duff layers with negative consequences for large tree survival (Hood 2010). Our laboratory measurements did not examine differences in burning characteristics due to different moisture contents or due to admixtures of cones and needles (sensu Taylor and Fonda 1990, Fonda and Varner 2004). A combination of laboratory and field experiments would provide insights into the role of sugar pine cones as a flame and heat vector for surface and <b>ladder</b> <b>fuel</b> ignition, or as a vector for duff ignition.|$|R

40|$|Wildfire is {{a natural}} process {{which can lead to}} a variety of {{conditions}} in a forested landscape, some quite destructive. Whatever the cause of a fire, no one questions that destructive fires often occur during certain weather events where litter (woody debris from trees) and <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> are abundant. The US Forest Service has implemented a program to reduce litter and <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> along with thinning of stands in order to mitigate the extent and severity of fires, especially in areas surrounding critical habitat. Fuels reduction/treatment plans are expensive and therefore must be planned over a period of years, often two decades or more. This chapter presents an application of a location-scheduling model which has been developed for the US Forest Service to determine when and where fuels treatments are to be implemented. The model itself is an integer linear programming problem, which has been embed-ded in a decision support system called iFASST. This modeling system is quite flexible, and because of its flexibility has now been used in many of the National Forests in California...|$|E
30|$|This {{information}} {{also may}} be useful for prioritizing areas for fuels treatment. For example, if managers must choose between burning untreated areas of either ponderosa pine forest or white fir-mixed conifer forest, it might be prudent to treat the ponderosa pine forest type first as surface fuels may still be accumulating. It is critical to note that treatment to reduce current fuel hazard and restore altered stand structure (<b>ladder</b> <b>fuels)</b> is still important {{in all of these}} forest types.|$|E

Fire severity, as observed through tree death, was high in the untreated areas adjacent to treated stands.

40|$|In {{the southwestern}} United States, Brassica tournefortii(Sahara mustard) {{is a highly}} {{invasive}} plant that colonizes roadsides, beaches, sand dunes, and open desert threatening native annuals. Sahara mustard is believed to contribute to fuel loads in the Mojave Desert in areas where Schismussp. and Bromussp. occur. Sahara mustard may act as <b>ladder</b> <b>fuel,</b> thereby facilitating the spread of fire throughout the landscape. Manpower limitations and insufficient funding limits the abilities of managers to effectively control Sahara mustard. We tested seed germinability in Sahara mustard after fruiting plants were treated with either 2 %, 5 %, or 12 % triclopyr. Sahara mustard seed pods were labeled based on three developmental stages prior to treatment. Application of herbicide decreased germination from control seeds; however, effectiveness did not differ across concentrations of triclopyr (2, 5, and 12 %). We also tested seed germinability in Sahara mustard after fruiting plants were separated from their resources and allowed to dry in the field. Seed pods were labeled by developmental stage before treatment. The three treatments consisted of: 1) pulling plants with roots intact; 2) pulling the plant and breaking the roots and leaf rosette from the inflorescence; 3) pulling off individual fruits. All treatments resulted in a decrease in germination from control seeds...|$|R
30|$|Conifer {{regeneration}} was {{impacted by}} both burn season and frequency. Ponderosa pine seedling regeneration {{in many areas}} of the western US exceeds the amount needed to maintain forested stands (Sackett and Haase 1998, Battaglia et al. 2008, Higgins et al. 2015). Seedlings, often occurring in scattered dense clusters, quickly contribute to excessive stand density and create a multi-layered canopy of <b>ladder</b> <b>fuel</b> that can substantially raise crown-fire potential (Fule et al. 2004, Agee and Skinner 2005, Battaglia et al. 2008, Higgins et al. 2015). If the management goal is to maintain low crown-fire hazard, these seedlings need to be eliminated before reaching a more fire-resistant stage, with crowns safely above the flame lengths typical of low-severity reburns. Both Battaglia et al. (2008), for the Black Hills, and Bailey and Covington (2002), for Arizona, suggest regeneration densities of no more than 500 ha− 1. While highly variable due to the clustered nature of seedling establishment, all of our treatments exceeded that density when both seedling sizes are combined. Battaglia et al. (2008) found a 10 -year burn frequency to be optimal for controlling excessive conifer seedlings and recommended no more than 15 years in the Black Hills. Our results indicate that, for the Blue Mountain Ecoregion, 15 years may be too long between burns for controlling regeneration through burning alone, especially when reburning is executed during the spring.|$|R
5000|$|A third {{concept of}} Defensible Space is [...] "Fuel Ladder" [...] management. Like rungs on a ladder, {{vegetation}} can {{be present at}} varying heights from groundcovers to trees. Ground fuel 'rungs' such as dried grasses, can transmit fire to shrub rungs, which then transmit up tree branch rungs into the tree canopy. A burning tree produces embers that can blow to new areas spreading and so {{making it more difficult}} to control a wildland fire. One guideline is for a typical separation of three times the height of the lower fuel to the next <b>fuel</b> <b>ladder.</b> For example, a 2 ft shrub under a tree would need a spacing of 6 ft to the lowest limbs of the tree. Since wildfires burn faster uphill than on flat land, <b>fuel</b> <b>ladder</b> spacing may need to be greater for slopes.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> carry {{fire from}} the forest floor to the canopy and thereby may turn low-intensity fires into severe canopy fires. Attempts at {{assessing}} <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> have been either expensive and spatially limited quantified approaches or unrepeatable and variable expert opinion strategies. We have developed a mixed semiquantitative, semiqualitative approach using a flow chart that systematizes observations and constrains judgments and decisionmaking. The ladder fuel hazard assessment (LaFHA) approach leads to ladder hazard ratings and some quantified observed data; it can be repeated across a very large area at relatively low cost and, because of the systematic and constrained approach, produces results that are mostly consistent and repeatable. Key attributes assessed are clumping of low aerial fuels, height to live crown base, and maximum gaps in vertical fuel ladders. Three field seasons of testing and implementing the LaFHA approach resulted in almost 4, 000 observations. For the study area in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, {{more than a quarter}} of sites were rated high hazard and about 40 % more were moderate risk.

Abstract—The Savannah River Site is a Department of Energy Nuclear Defense Facility and a National Environmental Research Park {{located in}} the upper coastal plain of South Carolina.

We modifi ed standard forest inventory methods to incorporate a complete assessment of fuel components on 622 plots, assessing coarse woody debris, <b>ladder</b> <b>fuels,</b> and the litter and duff layers. Because of deficiencies in south-wide data on litter-duff bulk densities, which are the fuels most often consumed in prescribed fires, we developed new bulk density relationships. Total surface fuel loading across the landscape ranged from 0. 8 to 48. 7 tons/ac. The variables basal area, stand age, and site index were important in accounting for variability in ladder fuel, coarse woody debris, and litter-duff for pine types. For a given pine stand condition, litter-duff loading decreased {{in direct proportion to}} the number of burns in the preceding thirty years. <b>Ladder</b> <b>fuels</b> for loblolly and longleaf increased in direct proportion to the years since the last prescribed burn. The pattern of fuel loading on the SRS reflects stand dynamics, stand management and fire management.

5000|$|Potential <b>fuel</b> <b>ladders</b> {{should be}} removed {{to reduce the risk}} of fire {{bridging}} the gap to the canopy.

30|$|Our {{results suggest}} that neither first nor second entry fires met all {{management}} objectives, but second entry fires were more effective than first entry fires, which failed to meet any objectives. Continuation of fires in these areas may enhance the understory by continuing to reduce dead and down fuels, expose bare mineral soil, and promote herbaceous growth. We recommend {{the addition of a}} management objective related to increasing native herbaceous cover as a diverse understory promotes low intensity surface fires, provides forage for wildlife, and contributes to biodiversity (Moore et al. 2006, Laughlin et al. 2008). Results from a first entry prescribed fire often do not meet fuel reduction objectives due to the long history of fire exclusion and the lack of <b>ladder</b> <b>fuel</b> removal (Cooper 1960, Stephens et al. 2009). The needle cast post fire leads to a higher fuel loading that a second entry fire will remove with less post-fire needle cast. We recommend the use of multiple fire entries or higher intensity fire to more effectively achieve a broader array of objectives. However, these recommendations are based on a small set of pseudoreplicated plots and should not be the sole determinant of whether objectives have been met or if the original objectives were valid. For example, Zion has an objective of maintaining large (> 61 cm dbh) ponderosa pine in the landscape. This objective could not be evaluated because too few large trees were present on the monitoring plots. Fire managers should use results from monitoring along with their expertise in prescribed fire treatment prescriptions, intensity, season, interval, and implementation, plus any limitations (e.g., policy), to adjust their prescribed burning program to better meet objectives.|$|R
40|$|Insect {{disturbance}} {{is often}} thought to increase fire risk through enhanced fuel loadings, particularly in coniferous forest ecosystems. Yet insect disturbances also affect successional pathways and landscape structure that interact with fire disturbances (and vice-versa) over longer time scales. We applied a landscape succession and disturbance model (LANDIS-II) {{to evaluate the}} relative strength of interactions between spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) outbreaks and fire disturbances in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) in northern Minnesota (USA). Disturbance interactions were evaluated for two different scenarios: presettlement forests and fire regimes vs. contemporary forests and fire regimes. Forest composition under the contemporary scenario trended toward mixtures of deciduous species (primarily Betula papyriferaand Populus spp.) and shade-tolerant conifers (Picea mariana, Abies balsamea, Thuja occidentalis), with disturbances dominated {{by a combination of}} budworm defoliation and high-severity fires. The presettlement scenario retained comparatively more “big pines” (i. e., Pinus strobus, P. resinosa) and tamarack (L. laricina), and experienced less budworm disturbance and a comparatively less-severe fire regime. Spruce budworm disturbance decreased area burned and fire severity under both scenarios when averaged across the entire 300 -year simulations. Contrary to past research, area burned and fire severity during outbreak decades were each similar to that observed in non-outbreak decades. Our analyses suggest budworm disturbances within forests of the BWCA have a comparatively weak effect on long-term forest composition due to a combination of characteristics. These include strict host specificity, fine-scaled patchiness created by defoliation damage, and advance regeneration of its primary host, balsam fir (A. balsamea) that allows its host to persist despite repeated disturbances. Understanding the nature of the three-way interaction between budworm, fire, and composition has important ramifications for both fire mitigation strategies and ecosystem restoration initiatives. We conclude that budworm disturbance can partially mitigate long-term future fire risk by periodically reducing live <b>ladder</b> <b>fuel</b> within the mixed forest types of the BWCA but will do little to reverse the compositional trends caused in part by reduced fire rotations...|$|R
