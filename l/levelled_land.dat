50|$|Sidley {{railway station}} is a closed railway station In Sidley, East Sussex. It {{was on the}} Bexhill West branch of the Hastings Line from Tunbridge Wells. It was opened by the South Eastern & Chatham Railway and was {{operated}} by the Southern Region of British Railways on closing. All the station buildings and platforms were demolished soon after closure. The goods shed was the last railway building on the site which was demolished in 2009 having been derelict for many years. The cutting where the station was situated was infilled to about platform level and the <b>levelled</b> <b>land</b> used by a motorbike training centre which closed in 2012. Work started in January 2013 on {{construction of a new}} Bexhill to Hastings link road which has been built along the trackbed through the site of the platforms and opened in 2015.|$|E
50|$|Night {{has fallen}} over Cirbury; {{the night of}} the summer solstice, and {{the night of the}} tour's final performance. This time, they're tapping into more than just the hatred of the convoy; they're drawing power out of the ley lines which gave birth to the Ragman in the first place. As the band starts to play, the Ragman sends Jimmy to Stonehenge, where he drives his van into the monument, {{knocking}} a stone out of position, blowing up the van and himself, and finally sparking an all-out battle between the soldiers and the travellers, who have been aching to lay into each other for days. As the violence erupts at Stonehenge, the people of Cirbury turn on each other, tearing apart the village constables. Kane Sawyer arrives, having given in to his destiny at last, and Charmagne Peters emerges from the cattle truck, also under the spell of her ancestor. They are both descendants of Emily Sawyer's child, the child of the Ragman; and the fruit of their union will inherit a great <b>levelled</b> <b>land</b> where all are equal. Yates and his men arrive and try to gun down the mummers, but their bullets have no effect, for the players are already dead. The Ragman raises the corpses of 18th-century highwaymen, those who robbed the rich and were killed for it, and sets them on the UNIT men. Yates is shot in the shoulder as his men die around him. The force of the Ragman's hate is spilling out into the ley lines, and the people of the convoy see images of London falling, and of the royal family hung to die on an Offering Tree. Anarchy is loose, and soon all the world will be bathed in violence...|$|E
40|$|Based on FADN data {{the output}} and {{economic}} results from EU with LFA countries {{were compared with}} the results of those farms located in favourable environment. In 2004 - 2009 farmers from unfavourable environment received lower crop output per land unit (by 55 %) with lower crop protection (by 4 %) and higher fertilizers costs (by 12 %). Unfavourable environment lowered also livestock output by 25 %. The influence of the environment is accumulated in economic results per ha of agricultural unit: net value added was lower by 35 % and family farm income was lower only by 3 %.

40|$|The Chitral District of {{northern}} Pakistan straddles the Hindu Kush Range in the SW Pamir Syntaxis. The district covers {{an area of}} 14850 km 2 in a mountainous terrain with an elevation range from ~ 1000 m to ~ 7700 m. The late Quaternary glaciations broadened the river valleys up to ~ 4 km wide (e. g., at Mastuj and Chitral). Proximity to steep valley slopes renders these fans prone to hydrogeomorphic hazards, including landslides, floods, mud flows and debris flows. This dissertation focuses on Geomorphology of alluvial fans from the Hindu Kush range in Chitral valley, north Pakistan, with emphasis on evaluation of debris flow hazards. It is addresses the issue of debris-flow related geohazards in the Chitral district, especially on the valley slopes of the Yarkhun (Chitral) River. In general, slopes in the Hindu Kush and Karakoram are so heavily laden with debris that it appears that {{in the event of}} a heavy rain or glacial outburst-flood (GLOF), every tributary stream is capable of generating debris and mud flows. The inventory of debris flow in Chitral valley covers road/river stretch along the main trunk river i. e., Kunar-Chitral-Yarkhun river between Drosh in the south-west and Brep (north of Mastuj) in the northwest, described in terms of sites which have experienced Debris flow hazards in the past or have potential for future debris flow hazard. Field observations, topographical maps andsatellite-image analyseswas carried out by applying the Arc GIS 9. 3. software in laboratory. For classification of tributary stream types and their associated landforms and geomorphological characteristics of the various landform types, morphometric parameters of watersheds, their resultant streams and associated fans were measured, analyzed and use them to differentiate between various landforms. A preliminary morphometry of the tributary-junction fans in the Chitral valley are classified into 1) discrete and 2) composite. The discrete fans are modern-day active landforms and include debris cones associated with ephemeral gullies, debris fans associated with ephemeral channels and alluvial fans formed by perennial streams. The composite fans are a collage of sediment deposits of widely different ages and formed by diverse alluvial-fan forming processes. These include fans formed predominantly during MIS- 2 /Holocene interglacial stages superimposed by modern-day alluvial and debris fans. Composite fans are turned into relict fans when entrenched by modern-day perennial streams. These deeply incised channels discharge their sediment load directly into the trunk river without significant spread on fan surface. In comparison, when associated with ephemeral streams, active debris fans develop directly at composite-fan surfaces. Major settlements in Chitral are located on composite fans, as they provide large tracts of <b>levelled</b> <b>land</b> with easy accesses to water from the tributary streams. These fan surfaces are relatively more stable, especially when they are entrenched by perennial streams (e. g., Chitral, Ayun, Reshun). When associated with ephemeral streams (e. g., Snowghar) or a combination of ephemeral and perennial streams (e. g., Drosh), these fans are subject to frequent debris-flow hazards. Fans associated with ephemeral streams are prone to high-frequency (~ 10 years return period) debris-flow hazards. By comparison, fans associated with perennial streams are impacted by debris-flow hazards during exceptionally large events with return periods of ~ 30 years. This study has utility for quick debris-flow hazard assessment in high-relief mountainous regions, especially in arid- to semi-arid south-central Asia where hazard zonation maps are generally lacking. Several factors, such as, presence of a water source from rainstorms or glacial melting), density of vegetation, gradient of slopes, nature of the stream (perennial or ephemeral) contribute to debris-flow hazards. However, they greatly vary in the amount of debrisflow hazard due to the nature of the fan and nature of the feeding tributary stream. Finally, two fans with equivalent hazard shall have different vulnerability depending upon the size of population and associated infrastructure. Based on the geomorphological and morphometric analysis carried out during this study, hazard and vulnerability maps were developed for the Chitral valley. These maps of the Chitral valley provide evidence for debris flow hazard and vulnerability...|$|E
