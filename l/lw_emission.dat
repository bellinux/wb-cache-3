40|$|This work evaluates objectively the {{consistency}} {{and quality of}} a 9 year dataset based on 5 minute average values of downward longwave atmospheric (<b>LW)</b> <b>emission,</b> shortwave radiation, temperature and relative humidity. All these parameters were observed simultaneously and continuously from 1997 to 2006 in the IAG micrometeorological platform, located {{at the top of}} the IAG-USP building. The pyrgeometer dome emission effect was removed using neural network technique reducing the downward long wave atmospheric emission error to 3. 5 %. The comparison, between the monthly average values of <b>LW</b> <b>emission</b> observed in São Paulo and satellite estimates from SRB-NASA project, indicated a very good agreement. Furthermore, this work investigates the performance of 10 empirical expressions to estimate the <b>LW</b> <b>emission</b> at the surface. The comparison between the models indicates that Brunt's one presents the better results, with smallest “MBE,” “RMSE” and biggest “d” index of agreement, therefore Brunt is the most indicated model to estimate <b>LW</b> <b>emission</b> under clear sky conditions in the city of São Paul...|$|E
40|$|The diurnal and {{regional}} {{variations of the}} top-of-atmosphere radiation budget in the tropics are examined and {{the relative importance of}} these variations are assessed. The variations of the radiation components with scene type and the radiative effects of clouds are investigated. The <b>LW</b> <b>emission</b> shows the strongest diurnal variation over clear desert and land scenes, with domain-averaged diurnal ranges of approximately 50 W/sq m and 35 W/sq m, respectively. The <b>LW</b> <b>emission</b> over clear and tropical oceans show a small diurnal range of less than 1 W/sq m. A bias in the ERBE scene ID algorithm against clear tropical scenes at night is evident in the LW diurnal variation results for clear scenes. The effect of tropical water vapor resulting in low <b>LW</b> <b>emission</b> to space is diagnosed as the principal source of uncertainty in scene identification at night. Regional cloud forcing results show a strong dependence of net forcing on cloud type. While high cirrus clouds largely contribute to a small positive net forcing, low stratiform clouds primarily account for a large negative net forcing...|$|E
40|$|Results {{of recent}} IUE {{observations}} of the LINER galaxy NGC 3998 are reported. Spatial structure in the <b>LW</b> <b>emission</b> is apparent; the spatial profiles in the longwave primary (LWP) images show a two-component structure, with an unresolved central component superposed on extended underlying emission. New software, which exploits {{a knowledge of the}} LWP point spread function and its variation with wavelength, is used to model the spatial profiles and to separate the LWP emission into component spectra. The unresolved component spectrum is found to be considerably flatter than the spectrum of the extended component, which is dominated by fairly late-type stars. The unresolved component exhibits strong semiforbidden C II 2326 and broad Mg II 2800 emission. The width of the Mg II emission is about 8000 km/s, and its profile agrees quite well with the broad wings of the H-alpha emission...|$|E
30|$|This {{conceptual}} model was successfully applied for optimisation of mining sequence and gas drainage design at coal mines. An {{example of such}} applications is the significant improvements achieved in terms of safe working conditions, gas capture efficiency, gas utilisation, and fugitive emission reduction at the Pansan mine where optimisation of both mining sequence and surface goaf drainage wells was involved (Guo et al. 2013). The <b>LW</b> face methane <b>emissions</b> were controlled effectively with surface goaf drainage boreholes located within the AOZ zone.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Absorption, {{steady state}} and time {{resolved}} fluorescence spectra of 4, 4 ′-sulfonyldiphenol (SDP), 3, 3 ’–dimethyl 4, 4 ′-sulfonyldiphenol (DMSP), 4, 4 ′-sulfonyldibenzoic acid (SDBA) were {{studied in the}} presence of α- and β-cyclodextrins. Both in water and CD, SDP and SDBA exhibit two emission maxima while DMSP exhibit three emission maxima. In β-CD, the rate of enhancement of longer wavelength (<b>LW)</b> <b>emission</b> is higher than that of shorter wavelength (SW) band, where as in α-CD the enhancement of SW is larger than that of LW. The normal Stokes shifted band was originated from the locally excited state and the large Stokes shifted band was due to the emission form a TICT state. In these molecules, the presence of OH or COOH groups at para position of the aromatic rings increase the coplanar geometry in the excited state. Semi-empirical quantum-mechanical calculations were also carried out to assign the encapsulation of the SDP, DMSP and SDBA. PM 3 calculations show that most of the SDBA values are different from SDP and DMSP because the values are dependent {{on the size of the}} CD cavities and nature of the functional group of the guest...|$|E
40|$|The direct clear-sky {{radiative}} effect (DRE) {{of atmospheric}} mineral dust is diagnosed over the Bordj Badji Mokhtar (BBM) supersite {{in the central}} Sahara during the Fennec campaign in June 2011. During this period, thick dust events were observed, with aerosol optical depth values peaking at 3. 5. Satellite observations from Meteosat- 9 are combined with ground-based radiative flux measurements to obtain estimates of DRE at the surface, top-of-atmosphere (TOA), and within the atmosphere. At TOA, there is a distinct daytime cycle in net DRE. Both shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) DRE peak around noon and induce a warming of the Earth-atmosphere system. Toward dusk and dawn, the LW DRE reduces while the SW effect can switch sign triggering net radiative cooling. The net TOA DRE mean values range from - 9 Wm- 2 {{in the morning to}} heating of + 59 Wm- 2 near midday. At the surface, the SW dust impact is larger than at TOA: SW scattering and absorption by dust results in a mean surface radiative cooling of 145 Wm- 2. The corresponding mean surface heating caused by increased downward <b>LW</b> <b>emission</b> from the dust layer is a factor of 6 smaller. The dust impact on the magnitude and variability of the atmospheric radiative divergence is dominated by the SW cooling of the surface, modified by the smaller SW and LW effects at TOA. Consequently, dust has a mean daytime net radiative warming effect on the atmosphere of 153 Wm- 2...|$|E
