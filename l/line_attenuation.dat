We propose a new method to design two-channel EUV multilayer mirrors with enhanced spectral selectivity. The mirror structure is a stack of two periodic multilayers separated by a buffer layer. We have defined the main parameters which allow adjustment of the distance between different order Bragg's peak and of wavelength positions of reflectivity minima.

The first mirror reflects Fe IX–X line (17. 1 nm) and Fe XVI (33. 5 nm) <b>lines</b> with <b>attenuation</b> of the He II line (30. 4 nm).

We demonstrate that the Rap signal is required for the proliferation and leukemogenesis of established Notch-dependent T-ALL cell <b>lines.</b> <b>Attenuation</b> of the Rap signal by the expression of a dominant-negative Rap 1 A 17 or Rap 1 GAP, Sipa 1, in a T-ALL cell line resulted in the reduced Notch processing at site 2 due to impaired maturation of Adam 10. Inhibition of the Rap 1 prenylation with a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor abrogated its membrane-anchoring to Golgi-network and caused reduced proprotein convertase activity required for Adam 10 maturation. Exogenous expression of a mature form of Adam 10 overcame the Sipa 1 -induced inhibition of T-ALL cell proliferation. T-ALL cell lines expressed Notch ligands in a Notch-signal dependent manner, which contributed to the cell-autonomous Notch activation. Although the initial thymic blast cells barely expressed Notch ligands during the T-ALL development from Rap(high) hematopoietic progenitors in vivo, the ligands were clearly expressed in the T-ALL cells invading extrathymic vital organs. These results reveal a crucial role of the Rap signal in the Notch-dependent T-ALL development and the progression...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Radiographic {{simulation}} of thick components represents a particular challenge, since the Monte-Carlo methods generally applied to obtain accurate scattering predictions are inherently slow, {{and as such}} not suited to applications for inspection procedure qualification, where {{a large number of}} parameter variations has to be studied in a reasonable time. We present a generic radiographic modeling code, which overcomes this impediment by combining a Monte-Carlo approach with a simple straight-line attenuation model and an analytical film-foil model. The code MODERATO has been thoroughly validated and is now used to perform parametric studies for performance demonstration purposes.
