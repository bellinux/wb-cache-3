[...] She wears a gold <b>lattice-work</b> partlet studded with pearls and a matching snood or caul. [...] The blackwork embroidery {{at the edges}} of her square-necked chemise can be seen beneath the parlet, 1545.|$|E
2500|$|About {{two and a}} half {{kilometers}} {{northwest of}} this monastery, there is also the limestone cave of the late Pope Cyril VI. Marked by twelve wooden crosses, it is known as the Rock of Sarabamun and has become a popular place of pilgrimage. An iron <b>lattice-work</b> protects the entrance to the site. [...] Within, the one room cave is spacious. It is adorned with numerous pictures and icons of Pope Cyril VI. [...] In the desert about the monastery there are also several caves that apparently continue to be inhabited by hermits.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} building is the caretaker's cabin, which is notable as an outstanding example of vernacular wilderness camp architecture, with finely crafted details and using local building materials. [...] The cabin is a low, -story rustic building, built of round logs on a fieldstone foundation. It has an H-shaped floor plan with gable-roofed legs connected by an open shed-roofed porch stretching between the legs. It is built of notched logs chinked with mortar, with the gable ends of smaller logs laid in a herringbone pattern. Inside, the cabin has four rooms, with fieldstone chimneys and intricate decorative work, including hand-carved light fixtures and a <b>lattice-work</b> stairway built from tree roots by local wood carver Frank Ranwick.|$|E
50|$|It is an {{impressive}} building with a late-Gothic <b>lattice-worked</b> architrave running along the building. This elegant architrave resembles somewhat the architrave of the Monastery of Batalha, {{even if there are}} some early-Manueline influences. Above the entrance porch on the western façade one can see the ajimez window (a mullioned window in Manueline and Moorish style) in the room of the abbess, originating from the demolished palace of the dukes of Beja. The entrance door is embedded under an ogee arch. A square bell-tower and a spire with crockets tower above the complex. The convent has been classified as a national monument.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to popular}} legend, Indra, {{the king of}} the Devas created the idol of Ganesha out of sea sand during the {{churning}} of the ocean and left it in a niche in the temple hoping to get back the idol sometime later. But later, when he returned to remove the idol of Ganesha, it would not budge. So, the idol was allowed to remain where it was. [...] A <b>lattice-worked</b> stone window pane called palahani is present in the temple. [...] The temple is originally believed to have been built by Kanaka Chola in prehistoric times.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{developmental}} meta-analysis of behaviors {{that contribute to}} political economies of corruption, deploying bioneurological dual motive and behavioral development theories. Together, these systems of analysis enable a developmental perspective to illustrate and analyze a progression of dual motives’ variations as humans and their conditions change. The progression of examples indicates that there are multiple evolutions of political economies that vary in their complexity, with different behavioral features at each level. Dual motive theory helps in identifying and understanding the complex linkages and layers of socio-political and economic behaviors as they become more complex. Increasingly complex horizontal and vertical stacks of social networks, like <b>lattice-works</b> of dual motives, enable individuals and groups to develop and maintain sturdy yet adaptable social systems of patronage, brokerage, and clientelism. These so-often informally structured relationships underlie corruption-like transactions long before, and long after, they are regarded as the enduring institution of corruption. Three hypotheses under gird the development of that thesis. The first is that dual motive theory facilitates meta-analyses of social networks’ often hidden layers of complexity. A second hypothesis is that analyses using dual motive theory can explicate more complexity when the theory is integrated with developmental behavioral theory. The third hypothesis is that analyses made possible by that integration offer substantive contributions to understanding socio-political-economic behaviors, including multiple political economies of corruption. Three strategies are employed to develop the paper’s thesis. First, the concepts of social ties, networks, reciprocity and dual motive theory are introduced to set the context. second, a behavioral task measurement theory is introduced: the model of hierarchical complexity. Scoped for this paper to introduce only the most common adult-level tasks, that model’s orders of increasing complexity describe developmental differences {{in the performance of}} individuals’ and social systems’ behaviors. Third, a series of international examples shows the hierarchically different ways the behavioral tensions of dual motives manifest in human exchanges. The hierarchical complexity of the examples’ settings is correlated with the hierarchical complexity of adults’ behaviors in those settings. The results of the analysis indicate that (a) individual and system behaviors are continuously shaped and constrained by complex interrelations that can be explained in terms of the hierarchical complexity of dual motives; (b) there are predictably difficult transitions and breaches when systems of different hierarchical complexity disrupt pre-existing systems for managing behavioral tensions. The application of dual motive theory indicates its analytical usefulness for interpreting social, political, and economic phenomena. Political economies of corruption can be more thoroughly understood as enduring institutions through a developmental behavioral application of dual motive theory...|$|R
2500|$|The {{buildings}} and the style were extremely well received by the public and design professionals in California and nationally, becoming a reigning style for decades, and still the primary vernacular style in much of California. [...] Goodhue's associate architect was Carleton M. Winslow, who is solely credited with the <b>lattice-work</b> Botanical Building and other structures. [...] Goodhue's team, which included Kate Sessions and Lloyd Wright for landscape design, had won out over the local and more modernist Irving Gill to get the commission. One {{of the most significant}} improvements to the park from that time was the construction of the Cabrillo Bridge across a major canyon in the city. The bridge connects the main portion of the park with the western portion and with Laurel Street.|$|E
2500|$|The name ford of hurdles – Áth Cliath in Irish – {{suggests}} that, {{to facilitate}} travellers {{who wished to}} cross the river dry-shod during low tide, the inhabitants of this settlement constructed a <b>lattice-work</b> of interlaced [...] – [...] – and secured it to the muddy bed of the river, perhaps making use of the fortuitously placed Usher's Island {{in the middle of}} the stream. It is also possible that a series of hurdles used as fish-traps were placed along the banks of the river. The hurdles were probably located about 100 metres west of the point where Father Mathew Bridge now crosses the Liffey, but in the absence of archaeological evidence both its nature and precise location must remain matters of speculation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948 in an {{apartment}} in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his [...] "Blake vision"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as [...] "voice of the ancient of days". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at <b>lattice-work</b> on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked {{at the sky and}} intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: [...] "living blue hand itself. [...] Or that God was {{in front of my eyes}} - existence itself was God" [...] and [...] "And it was a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe than I'd been existing in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matthew's {{objections}} {{were not}} heeded, {{and were not}} persisted in once Parliament had passed the Bill authorising construction of the Tay Bridge. [...] During construction of the bridge some of Matthew's criticisms were borne out: {{it became apparent that}} bedrock could not be found at a depth allowing the use of brick piers; the design had to be modified to use <b>lattice-work</b> iron piers of reduced width, and there was considerable cost overrun. The [...] bridge opened in June 1878 and was destroyed in a storm in December 1879: the lattice work piers supporting the centre section of the bridge (the high girders) failed catastrophically as a train was crossing the bridge. [...] The high girders and the train fell into the Tay and about seventy-five lives were lost. Whilst it was recalled {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the disaster that Matthew had predicted collapse in a high wind as one of the horrible ends to which a bridge at Dundee could come, the disaster is generally ascribed to defects in the design and manufacture of the lattice work piers introduced into the design well after Matthew's campaign against the bridge.|$|E

6000|$|... "Most of {{them are}} making off," [...] Antonio said, peeping {{cautiously}} out through the <b>lattice-work.</b> [...] "I suppose {{they are going to}} attack somewhere else. What are the police doing? They ought to be here soon." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus talking, they loitered {{slowly along}} beside the parapet which borders the level {{summit of the}} Pincian with its {{irregular}} sweep. At intervals they looked through the <b>lattice-work</b> of their thoughts at the varied prospects that lay before and beneath them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Brothers Peter and John, I {{forgot to}} caution you to speak low in this house, {{as there is}} <b>lattice-work</b> over the doors to let in the air. Do not be afraid. I only heard the voice of John, not what he said." ...|$|E
60|$|After a {{while the}} rain ceased and there {{came out in the}} sky certain new washed stars, and by their light I saw that there was no end to the black water {{as far as the eye}} could travel, and the water had risen upon the rails. There were dead beasts in the {{driftwood}} on the piers, and others caught by the neck in the <b>lattice-work,</b> and others not yet drowned who strove to find a foothold on the lattice-work--buffaloes and kine, and wild pig, and deer one or two, and snakes and jackals past all counting. Their bodies were black upon the left side of the bridge, but the smaller of them were forced through the <b>lattice-work</b> and whirled down-stream.|$|E
60|$|He {{led her to}} {{the kitchen}} door and round the corner of the house. The beloved rose-arbor had been wrecked by the storm. The <b>lattice-work</b> was smashed. The gray bare stems of the crimson ramblers drooped drearily into a sullen puddle. The green settee was smeared with splashed mud.|$|E
60|$|The {{houses are}} {{generally}} two stories high, built strongly of masonry, whitewashed or plastered outside, {{and have a}} cage of wooden <b>lattice-work</b> projecting in front of every window. To reproduce a Jerusalem street, {{it would only be}} necessary to up-end a chicken-coop and hang it before each window in an alley of American houses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Luke had his {{own ideas}} of {{legality}} and justice. He was kind of training me to succeed him when he went out of office. He was always looking ahead {{to the time when}} he'd quit sheriffing. What {{he wanted to do was}} to build a yellow house with <b>lattice-work</b> under the porch and have hens scratching in the yard. The one main thing in his mind seemed to be the yard.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Tibbs resumed her {{occupation}} of making worsted <b>lattice-work</b> in the carpet, anxiously {{listening to the}} twopenny postman, who was hammering {{his way down the}} street, at the rate of a penny a knock. The house was as quiet as possible. There was only one low sound to be heard—it was the unhappy Tibbs cleaning the gentlemen’s boots in the back kitchen, and accompanying himself with a buzzing noise, in wretched mockery of humming a tune.|$|E
6000|$|... "It has a {{very nice}} smell," [...] said Lucy, {{examining}} the dark brown beads, which hung loosely on their string, and letting them fall one by one through her hands, till of course that happened which she was hoping for: she woke on a long, low sofa, {{in the midst of}} a room all carpet and cushions, in bright colors and gorgeous patterns, curling about with no particular meaning; and with a window of rich brass <b>lattice-work.</b>|$|E
6000|$|One {{morning the}} postman brought {{a letter to}} the Hall {{addressed}} to my mistress. I took it upstairs, and looked at the direction as I put it on the salver. The handwriting was not my master's; was not, as it appeared to me, the handwriting of any well-educated person. The outside of the letter was also very dirty, and the seal a common office-seal of the usual <b>lattice-work</b> pattern. [...] "This must be a begging-letter," [...] I thought to myself as I entered the breakfast-room and advanced with it to my mistress.|$|E
60|$|We {{expressed}} our acknowledgments and {{sat down}} behind the door, {{where there was a}} lame invalid of a sofa. Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair but was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it. The shawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped onto her chair when she advanced to us; and as she turned to resume her seat, we could not help noticing that her dress didn't nearly meet up the back and that the open space was railed across with a <b>lattice-work</b> of stay-lace--like a summer-house.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{need not}} be told!" [...] thundered a strong voice close to their ears. And {{then there was a}} noise of {{breaking}} <b>lattice-work</b> and cracking vines, and through the back part of the arbor came an old woman wearing a purple sun-bonnet, and beating down all obstacles before her with a great purple umbrella. [...] "You needn't tell it!" [...] cried Mrs Keswick, {{standing in the middle of}} the arbor, her eyes glistening, her form trembling, and her umbrella quivering in the air. [...] "You needn't tell it! It's told!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Among the {{listeners}} was our friend Edgar Berrington. Seated, as usual, {{in front of}} the great crank, with bare muscular arms folded on his broad chest and a dark frown on his forehead, he riveted his eyes on the crank {{as if it were the}} author of all his anxieties. Suddenly the terminating lines, [...] "I cannot sing the old songs, they are too dear to me," [...] rising above the din of machinery, floated gently down through iron <b>lattice-work,</b> beams, rods, cranks, and bars, and smote upon his ear.|$|E
60|$|She {{was rather}} touching, {{as she stood}} before the {{wardrobe}} glass divested of her bodice, with dimples of exertion in her thin white arms while she hooked her skirt behind, and her greenish eyes troubled, so anxious {{to do their best}} for everyone, and save risk of any sort. Having put on a bramble-coloured frock, which laced across her breast with silver <b>lattice-work,</b> and a hat (without feathers, so as to encourage birds) fastened to her head with pins (bought to aid a novel school of metal-work), she went to see what sort of day it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the kind}} of a man he was. He was home-like, {{although}} he'd had bad luck in such investments. But he never talked about them times on the ranch. It seemed like he'd forgotten about it. I wondered how, with his ideas of yards and chickens and notions of <b>lattice-work,</b> he'd seemed to have got out of his mind that kid of his that had been taken away from him, unlawful, in spite of his decree of court. But he wasn't a man you could ask about such things as he didn't refer to in his own conversation.|$|E
60|$|The {{production}} of these devoted little sacrifices in any presentable condition being quite {{out of the}} question at a week's notice, I proposed to Caddy that we should make them as happy as we could on her marriage morning in the attic where they all slept, and should confine our greatest efforts to her mama and her mama's room, and a clean breakfast. In truth Mrs. Jellyby required a good deal of attention, the <b>lattice-work</b> up her back having widened considerably since I first knew her and her hair looking like the mane of a dustman's horse.|$|E
60|$|They {{stood in}} front of the door and passed through into the courtyard. On their right, the {{interior}} of the smaller restaurant was shielded from view by a <b>lattice-work,</b> covered with flowers and shrubs. Pritchard came to a standstill at a certain point, and stooping down looked through. He remained there without moving for what seemed to Tavernake an extraordinarily long time. When he stood up again, there was a distinct change in his face. He was looking more serious than Tavernake had ever seen him. But for the improbability of the thing, Tavernake would have thought that he had turned pale.|$|E
60|$|Billy Towler did try it. Many a London lamp-post had he shinned {{up in his}} day. The {{difference}} did {{not seem}} to him very great. The ball, he observed, was made of light bands or lathes arranged somewhat in the form of <b>lattice-work.</b> It was full six feet in diameter, and had an opening in the under part by which a man could enter it. Through the lozenge-shaped openings he could see two enormous ravens perched on the top. Pausing merely for a second or two to note these facts and recover breath, he shinned up the bare pole like a monkey, and got inside the ball.|$|E
60|$|It {{were but}} natural {{to suppose that}} the magistrates would, at first, shrink from {{immediate}} personal contact with what they saw. At the least, for a time, they would stand in involuntary doubt; it may be, in more or less of horrified alarm. Certain it is, that an arquebuss was called for from below. And some add, that its report, followed by a fierce whiz, as of the sudden snapping of a main-spring, with a steely din, as if a stack of sword-blades should be dashed upon a pavement, these blended sounds came ringing to the plain, attracting every eye far upward to the belfry, whence, through the <b>lattice-work,</b> thin wreaths of smoke were curling.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will buy}} that rug," [...] he said, [...] "for of a truth {{it might be}} one on which I lay sick many {{a year ago in}} the house of Ayoub at Damascus. Nay, I haggle not at the price. I will buy it." [...] Then he fell to {{thinking}} how, whilst lying on such a rug (indeed, although he knew it not, it was the same), looking through the rounded beads of the wooden <b>lattice-work</b> of his window, he had first seen his Eastern wife walking in the orange garden with her father Ayoub. Afterwards, still recalling his youth, he began to talk of Cyprus, and so time went on until the dark was falling.|$|E
60|$|They {{have but}} to cross {{what was once}} the vineyard, {{belonging}} to {{what was once the}} Monastery, to come into the narrow back lane wherein stands the crazy wooden house of two low stories currently known as the Travellers’ Twopenny:—a house all warped and distorted, like the morals of the travellers, with scant remains of a <b>lattice-work</b> porch over the door, and also of a rustic fence before its stamped-out garden; by reason of the travellers being so bound to the premises by a tender sentiment (or so fond of having a fire by the roadside {{in the course of the}} day), that they can never be persuaded or threatened into departure, without violently possessing themselves of some wooden forget-me-not, and bearing it off.|$|E
60|$|But the {{whitewash}} and the barred {{windows with}} their wooden <b>lattice-work,</b> {{remind you that}} you are in Moorish country, in the very heart of it; and Ronda, indeed, figures in chronicles and in old ballads as a stronghold of the invaders. The temperature affects the habits of the people, even their appearance: there is no lounging about the squares or at the doors of wine-shops, the streets are deserted and their great breadth makes the emptiness more apparent. The first setters out of the town had no need to make the ways narrow for the sake of shade, and they are, in fact, so broad that the houses on either side might be laid on their faces, and there would still be room for the rapid stream which hurries down the middle.|$|E
