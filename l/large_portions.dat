5|$|As a {{composer}} and pianist, Sorabji was largely self-taught, and he {{distanced himself from}} the main currents of contemporary musical life early in his career.

40|$|Could smaller snack {{portions}} be similarly {{effective in}} decreasing cravings or feelings of hunger as <b>larger</b> <b>portions?</b> To answer this, three common snack foods – chocolate, apple pie, potato chips – {{were given to}} 104 participants as either a small portion (x) or a substantially <b>larger</b> <b>portion</b> (5 – 10 x). Results indicate that smaller portions satisfied one’s ratings of hunger and craving similar to <b>larger</b> <b>portions,</b> but led to a mean intake that was significantly lower than in the <b>large</b> <b>portion</b> condition (with a difference of 103 calories). This suggests that 15 min after eating a considerably smaller snack, people will have eaten much less but will feel equally satisfied...|$|R

50|$|Using smaller plates {{helps to}} consume smaller portion sizes and {{this leads to}} the {{consumption}} of fewer calories. Studies have shown that portion size influences energy intake. People who are presented with <b>larger</b> <b>portions</b> do not report to have a higher level of satiety, which suggests that hunger and satiety signals are ignored when a <b>large</b> <b>portion</b> of food is placed in front of them. In particular, one study showed that participants consumed 31% less calories with the small portion sized of a 6-inch submarine sandwich compared with the <b>large</b> <b>portion</b> size of a 12-inch submarine sandwich.Increased portion sizes have occurred simultaneously with the increase in obesity rates; hence, <b>large</b> <b>portion</b> sizes {{can be one of the}} factors contributing to the current increase in body weight of the US. Evidence from a systematic review of 72 randomized controlled trials indicates that people consistently eat more food when offered <b>larger</b> <b>portion,</b> package, or tableware sizes rather than smaller size alternatives.|$|R
5|$|Byzantine troops {{occupied}} <b>large</b> <b>portions</b> of Bulgaria, including modern Dobruja, under Emperor John I Tzimiskes (969976).

In 1018, the Byzantines conquered the whole territory of the Bulgarian Empire and the Archbishop of Ohrid acquired ecclesiastic jurisdiction in 1020 over the Vlachs living there.|$|E

5|$|A {{quarter of}} the homes in Cihuatlán, Jalisco, were totally destroyed, leaving many homeless.

5|$|From 1885 to 1893, the {{architect}} Helgo Zettervall (1831-1907) undertook comprehensive restoration work, seeking {{to give the}} cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he {{has been criticized for}} not respecting the building's original Baltic Gothic style. He also added pointed French spires to the towers, bringing the cathedral up to a height of , so making it as high as it was long. In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered <b>large</b> <b>portions</b> of the medieval outer brick walls and removed the decorative white-washed ‘blind windows’ on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church.|$|E
5|$|Further {{renovation}} {{work in the}} early 1970s led to improvements in the building's structure and included restoration of the walls and windows. <b>Large</b> <b>portions</b> of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they adversely affected the building's fabric. In 1989, Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in Uppsala Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkström.

Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski defeated the Cossack units in 1596 and Severyn Nalyvaiko was executed. A temporary pacification of relations followed in the early 17th century, when the many wars fought by the Commonwealth necessitated greater involvement by registered Cossacks. But the Union of Brest resulted in new tensions, as the Cossacks had become dedicated adherents and defenders of the Eastern Orthodoxy.|$|E
