40|$|Abstract Background The {{only natural}} hosts of Pseudorabies virus (PRV) {{are members of}} the family Suidae (Sus scrofa scrofa). In species other than suids {{infection}} is normally fatal. In these mammals, including carnivores, PRV typically causes serious neurologic disease. The endangered Iberian <b>lynx</b> (<b>Lynx</b> <b>pardinus)</b> is a wild feline endemic to south-western Europe (Iberian Peninsula). The Iberian lynx was found to be the world 2 ̆ 019 s most endangered felid species in 2002. In wild felines, PRV infection has only been previously reported once in a Florida panther in 1994. No seropositive lynxes have ever been found, nor has PRV been detected in dead Iberian lynxes to date. Case presentation We describe the first reported case of pseudorabies in an Iberian <b>lynx</b> (<b>Lynx</b> <b>pardinus).</b> Pseudorabies was diagnosed in a young wild Iberian lynx from Extremadura (SW Spain) by histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis. Gross lesions included alopecia of the ventral neck, bloody gastro-intestinal contents and congestion of the brain. Histopathological analysis showed a moderate nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis with diffuse areas of demyelination, necrotizing gastritis and enteritis of the small intestine. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) antigen was found in neuronal and non-neuronal cells of the brain, tonsils, and gastric glandular epithelial cells by immunohistochemical analysis. The presence of the virus in the brain was confirmed by nested PCR. The sequence analysis of the 1460 bp fragment (from the viral glycoprotein B gene) showed that the amplified sequence matched (with 100...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The use of metapopulation {{models in}} {{conservation}} biology is growing ex-ponentially, {{but there is}} a need for empirical studies that support theoretical approaches, especially for species with large and long-lived individuals. In this paper we explore the viability and dynamics of a real metapopulation of an endangered mammal by combining field work and modeling in order to support conservation decisions and evaluate theoretical approaches. The Iberian <b>lynx</b> (<b>Lynx</b> <b>pardinus),</b> considered the most vulnerable felid in the world, is restricted to the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe. The persistence of the species is handicapped by the high fragmentation of its populations. Fewer than 1000 individuals are distributed in nine isolated populations, each of them also fragmented but with their patches connected by dispersers, in what could be called metapopulations. One of these metapopulations, including; 60 individuals, inhabits the Doñana National Park (DNP) and its surroundings. Demographic and behavioral data gathered over one decade for this lynx population were employed to develop a spatially realistic structured model with density-dependent fecundity and migration, including demographic and environmental stochasticity.

Nine environmental factors were related, by season and age class, to 12 indices of daily activity of lynxes derived from movement rates and pulses {{of the motion}} sensor in the transmitters. Coefficients of determination were higher in winter and summer than in spring. Juvenile lynxes appeared more sensitive to environmental factors than adults. Photoperiod had a major influence (R 2 = 29 %) on circadian activity pattern throughout the year. Environmental factors significantly related to activity of lynxes during winter were maximum temperature, pressure changes, evaporation, and moonphase. In sum­ mer, important variables were maximum temperature, moonphase, hours with moonlight, and high pressures. In spring, only rainfall and temperature (minimum and maximum) showed a slight but significant influence on activity of lynxes. Although some climatolog­ ical factors may have a direct effect on the circadian activity of Iberian lynx, others (e. g., moonlight) may act indirectly by influencing {{the activity of the}} Mediterranean rabbit, the lynx’s main prey.

40|$|This review {{highlights}} {{the status of}} the European wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, which is threatened within its native range and yet is a highly successful colonizer across its worldwide, introduced range. The European wild rabbit is a keystone species in Iberia, and the survival of a range of threatened predator species, including the Iberian <b>lynx</b> <b>Lynx</b> <b>pardinus</b> and Spanish imperial eagle Aquila aldabertii, is dependent upon the restoration of rabbit populations. Although not native to the UK, the rabbit also performs significant ecosystem services for nationally rare UK species, by maintaining short sward heights in heathland and grassland ecosystems, and serving as a prey item for populations of predators. We identify the European wild rabbit as an excellent model to demonstrate the wide range of complex effects that an introduced mammalian species may exert on ecosystems to which it has been introduced. These effects include habitat degradation following overgrazing, competition with native mammals and facilitating meso-predator release and hyperpredation. We also show that rabbit eradication from some sites may generate more problems than are solved because of the impacts of trophic cascades stemming from dependence on rabbits by native predator assemblages...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} pressure {{generated by}} the clinical misuse of antibiotics has been the major driving force leading {{to the emergence of}} antibiotic resistance among bacteria. Antibiotics or even resistant bacteria are released into the environment and contaminate the surrounding areas. Human and animal populations in contact with these sources are able to become reservoirs of these resistant organisms. Then, due to the convergence between habitats, the contact of wild animals with other animals, humans, or human sources is now more common and this leads to an increase in the exchange of resistance determinants between their microbiota. Indeed, it seems that wildlife populations living in closer proximity to humans have higher levels of antibiotic resistance. Now, the Iberian <b>Lynx</b> (<b>Lynx</b> <b>pardinus)</b> is a part of this issue, being suggested as natural reservoir of acquired resistant bacteria. The emerging public health concern regarding microbial resistance to antibiotics is becoming true: the bacteria are evolving and are now affecting unintentional hosts.

40|$|The {{wild rabbit}} (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and the Iberian <b>lynx</b> (<b>Lynx</b> <b>pardinus)</b> are endemic {{species of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The Iberian lynx is a {{specialist}} predator, listed as critically endangered, and rabbit represents the bulk of its diet {{as well as of}} many other Iberian predators. The decline of this emblematic predator has been recurrently explained by means of rabbit decline in Spain. A recent study has shown that wild rabbit populations have declined 55 % in three decades in the country. Habitat destruction and fragmentation by infrastructures, the abandonment of marginal crops, the intensification of farmland ecosystems, and the direct and continuous persecution by farmers to preserve their crops have been claimed as the main factors that account for this dramatic decline. In parallel, the impact of both myxoma virus and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) implied a relevant increase in rabbit mortality rates, while the species coped with a strong hunting pressure and an increase of competition with other wild herbivores. At present, all of these threats have not yet disappeared and conservation efforts have been very scarce. However, previous to the rabbit decline, the area of distribution of the Iberia...|$|R
40|$|The Iberian <b>lynx</b> (<b>Lynx</b> <b>pardinus)</b> is {{considered}} the most endangered felid species in the world, less than 250 animals left. The narrow genetic basis may contribute to render this species particularly susceptible to infectious diseases. Within a six-month period starting in December 2006, a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) outbreak of surprising virulence killed about 60 % of infected animals. Sequencing of the FeLV envelope surface unit gene revealed a common origin in all lynxes. The sequences were closely related to FeLV-A/ 61 E, originally isolated from a cat in Colorado and only mildly pathogenic in domestic cats. Nevertheless, a particular virulence of the FeLV strain found in Iberian lynxes could not be ruled out. In order to evaluate the virulence of the lynx FeLV, we assessed the disease-inducing potential of the Iberian lynx`s FeLV strain in its probable original host, the domestic cat. Intraperitoneal inoculation of specified pathogen-free (SPF) domestic cats with FeLV-infected Iberian lynx blood {{did not lead to}} a particularly severe outcome. Thus, the FeLV epidemic in the Iberian lynxes seems to be more related to a potential primary immunodeficiency of these animals than to an extremely virulent FeLV strain...|$|R

Up until now its contribution as a rabbit bone accumulator in archaeological sites has never been properly assessed. In order to investigate the taphonomic signature of this predator the analysis of 33 samples of modern Iberian lynx scats was carried out. Results show that leporid remains consumed by this carnivore appear very fragmented and exhibit a strong degree of corrosion digestion. Cranial elements are most abundant followed by long bones.

However, this hypothesis remains empirically untested. Here, we examined this hypothesis for solitary territorial carnivores using the Iberian <b>lynx</b> (<b>Lynx</b> <b>pardinus)</b> as a case study. We expected that territorial males sire all litters born within their territories, translating into the absence of multi-paternity cases within the same litter. We analysed parentage in 43 kittens, belonging to 20 different litters. For 42 kittens, a father could be assigned using microsatellites and always coincided with the individual holding the territory. For 16 kittens from 10 litters for which we also had information on SNPs, paternity assignments coincided with microsatellites, except for a litter (two kittens) from the same litter for which a different male was assigned, but the territorial male could not be excluded. Our results indicated that multi-paternity in the Iberian lynx must be a rare event, and that territorial males sire all litters born from the females with which they share territories.

The effectiveness of portable electric fences in preventing predation by Iberian lynx on lambs in such flocks was evaluated. Electric fences were installed around two flocks of sheep suffering from attacks by Iberian lynx. Before the experiment, both flocks grazed without any surveillance during the day. At night, sheep with a single lamb were left to roam freely or spent the night in a poorly constructed enclosure. Sheep with two lambs remained with their lambs without any type of protection. After the electrified enclosures were put in place, sheep with lambs were moved inside at night. No attacks were detected inside the electric fences. During the daytime, four attacks on lambs grazing without surveillance were recorded.

40|$|Managers {{trying to}} {{preserve}} populations of endangered carnivores are often {{forced to choose between}} restoring habitat to allow larger breeding populations or reduce risks of mortality to increase survival rates. We modelled the viability of a metapopulation of the Iberian <b>lynx</b> (<b>Lynx</b> <b>pardinus)</b> under several scenarios (habitat restoration, anti-poaching, reduction in road kills) in a real landscape to evaluate their relative effects. Increasing carrying capacity was highly effective when performed on the local populations that acted as sources but had no effect when carried out in the sinks. Realistic scenarios consisting of partial removal of the human-related mortality (assuming additive effects of causes) pre- dicted high risk of extinction. When combined, the effects of both management options are highly dependent on where they are carried out. If the sinks are the only targets of carrying capacity enlarge- ment, a complete removal of human-caused mortality is required, whereas increases in the carrying capacity of sources are always effective. The metapopulation risk of extinction decreases dramatically (from 45. 5 % to 2. 1 % in 100) if connectivity among source populations can be improved.
