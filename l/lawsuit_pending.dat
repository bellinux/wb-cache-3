50|$|The Androscoggin {{was once}} heavily {{polluted}} {{by a variety}} of textile mills, paper mills, and other industries located along its banks, and helped inspire the Clean Water Act. Although the river has benefited greatly from environmental work and the departure of certain types of industry from the region, recent EPA test results indicate unacceptably high levels of mercury-contaminated wastewater are still being discharged into the river from numerous paper mills. One environmentalist group has cited the results in calling the Androscoggin one of the 20 most polluted rivers in America. One 14 mi stretch requires oxygen bubblers to prevent fish from suffocating. As of May 2007, environmental groups had a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>pending,</b> in an attempt to force the paper mills located along the river to clean their waste streams.

50|$|The Riverside County Board of Supervisors {{approved}} {{the project in}} October 1992 after EPA approval of the project. In August 2000, Kaiser Ventures reached {{an agreement with the}} Los Angeles Sanitation District (LASD - a public entity comprising several public waste collection agencies), to purchase the landfill project as a replacement for the Puente Hills Landfill, which would be nearing the end of its useful life. Trash was to be shipped by rail from the Los Angeles area via the abandoned Eagle Mountain Railroad line. However, the sale agreement states that all lawsuits and claims regarding the project were to be resolved. As of 2008, there was one <b>lawsuit</b> <b>pending.</b> However, much has changed in the waste business since 2000. A reduction in waste generated because of recycling has reduced the urgency for the new landfill. In addition, the Los Angeles Sanitation District purchased another landfill site in Imperial County. In May 2013, the LASD discontinued plans to convert the Eagle Mountain mine into a landfill.|$|E
5000|$|Charles did not prosper in the capital. According to Paul Hugounet, a {{contemporary}} of the mime {{and one of}} his earliest biographers, he left the Délassements-Comiques only a year after his engagement, a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>pending</b> between him and its director. In the following year, 1858, he opened the Salle Lacaze as the Théâtre Deburau, but the venture was a failure, and in 1859, to recover his debts, he left Paris {{on a tour of the}} provinces. [...] His last major attempt to win over audiences at the capital was in 1865, when he signed on at the Fantaisies-Parisiennes, then co-administered by the novelist and enthusiast of pantomime, Champfleury. Champfleury wrote his last pantomime, The Pantomime of the Attorney, for Deburau's début, and, though it was praised by the likes of Théophile Gautier, [...] Charles's engagement was cancelled not four months after its premiere. [...] "The less-than-tepid reception till then accorded the pantomime", in the words of L.-Henry Lecomte, the chief historian of the theater, [...] "convinced the administration of the Fantaisies-Parisiennes to abandon the genre at about this time." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Fontamara, Silone {{captures the}} fatigue and misery of the peasants and {{agricultural}} workers, which {{had previously been}} relatively undocumented. For {{the first time in}} Italian literature, peasants were the protagonists and their agricultural activities are described in great detail through the seasons. In 1929, when the story is set, the survival of peasants depended on subsistence agriculture on the land of the large landowners. Harvests varied day to day, food was not guaranteed and wages were low. Their land is very important to them and it is said that the relationship of a peasant to his land is a serious thing, like that between a husband and wife. Its a kind of sacrament. The misery of peasants is closely linked to their ignorance as this makes them vulnerable to scams and abuse, especially due to their reliance on others for contact with the new and complicated world of the city. The Fascist regime legalized the abuse of power, adopted measures that worsened the lives of peasants such as the reduction of wages and laws of emigration. This was not just a problem in Italy, as Silone states in his preface, The poor peasants, the men who make the earth fruitful and suffer hunger, …are alike in all the countries of the world ( [...] p. 18) Their ignorance meant that they could not progress up the social ladder, and At Fontamara there are only two rungs on the social ladder: the lowest, that of the cafoni, which is at ground level, and that of the small landowners, which is just a little higher. They are swindled out of their profits and wages by don Circonstanza and the Impresario, and as every family in Fontamara is connected, every family, even the poorest, has interests that are shared with others, and for lack of wealth it is poverty that has to be shared. So at Fontamara theres not a family that doesnt have a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>pending.</b> Their ignorance makes them vulnerable to exploitation. They are disconnected with the world and dont know about new laws like the Emigration Policy, wage rate changes, and identity cards and papers needed to get on a train or work elsewhere. The Italian Unification is still a recent event to them, they are ignorant of the new Fascist regime and still think that Queen Margherita is alive. Berardo also asks the Solito Sconsciuto if Russia exists. [...] "Russia? Tell me the truth, is there really such a place as this Russia theres so much talk about? Everyone talks about it, but no one has ever been there. Cafoni go everywhere, to America, Africa, France, but noone has ever been to Russia." ...|$|E
