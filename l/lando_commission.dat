50|$|Development of a European {{code for}} {{contract}} law began in 1982 with {{the formation of}} the Commission on European Contract Law. This became known as the <b>Lando</b> <b>Commission</b> after its chairman Ole Lando. At the same time UNIDROIT began similar studies leading to their 1994 publication Principles for International Commercial Contracts. The <b>Lando</b> <b>Commission</b> focused on creating their Principles of European Contract Law (PECL). The first part of the PECL was published in 1995, followed by Part II in 1999 and the final Part III in 2003. These Principles of European Contract Law may eventually form one part of the European civil code.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss the Principles of European Contract Law which were {{recently}} {{published by the}} <b>Lando</b> <b>commission.</b> I do this by addressing some of the choices the <b>Lando</b> <b>commission</b> made when drafting their Principles. In particular I examine choices {{with regard to the}} purpose of the PECL, the authors and their working method, the format and style, the subject matter, politics, culture, economics, and progress v. tradition. In assessing these choices I try to provide a deconstruction of the PECL as a restatement of the common core of European contract law...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} advocating {{lex mercatoria}} has periodically been enhanced by attempts to {{provide evidence of}} its existence and, at the same time, {{to make it more}} accessible by formulating-or codifying-its rules. One such attempt was a series of proposals to use international law as a tool for imposing uniform special rules for international trade. Others have been the formulation of non- binding general principles of international commercial contract law by UNIDROIT, the Cornell Common Core project, the <b>Lando</b> <b>Commission</b> Principles of European Contract Law, the various ICC formulations and, finally, general lists of principles formulated by prominent scholars in the area of lex mercatoria such as Berthold Goldman, Lord Mustill, and most recently Klaus Peter Berger. I should like to take this opportunity of discussing the relationship of lex mercatoria with both national and international law to reexamine the question of its autonomy in the light of this move towards codification. I shall suggest that these relationships and the inevitable process of institutionalisation through codification undermine all claims to an autonomous lex mercatoria and produce the antithesis of what is offered as its model.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of a European private law {{is one of the}} great issues on the legal agenda of our time. Among the most prominent initiatives furthering this process is the work of the Commission on European Contract Law (‘Lando Commission’). The essays collected in this volume have their origin within this context. They explore two practically very important topics which have hitherto been largely neglected in comparative legal literature: set-off and ‘extinctive’ prescription (or limitation of actions). The author lays the foundations for a common approach which may provide the basis for a set of European principles. At the same time, the essays provide practical examples of the arguments that can be employed in the process of harmonizing European private law on a rational basis: they consider the comparative experiences in the various modern legal systems, they explore the extent to which there is a common core of values, rules and concepts, they explain existing differences and they analyse the direction in which the international development is heading. The introduction to the present volume discusses the terms of reference of the <b>Lando</b> <b>Commission</b> that has set itself the task of elaborating a ‘restatement’ of European contract law and places its work within the wider context of the Europeanization of private law...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is about}} the duty of information, {{understood}} as a typical obligation of good faith in contrahendo. In general terms, the role that information plays in the period before {{the performance of the}} contract, commonly called pre-contractual or preliminary treatments. Different sources will be quoted, those of which in the formation period on the Roman judiciary system present configurative elements or at least, approximate to information duty. Due to the number of literary or judiciary sources found in that period, the analysis will be deepened in some sayings of Cicero that offer a valuable contribution to the evolution of the topic presented in this research paper. Then and after a short account of intermediate duty, we will come to modern right, framed by the Latin-American Civil Codifications and their European antecedents to study in depth in the reception of the duty to inform in the judiciary systems of the Common South Market - MERCOSUR. We analyze the different theories about the obligation rights with special reference to the role of information starting from the basis of the doctrinal and jurisprudential development, fields that based the evolution of this institute. Then we will study this figure according to relevant doctrinary experiences in the European countries, and also the unification legislative projects, such as Unidroit, Pavia`s European Private Law Academy and <b>Lando</b> <b>Commission.</b> At last, we will deal with the topic from the modern economy right analysis, which gives us an interesting perspective to use economy categories, methods and techniques to explain and interpret the right in general and the central topic of this work in particular. ...|$|E
40|$|The communitarization of {{the private}} law of the Member States {{has been given a}} {{significant}} impetus by the transfer of EC competence regarding judicial cooperation in civil matters from the third to the first pillar of the European Union. That is to say, under a new title of the EC Treaty, a single judicial area will be established; in terms of private law, the fields of private international law is involved to a large extent, whereas the civil procedure of the Member States will be affected to a lesser extent. In particular, the Community {{is in the process of}} transforming a number of conventions into secondary EC law, the most important one is the conversion into a Regulation of the Brussels Jurisdiction and Judgement Convention. Although the measures (to be) adopted in this context are ‘real’ acts of Community law – being based on the EC Treaty rather than the Treaty of European Union, the ‘normal’ regime for references for preliminary rulings does not apply. A more restricted regime is applicable. Also, the unity of Community law has been fragmented in that the measures are not binding on Denmark (the UK and Ireland are also not bound by acts adopted under this new Title but have opted in insofar as civil law measures are concerned). Harmonisation of substantive private law, unlike the conflicts of law and civil procedure, has not been affected significantly by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Private initiatives such as the Commission of European Contract Law (<b>Lando</b> <b>Commission)</b> are still the primary focus for proposals involving large scale harmonisation of private law, such as a systematic approximation of the whole of the law of obligations or even a European Civil Code...|$|E
40|$|International {{character}} of economic relations is in discrepancy with {{the limitation of}} their national legislation. During the whole last century and especially since World War II enormous grow of international trade created inevitable need for attempts of harmonization and even unification of commercial contract law. The unknown law of the different countries and contradictions and discrepancies among the legal families of common and civil law were the big risk which increased enormously transactional costs of the business arrangements in the trade between nations, especially in the trade among European countries. Existed varieties of contract law in European countries become a special type of non-tariff barrier which opposed to {{the free flow of}} goods, services, persons and capital and at the end decreased wealth. Legal scholars, practitioners and lawyers in Europe realized the need for harmonizing contract law in a way to create and adopt uniform rules for commercial activities, in one word to Europeanize the law of commercial contracts and create uniform legal environments. The problem of appropriate method of the unification divides many academics between idea of codification method in the way of legislation or by so called “creeping” method which uses common customs and practices in order to create unified system of generally accepted principles of commercial contracts law (lex mercatoria). In spite the first stages of unification was realized by way of directives, such as the law of consumer contracts, later on creation of the body of European competition law, emanation of the idea of Europeanized contract law took another direction emanating itself through the legal instrument of the so called “soft law” such as Principles of European Contract Law (PECL) created by the Commission of European Contract Law (so called <b>Lando</b> <b>Commission).</b> The Lando Principles which in their 17 Chapters content the common core of the all national legal systems of European countries are nowadays regarded as the nucleus of a European Civil Code. In Serbian attempts to join the EU it is the process of Europeanizing its commercial contract law which creating a challenge which obstacles should be overcome thankfully to the healthy roots of Serbian Law of Obligations-de lege lata which is the best part of Serbian positive private law founded on European legal tradition.
