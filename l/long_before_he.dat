5|$|At the April 2017 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, a film {{adaptation}} was announced. It will be co-written by Seeley and Sarah Fischer, {{directed by}} Luke Boyce and produced by Shatterglass Films, an independent film {{company based in}} Champaign, Illinois. Larger production firms also expressed interest, but Seeley would have had less input into the film if it were made by them. Boyce said he had enjoyed Revival since its debut, and {{had been thinking about}} adapting it <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> met the creators. A two-minute proof of concept teaser was shown at the expo.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter {{had envisioned}} Lance Henriksen portraying the {{character}} of Frank Black, <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was ever contacted.

Fox asked William Hurt to play the lead role, but after finding out that Hurt had no interest in acting on television, Henriksen got the part.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his success}} as a producer, West's true {{aspiration}} {{was to be a}} rapper. Though he had developed his rapping <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> began producing, it was often a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and he struggled to attain a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.|$|E
5|$|In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, Elves {{are one of}} {{the races}} that inhabit a fictional Earth, often called Middle-earth, and set in the remote past.

Tolkien had been writing about Elves <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> published The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1979, Eaton turned heel (bad guy) for {{the first}} time in his career by joining Tojo Yamamoto's group of wrestlers, whom the fans hated. Although Eaton is now thought of mainly as a heel, his fans were {{surprised}} at the time. Eaton's heel run did not last <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> rescued his former Jet Set partner, George Gulas, from a two-on-one attack by The Blond Bombers (Larry Latham and Wayne Ferris) to return to the fan-favorite side once more. After reuniting the team, Eaton and Gulas had one final run with tag team champions and worked an intense feud with Latham and Ferris.|$|E

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives late to {{the crime}} scene and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) tells her that the man's blood all drained {{abruptly}} in the hotel. A child’s bloody print is found, but Scully doesn’t believe that a child did this. Meanwhile, the beggar, somehow disguised as an ordinary-looking Caucasian man, applies for a janitorial job at a Cheverly, Maryland elementary school. In the morgue, Scully describes the massive stomach damage done to the body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly cut out of him. However, the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his time of death was 24 to 36 hours prior, <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> left India. Due to a discrepancy in weight, she begins to believe that there was a passenger in the corpse.|$|E
5|$|Humphreys, a Naval captain, {{had married}} Maria Davenport in 1810, and lived at Bramall Hall <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely {{respected}} in the Stockport area, but following his succession {{to the estate}} in 1829, there were disputes from {{other members of the}} Davenport family who claimed a right to the property. Edmund Davenport, who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport, the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees. Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services, and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport, in an effort to continue the Davenport line. He moved with Maria to Cheltenham in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in Leckhampton.|$|E
5|$|Julia {{found out}} that she was {{pregnant}} in January 1940. John Winston Lennon was born on 9 October 1940, on the second-floor ward of the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital in Liverpool, supposedly during a German air raid in World War II, although it has been confirmed there was no air raid on this date. Alf first saw his son that November when he returned from working as a merchant seaman on troop transports during World War II. He sent regular pay cheques to Julia, who lived with her son at 9 Newcastle Road (the Stanley family's home). He occasionally went back to Liverpool, but did not stay <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was sent off on another ship. The cheques to Julia stopped when he went absent without leave in 1943. Neither Julia nor the Merchant Navy knew of his whereabouts. Julia only found out because she stopped receiving her allowance money, and the Navy wrote to her to inform her that they were looking for him.|$|E

5|$|On May 20, 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} that Zayat had sold breeding {{rights to the}} colt to the Ashford Stud, a division of Ireland's Coolmore Stud, but retained control over the colt and his racing career. Before the announcement, offers for American Pharoah's breeding rights reportedly exceeded $20 million. After the Belmont, Forbes magazine {{reported that}} Zayat had actually sold the breeding rights to Ashford in late 2014, <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> began his Triple Crown run, and that Zayat retained 100% of the racing rights. Forbes went on to estimate that if American Pharoah stood for a $100,000 stud fee, he could be worth $50 million. More conservative estimates placed his potential stud fee at $75,000 and his potential value at about $25 to $36 million. The New York Times said that breeding rights had been sold for $13.8 million: $9.8 million with an additional $4 million incentive if American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes. Zayat retained an undisclosed percentage in the colt's breeding career, and explained that American Pharoah would retire from racing {{at the end of}} 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} conceived by Jun Maeda, who also wrote the screenplay and composed {{some of the}} music, with original character design by Na-Ga. Both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! in 2010. Maeda had thought up the concept for Charlotte <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was approached in early 2012 to work on another anime series after Angel Beats!. Maeda narrowed down the number of main characters compared to Angel Beats! and attempted to put more of a focus on their behavior. Instead of employing the same staff that had worked on Angel Beats!, the aim for Charlotte was to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process to prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!.|$|E
5|$|Following a spell in England {{playing for}} Sheffield Wednesday and Grimsby Town, Roy Coyle joined the club as player-manager, {{taking over the}} reigns from {{outgoing}} manager Billy Campbell. After a tough start to his managerial career at the club, Coyle {{went on to become}} the most successful Linfield manager in history, winning numerous trophies during his time at Windsor Park. His first season in charge was without silverware. In fact, having been Irish Cup runners-up the previous season when Coleraine defeated the Blues 1–0 after two replays, Linfield suffered one of the biggest upsets in Northern Irish football history when B Division club Carrick Rangers defeated the Blues 2–1 in the 1975–76 Irish Cup final on 10 April 1976. This giant-killing act in which a junior club defeated a senior club in the Irish Cup final had only happened twice before in the cup's history, and not since 1955 – 21 years earlier. The club stuck by Coyle however, and it was not <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> brought silverware to the club. His first honour arrived in the 1976–77 season in the form of the County Antrim Shield. However, the Blues suffered defeat in the Irish Cup final for the third consecutive season when they once again lost out against Coleraine – losing 4–1. The 1977–78 season saw the club win an Irish League, Irish Cup and Ulster Cup treble. Runners-up in the last three Irish Cup finals, this time they were not to be denied. A 3–1 victory over Ballymena United secured the club's third trophy of the season.|$|E
