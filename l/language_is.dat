5|$|Wittgenstein {{believed}} {{that religion is}} significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore {{believed that}} religious <b>language</b> <b>is</b> confessional– a confession of what someone feels and believes– rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious <b>language</b> <b>is</b> different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} ethnic groups prefer to {{communicate}} in their own languages, English as the official <b>language</b> <b>is</b> widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first <b>language</b> <b>is</b> used only by {{a small minority of}} the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the 3 main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba) but unlike the Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if <b>language</b> <b>is</b> the expression of thoughts and <b>language</b> <b>is</b> systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E

5|$|Human {{language}} has {{the properties of}} productivity and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. <b>Language</b> <b>is</b> thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided {{with an increase in}} brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. <b>Language</b> <b>is</b> processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old. The use of <b>language</b> <b>is</b> deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Human <b>language</b> <b>is</b> also {{unique in}} being able to refer to {{abstract}} concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events {{that took place in the}} past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human <b>language</b> <b>is</b> also considered unique.|$|E
5|$|Human <b>language</b> <b>is</b> {{unique in}} {{comparison}} {{to other forms of}} communication, such as those used by non-human animals. Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.|$|E

5|$|Modern English syntax <b>language</b> <b>is</b> {{moderately}} analytic. It {{has developed}} {{features such as}} modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning.
