40|$|Abstract In Denmark the {{possession}} {{and use of}} cannabis in all forms is illegal. More than 44 % of the population aged 16 - 44 has tried it and around 23 % of young people aged 16 - 24 used it presently. This constitutes some problems in the danish society {{as a lot of}} people are criminalized. In 2003 the former danish government tightened the cannabis law when they announced their plan of actions against drugs in Denmark called “Kampen mod narko”. Prior to 2003 possession of cannabis for own usage was allowed. This was now changed, and even possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use now results in at least a fine. Prior to the changes in the cannabis law in Denmark had been classified as a “soft drug” opposed by “hard drugs” such as heroin and cocaine. This is one of the areas where international society has affected danish drug laws thoroughly through the UN Single Convention of 1961 which contains a list of all drugs the UN decided should be illegal. This convention has had a major influence on “Kampen mod narko”. By acknowledging the UN convention as an authority yielding power on danish law it is clear that the obligation felt by the danish government towards the international community has a direct influence on danish law. The danish government in turn uses this direct influence from the international community to exert what we call an indirect use of power to prevent alternatives to the current law from being discussed. The consequences of being a cannabis user has changed drastically in Denmark since 2003. Where it was previously frowned upon but did not have legal consequences, a large portion of danish people have now been criminalized. This means that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not have any other conflicts with legal authorities now suffer the consequence of being a criminal in the eyes of the law. Potentially, the result of this is that they will have a harder time finding jobs, starting educations and will be more prone to social conflicts with family and friends because of the influence the law has on the perception of people who use cannabis. Not only does this have a negative consequence for the single user, society as a whole also suffers from criminalizing cannabis in every regard except for medical and scientific. It suffers because large resources are allocated to fighting cannabis. Looking at the statistics it does not seem that the plan of actions has had any positive effects on the use of cannabis. In the last decade the use of cannabis has remained stable and is actually on the rise in 2013...|$|E
40|$|Menjelang pergantian Pemerintahan Orde Baru oleh Pemerintahan “Reformasi” pada penghujung Tahun 1997 - 1998, terjadi perkembangan menarik menyangkut Deregulasi Kebijakan Pertanahan Nasional, ketika pemerintah secara berturut-turut mengeluarkan 5 (lima) Keputusan Menteri Negara Agraria/Kepala BPN tentang Deregulasi Perubahan Hak Guna Bangunan (HGB) atau Pemberian Hak Milik (HM) Atas Tanah Perumahan. Kebijakan deregulatif ini semula ditujukan untuk masyarakat Golongan Ekonomi Lemah (GEL) dengan Kategori Rumah Sangat Sederhana dan Rumah Sederhana (RSS/RS), yang pada umumnya mereka peroleh dari Fasilitas Kredit Pemilikan Pemilikan Rumah (KPR) dari Bank Pemerintah (KPR-BTN). Namun kemudian, Kebijakan itu diperluas berlakunya dan atau diberikan juga kepada pemegang Hak atas tanah yang habis masa berlakunya; termasuk Untuk rumah tinggal yang dibeli PNS dari Pemerintah, serta pemberian HM untuk rumah tinggal yang luas tanahnya tidak lebih dari 600 m 2. Kebijakan deregulatif peningkatan Hak atas perumahan untuk Golongan Ekonomi Lemah (GEL) itu tidak serta merta dimanfaatkan dengan baik oleh masyarakat, karena banyak faktor yang mempengaruhi. Disisi lain, Realisasi proses perubahan HGB menjadi HM oleh pihak kreditur/Bank disinyalir tidak dilaksanakan secara benar dan konsisten, sehingga dapat menimbulkan akibat hukum terhadap para pihak dalam Perjanjian KPR. Temuan di lapangan menunjukkan sebagai berikut : (1) faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi pemegang hak mengajukan peningkatan HGB menjadi HM adalah, (1. 1.) faktor pendorong (a) Perubahan HGB menjadi HM akan memberikan kepastian hak tanpa batas waktu berlaku;(b) status HM memberikan ketentraman psikologis dalam rumah tangga;(c) Peningkatan HGB menjadi HM dapat meningkatkan Harga jual atau nilai ekonomis tanah;(d) Peningkatan HGB menjadi HM diharapkan dapat menambah jumlah pinjaman; dan (e) Prosedur perubahan HGB menjadi HM lebih sederhana (deregulatif); sedangkan (1. 2.) faktor penghambat (a) pemegang hak merasa kesulitan mendapat persetujuan pihak kreditur/Bank;(b) menurut mereka, biaya jasa notaris mahal;(c) biaya formulir permohonan perubahan hak di BPN tidak sesuai tarif resmi;(d) Perubahan HGB menjadi HM tidak mendesak (urgen);(e) biaya yang akan mereka keluarkan lebih besar daripada manfaat yang akan diperoleh; dan (f) Developer tidak memberikan opsi peningkatan hak kepada Konsumen menjelang transaksi jualbeli. Realisasi perubahan/peningkatan HGB menjadi HM tidak langsung diikuti dengan perubahan dokumen yuridis, seperti perubahan akad kredit, APHT, SKMHT dan sertifikat HT, padahal obyek haknya sudah berubah; Akibat Hukum yang dapat timbul adalah diantara para pihak, tidak lagi terikat pada klausul agunan kredit atau klausul pembebanan hak tanggungan dalam Perjanjian KPR. Implikasi yuridis lain, dengan demikian, kedudukan Kreditur/Bank tidak lagi sebagai kreditur {{preference}} atau yang diutamakan diantara kreditur- kreditur lain. Kata Kunci : Kebijakan Deregulasi; Peningkatan Hak Atas Tanah; Perjanjian KPR; Klausula Pembebanan Hak Tanggungan; HGB; Hak Milik ABSTRACT There was {{an interesting}} development regarding The Deregulation of the National Land Policy {{at the end of}} Orde Baru era (the late 1997 - 1998). The Government at that time enacted 5 (five) The Decree of State Minister of Agraria/Head of National Land Agency regarding the The Deregulation on the change of the Rights of Usage of The Building (Hak Guna Bangunan) to the Rights of Ownership (Hak Milik/HM) toward Housing Complex land. The object of this policy used to be a Low-Economic Society where the categories are A very simple house (rumah sangat sederhana) and A simple house (rumah sederhana),with which in general the owners get the special credit for housing complex from the state bank (in this case is BTN). As time goes by, the policy stated that it has wider coverage and or it is also given to the land right holders whose certificate is already not valid, including the houses bought by State servant from the government, and also for the houses where the land is not more than 600 M 2. The existence of the policy regarding the Deregulation on the Increasing of the land right toward the housing complex for Low-Economic Society gives many advantages but in fact there are still a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not use this facility. It is all because there are several factors which influence the right holders to implement the change from Right of Usage of The Building to Rights of Ownership or one which contains land mortage Clausal. On the other hand, the process of the changing from Right of Usage of Building to Rights of Ownership by the creditor is not conducted correctly and consistently, that produce the Consequences of the law for the parties-especially the creditor- which is bonded with the main agreement in the form of KPR agreement. The data found on the field are as follow: (1) The factors that influence the right holder to propose the change from Right of Usage of Building to Rights of Ownership are: (1. 1) Positive factors (a) the change from Right of Usage of Building to Rights of Ownership will make sure that there is no time limitation on the right; (b) The status of Rights of Ownership gives the psychological comfortableness for the family; (c) The change from Right of Usage of Building to Rights of Ownership rises the economic value; (d) The change from Right of Usage of Building to Rights of Ownership is expected to add the amount of credit; (e) The procedure of the change from Right of Usage of Building to Rights of Ownership is simpler (deregulative); while the negative factors are: (a) The right holders feel the difficulties in getting the agreement from the creditor/bank; (b) according to them, the notaries fee is expensive; (c) The fee for the change proposal form in BPN is not as stated as in the rules (more expensive); (d) The change from Right of Usage of Building to Rights of Ownership is not urgent; (e) The expense will be bigger than the advantage they will get; and (f) The developer did not give any option to the customer regarding the change from Right of Usage of Building to Rights of Ownership when the transaction would be held. The Implementation of the change from Right of Usage of Building to Rights of Ownership is not followed by the change on the juridical documents, such as Akad kredit, APHT, SKMHT and the certificate whereas the object has changed. Consequences of law which raises is that the parties are no longer bonded on the Agunan Credit Agreement or land mortgage clausal in the KPR agreement. The other Juridical Implication is that, the position of the creditor is no longer a preference creditor or the one who must be taken into the first consideration.
