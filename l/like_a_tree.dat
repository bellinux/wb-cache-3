5|$|During the Mesozoic, the prototypical mammal {{was a small}} nocturnal {{insectivore}} something <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> shrew. Due {{to their}} nocturnal habits, most mammals lost their color vision, and greatly improved their sense of hearing. All mammals of today are shaped by this origin. Primates later re-evolved color-vision.|$|E
5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E

5|$|Magi sacrifices {{herself to}} give the fairies a chance, and she tells Crysta to {{remember}} everything she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus {{the source of his}} power, but he manifests himself within the oil in the machine and begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta seemingly sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost, until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> Pips {{and the rest of the}} fairies rally to the powers they have been given, which causes the seed that Crysta fed him to start growing wildly. Hexxus is imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which bursts into bloom. Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to remember everything that has transpired and she sadly restores him to his human size. Remembering the seed in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries the seed in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need to change as they leave the forest behind. The seed sprouts new growth for FernGully, as Crysta follows Pips with Batty behind her.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular {{to the notion that}} Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't {{be able to make it}} work for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite their similarities, works {{produced}} by divers artists were neither homogeneous nor isotropic. This venture was essentially nonlinear. Cubism was omnidirectional, growing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> with many branches. The progression of each artist was unique. Even when paths would cross, artists {{would not necessarily}} fall under one another's influence. Despite a growing awareness, a 'collective consciousness' based on a nonacademic passion for structure and mobility, and despite the sense of group unity that would attain a maxima circa 1912, deep-seated differences arose sporadically, often fueled by critics and dealers.|$|E
25|$|To these {{dangerous}} {{products of}} Western thought {{he found a}} counterpoise in popular vis inertiae, and in {{the respect of the}} masses for institutions developed slowly and automatically during the past centuries of national life. In his view, human society evolves naturally, just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> grows. Human mind is not able to perceive the logic of social development. Any attempt to reform society is a violence and a crime. Among the practical deductions drawn from these premises is the necessity of preserving autocratic power, and of fostering among the people the traditional veneration for the ritual of the national Church.|$|E

25|$|Cockroaches, {{like all}} insects, breathe through {{a system of}} tubes called tracheae. The tracheae of insects are {{attached}} to the spiracles, excluding the head. Thus cockroaches, like all insects, are not dependent on the mouth and windpipe to breathe. The valves open when the CO2 level in the insect rises to a high level; then the CO2 diffuses out of the tracheae to the outside and fresh O2 diffuses in. Unlike in vertebrates that depend on blood for transporting O2 and CO2, the tracheal system brings the air directly to cells, the tracheal tubes branching continually <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> until their finest divisions, tracheoles, are associated with each cell, allowing gaseous oxygen to dissolve in the cytoplasm lying across the fine cuticle lining of the tracheole. CO2 diffuses out of the cell into the tracheole. While cockroaches do not have lungs and thus do not actively breathe in the vertebrate lung manner, in some very large species the body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air out and in the spiracles; this may be considered a form of breathing.|$|E

500|$|Resnick {{was awarded}} the {{contract}} to design the memorial after a nationwide competition. His initial vision for the memorial was a [...] "free form" [...] but generally circular shape, set within a reflecting pool. [...] However, because money was being raised for the memorial by groups in all 50 states in the U.S., as well as groups in Washington, D.C., a vision of columns for each of those locations ultimately helped him {{come up with the}} concept of a tree trunk, linked to the idea that Kennedy's life had been cut down <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> that is felled in its prime. [...] The courtyard below the memorial includes a number of plaques acknowledging contributions by individuals and groups.|$|E

Stone reworked 1969's [...] "Thank You" [...] single as a slower, closing track, [...] "Thank You For Talking to Me Africa" [...] which, according to AllMusic's Matthew Greenwald was a blues and gospel influenced examination of urban tension {{and the end of}} the 1960s, [...] "perhaps the most frightening recording from the dawn of the 1970s, capturing all of the drama, ennui, and hedonism of the decade to come with almost a clairvoyant feel." [...] "Africa Talks to You" [...] is a nine-minute funk jam written in response to Sly Stone's backlash from estranged fans and friends, record industry associates, and the media. According to biographer Eddie Santiago, the lyrics cynically portray [...] "fame and its cold retrogression into perceived insanity", with a chorus that reflects [...] "Sly's feelings on being cut down in his prime <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> in the forest." ...|$|E
