50|$|Allwork {{tractors}} were {{manufactured by}} the Electric Wheel Company of Quincy, Illinois. Electric Wheel Co. {{was acquired by}} the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. The All Work II Model F was a <b>lightweight</b> <b>tractor</b> with a big surplus of power for general farming and orchard work. This tractor was fueled by kerosene.|$|E
50|$|Road {{performance}} of the Auto-Truck was improved by fitting larger rear wheels with pneumatic tyres. Several tyre and suspension spring options remained in production throughout its history. An early development even offered the Auto-Truck as a <b>lightweight</b> <b>tractor</b> for use on roads, sold to local councils and the like for street cleaning. Many Auto-Trucks were registered for road use and carried a number plate, but none {{are known to have}} had lighting or other road equipment fitted.|$|E
5000|$|In 1953 the Cheston L. Eshelman Company, {{which had}} {{produced}} light aircraft immediately after World War II and then pleasure boats (including the spectacular [...] "Rocket Boat", built from surplus military aircraft wing tanks), <b>lightweight</b> garden <b>tractors</b> and other implements, began producing a tiny air-cooled, one-cylinder automobile, the [...] "Sport Car", in two versions: a basic $295 15 MPH [...] "Child's Sport Car" [...] (CSC) for {{two children and}} powered by a two-horsepower Briggs & Stratton #6 engine, and the $395 25 MPH Model 2 [...] "Adult Sport Car" [...] (ASC) for one adult which featured the three-horsepower Briggs & Stratton #8 engine, battery-operated head and tail lamps, seat-cushion upholstery, and trademark chrome [...] "rocket" [...] emblems on its flanks.|$|R
5000|$|The 399 was {{initially}} {{powered by a}} 97 horsepower Perkins A6.354 6-cylinder diesel engine as standard. The engine was uprated to a [...] Perkins 1006 series engine and the cab updated in 1991. The company never had such bumper sales {{with a series of}} tractor since it first started decades previously. The years 1994 - 96 were good for Massey Ferguson when Ireland and the UK had record sales of this series. The main reasons for this was its reliability, excellent cab, strong features and powerful engine the latter sometimes receiving dealer fitted turbocharger kits to boost the 399's power to the 125/130 horsepower mark, giving the farmer a <b>lightweight,</b> yet powerful <b>tractor</b> for field work where a larger tractor might damage the crop.|$|R
40|$|About 80 % {{of farms}} in India {{are less than}} five acres in size and are {{cultivated}} by farmers who use bullocks for farming operations. Even the smallest tractors available in the Indian market are too expensive and large, and not {{designed to meet the}} unique requirements of these farmers. To address these needs, we have developed a proof-of-concept <b>lightweight</b> (350 kg) <b>tractor</b> in collaboration with Mahindra and Mahindra Limited, an Indian tractor manufacturer. Given the challenges of accurately predicting traction in Indian soils by applying existing terramechanics models, an alternative design approach based on Mohr-Coulomb soil-failure criterion is presented. Analysis of weight, power and drawbar of existing tractors on the market, a single wheel traction test, and a drawbar test of a proof-of-concept small tractor prototype suggest that ~ 200 kg is the maximum drawbar force that could be achieved by a 350 kg tractor of conventional design. In order to attain higher drawbar performance of 70 % of the tractor weight needed for specific agricultural operations, additional design changes are required. An approach for increasing traction by adding tires is investigated and discussed. Additional research on weight distribution, dynamic drawbar testing and tread design is suggested as future work.

5000|$|Around 1920, as IH's motor {{cultivator}} died, {{a team of}} IH engineers was {{experimenting with}} an all-purpose tractor, replacing the horse in every job including cultivating. By 1923, they settled on a configuration, and their informal name for the project, the [...] "Farmall", {{was selected as the}} product's official name. As IH management was concerned that the new high-riding, tricycle design—a rather -looking thing to eyes of the early 1920s—might turn off customers, the Farmall was initially released only in Texas, in order to minimize potential embarrassment if the design proved to be unsuccessful. However, the new tractor did its many jobs well and hence sold well, and by 1926, IH was ready for large-scale production at its new Farmall Works plant in Rock Island, Illinois. Although the Farmall never reached the per-year production numbers of the Fordson during the 1920s, it was the tractor that prevented the Fordson from completely owning the market on small, <b>lightweight,</b> mass-produced, affordable <b>tractors</b> for the small or medium family farm. Its narrow-front tricycle design, high ground clearance to clear crop plants while cultivating (helped by a portal axle gearset), power take-off (a feature on which IH was an early leader), and standard mounting points for cultivators and other implements on the tractor's frame (a Farmall first) gave it some competitive advantages over the Fordson, especially for row crops, and it became the favorite row-crop tractor of America, outselling all other competitors (such as John Deere's).|$|R
