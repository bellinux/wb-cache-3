5|$|The {{provenance}} {{and early}} history of the codex is uncertain; Rome (Hort), southern Italy, Alexandria (Kenyon,, 1912, p. 88. Burkitt), and Caesarea (T. C. Skeat) have been suggested as the origin. Hort's argument for Rome rests mainly on certain spellings of proper names, such as Ισακ and Ιστραηλ, which show a Western or Latin influence. A second argument is that the chapter division of Acts, {{similar to that of}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, is not found in any other Greek manuscript, but is present in several manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate. Robinson counters the argument by suggesting that this system of chapter divisions was introduced into the Vulgate by Jerome himself, {{as a result of his}} studies at Caesarea. According to Hort, it was copied from a manuscript whose <b>line</b> <b>length</b> was 12–14 letters per line, because where the Codex Vaticanus's scribe made large omissions, they were typically 12–14 letters long.|$|E

25|$|Trains on the Fast lines {{pass the}} station through {{platforms}} 3 and 4, usually without stopping to serve it; {{access to these}} platforms is now by staff-operated gates which are opened when necessary. Southern and London Midland stopping services generally use platforms 5 and 6 on the Slow lines but all can use either pair of platforms when needed since the four Main Line platforms were lengthened to take 12-coach trains. Platform 2 on the Up DC line has unusually been maintained at a length of 182m rather than the usual DC <b>line</b> <b>length</b> of around 125m, long enough for an 8-coach train; on rare past occasions in recent years involving total closure of the Fast and Slow lines, main line trains have been diverted over the DC line between Watford Junction and Euston but without stopping at intermediate stations.|$|E
25|$|The over is a {{fundamental}} consideration in the tactical planning of the fielding side. Since a single bowler has only six legal balls to bowl before he must hand the ball to another bowler, he typically plans to use those six balls {{to set up a}} pattern of play designed to get a batsman out. For example, he may bowl the first few balls with the same <b>line,</b> <b>length,</b> or spin. He intends to tempt the batsman into scoring runs by providing balls that are relatively easy to hit. If the batsman takes the bait, the bowler can then follow up with a variation designed to hit the wicket, or a ball that is intended to induce a mistake from a batsman who is still in aggressive run-scoring mode, which will result in him being caught out.|$|E

25|$|The Lieråsen Tunnel was {{launched}} {{as a project}} to cut distance and travel times between Asker and Drammen, as the Drammen Line was nearly twice the length compared to a straight line. The first proposals were developed by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in the early 1940s, albeit at first for a single track. During the process of double tracking the Drammen Line between Asker and Sandvika, NSB launched a proposal to build two additional sections of double track, one from Hokksund to Drammen and one from Brakerøya to Asker. For the latter two main proposals were made: one which would run from the old Lier Station to Asker and a shorter direct tunnel. The advantage of the former was the ability to still serve Lierbyen and smaller construction costs, while the latter would give a shorter overall <b>line</b> <b>length.</b> NSB called for prioritizing the Drammen–Hokksund segment if there was not funding for both.|$|E

500|$|The sestina {{has been}} subject to some variations, with changes being made to both the size and number of stanzas, and also to {{individual}} <b>line</b> <b>length.</b> A [...] "double sestina" [...] is the name given to either: two sets of six six-line stanzas, with a three-line envoy (for a total of 75 lines), or twelve twelve-line stanzas, with a six-line envoy (for a total of 150 lines). Examples of either variation are rare; [...] "Ye Goatherd Gods" [...] by Philip Sidney is a notable example of the former variation, while [...] "The Complaint of Lisa" [...] by Algernon Charles Swinburne is a notable example of the latter variation. In the former variation, the original pattern of line-ending words, i.e. that of the first stanza, recurs in the seventh stanza, and thus the entire change of pattern occurs twice throughout. In the second variation, the pattern of line-ending words returns to the starting sequence in the eleventh stanza; thus it does not, unlike the [...] "single" [...] sestina, allow for every end-word to occupy each of the stanza ends; end-words 5 and 10 fail to couple between stanzas.|$|E
500|$|The player fishes {{in pursuit}} of fame as a {{fisherman}} named Billy. The game mechanics are [...] "three tightly-woven minigames in one": casting the fishing line, catching fish, and shooting {{the fish in the}} air. The player casts the line and tilts the device to avoid the fish as the hook sinks. Upon hooking a fish, the hook ascends and the player tilts the device to catch as many fish as possible en route to the surface. Above water, the fish are launched into the air, and the player taps the screen to shoot the fish out of the sky to earn money before they fall into the water. The fish differ in characteristics including swim pattern and the number of shots required to cash in. The jellyfish shot detract from the total income. There are four stages, each with its own visual and audio theme and rare fish, and an endless mode where players can work towards the highest score. Earnings can be spent in a store towards persistent upgrades such as longer fishing <b>line</b> <b>length,</b> invulnerable drills, frivolous hats, bigger guns, chainsaw lures, a hair dryer and toaster (to zap inadvertent catches), fuel for the chainsaw, and a necktie for greater income. There is also a Fish-o-pedia in Billy's smartphone that gives gameplay hints and tracks stats such as fish caught, which is the progress for unlocking new levels. There are no in-app purchases.|$|E
500|$|Shi (...) Is {{the main}} type of Classical Chinese poetry. Within {{this form of}} poetry the most {{important}} variations are [...] "folk song" [...] styled verse (yuefu), [...] "old style" [...] verse (gushi), [...] "modern style" [...] verse (jintishi). In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, {{and the number of}} lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of shi poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or jueju) or else an eight line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The <b>line</b> <b>length</b> is scanned by according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a caesura before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device. The [...] "old style" [...] verse (gushi) is less formally strict than the jintishi, or regulated verse, which, despite the name [...] "new style" [...] verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back as Shen Yue (441–513 CE), although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of Chen Zi'ang (661–702 CE). [...] A good example of a poet known for his gushi poems is Li Bai (701–62 CE). Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the four tones of Middle Chinese The basic form of jintishi (lushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines {{in the second and third}} couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of allusion, and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics. One of the masters of the form was Du Fu (712–70 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).|$|E
