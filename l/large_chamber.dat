5|$|It has {{intricate}} carvings, with inscriptions in Quranic script. The mosque, in a walled enclosure, {{is made of}} interlocking coral blocks {{with its}} hypostyle roof supported by cut-coral columns. With three entrances, the mosque has two prayer halls surrounded by antechambers on three sides. Its vaulted, decorated ceiling is indented in steps. Local master carpenters, known as maavadikaleyge, fashioned the mosque's woodwork, roof and interior, and its wall panels and ceilings have many culturally-significant examples of traditional Maldivian woodcarving and lacquerwork. The mihrab, with a mimbar (pulpit) at one end, is a <b>large</b> <b>chamber.</b> The main building, used for daily prayers, {{is divided into three}} sections: the mihtab (used by the imam to lead the prayers), the medhu miskiy (the mosque's central area) and the fahu miskiy (the rear of the mosque). A long, carved 13th-century panel memorializes the introduction of Islam to Maldives.|$|E
5|$|On the High Street, No. 106 and 107 {{stand on}} the site of Tackley's Inn; built around 1295, it was the first piece of {{property}} that Adam de Brome acquired when he began to found the college in 1324. It comprised a hall and chambers leased to scholars, behind a frontage of five shops, with the scholars above and a cellar of five bays below. The hall, which was open to the roof, was 33feet (10m) long, 20feet (6m) wide, and about 22feet (7m) high; at the east end was a <b>large</b> <b>chamber</b> with another chamber above it. The south wall of the building, which survives, was partly of stone and contains a large two-light early 14th-century window. The cellar below is of the same date and is the best preserved medieval cellar in Oxford; originally entered by stone steps from the street, it has a stone vault divided into four sections by two diagonal ribs, with carved corbels.|$|E

50|$|Every state except Nebraska has a {{bicameral}} legislature, {{meaning that}} the legislature consists of two separate legislative chambers or houses. In each case the smaller chamber is called the Senate and is usually {{referred to as the}} upper house. This chamber typically, but not always, has the exclusive power to confirm appointments made by the governor and to try articles of impeachment. (In a few states, a separate Executive Council, composed of members elected from large districts, performs the confirmation function.) Members of the smaller chamber represent more citizens and usually serve for longer terms than members of the <b>larger</b> <b>chamber,</b> generally four years. In 41 states, the <b>larger</b> <b>chamber</b> is called the House of Representatives. Five states designate the <b>larger</b> <b>chamber</b> the Assembly and three states call it the House of Delegates. Members of the <b>larger</b> <b>chamber</b> usually serve for terms of two years. The <b>larger</b> <b>chamber</b> customarily has the exclusive power to initiate taxing legislation and articles of impeachment.|$|R

25|$|GLaDOS' {{physical}} appearance went through several iterations when Valve had Jason Brashill help drive the visual creation of GLaDOS. Early designs used for her included a floating brain, a spider-like appearance, and an upside-down version of Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus {{with the four}} personality cores around her body. Eventually, they settled {{on the design of}} the robotic figure hanging upside down. This was done to convey both a sense of raw mechanical power and femininity. A large disk with the four personality cores hanging from it was added to her design, when she was still just a sphere standing above it. However, the team found it to be too small, giving her a body and putting it below the disk. Another early design was when GLaDOS was only a cube, which was used for the removed laser battle mentioned below. The <b>large</b> <b>chamber</b> that the player-character encounters {{was the result of the}} team wanting to build a space that brought a great deal of attention to her.|$|E
500|$|Nickel is {{obtained}} from nickel carbonyl {{by one of}} two processes. It may be passed through a <b>large</b> <b>chamber</b> at high temperatures in which {{tens of thousands of}} nickel spheres, called pellets, are constantly stirred. The carbonyl decomposes and deposits pure nickel onto the nickel spheres. In the alternate process, nickel carbonyl is decomposed in a smaller chamber at 230°C to create a fine nickel powder. The byproduct carbon monoxide is recirculated and reused. The highly pure nickel product is known as [...] "carbonyl nickel".|$|E

Although Hatanaka threatened to disembowel him with a samurai sword, Tokugawa lied and told them he did not know where the recordings or men were. During their search, the rebels cut nearly all of the telephone wires, severing communications between the palace grounds and the outside world.|$|E

500|$|Burial 10 was {{the tomb}} of late 4th-century king Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The tomb {{consists}} of a <b>large</b> <b>chamber</b> {{carved out of the}} bedrock beneath Temple 34. The remains of the king were interred upon a wooden bier and he was accompanied by nine human sacrifices and a headless caiman. The tomb contained a large quantity of grave goods, including an impressive array of ceramic vessels, many decorated with Teotihuacan-linked imagery. One ceramic drinking vessel bore the writing [...] "the drinking vessel of the son of Spearthrower Owl". Five turtle shells of assorted sizes, some still attached to a rack, were the remains of a musical instrument similar to a marimba. A small jade ornament was also found, sculpted into the form of a caiman's head with a curled snout. The skull of the king was dyed red. The association of caimans with the king's remains related to an element of the king's name; ayiin means [...] "crocodile" [...] and the animal may have been the king's way (spirit companion).|$|E

[...] As the fungus matures, the fruiting body cracks open and forms a stalk with tapering arms, a volva, and a spore mass {{known as a}} gleba. The mature fruiting body is typically [...] in height, with arms that are 2–5 times {{the length of the}} stipe. The stipe itself does not extend past the volva, and is hollow, thin-walled, chambered, wrinkled, and flares towards the upper end.

500|$|GLaDOS {{attempts}} to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements claiming {{that she is}} going the wrong way as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Eventually, Chell reaches a <b>large</b> <b>chamber</b> where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to plead with and threaten Chell, but during the exchange a sphere falls off; Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple [...] "personality cores" [...] which the Aperture Science employees allegedly installed after GLaDOS flooded the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin gas, {{and goes on to}} state that now there is nothing to prevent her from doing so once again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more pieces of GLaDOS, while GLaDOS {{attempts to}} discourage her both verbally, with a series of taunts and increasingly juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After she has destroyed the final personality core, a portal malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. One of the final scenes is changed through a patch of the PC version that was made available a few days before Portal 2s announcement; in this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the [...] "party escort submission position", revealing the entity to be a [...] "party associate".|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{persistent}} myth about 1970-mid 1971 319 and 291 AMC heads. These heads have the dog-leg exhaust ports and 50-52cc combustion chambers. They are commonly {{identified by the}} first three (319) or last three (291 for the 360-401 heads; 304 used a different casting) digits of the casting number. There was a U.S. auto industry-wide shift to lower compression ratios in mid 1971, so AMC increased combustion chamber size to 58-59 cc. The first three digits of the casting number on the <b>large</b> <b>chamber</b> heads are 321, 322, or 323 depending on year. The only difference between small and <b>large</b> <b>chamber</b> Gen-3 heads is the combustion chamber size. The early heads are not [...] "the best" [...] AMC heads as many have come to believe. They will raise compression on a later engine with no other changes, but if building an engine get the proper pistons for the desired ratio. There {{is no reason to}} search out these relatively hard to find, and more expensive when found, heads for performance, except for the fact they are a factory-reliable high-compression performance part which is generally viewed as more valuable and instantly desirable.|$|E
