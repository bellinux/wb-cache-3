James {{believes}} that St Hill planned to play professional cricket in England around this point, but his {{failure in the}} trial matches meant {{that he was not}} selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1923. James records how upset St Hill's supporters were by his omission and they believed the West Indian selectors feared a black batsman being successful in England. He also describes St Hill became more single-minded and <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> moderate his approach after this decision.|$|E

Jack's {{role in the}} Merseyside Council of Action (an impromptu militant action group) during the 1926 General Strike made employers even <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> engage him. He was rescued {{by the action of}} Sir Benjamin Johnson, a liberal-minded industrialist, who lent him the money to purchase a Co-operative Insurance Society agency. Jack and Bessie were now determined to pursue their political aims by democratic methods, and in 1926 they joined the Fairfield ward of the Liverpool Labour Party. In the 1929 Liverpool council elections, Jack was returned unopposed as the Labour councillor for the Fairfield ward. A year later Bessie joined him, elected in the St Anne's ward.|$|E

5|$|According to Sugiura, Monolith Soft's {{relations}} with Namco {{had undergone a}} negative change after Nakamura retired as head of Namco in 2002, three years before the merger with Bandai. The company underwent changes and Monolith Soft felt they were being given less creative freedom, and the newly-created Namco Bandai was <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take creative risks. The company then received consultation from Shinji Hatano, an executive director at Nintendo, who advised them to continue creating innovative projects. Spurred on by Hatano's supportive attitude, Monolith Soft decided {{to break away from}} Namco Bandai to become a Nintendo subsidiary; this provided Monolith Soft creative freedom in exchange for software development exclusivity for Nintendo platforms. Nintendo's purchasing of the majority of Monolith Soft's shares from Bandai Namco Holdings was publicly announced in April 2007. Nintendo became the majority shareholder of Monolith Soft with 80% of shares, while Bandai Namco retained 16% and remained as a development partner. Namco Bandai stated that the exchange of Monolith Soft shares would strengthen their relationship with Nintendo. The remaining shares were divided between Takahashi, Sugiura and Honne. Nintendo's acquisition of Monolith Soft contrasted against the company's previous publicized approach of not taking part in mergers and acquisitions of other studios and companies. In a statement on the matter, then-CEO of Nintendo Satoru Iwata said that the deal was initiated due to the positive relations between Sugiura and Nintendo, and the two company's parallel design and development philosophies.|$|E
25|$|Pit latrines {{are often}} {{relocated}} or re-built after some years (when the pit is full {{and if the}} pit is not emptied) and thus need more space than urine-diverting dry toilets for example and people are <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> invest in a nice high-quality super-structure as {{it will have to}} be dismantled at some point.|$|E

40|$|Women are <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> {{than men}} <b>to</b> compete against others. This gender gap can {{partially}} explain {{the differences between}} women's and men's education and career choices, and the labor market disparities that result. The experiments presented here show that even though women are <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> than men <b>to</b> compete against others, they are just as willing as men are {{to take on the}} challenge of improving themselves and competing against their own past performance. For organizations striving towards gender equality, this opens up new possibilities for institutionalizing competitive pressure...|$|R

25|$|The Victorian American {{conception}} {{of sexuality and}} other roles {{of men and women}} in society and to one another were being challenged. Modern clothing was lighter and more flexible, better suiting the modern woman such as the flapper who wanted to engage in active sport. Women were now becoming more assertive and <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> keep the home fires burning. The flappers' costume was seen as sexual and raised deeper questions of the behavior and values it symbolized.|$|E
25|$|When a {{group member}} {{does not feel}} that his/her effort is {{justified}} {{in the context of}} the overall group, the individual will be <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> assert the effort.

50|$|Over {{one million}} cases of acute {{salpingitis}} are reported {{every year in}} the U.S., but the number of incidents is probably larger, due to incomplete and untimely reporting methods and that many cases are reported first when the illness has gone so far that it has developed chronic complications. For women aged 16-25, salpingitis is the most common serious infection. It affects approximately 11% of the female of reproductive age.Salpingitis has a higher incidence among members of lower socioeconomic classes. However, this is thought of being an effect of earlier sex debut, multiple partners and decreased ability to receive proper health care rather than any independent risk factor for salpingitis.As an effect of an increased risk due to multiple partners, the prevalence of salpingitis is highest for people aged 15-24 years. Decreased awareness of symptoms and <b>less</b> <b>will</b> <b>to</b> use contraceptives are also common in this group, raising the occurrence of salpingitis.|$|R

Because of this portrayal, communities may be <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> help the salaryman with his emotional problems, which often leads to clinical depression or even suicide. Corporations are often more willing to fire salarymen to lower costs, and many Japanese students are attempting to veer off the typical path of graduating from college to enter a corporation and become a salaryman. The act of escaping from the corporate lifestyle is known as datsusara. A vivid portrait {{of this can be}} found in the 2002 Takeshi Kitano film, Dolls.|$|E
25|$|Boys are <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> state {{they have}} {{negative}} feelings about sex than girls when they describe their sexual self-schemas.

Boys who are sexually schematic are more sexually experienced, {{have higher levels of}} sexual arousal, and are more able to experience romantic feelings. Boys who are not schematic have fewer sexual partners, a smaller range of sexual experiences and are much less likely than schematic men to be in a romantic relationship.|$|E
25|$|In most poorer countries, health care—ranging {{from basic}} {{pharmaceuticals}} and postnatal care to costly multidrug therapies—remains very limited. Market forces drive private pharmaceutical companies, and many developed country government research programs, {{to focus on}} drugs needed in their environment, not necessarily those of the poorer countries. This is generating a growing controversy between rich and poorer nations over such issues as intellectual property rights, as some developing countries make their own copies, not always with permission, of drugs under patent protection. Developing countries also are <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make microbial samples available to companies that will make commercial vaccines from them, which may be too costly for the country that provided the sample.|$|E

It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet.

25|$|Males {{who are in}} a {{committed}} relationship, in other words have a restricted sociosexual orientation, will have different sexual strategies compared to males who have an unrestricted sociosexual orientation. Males with a restricted sociosexual orientation will be <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> have sex outside of their committed relationship, and adjust their strategies according to their desire for commitment and emotional closeness with their partner. It has been found that such males are less likely to approach attractive females who have greater waist-to-hip ratios (0.68-0.72). It has been found that a greater waist-to-hip ratio, the ideal being 0.7, is associated with youthfulness, physical attractiveness and reproductive potential. Therefore, such females would be viewed as a risk to the male’s current sexual partner. Consequently, males will adjust their sexual strategies by showing less willingness to approach such females.|$|E
25|$|Women {{artists have}} also been at the {{forefront}} of the hip hop movement since its inception in the Bronx. Nevertheless, as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music, there were many songs with misogynistic (anti-women) lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion. The negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music. The recording industry is <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> back female artists than their male counterparts, and when it does back them, often it places emphasis on their sexuality over their musical substance and artistic abilities. Since the turn of the century (the beginning of the 2000s decade), female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention, with only a few, such as older artists like the female duo Salt N' Pepa to more contemporary ones like Lil' Kim and Nicki Minaj, reaching platinum status.|$|E
