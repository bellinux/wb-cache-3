In the lead-up to the Test, Meckiff was the centre of media attention, and one report described him as cricket's [...] "bogey man". The South Africans were reportedly stunned by Meckiff's selection, giving the impression that they considered him an illegitimate bowler. Reaction in England was also hostile, ahead of Australia's forthcoming tour in the English summer of 1964.

[...] Sullivan's only wholly serious opera, Ivanhoe (1891), received generally favourable reviews, although J. A.

2500|$|The only {{exceptions}} were ballad operas, such as John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (1728), musical burlesques, European operettas, {{and late}} Victorian era light operas, notably the Savoy Operas of W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, {{all of which}} types of musical entertainments frequently spoofed operatic conventions. Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, Ivanhoe (following the efforts {{of a number of}} young English composers beginning about 1876), but he claimed that even his light operas constituted part of a school of [...] "English" [...] opera, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually performed in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage from the mid-19th century into the 1870s.

2500|$|Among the composers whom Grove {{sought to}} popularise was Schubert, whose music was largely {{neglected}} in England. Grove and Manns presented the first performance in England of the Great C major Symphony. Together {{with his friend}} Arthur Sullivan, Grove went to Vienna in 1867 in search of Schubert manuscripts. They found and copied several, and were particularly excited about their final discovery, which Grove described thus: [...] "I found, {{at the bottom of}} the cupboard, and in its farthest corner, a bundle of music-books two feet high, carefully tied round, and black with the undisturbed dust of nearly half-a-century. … These were the part-books of the whole of the music in Rosamunde, tied up after the second performance in December, 1823, and probably never disturbed since. Dr. Schneider [...] must have been amused at our excitement; but <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>hope</b> that he recollected his own days of rapture; at any rate, he kindly overlooked it, and gave us permission to take away with us and copy what we wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Robert Craft, Stravinsky {{remained}} a confirmed monarchist {{throughout his life}} and loathed the Bolsheviks from the very beginning. In 1930, he remarked, [...] "I don't believe that anyone venerates Mussolini more than I ... I know many exalted personages, and my artist's mind does not shrink from political and social issues. Well, after having seen so many events and so many more or less representative men, I have an overpowering urge to render homage to your Duce. He is the saviour of Italy and – <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>hope</b> – Europe". Later, after a private audience with Mussolini, he added, [...] "Unless my ears deceive me, the voice of Rome {{is the voice of}} Il Duce. I told him that I felt like a fascist myself... In spite of being extremely busy, Mussolini did me the great honour of conversing with me for three-quarters of an hour. We talked about music, art and politics". When the Nazis placed Stravinsky's works on the list of [...] "Entartete Musik", he lodged a formal appeal to establish his Russian genealogy and declared, [...] "I loathe all communism, Marxism, the execrable Soviet monster, and also all liberalism, democratism, atheism, etc." [...] Towards the end of his life, at Craft's behest, Stravinsky made a return visit to his native country and composed a cantata in Hebrew, travelling to Israel for its performance.|$|E
