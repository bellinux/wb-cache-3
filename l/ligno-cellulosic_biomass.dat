Torrefaction is an interesting process used {{to improve the quality}} of <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomasses</b> and to achieve standardisation. In the present study torrefaction has been employed on residues and by-products deriving from sunflower production chain, in particular sunflower stalks and oil press cake. The thermal behaviour of materials has been studied at first by thermo-gravimetric analysis in order to identify torrefaction temperatures range. Different residence time and torrefaction temperatures have been employed in a bench top torrefaction reactor afterwards. Analyses of raw and torrefied materials have been carried out to assess the influence of the process. As a consequence of torrefaction, the carbon and ash contents increase while the volatilisation range is reduced making the material more stable and standardised. Mass yield, energy yield and energy densification reach values of about 60 %, 80 % and 1. 33 for sunflower stalks and 64 %, 85 % and 1. 33 for sunflower oil press cake respectively. As highlighted by results, torrefaction is more interesting for sunflower stalks than oil cake and husks because of the different starting characteristics. Untreated oil cake and husks already show a good high heating value and the eventual torrefaction should be mild.

This can be achieved only if development of efficient technology for second generation biofuel from ligno-cellulosic sources is feasible. To be successful in this area, development of a widely available, renewable, cost-effective <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> feedstock {{that can be easily}} and efficiently converted biochemically by bacteria or other fast-growing organisms is required. Moreover, if the biofuel type is butanol, then the existing infrastructure to deliver fuel to the customer can be used without additional costs and retrofits. The Claflin Biofuel Initiative project is focused on helping the US meet the above-mentioned targets. With support from this grant, Claflin University (CU) scientists have created over 50 new strains of microorganisms that are producing butanol from complex carbohydrates and cellulosic compounds. Laboratory analysis shows that a number of these strains are producing higher percentages of butanol than other methods currently in use. All of these recombinant bacterial strains are producing relatively high concentrations of acetone and numerous other byproducts as well. Therefore, we are carrying out intense mutations in the selected strains to reduce undesirable byproducts and increase the desired butanol production to further maximize the yield of butanol. We are testing the proof of concept of producing pre-industrial large scale biobutanol production by utilizing modifications of currently commercially available fermentation technology and instrumentation. We have already developed an initial process flow diagram (PFD) and selected a site for a biobutanol pilot scale facility in Orangeburg, SC.

The main improvements are firstly that our study shows how these biomass potentials from forests are spatially distributed across the European continent, thereby providing insights into which European regions could increase the supply of woody biomass from forests and could be a focus of targeted policies. Secondly, we collected and used updated forest resource information for eight countries. Such updates are important as several European countries are improving their forest inventory methods (e.g., by moving from stand-wise inventories to statistical inventories) (Tomppo et al. 2010) and are harmonising important parameters to enhance the comparability of forest resource information between countries (Alberdi et al. 2016; Fischer et al. 2016).

Leaf osmotic adjustment was primarily achieved by inorganic solutes (K+ and Na+) while soluble sugars and proline remained unchanged. Higher K+ selectivity and Na+ exclusion from shoots improved photosynthesis and growth under moderately saline conditions.

Commercial pruning residue harvesters are now available, which may allow cost-effective recovery. The study aimed at determining the quantity and the quality of pruning residues potentially derived from vineyard management. Data were obtained from 17 fields in Northern and Central Italy. Fields were harvested with seven different machines. The experimental design adapted to the necessities of field trials, but was adequate for testing the main sources of variability. Net residue yield varies around 1 oven dry tonne per hectare, with minor differences between grape varietals and harvesting technologies. Losses are still high, and are generally related to ineffective management techniques. Moisture content at harvest varies between 40 % and 45 %, whereas the higher heating value is slightly lower than that of forest fuels. Comminuted vineyard residues are unsuitable for firing residential boilers, due to the frequent presence of oversize and/or undersize particles.

Our aims were to: (1) quantify non-structural carbohydrates (NSC), (2) observe the timing of seasonal shifts in the stems and rhizome, and (3) identify developmental and/or climatic conditions that promoted carbohydrate remobilization from the stems to the rhizome during senescence. Two genotypes of Miscanthus sinensis, a Miscanthus sacchariflorus and a Miscanthus ? giganteus were grown at replicated field sites in Aberystwyth, West Wales and Harpenden, South East England. NSC were quantified from the rhizome and aboveground organs and then correlated with climatic data collected from on-site weather stations.

40|$|Bio-fuel {{production}} from {{renewable energy sources}} is the topic that have been studied by scientists and discussed in a political agenda {{for a couple of}} decades. In this period of time, however, it was discovered that approaches and technologies used until present for the production of bio-fuels (e. g. bio-ethanol and bio-diesel) are not as sustainable as they were reported in the beginning of their invention. The production of so-called 1 st generation bio-fuels, such as bio-ethanol from wheat, directly compete with food sector, producing sustainable transport fuels on one hand {{and on the other hand}} considerably endangering food sector. Recently, this problem was understood by scientists and novel possibilities were discovered for the production of next generation (2 nd generation) bio-fuels with the use of non food biomass (such as wood, leaves, straw) as a feedstock. Py-rolysis is often mentioned in scientific literature as a potential technology for the pro-duction of 2 nd generation bio-fuels. However, until present biomass pyrolysis was per-formed only on the laboratory scale leaving a significant gap and necessity for further scientific researches. This study focused on the assessment of biomass pyrolysis as an alternative process for the production of 2 nd generation bio-fuels, giving pyrolysis a position among existing biomass-to-energy production techniques and evaluating the entire concept of 2 nd gen-eration bio-fuels from energy and land use perspectives. The first part of this report represented a literature study, giving the main insights and description of pyrolysis process and its products, which are bio-oil, bio-char and syngas. Forty scientific publications on different biomass types, which are considered as a po-tential source for 2 nd bio-fuel production via pyrolysis, were studied in terms of this re-search. Main parameters and thermal decomposition behaviour of these biomass types indicated that biomass with low lignin content (e. g. wood and straw) is more favourable for bio-fuel production than with high lignin content (e. g. pressed shells and seeds of the plants). Several pyrolysis operation conditions and their variations were also inves-tigated in this study in order to estimate the optimal ones that would lead to maximised production of a particular pyrolysis product. It was found that temperature and biomass heating rate (how fast biomass is heated) have a mayor influence on the pyrolysis prod-uct formation and their final yields. The second part of this study included a variety of scenarios considering the utilisation of particular biomass types (wood and wheat straw) for transport fuel versus energy production purposes. Each scenario was evaluated from energy and land use efficiency perspectives. This evaluation was performed on several bases (1 kg base and 1 ha base), depending on biomass availability. The results from different scenarios showed, that from energy perspective it is more efficient to use biomass as a potential energy source rather for 2 nd generation bio-fuel production via pyrolysis. When deciding to grow <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> for transport fuel production it was found that as soon as high biomass production yields are involved, food versus fuel competition remains. In this case this competition is not be direct, as no food source being used for bio-fuel produc-tion, but it shifts to it’s indirect form, involving good quality soil competition. The gen-eral analysis of the results obtained in this research also showed that production of 2 nd generation bio-fuels from <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> using pyrolysis process is less fa-vourable than production of 1 st generation bio-fuels, from energy efficiency (energy content in produced bio-fuels), land use and food versus fuel competition perspectives. ...|$|E

The combination of decentralized fast pyrolysis of biomass to produce bio-oil, followed by transportation and gasification of bio-oil in bio-refinery has appeared {{as one of the}} most economically viable methods for syngas (H 2 +CO) production. The objective of this work is to bridge the lack of knowledge concerning the physicochemical transformation of bio-oil into syngas using non catalytic steam gasification in entrained flow reactors. This complex process involves vaporization, thermal cracking reactions with formation of gas, tars and two solid residues - char and soot - that are considered as undesirable products. This is followed by steam reforming of gas and tars, together with char and soot conversion. To better understand the process, the first step of gasification (pyrolysis) and thereafter the whole process (pyrolysis + gasification) were studied. The pyrolysis study focused on the influence of the heating rate, the final pyrolysis temperature and the ash content of bio-oil on char, tars and gas yields. At the higher heating rate char yield is smaller than 1 %. In addition, ash seems to promote polymerization reactions and causes a decrease of gas yield. Concerning gasification, the effect of temperature on syngas yield and composition was studied. An increase in the reaction temperature implies higher hydrogen yield and higher solid carbon conversion. A thermodynamic equilibrium calculation showed that equilibrium was reached at 1400 °C. Finally, the soot formation and oxidation mechanisms were investigated through experiments in three different atmospheres: inert (pyrolysis), rich in steam (gasification) and in the presence of oxygen (partial oxidation). A semi-empirical model was proposed and validated. It is based on detailed chemistry to describe gas phase reactions, a single reaction using C 2 H 2 concentration to describe soot formation and one main heterogeneous reaction to describe soot oxidation...|$|E

Several heterogeneous metal catalysts Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, and Ni supported on alumina were tested for their gasification efficiency (GE). The GE for the metals is decreasing in the order Ru > Pt > Rh ∼ Pd > Ni. For optimum H 2 selectivity {{the order of the}} catalysts is Pd > Ru ∼ Rh > Pt > Ni. Pd catalysts with different supports have been screened and no significant changes in the GE were found for the different supports. However, the composition of the product gas differed significantly with the support type. High H 2 selectivity was obtained with Al 2 O 3 and Ce–ZrO 2 supports. With increasing the organic concentration from 5 to 50 wt% the GE as well as the H 2 and CO 2 selectivities dropped significantly. High reaction temperatures, long residence time, low feed stock concentrations and high catalyst loadings favored the high carbon to gas conversion. The aqueous wastes streams obtained from the hydrodeoxygenation process for the pyrolysis oil are easier to reform in supercritical in comparison to the feedstocks obtained directly as pyrolysis condenser fraction or as phase-separated aqueous fraction. Complete conversion of the made-up and the fast pyrolysis condenser fraction was obtained at low feed concentrations (5 wt%) using a continuous flow reactor in the presence of Ru/Ce–ZrO 2 catalyst. However, the catalyst quickly deactivated with the made-up fraction but the same catalyst retained its stability and activity with the pyrolysis condenser fraction during the 3 h test run. The supercritical water gasification seems therefore a very suitable step for treating the aqueous phase obtained after hydrotreatment of pyrolysis oil in a (biomass) refinery concept...|$|E

In this context, a "second generation" biofuels production, aiming at utilizing the whole plant, including ligno-cellulosic (hemicelluloses, cellulose, lignin) fractions (Ogier et al., 1999) that are not used for human food, would allow the reduction of the drawbacks of bioethanol production (Schoeling, 2007).

Cellulose enzymatically hydrolysed in seawater and salt-assisted organic-acid catalysed cellulose were investigated as substrates. Lastly, hydrolysed hemicellulose from fractionated beech wood was applied as substrate. Results U. maydis was characterized on shake flask level regarding its itaconic acid production on glucose. Nitrogen limitation was shown to be a crucial condition for the production of itaconic acid. For itaconic acid concentrations above 25 g/L, a significant product inhibition was observed. Performing experiments that simulated influences of possible pretreatment methods, U. maydis was only slightly affected by high osmolarities up to 3. 5 osmol/L as well as of 0. 1 M oxalic acid. The production of itaconic acid was achieved on pretreated cellulose in seawater and on the hydrolysed hemicellulosic fraction of pretreated beech wood. Conclusion The fungus U. maydis is a promising producer of itaconic acid, since it grows as single cells (yeast-like) in submerged cultivations and it is extremely robust in high osmotic media and real seawater. Moreover, U. maydis can grow on the hemicellulosic fraction of pretreated beech wood. Thereby, this fungus combines important advantages of yeasts and filamentous fungi. Nevertheless, the biomass pretreatment does indeed affect the subsequent itaconic acid production. Although U. maydis is insusceptible to most possible impurities from pretreatment, high amounts of salts or residues of organic acids can slow microbial growth and decrease the production. Consequently, the pretreatment step needs to fit the prerequisites defined by the actual microorganisms applied for fermentation. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays, <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> is {{considered}} as a renewable carbon resource. It represents a relevant alternative to reduce greenhouse gases emissions. During last decades, many scientists and industrials {{have been interested in}} thermochemical conversion of biomass such as gasification. In order to accurately model the gasifiers, it is important to study the implied thermochemical phenomena (such as pyrolysis), through dedicated experiments close to the industrial conditions. This communication presents the model developed by LRGP to describe primary pyrolysis in bubbling fluidized beds conditions, one of the major technologies used for biomass gasification. The novelties of this proposed model are the coarse description of the 3 main products (gas, vapours, char) and the conservation of the 3 main biomass elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen. The work is part of the Gaya project, led by GDF Suez and funded by ADEME. Gaya project will contribute to develop a new gasification demonstration platform in Europe for SNG production. The experimental setup used to adjust the pyrolysis model is a vertical image furnace [Christodoulou & al 2012]. The principle is to concentrate the radiation of a xenon arc lamp on a biomass sample. The lamp is settled at the first focus of an elliptical mirror. The light beams are concentrated at the second focus where the biomass sample is placed inside a transparent reactor. In order to prevent any gas-phase secondary reactions, the volatile matter (vapours and gases) released during the reaction is quenched by a controlled flow of nitrogen at room temperature. During a flash time, the temperature evolution is measured by pyrometry on both sides. As soon as the light beams are switched off, all the pyrolysis products can be recovered, allowing achieving complete mass balances. Gases are collected in a sampling bag, liquids are condensed and aerosols are trapped in a filter. The solid residue remains on the sample holder in the reactor. All these products are analysed off-line. The heat flux density applied to the biomass can reach 650 kW m - 2. This is the maximum value encountered by wood particles surrounded by hot bed particles in fluidized bed gasifier. The heat flux density is decreased over time in order to reproduce the thermal story of a wood particle injected inside a fluidized bed...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. The increasing worldwide use of bio-fuels constitutes one of the measures considered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Bio-fuels also have an important part to play in promoting the security of energy supply, and promoting technological development and innovation. Di-butyl ether (DBE) is used as blending agent in reformulated gasoline and has been included in recent international regulations on {{the promotion of the}} use of energy from renewable sources for transport. The DBE is a non-polluting, high octane number blending agent. DBE could be also used as cetane enhancer in bio-diesel fuel, and can be obtained as an added valued additive to second generation bio-fuels. Second generation bio-fuels could be obtained from <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> and waste materials. Ether + alkane mixtures are of interest as model mixtures for gasoline in which the ether act as renewable, high octane number blending agent. From this point of view the study of the binary mixtures dibutyl ether + heptane, are very interesting. Heptane has been chosen {{as a representative of the}} linear alkanes that contain real gasoline. Density of the binary mixtures DBE + heptane and its pure compounds have been measured under pressure and reported in this work using a vibrating tube densitometer. Accurate PVT properties of pure ethers and its mixtures are required to develop and test equations of state, because equations of state are critical to design storage and transport systems in the fuel industry. Moreover, high temperature and pressure data serve to validate equations of state which are reliable for the increasingly use of industrial and engine processes under hard conditions. Experimental densities (826 points) for the compressed liquid phase of the binary systems DBE + heptane have been measured at 298. 15, 313. 15, 333. 15, 353. 15, 373. 15 and 393. 15 K and at pressures up to 140 MPa, with an absolute uncertainty of 0. 7 kg·m- 3. For each composition, the experimental values were correlated using a Tait-type equation. Results show non-linear behaviour of the mixture. dc 201...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{possible}} process options {{for the production of}} advanced biofuels is the co-processing of upgraded pyrolysis oil in standard refineries. The applicability of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) was studied as a pyrolysis oil upgrading step to allow FCC co-processing. Different HDO reaction end temperatures (230 – 340 °C) were evaluated in a 5 L autoclave, keeping the other process conditions constant (total 290 bar, 5 wt. % Ru/C catalyst), in order to find the required oil product properties necessary for successful FCC co-processing (miscibility with FCC feed and good yield structure: little gas/coke make and good boiling range liquid yields). After HDO, the upgraded pyrolysis oil underwent phase separation resulting in an aqueous phase, some gases (mainly CO 2 and CH 4), and an oil phase that was further processed in a Micro-Activity Test (MAT) reactor (simulated FCC reactor). Although the oil and aqueous phase yields remained approximately constant when the HDO reaction temperature was increased, a net transfer of organic components (probably hydrodeoxygenated sugars) from the aqueous phase to the oil phase was observed, increasing the carbon recovery in the oil product (up to 70 wt. % of the carbon in pyrolysis oil). The upgraded oils were subsequently tested in a lab scale catalytic cracking unit (MAT reactor), assessing the suitability of HDO oils to be used as FCC feed. In spite of the relatively high oxygen content (from 17 to 28 wt. %, on dry basis) and the different properties of the HDO oils, they all could be successfully dissolved in and co-processed (20 wt. %) with a Long Residue, yielding near normal FCC gasoline (44 – 46 wt. %) and Light Cycle Oil (23 – 25 wt. %) products without an excessive increase of undesired coke and dry gas, as compared to the base feed only. Near oxygenate-free bio-hydrocarbons were obtained, probably via hydrogen transfer from the Long Residue. In this way, we have demonstrated on a laboratory scale {{that it is possible to}} produce hydrocarbons from <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> via a pyrolysis oil upgrading route. The much higher coke yields obtained from the catalytic cracking of undiluted HDO oil showed the importance of co-processing using a refinery feed as a diluent and hydrogen transfer source...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{designated}} as a bioenergy crop, Sorghum is rather unique as it can produce large quantities of cellulose or sugar {{which can be used}} to produce advanced biofuels or compounds. Sweet sorghum contains high levels of sugars and biomass sorghums consist primarily of <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass.</b> Improvement of both sorghum types is essential for maximizing production and conversion efficiency. Photoperiod sensitive sorghum is thought to maximize biomass production yet maturity influence on biomass production and composition is not fully understood. Utilizing sorghum for sugar production has increased efforts to develop sweet sorghums with sugar yields similar to sugarcane. Hybridization of these species has been investigated with, until recently, little success. Testing newly developed intergeneric hybrids and improvement of parents used in their creation will determine their feasibility and improve hybrid performance. Objectives of this research are multifaceted. First, analyze photoperiod sensitive sorghum in varying day length environments to determine maturity effects on plant phenotype, composition, and QTL detection. Second, analyze intergeneric sorghum ? sugarcane hybrids to determine agronomic performance in relation to sugarcane. Lastly, introgress the iap allele into sweet sorghum females for use in intergeneric hybrid creation. Photoperiod sensitive sorghum RILs were evaluated in College Station and Weslaco, Texas and Puerto Rico which caused differential expression of plant maturity. Genetic control of trait expression was high for each location. Results indicate gradual induction of plant maturity increases detection of phenotypic QTL and detection of compositional QTL increases when maturity effects on plant phenotype are reduced. Intergeneric sorghum ? sugarcane F_ 1 hybrids were compared to sugarcane in Weslaco, Texas in 2011. Each hybrid expressed agronomic traits similar or better than that of the sugarcane variety. High levels of repeatability and genetic influence on trait expression were observed. Overall performance of the sugarcane variety was better than any individual hybrid tested. Introgression of iap into sweet sorghum was successful and generated seventeen new sweet sorghum female genotypes possessing the allele. Only two genotypes exhibited higher brix readings and both were later maturing than Tx 3361. Height and maturity of all developed genotypes varied and desirability of developed lines was similar to Tx 3361...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays, <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> is {{considered}} as a renewable carbon resource. It represents a relevant alternative to reduce greenhouse gases emissions. Last decades, many scientists and industrials {{have been interested in}} thermochemical conversion of biomass such as gasification. In order to model these reactors, it is important to observe thermochemical phenomena, through dedicated experiments close to the industrial conditions. Accordingly, it is interesting to study the pyrolysis step, notably in conditions representative of fluidized bed, one of the major technologies to gasify biomass. The aim of this communication is to present and compare the new vertical image furnace realized by LRGP and four other fast pyrolysis setups: wire mesh reactor [1], free fall reactor [2], radiant furnace [3] and other image furnaces [4, 5]. The vertical image furnace is based on the former horizontal setup which has been described in details in previous works [4, 6]. The principle is to concentrate the radiation of a 5 kW xenon arc lamp on a biomass sample. The lamp is settled at the first focus of an elliptical mirror. The light beams are concentrated at the second focus where the biomass sample is placed inside a cylindrical reactor. A controlled flow of nitrogen at ambient temperature sweeps this reactor to quench vapours and prevent any gas-phase reactions. The radiant flux applied to the biomass can reach 800 kW. m -². This is the maximum heat flux encountered by a solid fuel injected inside a fluidized bed [6]. During pyrolysis, gases are collected in a sampling bag, liquids are condensed in a cold bath (T = 223 K) and aerosols are filtered. The solid residue is remained in the reactor. As soon as the light beams are switched off, the different products could be recovered, weighted and analysed (CHON, Karl Fischer, GC and HPLC). The main innovations of this setup are the heat flux modulation over time to reproduce fluidized bed conditions, the pyrometric temperature measurement and the vertical orientation of the concentrated beams. This feature allows studying very thin samples of wood pieces which are pyrolysed in chemical regime, but also other kind of biomass (powders and liquids). The comparison of this new setup with other fast pyrolysis lab reactors focuses on technical features: maximum temperature, heating rate, pressure, solid residence time, gas-phase conditions (temperature and residence time), type of biomass sample and its dimensions. This comparison allows evaluating advantages and drawbacks of this vertical image furnace setup. References [1] E.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{thermophilic}} microbial host {{systems for the}} production of bio-products has increased over the years due to the inadequacy of the currently available mesophilic systems. However, genetic tools for studying thermophilic organisms are sparingly available. This study evaluated the potential of S. acidocaldarius, a hyperthermophilic archaea, as a platform for metabolic engineering, especially cellulosic biofuels. Bioconversion of <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> into biofuels involves the use of a wide array of thermophilic enzymes such as endo-glucanases and &# 946;-glycosidase, most of which are not properly expressed in E. coli and S. cerevisiae. S. acidocaldarius grows optimally at 75 - 80 oC and pH 2 - 3. This organism utilizes most cellulosic sugars with the exception of cellobiose. The dissertation reports the absence of glucose-induced diauxie during consumption of multiple cellulosic sugars such as arabinose and xylose as co-carbon sources. The organism utilized combinations of 1 g/L each of glucose and xylose simultaneously with a specific growth rate of 0. 079 h - 1. The organism did not show preference to glucose or any of the sugars tested. However, the organism grew faster on 2 g/L xylose (0. 074 h - 1) than on equal amount of glucose (0. 022 h - 1). The consumption of most cellulosic sugars by this organism makes it a potential candidate for cellulosic bio-products engineering. During growth on multiple sugars, the organism consumed each sugar at a rate that was roughly proportional to its concentration in the growth medium. The mechanism of this novel regulation is not fully understood and is currently being investigated. This study also focused on developing reliable genetic tools such as recipient strains with selectable traits and effective plasmid system to achieve the goal of making this organism a potent platform for metabolic engineering. A number of pRN 1 -based shuttle vectors were developed for heterologous expression in S. acidocaldarius. The role of a 241 -bp region downstream of the orf 904 as the putative origin of replication of pRN 1 was also investigated. The results indicated that orf 56, orf 904 and the putative origin were the minimum replicon of pRN 1. A 100 -bp stem-loop structure within this putative origin was proposed to be the double-strand origin of replication of the plasmid. The impact of a functional &# 946;-glycosidase on cellobiose metabolism in S. acidocaldarius was evaluated by inserting lacS from S. solfataricus into the chromosome of the organism. The gene (lacS) established &# 946;-glycosidase activity in vivo but did not establish cellobiose metabolism, suggesting that S. acidocaldarius lacks a transporter for cellobiose. Overall, this study enhanced our knowledge of sugar metabolism in S. acidocaldarius and highlighted the development of genetic tools and strategy for utilizing the organism as a platform for metabolic engineering...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{population}} on earth along with diminishing fossil deposits and {{the climate change}} debate calls out for a better utilization of renewable, bio-based materials. In a biorefinery perspective, the renewable biomass is converted into many different products such as fuels, chemicals, and materials, quite similar to the petroleum refinery industry. Since forests cover about {{one third of the}} land surface on earth, <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> is the most abundant renewable resource available. The natural first step in a biorefinery is separation and isolation of the different compounds the biomass is comprised of. The major components in wood are cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, all of which can be made into various end-products. Today, focus normally lies on utilizing only one component, e. g., the cellulose in the Kraft pulping process. It would be highly desirable to utilize all the different compounds, both from an economical and environmental point of view. The separation process should therefore be optimized. Hemicelluloses can partly be extracted with hot-water prior to pulping. Depending in the severity of the extraction, the hemicelluloses are degraded to various degrees. In {{order to be able to}} choose from a variety of different end-products, the hemicelluloses should be as intact as possible after the extraction. The main focus of this work has been on preserving the hemicellulose molar mass throughout the extraction at a high yield by actively controlling the extraction pH at the high temperatures used. Since it has not been possible to measure pH during an extraction due to the high temperatures, the extraction pH has remained a “black box”. Therefore, a high-temperature in-line pH measuring system was developed, validated, and tested for hot-water wood extractions. One crucial step in the measurements is calibration, therefore extensive efforts was put on developing a reliable calibration procedure. Initial extractions with wood showed that the actual extraction pH was ~ 0. 35 pH units higher than previously believed. The measuring system was also equipped with a controller connected to a pump. With this addition it was possible to control the extraction to any desired pH set point. When the pH dropped below the set point, the controller started pumping in alkali and by that the desired set point was maintained very accurately. Analyses of the extracted hemicelluloses showed that less hemicelluloses were extracted at higher pH but with a higher molar-mass. Monomer formation could, at a certain pH level, be completely inhibited. Increasing the temperature, but maintaining a specific pH set point, would speed up the extraction without degrading the molar-mass of the hemicelluloses and thereby intensifying the extraction. The diffusion of the dissolved hemicelluloses from the wood particle is a major part of the extraction process. Therefore, a particle size study ranging from 0. 5 mm wood particles to industrial size wood chips was conducted to investigate the internal mass transfer of the hemicelluloses. Unsurprisingly, it showed that hemicelluloses were extracted faster from smaller wood particles than larger although it did not seem to have a substantial effect on the average molar mass of the extracted hemicelluloses. However, smaller particle sizes require more energy to manufacture and thus increases the economic cost. Since bark comprises 10 – 15 % of a tree, it is important to also consider it in a biorefinery concept. Spruce inner and outer bark was hot-water extracted separately to investigate the possibility to isolate the bark hemicelluloses. It was showed that the bark hemicelluloses comprised mostly of pectic material and differed considerably from the wood hemicelluloses. The bark hemicelluloses, or pectins, could be extracted at lower temperatures than the wood hemicelluloses. A chemical characterization, done separately on inner and outer bark, showed that inner bark contained over 10 % stilbene glucosides that could be extracted already at 100 °C with aqueous acetone...|$|E
40|$|In the {{following}} decades, biomass will {{play an important}} role among the other renewable energy sources globally as it is already the fourth largest energy resource after coal, oil and natural gas. It is possible to obtain gaseous, liquid or solid biofuels from biomass via thermochemical or biochemical conversion routes. Among them, gasification {{is one of the most}} favorable options as the products can serve all types of energy markets: heat, electricity and transportation. Conventional gasification is an excellent method for dry <b>ligno-cellulosic</b> <b>biomass</b> feedstocks. However, in case of wet biomass with a high moisture content, it results in a negative impact on the energy efficiency of the gasification process due to the fact that drying costs more energy than the energy content of the product for some very wet biomass types. An alternative method applied for the conversion of wet biomass such as sewage sludge, cattle manure and food industry waste is anaerobic digestion. This process is however characterized by a slow reaction rate and typical residence times are almost 2 – 4 weeks. Besides, the fermentation sludge and wastewater from the reactors should further be treated. The supercritical water gasification (SCWG) process is an alternative to both conventional gasification as well as the anaerobic digestion processes for conversion of wet biomass. This process does not require drying and the process takes place at much shorter residence times; a few minutes at most. Supercritical water gasification is therefore considered to be a promising technology for the efficient conversion of wet biomass into a product gas that after upgrading can be used as substitute natural gas. The main reason why supercritical water gasification is a promising technology is due to the favorable thermo-physical properties of water and the way they change in the supercritical region which causes water to act as a solvent as well as a catalyst. Furthermore, through hydrolysis reactions, water also acts as a reactant. Gasification of biomass is mainly influenced by the density, viscosity and dielectric constant of water. Above the critical point, physical properties of water drastically change and water behaves as a homogeneous fluid phase. In its supercritical state, water has a gas-like viscosity and liquid-like density, two properties which enhance mass transfer and solvation properties, respectively. Besides, when water enters its supercritical phase, the dielectric constant drastically decreases. Water thus starts to behave like an organic, non-polar solvent which results in poor solubility for inorganics, and complete miscibility with gases and many hydrocarbons. Due to its miscibility, phase boundaries do not exist any-more. This absence leads to fast and complete homogeneous reactions of water with organic compounds. This dissertation focuses on the three aspects of SCWG of biomass systems: i) thermodynamic equilibrium modeling, ii) experimental approaches and iii) process modeling. In Chapter 2, the state of the art of the supercritical water gasification technology starting from the thermophysical properties of water and the chemistry of reactions to previous studies on modeling and experimental approaches, and the process challenges of such a biomass based supercritical water gasification plant is presented. In Chapter 3, the thermodynamic equilibrium modeling of SCWG of biomass is presented in two sub-chapters. In the first sub-chapter, commercial software packages are dealt with to model the gasification process of a pig–cow manure mixture in supercritical water. The phase and compound behavior of elements, behavior of gas products and water are investigated. Besides, the influence of pressure and dry biomass concentration on the gas yields are reported. In the second sub-chapter, a multi–phase thermodynamic equilibrium model is described. The model is validated by comparing the predictions with the various experimental results. A case study concerning microalgae gasification in supercritical water was performed. The phase and compound behavior of elements and behavior of gas products are investigated. Additionally, the influence of pressure and dry biomass concentration on the gas yields as well as the phase behavior of elements are studied and reported. In Chapter 4, constrained equilibrium model is tested for SCWG of biomass systems in order to model systems which do not reach to their thermodynamic equilibrium state. Additional constraints are introduced into the developed multi–phase thermodynamic equilibrium model, which is described in Chapter 3, and the importance of the additional constraints are tested by comparing the predictions of the model with the experimental results available in the literature. In Chapter 5, the experimental methods used in this work are described. A new and novel type of experimental setup which incorporates a fluidized bed reactor is designed with and manufactured by Gensos B. V. The setup has a capacity of 50 l/h and allows for clogging-free conditions for the experiments. In Chapter 6, the results of the experiments for starch are given. The influence of reactor temperature and feed flow rate are investigated. The results include not only the gas composition but also the temperature profile along different process units and the velocity profile along the reactor for different process conditions. The observed process challenges are also reported in this chapter. In Chapter 7, process modeling of SCWG of biomass is presented in two sub-chapters. In the first sub-chapter, SCWG of biomass process is modeled with an assumption of partial conversion in the pre-heater and a thermodynamic equilibrium in the reactor. Constrained equilibrium modeling, described in Chapter 4, is used to model pre-heater and the multi-phase thermodynamic equilibrium model described in Chapter 3, was used to model the reactor. The influence of the inorganic content of the biomass on the final products and thermal behavior of the process is investigated and the results are reported in detail. In the second sub-chapter, based on the existing literature data, an integrated kinetic model consisting of decomposition and gasification reactions of cellulose, hemi-cellulose, lignin and protein is developed for the modeling of pre-heater and reactor of such a SCWG of biomass plant. The influence of biomass feedstock type, temperature and reactor residence time is investigated and the results are reported in detail.
