6000|$|Even as a boy, I had the fancy, the wish, {{to write}} a piece, perhaps a poem, about the sea-shore--that suggesting, {{dividing}} <b>line,</b> <b>contact,</b> junction, the solid marrying the liquid--that curious, lurking something, (as doubtless every objective form finally becomes to the subjective spirit,) which means far more than its mere first sight, grand as that is--blending the real and ideal, and each made portion of the other. Hours, days, in my Long Island youth and early manhood, I haunted the shores of Rockaway or Coney island, or away east to the Hamptons or Montauk. Once, at the latter place, (by the old lighthouse, nothing but sea-tossings in sight in every direction {{as far as the}} eye could reach,) I remember well, I felt that I must one day write a book expressing this liquid, mystic theme. Afterward, I recollect, how it came to me that instead of any special lyrical or epical or literary attempt, the sea-shore should be an invisible influence, a pervading gauge and tally for me, in my composition. (Let me give a hint here to young writers. I am not sure but I have unwittingly follow'd out the same rule with other powers besides sea and shores--avoiding them, in the way of any dead set at poetizing them, as too big for formal handling--quite satisfied if I could indirectly show that we have met and fused, even if only once, but enough--that we have really absorb'd each other and understand each other.) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a mixed lubrication {{model in}} order to predict the Stribeck curve for starved lubricated <b>line</b> <b>contacts.</b> This model {{is based on a}} combination of the contact model of Greenwood and Williamson and the elastohydrodynamic (EHL) film thickness for starved <b>line</b> <b>contacts.</b> The starved solution to be implemented in the EHL component is obtained by using numerical data of Wolveridge, who computed the starved film thickness for smooth <b>line</b> <b>contacts.</b> Calculations are presented for different oil supply layer thickness over roughness values (hoil/s). For values of the oil layer thickness over roughness ratio larger than approximately 6, the Stribeck curve and separation between the rough surfaces do not change compared to the fully flooded situation. If the oil layer thickness over roughness ratio is in the range of 6 down to 0. 7, friction starts to increase and the film thickness decreases. When the oil layer thickness over roughness ratio is less than approximately 0. 7, the Stribeck curve tends to transform into a straight line and separation stays at the same value as in the boundary lubrication regime. Comparison between measurements and calculations is made and a good agreement is found...|$|R

The movement near the moving <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> is modelled by a slip condition, the value of the dynamic contact angle is determined by a linear model, and the local forces are introduced at the moving <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> based on a relationship of moving contact angle and <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> speed.
