5|$|After Lee's surrender, {{a public}} meeting {{was held in}} Shreveport, Louisiana, at which many {{speakers}} supported continuation of the war. Plans were developed for the Davis government to flee to Havana, Cuba. There, the <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> regroup and head to the Confederate-controlled Trans-Mississippi area {{by way of the}} Rio Grande. None of these plans was put into practice.|$|E
5|$|During 1987, {{relations}} improved steadily, with U.S. military inspectors {{present at}} Soviet military manoeuvres, {{an agreement to}} establish centers on Reducing Nuclear Threat, and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning nuclear tests. The thaw in relations {{was reflected in the}} cultural sphere. Matlock’s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a reception at Spaso House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev’s intentions, as earlier Soviet <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> have considered it a provocation.|$|E
5|$|Göring spent The Hardest Day at Karinhall {{with two}} of his top fighter pilots, Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland. He was decorating them with the Combined Pilots-Observation Badge in Gold with Diamonds after they had {{achieved}} much success in recent weeks. However, Göring took the opportunity to berate them over bomber losses and in particular, what he saw, as a lack of aggression in the Jagdwaffe. This criticism was not received well by the two men. Göring moved to quickly reconcile with them by ordering their promotion to Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) in command of their respective Geschwader (Wings). Göring felt a younger generation of combat <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> help motivate the force. They were dismissed.|$|E
50|$|Immunity Challenge: Each tribe would paddle {{out to a}} {{floating}} platform. The tribe <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> not {{take part in the}} paddling, instead gathering ladder pieces tied to buoys along the way. Once at the floating platform, the tribe <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> retrieve the flag there and have the rest of the tribe row back to shore. Once at shore, the tribe <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> stand by at a tribal mat {{while the rest of the}} tribe would correctly assemble the ladder, which the tribe <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> use to scale up a standing platform and plant the flag upon it. The first two tribes to finish would win immunity.|$|R

50|$|POW {{status for}} Saddam Hussein {{meant that the}} former Iraqi <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> be {{eligible}} to stand trial for war crimes.|$|R
5|$|On November 7, Ralston {{called a}} meeting with company and union leaders to begin {{negotiations}} to resolve the strike. The temporary solution was that all workers {{who had not been}} involved in violence could return to work, the company would raise wages by five percent, recognize the union, guarantee a minimum weekly salary, and Thorpe and national union <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> immediately leave the state. The union and company agreed to later submit all grievances to the Indiana Public Service Commission for arbitration, and agreed that their decisions would be final. The arrangement was submitted to a workers' vote and was approved unanimously; the strike ended at 6:00 pm.|$|E
5|$|Relations between steppe nomads and the settled {{people in}} and around Central Asia were often marked by conflict. The nomadic {{lifestyle}} was well suited to warfare, and steppe cavalry became {{some of the most}} militarily potent forces in the world, only limited by nomads' frequent lack of internal unity. Periodically, strong <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> organise several tribes into one force, creating an almost unstoppable power. These unified groups included the Huns, who invaded Europe, and under Attila, conducted campaigns in both eastern France and northern Italy, over 500miles apart, within two successive campaign seasons. Other unified nomadic forces included the Wu Hu attacks on China, and the Mongol conquest of much of Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5000|$|Team {{oriented}} - {{characterized by}} diplomatic, administratively competent, team collaboration and integration. A Toxic <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> be malevolent alienating the team, but driving cohesion ...|$|R
50|$|If both {{steps were}} not achieved, {{then in the}} second part the <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> call a special conference, where again the {{resolution}} would need 2/3 support to pass.|$|R
5000|$|Although he has {{publicly}} described Mullah Omar as [...] "a dumb person, illiterate and ignorant", he also {{claims that the}} former Taliban <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> negotiate with him if he were elected President.|$|R
5|$|In {{the charter}} of the Presidential Council, each of the three <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> sit on a Presidential Council which would be tasked with {{approving}} all major policy decisions of the country. At the same time, each would get two years as the President of the country able to implement many of the ongoing tasks of managing the military and civil service in the country. The various ministerial positions would be divided between the three leaders; however, the Ministry of the Interior and the Minister of the Army would be appointed by the sitting president. It was decided that Maga would be the first President from 1970 until 1972, followed by Ahomadégbé until 1974, and then Apithy until 1976. One peaceful transition occurred with Hubert Maga giving power to Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin on 7 May 1972. However, stalled politics ensued with Maga and Apithy working to undermine Ahomadégbé's ability to govern and the Presidential Council was ended on 26 October 1972 when a military coup led by Mathieu Kérékou assumed power and ruled the country until 1991.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} after Wallingford, but in {{a rather}} half-hearted fashion. Stephen lost the towns of Oxford and Stamford to Henry while the King was diverted fighting Hugh Bigod in the east of England, but Nottingham Castle survived an Angevin attempt to capture it. Meanwhile, Stephen's brother Henry of Blois and Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury were for once unified {{in an effort to}} broker a permanent peace between the two sides, putting pressure on Stephen to accept a deal. The armies of Stephen and Henry FitzEmpress met again at Winchester, where the two <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> ratify the terms of a permanent peace in November. Stephen announced the Treaty of Winchester in Winchester Cathedral: he recognised Henry FitzEmpress as his adopted son and successor, in return for Henry doing homage to him; Stephen promised to listen to Henry's advice, but retained all his royal powers; Stephen's remaining son, William, would do homage to Henry and renounce his claim to the throne, in exchange for promises of the security of his lands; key royal castles would be held on Henry's behalf by guarantors, whilst Stephen would have access to Henry's castles; and the numerous foreign mercenaries would be demobilised and sent home. Stephen and Henry sealed the treaty with a kiss of peace in the cathedral.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the mid-2000s, Cisco {{also built}} a {{significant}} presence in India, establishing its Globalization Centre East in Bangalore for $1billion, and planning that 20% of Cisco's <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> be based there.|$|E
50|$|The {{selection}} of the relative market share metric was based upon {{its relationship to the}} experience curve. The market <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> have greater experience curve benefits, which delivers a cost leadership advantage.|$|R
6000|$|By the words, [...] "abide all consequences," [...] the <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> be {{justified}} in leaving a man to shift for himself, and refusing his pay, if the case were a serious one.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is grand!" [...] John agreed, {{with equal}} enthusiasm. [...] "He {{is just what}} I pictured to myself that a great <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> be; such as Joshua, or Gideon, or the Prince of the Maccabees." ...|$|R
25|$|Netanyahu {{responded to}} a pilgrimage march, called by Shalit's father for his release, by saying {{he was willing to}} release 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in {{exchange}} for Shalit, but that top Hamas <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> not be among those released.|$|E
25|$|Tributary {{leaders and}} provincial {{governors}} {{were responsible for}} collecting tribute and contributing troops under local generalship to the imperial army in times of emergency. Occasionally, tributary <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> be ordered to attack neighbors even without {{the backing of the}} main imperial army. These forces were often utilized in Oyo's distant campaigns on the coast or against other states.|$|E
25|$|A {{referendum}} of {{the party}} membership in 2007 {{on the question of}} creating a Leader and Deputy Leader – or, if candidates choose to run together and are gender balanced, Co-Leaders without a Deputy Leader – passed by 73%. The <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> be elected every two years, instead of annually, and would be able to vote on the GPEx.|$|E
5000|$|An {{inversion}} canon (also {{called an}} al rovescio canon) has the follower moving in contrary motion to the leader. Where the <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> go {{down by a}} particular interval, the follower goes up by that same interval [...]|$|R
50|$|On 22 May 2014, the NCPO {{announced}} its composition {{and stated that}} its <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> exercise all powers and duties which the laws invest in {{the prime minister and}} the cabinet, until a new prime minister was elected or appointed.|$|R
50|$|When Fianna Fáil is in {{opposition}} the leader usually {{acts as the}} Leader of the Opposition, and chairs the opposition front bench. Concordantly, when the party is in government, the <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> usually become Taoiseach, as well as appointing the cabinet.|$|R
25|$|The Christian {{population}} {{majority is}} believed to have ended in the early 1960s, but government <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> agree to no change in the political power balance. This led to Muslim demands of increased representation, and the constant sectarian tension slid into violent conflict in 1958 (prompting U.S. intervention) and again in the grueling Lebanese Civil War, in 1975–90.|$|E
25|$|On 15 March, King Abdullah II said a 53-member {{committee}} {{with government}} officials and opposition <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> draft new laws for parliamentary elections and political parties, setting a three-month deadline for agreement on political reforms. However, the Muslim Brotherhood {{said it would not}} take part unless parliament is dissolved and a prime minister is elected from a parliamentary majority.|$|E
25|$|Also {{writing for}} the Financial Times, Alan Beattie was less optimistic than Mr Wolf about {{the chances of a}} {{collaborative}} solution, as he considers China and America have too divergent views on currency to be able to co-operate. Speaking very shortly before the G20 summit was due to begin, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper also expressed doubts that <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> be able to agree on a solution.|$|E
50|$|The NCPO then {{announced}} that its <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> exercise all powers and duties which the laws {{invest in the}} prime minister and the cabinet, until there was a new prime minister. It placed its members in charge of government ministries and equivalent agencies.|$|R
50|$|Soon after this, the <b>Leader</b> <b>would</b> {{steal the}} {{seemingly}} lifeless body of General Thunderbolt Ross {{from the back}} of an ambulance, simply because it was there, and later managed to revive it as a mindless vegetable, which he used as an armored enforcer.|$|R
50|$|Although it was {{uncommon}} {{in the early}} Hasidic movement for a son to succeed his father as Rebbe (typically the Rebbe or <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> be succeeded by a disciple), the Sar Shalom wished to be succeeded by the youngest of his five sons, Yehoshua.|$|R
25|$|Camp Nelson is {{currently}} {{controlled by the}} Jessamine County Fiscal Court. The county and some local <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> like to transfer Camp Nelson to the National Park Service. The site was designated {{as part of the}} National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, which runs through several states and has sites in Canada and the Antilles. In 2008 U.S. Representative Ben Chandler was studying funding issues related to such a transfer of property.|$|E
25|$|Many in the American mission—Martin in particular—along {{with some}} key figures in Washington, {{believed}} that {{negotiations with the}} communists were possible, especially if Saigon could stabilize the military situation. Ambassador Martin’s hope was that North Vietnam’s <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> be willing to allow a “phased withdrawal” whereby a gradual departure might be achieved {{in order to allow}} helpful locals and all Americans to leave (along with full military withdrawal) over a period of months.|$|E
25|$|In response, {{opponents of}} the bill {{including}} Martin Lee have argued that a potentially repressive bill is more acceptable {{in a system of}} parliamentary democracy and that under British rule, the potential impact of security laws was minimised by the fact that political <b>leaders</b> <b>would</b> suffer political damage if they attempted to enforce these laws. The argument is that in the case where Hong Kong becomes authoritarian, there are fewer restrictions which prevent them drafting bad laws.|$|E
50|$|President Zelaya's {{chief of}} staff, Enrique Flores Lanza, {{declined}} to say whether the exiled <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> participate {{in the second round}} of talks, mediated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, which may resume on July 18 to try to resolve the country's political crisis.|$|R
50|$|Red Cross {{spokesman}} Florian Westphal {{confirmed that}} ICRC {{visits to the}} captured Iraqi <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> go ahead according to international rules governing the detention of all prisoners of war. He said discussions are under way as to how and where those visits would take place.|$|R
5000|$|During {{yellow flag}} caution periods, the [...] "wave around" [...] rule {{would now be}} implemented. When the field is one lap away from going back to green flag conditions, all lapped cars behind the pace car that happen to be ahead of the actual race <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> be waved around the pace car, get their lap back, and be {{permitted}} {{to catch up to}} {{the tail end of the}} line of cars. This would continue until the race leader became the first car behind the pace car. Following the precedent set in 2000, the pace car would then drop off the track in turn one, and the race <b>leader</b> <b>would</b> pace the field back to the green flag and the ensuring restart.|$|R
