The uniform diffusion time and the effective concentration of the aerosol fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> are important parameters for putting out a fire.

To clarify the characteristics of fire spread in nacelle and determine the minimum usage of fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent,</b> a numerical study is conducted to investigate fire activity in helicopter nacelle by analyzing the distribution of heat release rate, velocity vector field, temperature field and the distribution of fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> concentration with FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator). Full scale experiment is implemented and three fire sources are set in the nacelle away from front fire wall of 1 / 4 position, 1 / 2 position and 3 / 4 position, respectively. Fire extinguishing system is designed by the results of fire spread. The distribution of fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> concentration is investigated from 6 s to 10 s.

5000|$|The {{extinguishing}} {{performance of}} condensed aerosol fire suppressants {{is dependent on}} the density of aerosol particulates in the immediate vicinity of the flame.

The extinguishing and design densities of aerosol fire suppression agents are generally expressed in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3). Thus, the efficiency of aerosol <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> varies depending on a number of factors, such as the location of the aerosol relative to the flame, the proximity of other combustible flammable materials, the type of fuel involved, etc.|$|R
40|$|As a {{suitable}} {{candidate for the}} next halon alternative gaseous fire-extinguishing agent, it is very meaningful to investigate how to improve the fire-extinguishing capacity of hot aerosol fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> for local fires. When fire breaks out, the actual fire location is unpredictable, and the extinguishing efficiency of hot aerosol <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> will be observably affected by the fire locations due to different flame patterns and intensities at different fire locations. In this work, {{the use of the}} hot aerosol <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> in suppressing oil fires at different locations, including open, partially open, and fully closed locations, has been investigated in order to obtain the regularity of the effectiveness of the hot aerosol <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> in suppressing a local fire. The results have shown that the hot aerosol <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> is more effective in suppressing an oil fire in a fully closed system than in an open system or partially open system. The shortest fire-extinguishing time was for the fire in the corner, followed by the one in the middle, and the fire against the wall took the longest time to extinguish for fire locations in a partially open system and a fully closed system, respectively. In addition, the fire extinguishing process involves varying degrees of flame enhancements. Sredstva za gašenje požara vrućim aerosolom moguća su zamjena za halone.

In the tests, the studied agent was introduced into a propane flame in a diffusion flame burner. The combustion products were analysed using both conventional IR-techniques and FTIR. It could {{be concluded that}} for all four <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> that the <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> takes part in the combustion process resulting in production of CO and CO 2, which was also confirmed by the increase in smoke production with increasing amounts of agent introduced into the flame. Production of HF and COF 2 was found in experiments with all four <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents.</b> In experiments with Halon 1301, the production of HBr was also determined.

The recovery of fluorine as HF and COF 2 for the C 6 F-ketone is lower compared to HFC 227 ea and HFC 125.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a theoretical investigation designed to characterise the mechanism of formation of those toxic compounds which are produced when halon replacement <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> are released in the hot upper-layer of typical enclosure fires. The present work was primarily motivated by the fact that in many building fires the <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> may not be directly applied to the flame but released in the hot layer. For this purpose, detailed chemical kinetic modelling techniques were used to predict the generation of combustion products and toxic byproducts within the hot layer. This can be justified {{based on the fact that}} recent studies in this field have shown that the production of major combustion products in the upper-layer is kinetically controlled. Effects of the mixing phenomenon were investigated by considering two possible extremes using infinitely fast and infinitely slow mixing models. The heat loss variation was also studied under isothermal and adiabatic conditions. Calculations presented here show that the concentration of toxic compounds originated from halon replacement <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> are much higher than those of halons mainly because for such agents, due to the lack of significant chemical reaction inhibition, higher extinguishing concentration are required...|$|R

Numerical simulation was used to make a comparative research on superfine powder <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> movement released in non-fire room and fire room.

Finally total flooding condition was formed from the top to the bottom, and the total flooding time was pretty much exactly the same as non-fire condition. When fire was located at the left bottom corner, particles were mainly controlled by eddies, which led to irregular trajectory and uneven concentration distribution of particles.
