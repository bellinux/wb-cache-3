5|$|During the 1934–35 offseason, Ruth {{circled the}} world with his wife; the trip {{included}} a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player Alan Fairfax, and after having <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> in a cricketer's stance, stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted {{that he could not}} have the time to make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.|$|E
5|$|Many state {{conventions}} elected delegates {{pledged to}} support bimetallism {{in the party}} platform. Gold Democrats were successful in a few states in the Northeast, but had <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> elsewhere. Speakers in some states cursed Cleveland; the South Carolina convention denounced him. Cleveland issued a statement urging Democratic voters to support gold—the next convention to be held, in Illinois, unanimously supported silver; the keynote speaker prayed for divine forgiveness for Cleveland's 1892 nomination. Gold and silver factions in some states, such as Bryan's Nebraska, sent rival delegations to the convention.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, {{the team}} played the Bengals in the playoffs, {{this time at}} Paul Brown Stadium, and secured a 24–14 victory over Cincinnati. That victory meant that the Jets would travel to San Diego to play the Chargers, who had won eleven straight games, in the divisional round. Strong performances by Sanchez, running back Shonn Greene, and the Jets defense helped the Jets to a 17–14 win over the Chargers. New York played the top-seeded Colts in the AFC Championship Game and secured an early 17–6 lead. They had <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> {{in the second half}} as the Colts went to the Super Bowl with a 30–17 victory.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Tang {{slipped out of}} the city, however, the entire Nanking Garrison Force was rapidly {{disintegrating}} with some units in open flight. Furthermore, contact had already been lost with many units who thus never received Tang's message and continued to hold their positions as ordered, though even those that did receive it had <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> at slipping through the Japanese lines. China's 66th and 83rd Corps made a bid to evade the Japanese as planned through a gap to the east but immediately ran into their own minefield. After that they were attacked in flight by Japanese units and lost two divisional chiefs of staff in combat. Though the two corps had started the battle at least 11,000 men strong, only 600 of them escaped Nanking. Near dawn on December 13 a portion of China's 74th Corps was also annihilated in a bid to break through Japanese lines along the Yangtze River south of Nanking.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{left office}} as {{governor}} in January 1896. In February, Harrison {{made it clear}} that he would not seek a third nomination. Hanna's operatives immediately organized Harrison's home state of Indiana for McKinley with a haste that the former president privately found unseemly. By early 1896, the Reed and Allison campaigns were beginning to form themselves, but they had <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> in Indiana. McKinley challenged his rivals everywhere except in states, such as Iowa, that he deemed had serious candidates like Senator Allison. The favorite son candidacies of Minnesota Senator Cushman K. Davis and former Nebraska senator Charles F. Manderson fell victim to the McKinley forces, well-financed by Hanna, who took their states away from them. McKinley was disliked by the American Protective Association, an anti-Catholic group angered that as governor he had appointed to office members of that faith. Their wide pamphleting caused Hanna to act against falsehoods that his candidate was a Catholic.|$|E
25|$|The Temple had <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> {{converting}} most midwesterners to communist ideals, {{even when}} disguised as religion.

25|$|Kent County Cricket Club in 2005 {{played their}} cricket in Division One of the County Championship and Division Two of the totesport League. They started the Championship at 11-2 to win it, behind Surrey and Warwickshire. Their first {{first-class}} game, however, {{was against the}} students of Cardiff UCCE. They fell to 104 for 6 before rain prevented any further play. They had <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> in their first Sunday League game, against Derbyshire, which was also abandoned through rain.|$|E

Nicias had expected this, but the other commanders were dismayed. Nicias suggested they make a show of force and then return home, while Alcibiades said they should encourage revolts against Syracuse, and then attack Syracuse and Selinus. Lamachus said they should attack Syracuse right away, as it was the predominate city-state in Sicily.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1986–87 season, after further good form, Lawrence was selected in a West Indies B team to tour Zimbabwe, playing four first-class matches and five limited-overs games. He had <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> in the multi-day matches, but in the third one-day game scored a maiden List A century, 117 not out. Although a regular in the Leewards team {{throughout the rest of the}} 1980s and into the early 1990s, Lawrence never again played at a higher level, ending his career after the 1993–94 season. He finished with a first-class batting average of 29.82 and a List A average of 28.39.|$|E
25|$|On {{the tour}} of Australia in 1974–75, his fortune {{regarding}} injuries did not improve. In the first Test a ball from aggressive pace bowler Dennis Lillee struck his hand and broke it, although {{he was able to}} continue batting. In the Fourth Test, the then captain Mike Denness dropped himself and Edrich was subsequently named as captain. He had <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> in that game when Lillee broke his ribs with the first ball of his second innings, although he did recover to bat later on, scoring 33 runs. England lost the test, and it was to be his only appearance as captain.|$|E
25|$|Task Review: Renaissance's {{execution}} of the task was virtually flawless thanks to Raef and Simon; the team targeted large companies and got several orders by going door-to-door, making big earnings in both areas, while finishing their washing and pressing on time before the laundry closed and not losing any articles of clothing in the process. Meanwhile, Alpha's performance was dogged by problems; while they managed to secure work from businesses with dirty laundry, they had <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> going door-to-door. The team also started their work late, meaning they did not finish {{by the end of}} the first day, and lost two items in the process for which they were fined. As a direct result, the team effectively lost the task.|$|E

25|$|On January 23, 1691, Spain {{appointed}} the first governor of Texas, General Domingo Terán de los Ríos. On {{his visit to}} Mission San Francisco in August, he discovered that the priests had established a second mission nearby, but were having <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> converting the natives to Christianity. The Indians regularly stole the mission cattle and horses and showed little respect to the priests. When Terán left Texas later that year, most of the missionaries chose to return with him, leaving only 3 religious people and 9 soldiers at the missions. The group also left behind a smallpox epidemic. The angry Caddo threatened the remaining Spaniards, who soon abandoned the fledgling missions and returned to Coahuila. For the next 20years, Spain again ignored Texas.|$|E
25|$|Late in 1757, Foote faced {{himself in}} the guise of young actor and mimic, Tate Wilkinson. Wilkinson, like Foote, had failed {{somewhat}} as an actor, but was renowned for his satiric mimicry of others. Foote traveled with him to Dublin for part of the 1757–58 season and he also revived Diversions of the Morning as a vehicle to display Wilkinson's talents. The popularity of these talents crowded out all other performances at Drury Lane {{in the first half of}} the season, much to the chagrin of Garrick and the other actors. Soon, however, the luck ran out and by March, Foote was seeking employment elsewhere. With <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> in London, Foote traveled to perform a season in Edinburgh and found success with many of his works, including The Author which could not be staged in London. The following season found Foote in Dublin where Wilkinson was drawing crowds with his imitations and on 28 January 1760, Foote opened a new play, The Minor. The production was a failure.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} the party made camp, very little food {{remained}} from the supplies that Stanton had brought back from Sutter's Fort. [...] The oxen began to die and their carcasses were frozen and stacked. Truckee Lake was not yet frozen, but the pioneers were unfamiliar with catching lake trout. Eddy, the most experienced hunter, killed a bear, but had <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> after that. The Reed and Eddy families had lost almost everything and Margret Reed promised to pay double {{when they got to}} California for the use of three oxen from the Graves and Breen families. Graves charged Eddy $25—normally the cost of two healthy oxen—for the carcass of an ox that had starved to death.|$|E
500|$|Hubbell {{would not}} permit Antarctic to sail with Abby on board; {{possibly}} he had designs on her.

[...] Morrell set up camp {{on one of the}} islands, where he faced a hostile reception from the population, who were nevertheless intrigued by their first sight of metal. [...] There were thefts of tools; Morrell responded by holding several chiefs as hostages, at which the islanders mounted a full-scale attack on Morrell's shore base. Fourteen crew members were killed; Antarctic was forced to make a hasty withdrawal, leaving much equipment behind.|$|E

And {{then there are the}} editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a <b>little</b> <b>luck.</b> And that’s what I feel like we had with this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E
