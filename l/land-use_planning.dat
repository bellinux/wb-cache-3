5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} Netherlands after the central government and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, {{which means that the}} central government is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities a certain degree of independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include <b>land-use</b> <b>planning,</b> public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.|$|E

25|$|Aided by a {{favorable}} {{resolution of the}} Linn County Chamber of Commerce, Macpherson was able to help orchestrate a hearing on land use planning before the Linn County Commission, the elected county government authority for rural Linn County. The hearing, at which positive testimony was heard from {{a broad range of}} community figures including the head of the Linn Chamber of Commerce, led to an initial appropriation of $5,000 towards the development of a first building code for the county. A county planning commission was established, with Macpherson recruited as chairman, and in 1967 the first land use zoning hearings for Linn County were held. Macpherson would remain active in the Linn County planning commission's affairs, acutely aware of the rapidly changing <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> landscape in Oregon.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Barind tract is {{threatened}} by desertification and undergoing rapid change. In view of this fact {{it is very much}} essential to manage this barind tract under proper <b>land-use</b> <b>plan.</b> The present study evaluates the effectiveness of high-resolution satellite data and computer aided GIS techniques in assessing land-use change detection for the period 1990 to 2007 within the study area, which is very much essential to manage this barind tract under proper <b>land-use</b> <b>plan,</b> and for proper <b>land-use</b> <b>plan</b> it is necessary to get reliable information. The present study found five major land-use such as current fallow, current agriculture, settlement, irrigation water and water bodies. From the result, it is found that current fallow and water bodies decrease while settlement and current agriculture increase. Study concludes that as Barind tract {{is threatened}} by desertification, decrease of water bodies is not a good sign for the study area...|$|R
25|$|Preparing for {{sea-level rise}} can be {{justified}} in many cases, because the cost of preparing now is small compared {{to the cost of}} reacting later. Examples include wetland protection, flood insurance, long-lived infrastructure, and coastal <b>land-use</b> <b>planning.</b> Nevertheless, preparing for sea-level rise has been {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, flood insurance maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.|$|E
25|$|Critics of New Urbanism {{have argued}} that its {{environmental}} aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility. The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities {{is not just about}} cars and too much driving - it is about the entire urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is {{less than half of the}} overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that <b>land-use</b> <b>planning</b> can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the issues of}} spatial planning on the case study of Łódź. Of significance in Łódź are its outer peripheries, which due to their natural value have become areas that must be protected and monitored in order to limit the anthropogenic impact. Protection of these areas may be carried out through the usage of instruments such as local <b>land-use</b> <b>plans</b> which help to limit the green field development phenomenon and {{to look after the}} biologically active surfaces within the borders of the city. The second step which may concern the areas with local <b>land-use</b> <b>plans,</b> as well as those without current local <b>land-use</b> <b>plans,</b> is monitoring. Such monitoring may be carried out through the analyses of satellite imagery of the city area. Such activities are a kind of low-budget enterprises which bring many benefits at a very small cost resulting from the purchase of satellite imagery. From the perspective of the authorities, a crucial fact is that the material collected during the analyses of the satellite imagery may be used in the initial phase of the planning process as an element of the inventory of areas designated for the development of <b>land-use</b> <b>plans.</b> This publication was prepared thanks to a grant for the implementation of tasks aimed at the development of young scientists in the framework of the project entitled “Spatial information systems in spatial planning application in the field of culture and environment...|$|R
