40|$|Primary {{isolation}} of {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) in RIII mice generates a <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> believed to be reproducible and distinct from that produced by classical scrapie. This profile, which is characterized by peaks at gray matter areas 1, 4 and 7 (dorsal medulla, hypothalamus and septal nuclei), is used to diagnose BSE on primary isolation. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether the BSE agent could be present in sheep diagnosed with classical scrapie, using lesion profiles in RIII mice as a discriminatory method. Sixty-two positive scrapie field cases were collected from individual farms between 1996 and 1999 and bioassayed in RIII mice. Fifty-five of these isolates transmitted successfully to at least one mouse. Of the 31 that produced adequate data to allow <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> analysis, 10 showed a consistent profile with peaks at brain areas 1, 4 and 7. All inocula for this subgroup were derived from sheep of genotype ARQ/ARQ. While the 1 - 4 - 7 -scrapie profile exhibited similarities to BSE in RIII mice at primary isolation, it was distinguishable based on histopathology, immunohistochemistry and cluster analysis. We conclude that caution should be taken to distinguish this profile from BSE and that additional parameters should be considered to reach a final diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Global aphasia without {{hemiparesis}} (GAWH) {{is a rare}} stroke syndrome, {{which typically}} occurs after large perisylvian lesions involving both the Broca's and Wernicke's areas. This study localized the lesions and examined the pathogenic mechanism in Korean patients with GAWH. Methods: Twelve patients were diagnosed with aphasia using the Western Aphasia Battery. To identify decreased perfusion, which might be functionally relevant to aphasia but not detected by diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), single photon emission tomography (SPECT) was performed in six patients. To uncover the possible pathogenic mechanisms of ischemic stroke, vascular and cardiologic work-ups were performed {{in all of the}} patients. Results: The lesions seen on DWI varied, and included: both inferior frontal and superior temporal (four), isolated inferior frontal (four), superior temporal (one), subcortical (two), and even parieto-occipital (one) lesions. Brain SPECT did not reveal any extensive lesions of the peri-sylvian area outside the DWI lesion in any of the patients, except in one patient with subcortical lesions. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a single lesion of the left inferior frontal area, or a superior temporal lesion in different locations may produce GAWH, and the <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> and stroke mechanis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The United States {{control program}} for {{classical}} ovine scrapie {{is based in}} part on the finding that infection is typically spread through exposure to shed placentas from infected ewes. Transmission from goats to sheep is less well described. A suitable rodent model for examining the effect of caprine scrapie isolates in the ovine host will be useful in the ovine scrapie eradication effort. In this study, we describe the incubation time, brain <b>lesion</b> <b>profile,</b> glycoform pattern and PrP Sc distribution patterns in a well characterized transgenic mouse line (Tg 338) expressing the ovine VRQ prion allele, following inoculation with brain from scrapie infected goats. Results First passage incubation times of caprine tissue in Tg 338 ovinized mice varied widely but second passage intervals were shorter and consistent. Vacuolation profiles, glycoform patterns and paraffin-embedded tissue blots from terminally ill second passage mice derived from sheep or goat inocula were similar. Proteinase K digestion products of murine tissue were slightly smaller than the original ruminant inocula, a finding consistent with passage of several ovine strains in previous reports. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that Tg 338 mice propagate prions of caprine origin and provide a suitable baseline for examination of samples identified in the expanded US caprine scrapie surveillance program. </p...|$|E
40|$|A more {{complete}} assessment of ovine prion strain diversity will {{be achieved by}} complementing biological strain typing in conventional and ovine PrP transgenic mice with a biochemical analysis of the resultant PrPSc. This will provide a correlation between ovine prion strain phenotype and the molecular nature of different PrP conformers associated with particular prion strains. Here, we have compared the molecular and transmission characteristics of ovine ARQ/ARQ and VRQ/VRQ scrapie isolates following primary passage in tg 338 (VRQ) and tg 59 (ARQ) ovine PrP transgenic mice and the conventional mouse lines C 57 BL/ 6 (Prnpa), RIII (Prnpa), and VM (Prnpb). Our data show that these different genotypes of scrapie isolates display similar incubation periods of > 350 days in conventional and tg 59 mice. Facilitated transmission of sheep scrapie isolates occurred in tg 338 mice, with incubation times reduced to 64 days for VRQ/VRQ inocula and to ≤ 210 days for ARQ/ARQ samples. Distinct genotype-specific <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles</b> were seen in the brains of conventional and tg 59 mice with prion disease, which was accompanied by the accumulation of more conformationally stable PrPSc, following inoculation with ARQ/ARQ compared to VRQ/VRQ scrapie isolates. In contrast, the <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles,</b> quantities, and stability of PrPSc induced by the same inocula in tg 338 mice were more similar than in the other mouse lines. Our data show that primary transmission of different genotypes of ovine prions {{is associated with the}} formation of different conformers of PrPSc with distinct molecular properties and provide the basis of a molecular approach to identify the true diversity of ovine prion strains...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Prion {{diseases}} are generally characterized by pronounced neuronal loss. In particular, a subpopulation of inhibitory neurones, {{characterized by the}} expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV), is selectively destroyed early in the course of human and experimental prion diseases. By contrast, nerve cells expressing calbindin D 28 k (CB), another calcium-binding protein, as well as PV/CB coexpressing Purkinje cells, are well preserved. Methods: To evaluate, if PV and CB may directly contribute to neuronal vulnerability or resistance against nerve cell death, respectively, we inoculated PV- and CB-deficient mice, and corresponding controls, with 139 A scrapie and compared them with regard to incubation times and histological <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles.</b> Results: While survival times were slightly but significantly diminished in CB–/–, but not PV–/– mice, scrapie <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles</b> did not differ between knockout mice and controls. There was a highly significant and selective loss of isolectin B₄-decorated perineuronal nets (which specifically demarcate the extracellular matrix surrounding the 'PV-expressing' subpopulation of cortical interneurones) in scrapie inoculated PV+/+, as well as PV–/– mice. Purkinje cell numbers were not different in CB+/+ and CB–/– mice. Conclusions: Our results suggest that PV expression is a surrogate marker for neurones highly vulnerable in prion diseases, but that the death of these neurones is unrelated to PV expression and thus based on a still unknown pathomechanism. Further studies including the inoculation of mice ectopically (over) expressing CB are necessary to determine whether the shortened survival of CB–/– mice is indeed due to a neuroprotective effect of this molecule...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{individual}} animals {{affected by}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, different disease phenotypes {{can be identified}} which are attributed to different strains of the agent. In the absence of reliable technology to fully characterise the agent, classification of disease phenotype {{has been used as}} a strain typing tool which can be applied in any host. This approach uses standardised data on biological parameters, established for a single host, to allow comparison of different prion sources. Traditionally prion strain characterisation in wild type mice is based on incubation periods and <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles</b> after the stabilisation of the agent into the new host which requires serial passages. Such analysis can take many years, due to prolonged incubation periods. The current study demonstrates that the PrP Sc patterns produced by one serial passage in wild type mice of bovine or ovine BSE were consistent, stable and showed minimal and predictable differences from mouse-stabilised reference strains. This biological property makes PrP Sc deposition pattern mapping a powerful tool in the identification and definition of TSE strains on primary isolation, making the process of characterisation faster and cheaper than a serial passage protocol. It can be applied to individual mice and therefore it is better suited to identify strain diversity within single inocula in case of co-infections or identify strains in cases where insufficient mice succumb to disease for robust <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles</b> to be constructed. The detailed description presented in this study provides a reference document for identifying BSE in wild type mice. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of the agent causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) infecting small ruminants is of serious concern for human health. Among scrapie cases, the CH 1641 source in particular appears to have certain biochemical properties similar to the BSE strain. In France, several natural scrapie cases were identified as "CH 1641 -like" natural scrapie isolates in sheep and goats. The Tg(OvPrP 4) mouse line expressing the ovine prion protein is a sensitive model for studying and identifying strains of agents responsible for scrapie and BSE. This model is also very useful when studying specific scrapie source CH 1641, known to be not transmissible to wild-type mice despite the similarity {{of some of its}} biochemical properties to those of the BSE strain. As {{it is important to be}} able to fully distinguish CH 1641 from BSE, we herein report the histopathological data from CH 1641 scrapie transmission experiments compared to specific cases of "CH 1641 -like" natural scrapie isolates in sheep, murine scrapie strains and BSE. In addition to the conventional vacuolar <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> approach and PrP(d) brain mappings, an innovative differential PET-blot analysis was introduced to classify the different strains of agent and revealed the first direct concordance between ways of grouping strains on the basis of PrP(d) biochemical characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Sheep can be {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE), and the ensuing disease is similar to scrapie in terms of pathogenesis and clinical signs. BSE infection in sheep is an animal and human health concern. In this study, the transmission in BoPrP-Tg 110 mice of prions from BSE-infected sheep was examined and compared to the transmission of original cattle BSE in cattle and sheep scrapie prions. Our results indicate no transmission barrier for sheep BSE prions to infect BoPrP-Tg 110 mice, but {{the course of the}} disease is accelerated compared to the effects of the original BSE isolate. The shortened incubation period of sheep BSE in the model was conserved in subsequent passage in BoPrP-Tg 110 mice, indicating that it is not related to infectious titer differences. Biochemical signature, <b>lesion</b> <b>profile,</b> and PrP(Sc) deposition pattern of both cattle and sheep BSE were similar. In contrast, all three sheep scrapie isolates tested showed an evident transmission barrier and further adaptation in subsequent passage. Taken together, those data indicate that BSE agent can be altered by crossing a species barrier, raising concerns about the virulence of this new prion towards other species, including humans. The BoPrP-Tg 110 mouse bioassay should be considered as a valuable tool for discriminating scrapie and BSE in sheep...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{the proper}} neuropathological and {{molecular}} characterization of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has increased since asymptomatic and atypical cases were detected in the cattle population by active disease surveillance. In this respect we investigated a total of 95 confirmed BSE cases originating from different active and passive surveillance categories (clinical suspects, emergency-slaughter, fallen stock and routinely slaughter) in Switzerland for their neuropathological and molecular phenotype. We looked for measurable differences between these categories in <b>lesion</b> <b>profile,</b> severity of spongiform change, degree of astrocytosis as well as immunohistochemical and molecular patterns of the disease-associated isoform of the prion protein (PrPd) in the caudal brainstem. Our results indicate significantly higher intensities of spongiform change in clinically affected compared to asymptomatic BSE cases. Similar effects were in trend observed for the intensities of PrPd deposition and astrocytosis, whereas the frequencies of morphological PrPd types and the molecular patterns in Western immunoblot were not different. Importantly, none of the animals {{included in this study}} revealed features of atypical BSE. Taken together, this study suggests that both clinically affected as well as asymptomatic Swiss BSE cases in cattle share the neuropathological and molecular phenotype of classical BSE and that asymptomatic classical BSE cases are at a pre-clinical stage of the disease rather than representing a true sub-clinical form of BSE...|$|E

Both methods showed <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles</b> with a surface layer. The determination of nanohardness seems limited to lesions with a mineral content > 45 vol%.

40|$|In 2005, a {{retrospective}} GB survey of goat scrapie cases identified a single Scottish goat, culled in 1990, with immunohistochemical characteristics suggestive of BSE. Classical strain typing by bioassay in mice {{relies on the}} relative incubation periods in inbred mouse strains and vacuolar <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles</b> to characterise prion strains. Therefore, to further characterise this case, intracerebral challenges of suspect goat brain extract from fixed tissue, and control samples, were performed using the standard wild type mouse strains R III, C 57 Bl and VM and into the Tg 338 mice which over-express the sheep VRQ PrP allele. The experiment is not yet complete but the variable and limited recovery of infectivity from fixed tissue, which has resulted in very low attack rates in the wild-type mouse strains used for typing, mean that {{it is unlikely that}} there will be definitive strain characterisation using the standard criteria of attack rates or <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles.</b> However, one of the signatures of murine BSE is the presence of vacuolation in the brainstem cochlear nucleus. Mice challenged with the suspect goat BSE tissue showed vacuolation at this site while this lesion was absent or sparse in mice infected (and clinically-affected) following inoculation with caprine scrapie material. More generally, immunohistochemical patterns of abnormal PrP accumulation were consistent for each of the fixed ovine, caprine, sheep and cattle BSE sources and were distinct from each of the putative caprine and sheep scrapie sources. The suspect BSE goat shows patterns of abnormal PrP accumulation that were {{similar to that of the}} known BSE sources for each mouse strain. Thus the original characterisation of the suspect goat, by differential immunohistochemistry, as a BSE suspect and data arising from transmissions to mice are in agreement...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the current}} {{hypotheses}} about myelinic and astrocytic ion-dyshomeostasis underlying white (WM) and grey matter (GM) vacuolation in mitochondrial encephalopathies, there is a paucity {{of data on}} the exact mechanism of vacuole formation. To revisit the concepts of vacuole formation associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, we performed a comparative neuropathological analysis in Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) and full-length peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g coactivator- 1 a (FL-PGC- 1 a) -deficient mice, a recently proposed morphological model of mitochondrial encephalopathies. Brain tissues from an individual with genetically proven KSS (22 -year-old man) and aged FL-PGC- 1 a-deficient and wild-type (male, 70 - 75 -week-old) mice were analysed using ultrastructural and immunohistochemical methods, with a specific focus on myelin-related, oligodendroglial, axonal and astrocytic pathologies. Besides demonstrating remarkable similarities in the <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> of KSS and FL-PGC- 1 a-deficient mice, this study first provides morphological evidence for the identical origin of WM and GM vacuolation {{as well as for}} the presence of intracytoplasmic oligodendroglial vacuoles in mitochondriopathies. Based on these observations, the paper proposes a theoretical model for the development of focal myelin vacuolation as opposed to the original concepts of intramyelin oedema. Placing oligodendrocytes in the centre of tissue lesioning in conditions related to defects in mitochondria, our observations support the rationale for cytoprotective targeting of oligodendrocytes in mitochondrial encephalopathies, and may also have implications in brain aging and multiple sclerosis, as discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{systemic}} infection of a Rickettsia-like organism (RLO) in cultured sea bass is described {{for the first}} time. In hatcheries, clinical signs were lethargy, inappetence and discoloration. Twenty days after transfer to sea cages from hatcheries where the disease existed, fish showed erratic and abnormal swimming behaviour, loss of orientation, and lethargy. Cumulative mortality in colder {{months of the year}} reached 30 % in hatcheries and 80 % in cages. Surviving fish in cages did not show any clinical signs of RLO infection in the subsequent year. Evidence for a systemic distribution of RLO was supported by histolopathological lesions in both infected hatchery and caged fish, where the <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> included cranial sensory, central nervous, integumental and alimentary organ systems. Intracranial lesions were primarily characterized by an ascending histiocytic perineuritis and necrotizing congestive meningoencephalitis, with evidence for transfer of infective agents across the blood-brain barrier confirmed by the presence of RLOs within capillary endothelium and histiocytes in inflamed regions of the optic tectum and the cerebellum. In the most severe cases, infection spread to the statoacoustical (semicircular) canal system and the ependymal lining of ventricles, with marked rickettsial-laden histiocytic infiltration of the canal lumen. Integumental lesions were restricted to the oral submucosa, nares and integumental dermis of the cranium. Alimentary lesions were noted in both the liver parenchyma and mucosa/submucosa of the stomach. In all affected organs the RLOs were found by immunohistochemistry to be related to Piscirickettsia salmonis. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—Global aphasia without {{hemiparesis}} (GAWH) is {{an uncommon}} stroke syndrome involving receptive and expressive language impairment, without the hemiparesis typically manifested by patients with global aphasia after large left perisylvian lesions. A few cases of GAWH {{have been reported}} with conflicting conclusions regarding pathogenesis, lesion localisation, and recovery. The current {{study was conducted to}} attempt to clarify these issues.  METHODS—Ten cases of GAWH were prospectively studied with language profiles and lesion analysis; five patients had multiple lesions, four patients had a single lesion, and one had a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Eight patients met criteria for cardioembolic ischaemic stroke.  RESULTS—Cluster analysis based on acute language profiles disclosed three subtypes of patients with GAWH; these clusters persisted on follow up language assessment. Each cluster evolved into a different aphasia subtype: persistent GAWH, Wernicke's aphasia, or transcortical motor aphasia (TCM). Composite lesion analysis showed that persistent GAWH was related to lesioning of the left superior temporal gyrus. Patients with acute GAWH who evolved into TCM type aphasia had common lesioning of the left inferior frontal gyrus and adjacent subcortical white matter. Patients with acute GAWH who evolved into Wernicke's type aphasia were characterised by lesioning of the left precentral and postcentral gyri. Recovery of language was poor in all but one patient.  CONCLUSIONS—Although patients with acute GAWH are similar on neurological examination, they are heterogeneous with respect to early aphasia profile, language recovery, and <b>lesion</b> <b>profile.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Transmissible spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (TSE) strains {{are defined by}} their biological properties on transmission to wild-type mice, specifically by their characteristic incubation periods and patterns of vacuolar pathology (‘lesion profiles’) in the brain. Whilst a single TSE strain has been identified in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in sporadic CJD (sCJD) implies the existence of multiple strains of agent. These distinct strains are proposed to be enciphered by the different conformers of abnormal prion protein (PrP), recognised as different protease resistant PrP (PrPres) types by Western blotting (type 1 or type 2) and {{are thought to be}} substantially influenced by the different prion protein gene (PRNP) codon 129 polymorphism (MM, MV and VV). To test the relationship between disease phenotype and agent strain, this study carried out a full characterisation of the sCJD agent by primary transmission of brain tissue from 27 sCJD cases (comprising all six possible combinations of PRNP codon 129 genotype and PrPres type) in panels of wild-type mice using the standard strain typing properties of incubation period and <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles,</b> plus a full analysis of PrP in the mouse brain and the PrPres molecular subtypes present. Results were directly compared with the transmission characteristics of brain tissue from 10 vCJD cases. The characterisation of the agent strain in sCJD and vCJD was extended to include analysis of subsequent mouse-to-mouse passages. In an additional investigation, wild-type mice were experimentally challenged with a wide-range of lymphoid tissues, neural tissues and biological fluids from vCJD and sCJD patients in order to investigate the extent of peripheral involvement in CJD and to determine whether the agent is subject to any tissue-specific modifications. Analysis of all 27 sCJD sources demonstrated the existence of two strains of agent, one associated with the MM 1 /MV 1 subgroups and the other associated with the MM 2 subgroup, which could be distinguished by their transmission properties in the mice. The lack of transmission in mice challenged with VV 1, MV 2 and VV 2 tissues provided evidence of at least one further sCJD strain. In contrast, all 10 vCJD sources resulted in consistent incubation periods and <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles,</b> suggesting that all 10 patients investigated were infected with the same strain of agent. Overall, the observation that PrPres type in sCJD and vCJD was maintained on transmission is consistent with the proposition that PrPres type plays a role in enciphering strain-specific information. Experimental transmissions from peripheral tissues extended the evidence for a peripheral infection in vCJD. However, comparison of incubation periods and <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles</b> from transmission of brain and peripheral tissues showed no evidence of tissue-specific modification in the biological properties of the agent. Furthermore, the detection of low levels of infectivity in a sCJD buffy coat sample provides supporting evidence for a peripheral involvement in sCJD. This study highlights the complex relationship between disease phenotype, PRNP codon 129 genotype, PrPres type and agent strain in sCJD and vCJD. Overall, this study confirms that multiple strains of agent are associated with sCJD, some of which successfully propagate in wild-type mice but none of which are identical to the agent responsible for vCJD. Importantly, the sCJD strains identified here by their biological properties partially correlated with the current sub-classification system for sCJD which is based on the clinical and pathological phenotype of the disease...|$|R

40|$|According to {{traditional}} murine bioassay methodology, prions must be serially passaged within a new host before a stable phenotype, {{and therefore a}} strain, can be assigned. Prions often transmit with difficulty from one species to another; a property termed the transmission barrier. Transgenic mouse lines that over express prion protein (PrP) genes of different species can circumvent the transmission barrier but serial passages may still be required, particularly if unknown strains are encountered. Here we sought to investigate whether protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), an in-vitro method of PrP(Sc) replication, {{could be used to}} replace serial passage of VRQ/VRQ classical scrapie isolates undergoing strain typing in ovine transgenic tg 338 mice. Two classical scrapie field isolates that do not readily transmit to wild-type mice underwent bioassay in tg 338 mice pre- and post- PMCA and the phenotype of disease in inoculated mice was compared. For one of the sources investigated, the PMCA product gave rise to the same disease phenotypes in tg 338 mice as traditional bioassay, as indicated by <b>lesion</b> <b>profile,</b> IHC analysis and Western blot, whilst the second source produced phenotypic characteristics which were not identical with those that arose through traditional bioassay. These data show that differences in the efficiency of PMCA as a strain-typing tool may vary between ovine classical scrapie isolates and therefore suggest that the ability of PMCA to replace serial passage of classical scrapie in tg 338 mice may depend on the strain present in the initial source...|$|E

Of the 37 animals, 18 were from a herd consisting only of goats and 19 were from a herd of goats mixed with sheep. The goats studied were grouped {{on the basis of}} the presence or absence of clinical signs. Distinctive lesions and PrPSC (PrP, prion protein) deposition were found in the central nervous system (CNS) of eight clinically affected animals and six symptomless animals. The <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> and PrPSC distribution varied both between and within groups, variation being particularly pronounced in the symptomless goats. The results concerning the latter group suggested a poor correlation between the intensity of lesions, the amount of PrPSC in the CNS, and the manifestation of clinical signs. Immunohistochemical examination revealed 10 different PrPSC types, four of which are reported for the first time in goats. All scrapie-affected animals carried the VV 21 II 142 HH 143 RR 154 genotype, with the exception of two goats that carried the HR 143 dimorphism and had detectable PrPSC deposits. The results suggest that the histopathological and immunohistochemical profile of the natural disease in goats is influenced by the PrP genotype and age of the animals but may not be directly associated with the presence or otherwise of clinical signs.

40|$|Background: Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer in females in South Africa. The {{reporting}} of breast imaging has been standardised internationally using the Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS), which includes guidelines for reporting of breast lesions and further management. Ultrasound-guided core-needle breast (UGCNB) biopsy is a widely used method of obtaining histological diagnoses of breast lesions to assist with planning definitive management. Objectives: To perform an audit of the UGCNB biopsies performed at the Grey’s Hospital Mammography Department and assess the accuracy of the radiologists’ use of the BI-RADS scoring system. Methods: Records of all patients who underwent UGCNB biopsy between 01 January 2014 and 31 October 2015 were reviewed. A retrospective study was performed. Results: A total of 304 UGCNB biopsies were performed on 291 patients. The mean age was 49. 2 (s. d. = 15. 9) years. Tissue samples from 303 lesions were adequate for histological assessment, and of these, 51 % of the lesions were malignant whilst 49 % were benign. The most common malignant and benign diagnoses were invasive ductal carcinoma and fibroadenoma respectively. The BI-RADS scoring of the radiologists demonstrated a positive predictive value of 61. 6 % for the identification of possible malignant lesions. Conclusion: This study describes the patient and <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> and unit practices in a tertiary hospital setting in South Africa. The radiologists’ application of the BI-RADS scoring largely conforms to the BI-RADS guidelines.

Biochemical characteristics of PrPSc used to identify each strain include glycosylation profile, electrophoretic mobility, protease resistance, and sedimentation. In vivo, prion strains can be differentiated by the clinical signs, incubation period after inoculation and the <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles</b> in the brain of affected animals. Sources of prion strain diversity are the inherent conformational flexibility of the prion protein, the presence of PrP polymorphisms and inter-species transmissibility. The existence of the strain phenomenon is not only a scientific challenge, but it also represents a serious risk for public health. The dynamic nature and inter-relations between strains and the potential for the generation {{of a large number of}} new prion strains is the perfect recipe for the emergence of extremely dangerous new infectious agents...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the role of}} the CD 40 L-CD 40 pathway in a model of progressive atherosclerosis. ApoE-/- mice were treated with an anti-CD 40 L antibody or a control antibody for 12 wk. Antibody treatment started early (age 5 wk) or was delayed until after the establishment of atherosclerosis (age 17 wk). In both the early and delayed treatment groups, anti-CD 40 L antibody did not decrease plaque area or inhibit lesion initiation or age-related increase in lesion area. The morphology of initial lesions was not affected, except for a decrease in T-lymphocyte content. Effects of anti-CD 40 L antibody treatment on the morphology of advanced lesions were pronounced. In both the early and delayed treatment groups, T-lymphocyte content was significantly decreased. Furthermore, a pronounced increase in collagen content, vascular smooth muscle cell/myofibroblast content, and fibrous cap thickness was observed. In the delayed treatment group, a decrease in lipid core and macrophage content occurred. Interestingly, advanced lesions of anti-CD 40 L antibody-treated mice exhibited an increased transforming growth factor beta 1 immunoreactivity, especially in macrophages. In conclusion, both early and delayed treatment with an anti-CD 40 L antibody do not affect atherosclerotic lesion initiation but do result {{in the development of a}} lipid-poor collagen-rich stable plaque phenotype. Furthermore, delayed treatment with anti-CD 40 L antibody can transform the <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> from a lipid-rich to a lipid-poor collagen-rich phenotype. Postulated mechanisms of this effect on plaque phenotype are the down-regulation of proinflammatory pathways and up-regulation of collagen-promoting factors like transforming growth factor bet...|$|E
40|$|The agent {{responsible}} for prion disease may exist in different forms, {{commonly referred to}} as strains, with each carrying the specific information that determines its own distinct biological properties, such as incubation period and <b>lesion</b> <b>profile.</b> Biological strain typing of ovine scrapie isolates by serial passage in conventional mice has shown some diversity in ovine prion strains. However, this biological diversity remains poorly supported by biochemical prion strain typing. The protein-only hypothesis predicts that variation between different prion strains in the same host is manifest in different conformations adopted by PrPSc. Here we have investigated the molecular properties of PrPSc associated with two principal Prnpa mouse-adapted ovine scrapie strains, namely, RML and ME 7, in order to establish biochemical prion strain typing strategies that may subsequently be used to discriminate field cases of mouse-passaged ovine scrapie isolates. We used a conformation-dependent immunoassay and a conformational stability assay, together with Western blot analysis, to demonstrate that RML and ME 7 PrPSc proteins show distinct biochemical and physicochemical properties. Although RML and ME 7 PrPSc proteins showed similar resistance to proteolytic digestion, they differed in their glycoform profiles and levels of proteinase K (PK) -sensitive and PK-resistant isoforms. In addition, the PK-resistant core (PrP 27 - 30) of ME 7 was conformationally more stable following exposure to guanidine hydrochloride or Sarkosyl than was RML PrP 27 - 30. Our data show that mouse-adapted ovine scrapie strains can be discriminated by their distinct conformers of PrPSc, which provides a basis to investigate their diversity at the molecular level...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThis study evaluates {{outcomes}} and complications in patients treated with drug-eluting stents (DES) for “off-label” indications. BackgroundDrug-eluting stents {{have been effective}} in randomized trials, but their safety and efficacy for off-label indications has not been well studied. MethodsThe STENT (Strategic Transcatheter Evaluation of New Therapies) Registry is the largest multicenter U. S. registry evaluating outcomes of DES. Off-label indications included ostial, left main, long, bifurcation, and in-stent restenotic lesions, saphenous vein grafts, chronic total occlusions, small or large vessels, multilesion or multivessel percutaneous coronary interventions, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Outcomes were adjusted using Cox proportional hazards regression and propensity analyses. ResultsDrug-eluting stents were used in an off-label manner in 59 % of patients. The patients who received off-label treatment were more often male, had {{a higher incidence of}} prior infarction and bypass surgery, and lower ejection fractions. Off-label versus “on-label” use of DES was associated with higher rates of death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, major adverse cardiac events, and stent thrombosis at 9 months and 2 years. Off-label use of DES compared with off-label use of bare-metal stents (BMS) had lower rates of death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events at 9 months and 2 years and lower rates of stent thrombosis at 9 months. ConclusionsOff-label use of DES is associated with higher event rates compared with on-label use of DES, which is consistent with a higher risk clinical and <b>lesion</b> <b>profile.</b> However, event rates with off-label use of DES are lower compared with off-label use of BMS. Pending results from randomized trials, our data support the use of DES for off-label indications in selected patients...|$|E
40|$|Feline spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (FSE) {{is considered to}} be related to bovine {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) and has been reported in domestic cats as well as in captive wild cats including cheetahs, first in the United Kingdom (UK) and then in other European countries. In France, several cases were described in cheetahs either imported from UK or born in France. Here we report details of two other FSE cases in captive cheetah including a 2 (nd) case of FSE in a cheetah born in France, most likely due to maternal transmission. Complete prion protein immunohistochemical study on both brains and peripheral organs showed the close likeness between the two cases. In addition, transmission studies to the TgOvPrP 4 mouse line were also performed, for comparison with the transmission of cattle BSE. The TgOvPrP 4 mouse brains infected with cattle BSE and cheetah FSE revealed similar vacuolar <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles,</b> PrP(d) brain mapping with occurrence of typical florid plaques. Collectively, these data indicate that they harbor the same strain of agent as the cattle BSE agent. This new observation may have some impact on our knowledge of vertical transmission of BSE agent-linked TSEs such as in housecat FSE, or vCJD...|$|R
40|$|Pathogenesis of chronically {{developing}} {{alveolar echinococcosis}} (AE) {{is characterized by}} a continuous, granulomatous, periparasitic infiltration of immune cells surrounding the metacestode of Echinococcus multilocularis (E. multilocularis) in the affected liver. A detailed cytokine and chemokine profile analysis of the periparasitic infiltrate in the liver has, however, not yet been carried out in a comprehensive way all along the whole course of infection in E. multilocularis intermediate hosts. We thus assessed the hepatic gene expression profiles of 18 selected cytokine and chemokine genes using qRT-PCR in the periparasitic immune reaction and the subsequent adjacent, not directly affected, liver tissue of mice from day 2 to day 360 post intra-hepatic injection of metacestode. DNA microarray analysis was also used to get a more complete picture of the transcriptional changes occurring in the liver surrounding the parasitic <b>lesions.</b> <b>Profiles</b> of mRNA expression levels in the hepatic parasitic lesions showed that a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 immune response, characterized by the concomitant presence of IL- 12 a, IFN-c and IL- 4, was established very early in the development of E. multilocularis. Subsequently, the profile extended to a combined tolerogenic profile associating IL- 5, IL- 10 and TGF-b. IL- 17 was permanently expressed in the liver, mostly in the periparasitic infiltrate; this was confirmed by the increased mRNA expression of both IL- 17 A and IL- 17 F from a very earl...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{auditory}} hallucinations are often characterized by hearing voices and are then called auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). While AVHs have been extensively investigated in psychiatric patients suffering from schizophrenia, reports from neurological patients are rare and, in most cases, incomplete. Here, we characterize AVHs in 9 patients suffering from pharmacoresistant epilepsy {{by analyzing the}} phenomenology of AVHs and patients' neuropsychological and <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles.</b> From a cohort of 352 consecutively examined patients with epilepsy, 9 patients suffering AVHs were identified and studied {{by means of a}} semistructured interview, neuropsychological tests, and multimodal imaging, relying on a combination of functional and structural neuroimaging data and surface and intracranial EEG. We found that AVHs in patients with epilepsy were associated with prevalent language deficits and damage to posterior language areas and basal language areas in the left temporal cortex. Auditory verbal hallucinations, most of the times, consisted in hearing a single voice of the same gender and language as the patient and had specific spatial features, being, most of the times, perceived in the external space, contralateral to the lesion. We argue that the consistent location of AVHs in the contralesional external space, the prominence of associated language deficits, and the prevalence of lesions to the posterior temporal language areas characterize AVHs of neurological origin, distinguishing them from those of psychiatric origin...|$|R
40|$|Preeclampsia and {{intrauterine growth}} {{restriction}} are two separate disease entities that, according to numerous reports, share the same pathogenesis. In both, angiogenesis disorders and generalized inflammation are the dominant symptoms. In this study, we hypothesized that both diseases demonstrate the same profile in early preeclampsia, late preeclampsia, and {{intrauterine growth restriction}} patients, with the only difference being the degree of exacerbation of lesions. One hundred sixty-seven patients {{were enrolled in the}} study and divided into four groups: early preeclampsia, late preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction groups, and one control group. Concentrations of the angiogenesis and inflammatory markers soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 1, placental growth factor, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin- 6 were determined, and the behavior of these markers and correlations among them were studied. Higher concentrations of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 1, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin- 6 and a lower concentration of placental growth factor were observed in the study groups compared with the control group. No differences in concentrations of the studied markers were found among the study groups but significant correlations were observed. The higher values for the angiogenesis and inflammatory markers both in preeclampsia patients and patients with intrauterine growth restriction of placental origin compared with the control group suggest the existence of the same underlying disorders in the development of these pathologies. The observed mutual correlations for disordered angiogenesis and inflammatory markers are suggestive of a mutual relationship between these processes in the development of pathologies evolving secondary to placental ischemia. The same <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> was observed for both preeclampsia and 'placental' intrauterine growth restriction patients, which could be used in developing common diagnostic criteria for pregnant patients...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveIn glucose 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD) deficiency, decreased NADPH regeneration in the pentose phosphate pathway and subnormal {{levels of}} reduced glutathione result in insufficient antioxidant defense, increased susceptibility of {{red blood cells}} (RBCs) to oxidative stress, and acute hemolysis following exposure to pro-oxidant drugs and infections. Despite the fact that redox disequilibrium is a prominent feature of RBC storage lesion, {{it has been reported}} that the G 6 PD-deficient RBCs store well, at least in respect to energy metabolism, but their overall metabolic phenotypes and molecular linkages to the storability profile are scarcely investigated. MethodsWe performed UHPLC-MS metabolomics analyses of weekly sampled RBC concentrates from G 6 PD sufficient and deficient donors, stored in citrate phosphate dextrose/saline adenine glucose mannitol from day 0 to storage day 42, followed by statistical and bioinformatics integration of the data. ResultsOther than previously reported alterations in glycolysis, metabolomics analyses revealed bioactive lipids, free fatty acids, bile acids, amino acids, and purines as top variables discriminating RBC concentrates for G 6 PD-deficient donors. Two-way ANOVA showed significant changes in the storage-dependent variation in fumarate, one-carbon, and sulfur metabolism, glutathione homeostasis, and antioxidant defense (including urate) components in G 6 PD-deficient vs. sufficient donors. The levels of free fatty acids and their oxidized derivatives, as well as those of membrane-associated plasticizers were significantly lower in G 6 PD-deficient units in comparison to controls. By using the strongest correlations between in vivo and ex vivo metabolic and physiological parameters, consecutively present throughout the storage period, several interactomes were produced that revealed an interesting interplay between redox, energy, and hemolysis variables, which may be further associated with donor-specific differences in the post-transfusion performance of G 6 PD-deficient RBCs. ConclusionThe metabolic phenotypes of G 6 PD-deficient donors recapitulate the basic storage <b>lesion</b> <b>profile</b> that leads to loss of metabolic linkage and rewiring. Donor-related issues affect the storability of RBCs even in the narrow context of this donor subgroup in a way likely relevant to transfusion medicine...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Critical care {{patients}} frequently receive blood transfusions. Some reports show {{an association}} between aged or stored blood and increased morbidity and mortality, including the development of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). However, the existence of conflicting data endorses the need for research to either reject this association, or to confirm it and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Twenty-eight sheep were randomised into two groups, receiving saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Sheep were further randomised to also receive transfusion of pooled and heat-inactivated supernatant from fresh (Day 1) or stored (Day 42) non-leucoreduced human {{packed red blood cells}} (PRBC) or an infusion of saline. TRALI was defined by hypoxaemia during or within two hours of transfusion and histological evidence of pulmonary oedema. Regression modelling compared physiology between groups, and to a previous study, using stored platelet concentrates (PLT). Samples of the transfused blood products also underwent cytokine array and biochemical analyses, and their neutrophil priming ability was measured in vitro. RESULTS: TRALI did not develop in sheep that first received saline-infusion. In contrast, 80 % of sheep that first received LPS-infusion developed TRALI following transfusion with "stored PRBC. " The decreased mean arterial pressure and cardiac output as well as increased central venous pressure and body temperature were more severe for TRALI induced by "stored PRBC" than by "stored PLT. " Storage-related accumulation of several factors was demonstrated in both "stored PRBC" and "stored PLT", and was associated with increased in vitro neutrophil priming. Concentrations of several factors were higher in the "stored PRBC" than in the "stored PLT," however, there was no difference to neutrophil priming in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: In this in vivo ovine model, both recipient and blood product factors contributed to the development of TRALI. Sick (LPS infused) sheep rather than healthy (saline infused) sheep predominantly developed TRALI when transfused with supernatant from stored but not fresh PRBC. "Stored PRBC" induced a more severe injury than "stored PLT" and had a different storage <b>lesion</b> <b>profile,</b> suggesting that these outcomes may be associated with storage lesion factors unique to each blood product type. Therefore, the transfusion of fresh rather than stored PRBC may minimise the risk of TRALI. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Brain derived {{proteins}} such as 14 - 3 - 3, {{neuron-specific enolase}} (NSE), S 100 b, tau, phosphorylated tau and Aβ 1 – 42 {{were found to}} be altered in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) patients. The pathogenic mechanisms leading to these abnormalities are not known, but a relation to rapid neuronal damage is assumed. No systematic analysis on brain-derived proteins in the CSF and neuropathological <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles</b> has been performed. Methods CSF protein levels of brain-derived proteins and the degree of spongiform changes, neuronal loss and gliosis in various brain areas were analyzed in 57 CJD patients. Results We observed three different patterns of CSF alteration associated with the degree of cortical and subcortical changes. NSE levels increased with lesion severity of subcortical areas. Tau and 14 - 3 - 3 levels increased with minor pathological changes, a negative correlation was observed with severity of cortical lesions. Levels of the physiological form of the prion protein (PrP c) and Aβ 1 – 42 levels correlated negatively with cortical pathology, most clearly with temporal and occipital lesions. Conclusion Our results indicate that the alteration of levels of brain-derived proteins in the CSF does not only reflect the degree of neuronal damage, but it is also modified by the localization on the brain pathology. Brain specific lesion patterns have to be considered when analyzing CSF neuronal proteins. </p...|$|R
40|$|Variability of {{pathological}} phenotypes within classical sheep scrapie cases {{has been}} reported for some time, but in many instances it {{has been attributed to}} differences in the PRNP genotype of the host. To address this issue we have examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting (WB) for the disease-associated form of the prion protein (PrPd), the brains of 23 sheep from five European countries, all of which were of the same ARQ/ARQ genotype. As a result of IHC examinations, sheep were distributed into five groups with different phenotypes and the groups were the same regardless of the scoring method used, ‘long’ or ‘short’ PrPd profiling. The groups made did not respond to the geographical origin of the cases and did not correlate with the vacuolar <b>lesion</b> <b>profiles,</b> which showed a high individual variability. Discriminatory IHC and WB methods coincided to detect a ‘CH 1641 -like’ case but otherwise correlated poorly in the classification of disease phenotypes. No other polymorphisms of the PRNP gene were found that could account for the pathological differences, except perhaps for a sheep from Spain with a mutation at codon 103 and a unique pathological phenotype. Preliminary evidence indicates that those different IHC phenotypes correlate with distinct biological properties on bioassay, suggesting that they are indicative of strain diversity. We therefore conclude that natural scrapie strains exist and that they can be revealed by detailed pathological examinations, which can be harmonized between laboratories to produce comparable results...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOn MRI, focal {{cortical}} dysplasia (FCD) {{is characterized}} by a combination of increased cortical thickness, hyperintense signal within the dysplastic lesion, and blurred transition between gray and white matter (GM-WM). The visual identification of these abnormal characteristics may be difficult, and it is unclear to what degree these features occur among different FCD lesions. Our purpose was to investigate the pattern of occurrence of abnormal MRI characteristics in FCD by using a set of computational models and to generate quantitative <b>lesion</b> <b>profiling.</b> A set of voxel-wise operators was applied to high-resolution 3 D T 1 -weighted MRI in 23 patients with histologically proven FCD and 39 healthy controls, creating maps of GM thickness, maps of relative intensity highlighting areas with hyperintense signal, and maps of gradient magnitude modeling the GM-WM transition. All FCD lesions were segmented manually on the T 1 -weighted MRI. FCD volumes ranged from 734 mm 3 to 80, 726 mm 3 (mean, 8, 629 mm 3 +/- 16, 238). The manually segmented FCD lesions were used to estimate features in the lesional area and to determine possible local variations of each feature by means of a histogram. In 78 % of the patients, FCD lesions were characterized by simultaneous GM thickening, hyperintense signal, and blurring of the GM-WM transition. Moreover, in all patients, the FCD lesion had at least two of these three characteristics. The three features occurred regardless of the lesion volume, and they characterized not only large FCD lesions, but also subtle ones that had been overlooked by conventional radiologic inspection before surgery...|$|R
