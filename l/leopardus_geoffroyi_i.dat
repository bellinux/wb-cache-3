40|$|The Geoffroy's cat <b>Leopardus</b> <b>geoffroyi</b> (d'Orbigny & Gervais, 1844) {{is a small}} cat {{found in}} the Southern Cone of South America and, {{depending}} on the author, four or five subspecies have been usually recognized (L. g. geoffroyi, L. g. paraguae, L. g. euxanthus, L. g. salinarum and L. g. leucobaptus), mainly based on external morphological characters, such as color pattern of the pelage. In order to clarify the taxonomy of L. <b>geoffroyi,</b> <b>I</b> analyzed approximately 200 specimens housed in museums. I have examined the external and craniodental morphology in quantitative and qualitative terms {{in the search for}} patterns of congruent characters that would indicate the existence of taxonomic units. Twenty craniodental measurements were taken and tested by univariate and multivariate (MANOVA, PCA and DFA) procedures. In this study I detected a great variation in the morphological characters, and thus {{it was not possible to}} determine whether any of these were geographically consistent and could be used to determine any taxonomic unit. Based on this, I do not recognize any subspecific division for L. geoffroyi. Along its geographic range, a gradual and subtle change from one color pattern to the next along the latitude was detected, but the morphological characters that were used to define the putative subspecies were also detected in a same population. Furthermore, the present study is congruent with the results obtained by previous molecular data, suggesting that L. geoffroyi has a high level of genetic diversity with no geographic structure. This indicates the existence of a large panmictic population with no significant barriers to gene flow and, as a consequence, no subspecies should be recognized...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{wildlife}} of the Brazilian Pampa {{is threatened}} by large-scale habitat loss, due in particular {{to the expansion of}} soybean cultivation and the conversion of grasslands areas into extensive areas of silviculture. It is essential to study how the mammal fauna copes with the highly fragmented, human-influenced, non-protected landscape. Our study presents the results of a survey of the large- and medium-sized mammals of a typical human-influenced steppic savanna area of the Pampa biome. The survey was conducted exclusively with the use of camera traps over a period of 16 months. The relative frequencies of species in the area were evaluated. We recorded 18 species, some of them locally threatened (Tamandua tetradactyla, Alouatta caraya, <b>Leopardus</b> colocolo, <b>Leopardus</b> <b>geoffroyi,</b> <b>Leopardus</b> wiedii, Puma yagouaroundi, Mazama gouazoubira and Cuniculus paca).

40|$|Natural hybrid zones between {{distinct}} {{species have}} been reported for many taxa, but so far, few examples involve carnivores or Neotropical mammals in general. In this study, we employed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and nine microsatellite loci to identify and characterize a hybrid zone between two Neotropical felids, <b>Leopardus</b> <b>geoffroyi</b> and L. tigrinus, {{both of which are}} well-established species having diverged from each other c. 1 million years ago. These two felids are mostly allopatric throughout their ranges in South America, with a narrow contact zone that includes southern Brazil. We present strong evidence for the occurrence of hybridization between these species and identify at least 14 individuals (most of them originating from the geographical contact zone) exhibiting signs of interspecific genomic introgression. The genetic structure of Brazilian L. tigrinus populations seems to be affected by this introgression process, showing a gradient of differentiation from L. geoffroyi correlated with distance from the contact zone. We also corroborate and extend previous findings of hybridization between L. tigrinus and a third related felid, L. colocolo, leading to an unusual situation for a mammal, in which the former species contains introgressed mtDNA lineages from two distinct taxa in addition to its own...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWild felids {{are thought}} to share parasites with {{domestic}} cats. However, little is known of the coccidian parasites of wild felids. We investigated the presence of Sarcocystis spp. in tissues of 6 species of 90 Neotropical small felids killed in road accidents {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil by using microscopic and molecular techniques. Formalin-fixed tissues from 28 felids were examined, and Sarcocystis felis-like sarcocysts were detected in 4 wild cats (2 Puma yagouaroundi and 2 Leopardus guttulus). By transmission electron microscopy, sarcocysts from a P. yagouaroundi were identical to S. felis from domestic cats in the USA. Direct sequencing of PCR amplicons resulted the unambiguous sequences of the ITS- 1 region from 18 of the 31 PCR positive wild cats; 5 sequences from each P. yagouaroundi, and <b>Leopardus</b> <b>geoffroyi,</b> 4 sequences from L. guttulus, and 2 sequences from each Leopardus wiedii, and Leopardus colocolo.

40|$|Morphological {{variation}} in natural populations is a genomic test bed {{for studying the}} interface between molecular evolution and population genetics, {{but some of the}} most interesting questions involve non-model organisms that lack well annotated reference genomes. Many felid species exhibit polymorphism for melanism but the relative roles played by genetic drift, natural selection, and interspecies hybridization remain uncertain. We identify mutations of Agouti signaling protein (ASIP) or the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC 1 R) as independent causes of melanism in three closely related South American species: the pampas cat (Leopardus colocolo), the kodkod (Leopardus guigna), and Geoffroy’s cat (<b>Leopardus</b> <b>geoffroyi).</b> To assess population level {{variation in}} the regions surrounding the causative mutations we apply genomic resources from the domestic cat to carry out clone-based capture and targeted resequencing of 299 kb and 251 kb segments that contain ASIP and MC 1 R, respectively, from 54 individuals (13 – 21 per species), achieving enrichment of ~ 500 – 2500 -fold and ~ 150 x coverage. Our analysis points to unique evolutionary histories {{for each of the three}} species, with a strong selective sweep in the pampas cat, a distinctive but short melanism-specific haplotype in the Geoffroy’s cat, and reduced nucleotide diversity for both ancestral and melanism-bearing chromosomes in the kodkod.

While most carnivore species are negatively affected, {{the impact of}} habitat changes is expected to depend on their ecological flexibility. We aimed to identify key factors affecting the habitat use by four sympatric carnivore species in landscapes of central Argentina. Camera trapping surveys were carried out at 49 sites from 2011 to 2013. Each site was characterized by 12 habitat attributes, including human disturbance and fragmentation. Four landscape gradients were created from Principal Component Analysis and their influence on species-specific habitat use was studied using Generalized Linear Models. We recorded 74 events of Conepatus chinga, 546 of Pseudalopex gymnocercus, 193 of <b>Leopardus</b> <b>geoffroyi</b> and 45 of Puma concolor. We found that the gradient describing sites away from urban settlements and {{with low levels of}} disturbance had the strongest influence. L. geoffroyi was the only species responding significantly to the four gradients and showing a positive response to modified habitats, which could be favored by the low level of persecution by humans. P. concolor made stronger use of most preserved sites with low proportion of cropland, even though the species also used sites with an intermediate level of fragmentation. A more flexible use of space was found for C. chinga and P. gymnocercus. Our results demonstrate that the impact of human activities spans across this guild of carnivores and that species-specific responses appear to be mediated by ecological and behavioral attributes...|$|R

Analyses of habitat factors affecting occupancy and detection of mammalian species have not been conducted in the Paraguayan Chaco. To address this gap in the literature and provide conservation recommendations, I estimated site occupancy rates using species-specific detection probabilities for focal mammalian species at 3 study sites in the Chaco ecoregion of Paraguay. During remote camera surveys conducted August - November 2011 - 2012, I used photographic data and model selection techniques to assess the influence of different survey and site covariates on occupancy of several focal mammalian species: maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), Geoffroy 2 ̆ 7 s cat (<b>Leopardus</b> <b>geoffroyi),</b> puma (Puma concolor), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), pampas fox (Lycalopex gymnocercus), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), and giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla). I recorded 2, 034 photographs of 24 mammalian species at 64 camera sites; among those, 1, 353 photographs and 529 independent survey-detections were of these 9 focal species. Detection of maned wolves and peccaries was higher in 2011 than 2012; other species did not show significant differences in detection by year.

While {{studies have shown}} that domestic cats (Felis catus) are often asymptomatic carriers of dermatophytes, and thus a significant source of infection, this aspect has not been studied in relation to their wild relatives. The present study was aimed at determining the presence of dermatophytes on the haircoat of healthy wild felids, kept in captivity at "Fundação Parque Zoológico de São Paulo". Samples were taken from 130 adult animals of both sexes: 25 lions (Panthera leo), 12 tigers (Panthera tigris), 6 jaguars (Panthera onca), 4 leopards (Panthera pardus), 2 snow leopards (Panthera uncia), 2 pumas (Puma concolor), 2 cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), 1 ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), 28 tiger cats (Leopardus tigrinus), 10 margays (Leopardus wiedii), 8 geoffroy's cats (<b>Leopardus</b> <b>geoffroyi),</b> 22 jaguarundis (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) and 8 pampas cats (Oncifelis colocolo). The samples were obtained by rubbing the haircoat of the animals with squares of sterile carpet, and then seeded onto Petri dishes containing Mycobiotic agar (Difco™). The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 4 weeks. The isolates were subcultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 mg/L) and cultured on slides for posterior identification by their macro- and microscopic characteristics.

40|$|Cooperative {{behavior}} in reproductive contexts is rare among animals, especially males. Tamarins exhibit a rare breeding system called cooperative polyandry, {{in which a}} single breeding female mates with two or more males to produce fraternal twins and the males cooperate in caring for the infants by carrying young for the first 10 weeks of their lives. This peculiar breeding system {{raises questions about the}} adaptive consequences of male behavior. The nature of the breeding system also prompts questions about the ecological context and genetic consequences of this social organization. My research attempted address fundamental questions in behavior, ecology and evolutionary biology through the lens of individual behavior. Tamarins oftentimes inhabit disturbed habitats, however detailed space use within fragmented habitats is not well characterized. I used fine scale spatial and behavioral data in order to quantify habitat preference of S. geoffroyi in a heterogenous urban-forest landscape in central Panama. Using home range- based analyses and a novel method, first passage time analysis, I showed that tamarins spend significantly more time in secondary forest habitat {{and are more likely to}} forage and engage in social {{behavior in}} forest as compared to human-modified habitats. 	I examined the role of two aquatic barriers of varying age in creating population genetic structure in S. <b>geoffroyi.</b> <b>I</b> found that there was significant population differentiation across the Chagres River, an older, established riverine barrier and smaller, but detectable population structure across the Panama Canal, a recent anthropogenic riverine barrier. Finally, I examined the possible adaptive benefits of cooperative male parental care using genetic analyses of paternity and relatedness. I found that males in a group are often related and that they share paternity over multi-year associations.

40|$|Animals {{living in}} groups are {{frequently}} exposed to {{conflicts of interest}} which can escalate into aggression. Aggressive interactions may be a means to resolve incompatibility among objectives. Nevertheless, aggression may undermine the benefits of group living by disrupting the relationships between opponents. Thus, conflict management mechanisms have evolved {{to cope with the}} potential damage brought about by aggressive interactions. The aim of my thesis was to investigate the mechanisms to prevent aggressive escalation and to mitigate its negative consequences in 2 communities of wild spider monkeys (Ateles <b>geoffroyi</b> yucanensis). <b>I</b> also examined the factors, such as relationship characteristics, affecting the occurrence of these mechanisms. Spider monkeys live in communities {{with a high degree of}} fission fusion dynamics in which individuals frequently split and merge into subgroups of variable composition. The implications of this social system for conflict management were also explored. To characterise spider monkeys’ social relationships, two components were identified and labelled compatibility and risk. These components were further related to relationship characteristics, such as kinship, sex combinations, and tenure in the community. Kin had more compatible relationships than non kin, but there was no difference for risk. Male-male dyads were characterised as being significantly more compatible and riskier than either female-female dyads or male-female dyads. Furthermore, individuals with longer tenure had riskier relationships than individuals with shorter tenure. Among the post-conflict management mechanisms spider monkeys did not engage in reconciliation, redirected aggression, or bystander affiliation. However, an option afforded by their high degree of fission fusion dynamics was used in the aftermath of aggression. Fission from former aggressors was more likely to occur within one hour of the aggressive conflicts than in control periods. Furthermore, individuals sharing riskier and less compatible relationships had significantly shorter latencies to fission compared to those with less risky and more compatible relationships. These patterns suggest that fission may function to reduce the possibility of renewed aggression and cope with increased post-conflict anxiety. Indeed, anxiety levels were higher in the recipients of aggression during the first 5 post-conflict minutes compared to baseline levels. Whereas fission may be a mechanism to cope with the negative consequences of aggressive escalation, fusion of subgroups could lead to uncertainty and hostility. Indeed, aggression increased in the first five post-fusion minutes compared to baseline levels. There was also an increase in post-fusion friendly behaviours, which may function as signals of good intentions. This view was confirmed as post-fusion aggression was reduced when friendly behaviours took place. In addition, shorter latencies of post-fusion aggression and friendly behaviours were found between individuals with riskier relationships compared to those with less risky relationships. Prevention of aggressive conflicts may also be achieved by adjusting subgroup size to the availability of feeding resources thereby reducing competition. The effectiveness of this flexible adjustment was demonstrated during a period of drastic reduction in food sources caused by two consecutive hurricanes at the field site. Mean subgroup size and fusion rates were significantly reduced in the post-hurricane compared to pre-hurricane periods. Hence, my thesis adds to the study of social relationships and conflict management in non-human animals by making several contributions. I provided the first evidence of relationship components in new world monkeys. I then examined the potential of fission-fusion dynamics as a means to manage conflicts among community members. I was the first demonstrating that fission is a post-conflict mechanism. Fission from the former aggressor was especially used by individuals with riskier and less compatible relationships. Subgroup fusion increased aggressive conflicts, especially between individuals with riskier relationships, but post-fusion friendly behaviours reduced them. The effectiveness of fission-fusion dynamics in conflict management was further demonstrated by how the spider monkeys coped with the potential increase in conflict among community members due to a dramatic reduction in food supplies due to two hurricanes. Overall, spider monkeys appear to deal with conflicts using the full range of the flexible social options afforded by their social system.
