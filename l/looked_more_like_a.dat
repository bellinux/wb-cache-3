5|$|When {{the puppet}} for Marion was first created, he was {{depicted}} as having stripy fur, but <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mouse {{in the eyes}} of the crew, so his puppet was changed. Marion's image was based on topless photos of the comic actor James Corden.|$|E
5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn thought he <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood {{was offered a}} playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything {{to escape from the}} mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E

25|$|From {{at least}} {{the late nineteenth century}} in Europe, there was {{speculation}} that the range of human sexual response <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> continuum than two or three discrete categories. Berlin sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld published a scheme in 1896 that measured the strength of an individual's sexual desire on two independent 10-point scales, A (homosexual) and B (heterosexual). A heterosexual individual may be A0, B5; a homosexual individual may be A5, B0; an asexual would be A0, B0; and someone with an intense attraction to both sexes would be A9, B9.|$|E
25|$|After the 22nd session, in April 1903, the Meetings of {{the group}} (by this time known as Bogoiskateli, or God-seekers) were {{cancelled}} by the procurator of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Konstantin Pobedonostsev's decree, the main reason being Merezhkovsky's frequent visits to places of mass sectarian settlements where God-seekers' radical ideas of Church 'renovation' were becoming popular. In Novy Put things changed too: {{with the arrival of}} strong personalities like Nikolai Berdyayev, Sergey Bulgakov and Semyon Frank the magazine solidified its position, yet drifted away from its originally declared mission. In the late 1904 Merezhkovsky and Gippius quit Novy Put, remaining on friendly terms with its new leaders and their now highly influential 'philosophy section'. In 1907 the Meetings revived under the new moniker of The Religious-Philosophical Society, Merezhkovsky once again promoting his 'Holy Ghost's Kingdom Come' ideas. This time it <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> literary circle than anything it had ever purported to be.|$|E

500|$|Some events {{disturbed}} {{the project}} {{while working on}} Sarge, as Debian servers were attacked by fire and hackers. One {{of the most memorable}} was the Vancouver prospectus. After a meeting held in Vancouver, release manager Steve Langasek announced a plan {{to reduce the number of}} supported ports to four in order to shorten future release cycles. There was a large reaction because the proposal <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> decision and because such a drop would damage Debian's aim to be [...] "the universal operating system".|$|E
500|$|Squires {{drops his}} cup, as Nina {{continues}} {{to fill in}} the crossword, including SOWERBERRY and KNOWITALL. Squires is apparently paralysed in his chair, watching. Nina reveals herself as a marine biologist, and has acquired tetrodotoxin from a pufferfish, which causes paralysis and asphyxiation. Simon was actually Nina's brother, and is visible on the photo of Squires and his wife. Simon had reached a crosswording final only to be beaten by Squires after the latter challenged that a u <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> v. Depressed by the trivial defeat, Simon had killed himself. Squires, to Nina's shock, is unharmed. He leaps up to fill out NEUN and ASPS, revealing the nina ISWAPPEDCUPS within the crossword. As Nina induces vomiting, Squires makes a phone call. He had been warned by Dr Jacob Tyler, an old friend and Nina's supervisor. Squires places Nina—for whom paralysis is setting in—on a chair, and goes back to the crossword, filling out UNDERSLIP.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer of}} Rap-Up {{magazine}} wrote Beyoncé was [...] "spread the love" [...] with the [...] "feel-good clip". Idolator's Mike Wass said [...] "Happily [...] is as gorgeous {{as the song}} with Terry Richardson simply filming Bey living it up at Coney Island. It's almost too perfect." [...] In another review, he also hailed it as [...] "carefree, neon-drenched" [...] {{and one of the}} best clips on the whole album adding that it <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> home movie than a music video which was [...] "part of its immense appeal". Rob Harvilla from Spin magazine described it as [...] "the sweetest" [...] video on the album. Chris Martins from the same publication wrote that the video is [...] "all pretty huge and heartwarming". Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph found [...] "happy innocence" [...] in the clip. Kory Grow from Rolling Stone noted that the clip was a [...] "fun video for a likewise song" [...] further saying that the hand choreography was Beyoncé's version of a similar dance from the song [...] "Y.M.C.A." [...] (1978) by Village People.|$|E

2500|$|Marrero's pitches were {{primarily}} [...] "slow stuff—curves, sliders and knucklers." [...] Roberto González Echevarría provides the following description: [...] "A bit plump, {{of less than}} average height, with short arms and small hands, Marrero looked, in uniform, like someone in a baseball costume, not a player. He <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Spanish grocer or peasant than an athlete." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Peninsular War against Napoleon, {{despite the}} last absolutist claims {{during the reign}} of Ferdinand VII, gave birth to a new country with a liberal and bourgeois character, open to {{influences}} coming from the rest of Europe. Madrid, the capital of Spain, experienced like no other city the changes caused by this opening and filled with theatres, cafés and newspapers. Madrid was frequently altered by revolutionary outbreaks and pronouncements, such as Vicálvaro 1854, led by General Leopoldo O'Donnell [...] and initiating the progressive biennium. [...] However, in the early 20th century Madrid <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small town than a modern city. During the first third of the 20th century the population nearly doubled, reaching more than 850,000 inhabitants. New suburbs such as Las Ventas, Tetuán and El Carmen became the homes of the influx of workers, while Ensanche became a middle-class neighbourhood of Madrid.|$|E

2500|$|The band auditioned {{dozens of}} {{replacements}} for Criss in June 1980. One {{of the many}} who auditioned was Tico Torres (who would later be with Bon Jovi). They finally settled on a little-known drummer-guitarist-pianist-keyboardist-singer from Brooklyn named Paul Charles Caravello (born July 12, 1950) who adopted the stage name Eric Carr. His first make-up design was modeled on a hawk, though it was rejected as Stanley felt it <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> chicken. Carr ultimately settled on a [...] "Fox" [...] persona. In his Fox make-up, he was introduced on ABC's Kids Are People Too!, and debuted with the group on July 25, 1980, at the Palladium concert hall in New York City. This was Kiss's only U.S. show in support of Unmasked. The band's 1980 tour of Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, {{was one of the}} biggest in their history, as they played to sold-out crowds and received overwhelmingly positive press coverage.|$|E
2500|$|Dimitri and Erica's romance {{has often}} been {{attributed}} to featuring fairy tale aspects. Erica on her own always acted like a [...] "little princess" [...] (as Nick Davis dubbed her). [...] Though Dimitri is a Hungarian Count, he is {{sometimes referred to as}} a prince by Erica and the writers. This point was driven home by their location shoot in Budapest where they fell in love, with the city's Old World beauty as their backdrop. For their weddings All My Children made sure they did it up [...] "in pure fairy-tale style in an elaborate wedding that took its cue from Dimitri's Hungarian ancestors." [...] According to Carol Luiken (All My Children former costume designer), the show [...] "wanted to do kind of a European princess design" [...] for Erica's dress. The effect was so successful that [...] "Erica <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> queen than a princess." [...] The same idea was in mind for Erica's second wedding gown, dubbed [...] "the Guenevere dress." [...] Crowns were used for their second wedding ceremony which was done in a Russian Orthodox style.|$|E
2500|$|Plastic Slinkys {{are also}} available. They {{can be made}} in {{different}} colors. Many of them are made with the colors of the rainbow in rainbow order. They were marketed in the 1970s as a safer alternative to metal slinkys as they did not present a hazard when inserted into electrical sockets. The plastic spring toy, known as the Plastic Slinky was invented by Donald James Reum Sr. of Master Mark Plastics in Albany, Minnesota. Reum {{came up with the idea}} as he was playing with different techniques to produce a spiral hose for watering plants. [...] However, as it came off the assembly line, according to his children, it <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Slinky." [...] He worked at it until it came out perfectly and then went to Betty James with his prototype. Reum manufactured the Plastic Slinky for Betty James for several years. [...] Eventually Betty James [...] decided to manufacture the product exclusively through James manufacturing, effectively ending the production of the toy by the small Minnesota company. Reum’s patent number, 4120929 was filed on Dec 28, 1976 and issued by the US Patent Office on Oct 17, 1978.|$|E

2500|$|In a rough {{game between}} the Blue Devils and Tar Heels that {{featured}} blood and broken bones, Duke used an early 9–0 run to take a 16–11 lead with 12:55 {{to go in the}} first half. Hubert Davis' three-point play capped off a Carolina run to give the Tar Heels a 20–19 lead. [...] The teams exchanged the lead 10 times before a Thomas Hill baseline jumper gave the Blue Devils a 39–38 halftime lead. [...] The Tar Heels opened the second half with a 10–0 spurt, but then saw its offense disappear. [...] Duke went five minutes before scoring a second-half basket but fought back with tough defense, holding Carolina without a field goal over the last 9½ minutes of the game. Carolina hit 12 of 14 free throws during that stretch; including two by Derrick Phelps with 44.5 seconds remaining to give the Tar Heels a 75–73 lead. Christian Laettner had two shots to tie the game in the final 24 seconds, but missed both. [...] However, the lasting image from this game had to be Carolina's Eric Montross who took a couple of rough elbows to the face and <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> boxer than a center as he sank two late free throws with blood streaming down his face. Bobby Hurley broke his foot during the game, but continued playing. Brian Davis led Duke with 16 points, while Davis scored 16 for Carolina.|$|E
