60|$|LORD AUGUSTUS. [Coming up to LORD WINDERMERE.] Want {{to speak}} to you particularly, dear boy. I'm worn to a shadow. Know I don't look it.

Demmed nuisance, relations! But they make one so demmed respectable.|$|E

But for the general result we rejoice. Ladysmith, too, is proud and happy. Only ten thousand of us, and <b>look</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do! A little reproachfully, perhaps; for it is dull work fighting week after week without alcohol or green vegetables.|$|E

5000|$|They {{are also}} {{distinct}} from standard deductive and inductive forms of reasoning. Where a standard deductive argument <b>looks</b> for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can deduce {{from the fact}} of X, and a standard inductive argument <b>looks</b> for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can infer from experience of X, a transcendental argument looks for the necessary prior conditions to both the fact and experience of X. Thus, [...] "I entitle transcendental all knowledge which is occupied not so much with objects as with the mode of our knowledge of objects insofar as this mode of knowledge is to be possible a priori." [...] (Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, Introduction, VII).|$|R

50|$|The show premiered in London in 2006 at the New End Theatre and {{was later}} {{presented}} at Victory Gardens Greenhouse Theater in Chicago in 2008. Several changes were made when the show moved to Chicago. The song The Time is Coming was replaced by The Pool Guy, Chapter 17 replaced by Self Portrait and the finale Suddenly by All About Today. The plot was also extensively re-written by Wythe to introduce a pregnancy for the character of Kat. Also, the song <b>Look</b> <b>What</b> <b>We</b> Made was originally sung by the characters of Jack and Catherine, but in Chicago it became a song for the two men, Jack and John, thinking about their son {{and the son of}} the future respectively.|$|E

5000|$|Bryan Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, and Michael Feit Dougan {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for Public Access. Singer directed the screenplay in 1992 {{on a budget}} of $250,000 and with a schedule of 18 days. [...] The crew used leftover film stock from Dracula and Hoffa. [...] The director recalled the production experience, [...] "Chris and I look at that film and wince a little. Part of our reaction is, 'Wow, <b>look</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did then. It was so small and undeveloped.' Part of it is reliving {{the circumstances of the}} days we filmed each scene. This production was fraught with 100 times more turmoil than Usual Suspects—every day was a crisis. And then we also feel very nostalgic about it." [...] Singer compared Public Accesss themes to his follow-up film The Usual Suspects, [...] "The two films are similar in the notion of things not always being what they seem. They're also about audiences' projections on a stranger. In many ways, Verbal in The Usual Suspects is an extension of Whiley, by being a foil for our projections. Both films are about telling stories and provoking, which segues into my style—using sound and images and music to create tension." ...|$|E

40|$|Researchers' {{performances}} {{in the field are}} gendered, classed, and ethnicized. We are watched and judged by our respondents based on how we <b>look,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> say, and how we say it. Our appearance in the field may increase or decrease our chances of creating rapport, it may encourage respondents to talk to us or discourage them entirely from taking part in our research. Whereas we have no absolute control over all the factors determining how we present ourselves in the field, we do have some power over our dress. Although the act of getting dressed for fieldwork may appear inconspicuous and mundane, I argue in this article that its implications are most relevant for our thinking about how we design and perform fieldwork. Particularly the assumptions regarding our respondents' and our own class, gender, and ethnicity that we make before entering the field are worthy of careful consideration as they display our thought processes and, as such, are part of academic analysis.

40|$|John Boyd, USAF, {{wanted to}} {{understand}} why U. S. fighter pilots consistently won air combat engagements with their F- 86 fighter aircraft in combat over Korea against pilots that flew Mig- 15 aircraft with better maneuverability. His work {{came to be known}} as the OODA Loop or Boyd Cycle 1. For these authors, the thought that a study on how fighter pilot decision-making in air-to-air combat during the Korean War had crept into a presentation on information superiority at the turn of the century was intriguing and suggested a closer <b>look.</b> <b>What</b> <b>we</b> discovered were logical stepping stones that led us from “fighter pilot decision-making ” to previous discussions on “information overload” and from that to another CCRT presentation on the “cognitive hierarchy. ” The final stepping stone for this paper was the authors ’ abilities to mature this stepping stone process into a discussion of the methodology, applications and uses of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA&D) techniques to solve the problem of information overload. The authors have long been advocates of common shared data for the description and assessment of architectures, interoperability and information assurance. This paper continues that advocacy. 1.

40|$|The Daily and Ehrlich article presents, as expected, a {{detailed}} account of the myriad interrelationships between development, global change (notably population growth and global warming), environment and disease.
