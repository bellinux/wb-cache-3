40|$|This paper {{challenges}} the prevailing {{view of the}} neutrality of the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share</b> to labour demand, and investigates {{its impact on the}} evolution of employment. Whilst maintaining the assumption of a unitary long-run elasticity of wages with respect to productivity, we demonstrate that productivity growth affects the labour share in the long run due to frictional growth (that is, the interplay of wage dynamics and productivity growth). In the light of this result, we consider a stylised labour demand equation and show that the labour share is a driving force of employment. We substantiate our analytical exposition by providing empirical models of wage setting and employment equations for France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the UK, and the US over the 1960 - 2008 period. Our findings show that the timevarying labour share of these countries has significantly influenced their employment trajectories across decades. This indicates that the evolution of the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share</b> (or, equivalently, the wage-productivity gap) deserves the attention of policy makers.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{proliferation}} in research aimed at assessing monetary policy rules using macroeconomic models built from explicit micro-foundations. In many versions of these models, pricing behaviour is described by a ``new-Keynesian Phillips curve,'' which relates inflation to expected future inflation and a driving variable related to production costs. Woodford (2001) has presented evidence that the new-Keynesian Phillips curve fits the empirical behaviour of U. S. inflation well when the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share</b> {{is used as a}} driving variable, but fits poorly when deterministically detrended output is used. He concludes that the output gap [...] -the deviation between actual and potential output [...] -is better captured by the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share,</b> in turn implying that central banks should raise interest rates in response to increases in the labour share. We show that the empirical evidence generally suggests that the labour share version of the new-Keynesian Phillips curve is a very poor model of U. S. price inflation. We conclude that there is little reason to view the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share</b> as a good measure of the output gap, or as an appropriate variable for incorporation in a monetary policy rule. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} about the sources of growth in income in Australia {{and the effects of}} {{structural}} change on the distribution of income between labour and capital. The main objective is to find an explanation for the fall in the labour share of income in Australia in the 2000 s. Key points 	The labour share of income fell by 4 or more percentage points in the 2000 s. 	However, labour was no worse off in the process. 	 		Labour income grew at a faster rate in the 2000 s than in the 1990 s through stronger growth in both wages and employment. 	 	 	The <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share</b> only fell because capital income growth accelerated even more. 	The rise in the terms of trade meant that product prices rose faster than consumer prices. While labour received a smaller share of income at product prices, the slower growth in consumer prices meant that the real value of each dollar earned was worth more in terms of its purchasing power. This purchasing power effect (which was available to all income earners) more than outweighed the apparent reduction in labour 2 ̆ 7 s share of national income. 	The large rise in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s terms of trade brought strong growth in real income —even stronger than the growth in the 2 ̆ 7 productivity decade 2 ̆ 7 of the 1990 s. 	 		This provided scope for growth in both labour and capital income to rise. 	 	 	Other high-income countries also experienced a decline in the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share,</b> but driven by a different set of factors. In other countries, growth in labour income has suffered. 	The mining boom was overwhelmingly responsible for the fall in labour share in Australia: 	 		Development of mining and associated capacity added to the economy 2 ̆ 7 s capital stock, leading to more capital-intensive production overall. 		Higher output prices for minerals (and construction) reduced the real cost of labour so that growth in real wages fell behind labour productivity growth. 	 	 	The two other industries most affected by the mining boom — Construction and Manufacturing — served to increase the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share.</b> 	 		In Manufacturing, a slowdown in capital income growth meant the industry contributed more to labour income than to capital income at the aggregate level. 		Construction had stronger growth in capital income than in labour income. However, because the industry is labour intensive, growth in Construction 2 ̆ 7 s labour income had a greater effect on aggregate labour income than growth in its capital income had on aggregate capital income. 	 	 	As the terms of trade now decline, the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share</b> will rise. But with a more capital-intensive economy, the share is unlikely to revert fully to previous levels. 	Action to restore the old <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share</b> or to recover 2 ̆ 7 lost 2 ̆ 7 income share through wage rises would probably only have adverse consequences for employment and inflation and for industries already facing adjustment pressures. 	With the prospect of declining terms of trade, a focus on productivity growth will be the way to sustain growth in real wages...|$|E

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have found that estimating the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) using the output gap to proxy for real marginal cost tends to produce a counter-intuitive coefficient sign in the model, whereas using the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share</b> produces the expected coefficient sign.

40|$|Despite similar {{levels of}} per capita income, {{education}} and technology, {{the development of}} <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>shares</b> in OECD countries has displayed different patterns since 1960. The paper examines the role of demography in this regard. We first use a standard overlapping generations model to derive the mechanisms by which demographic change can affect the labour share. It turns out that demographic change can affect the labour share either by altering the domestic capital intensity, by causing factor-biased technological change or in a small open economy framework by creating a gap between domestic savings and investments. The latter affects the country's investments abroad and in return its net foreign asset income which directly leads {{to changes in the}} labour share. Empirical estimations based on these insights, provide evidence that an increases in the expected retirement durations and old-age dependency ratios as well as declines in labour force growth rates have indeed been major forces behind the decline in labour shares that took place in many countries.

40|$|This article proposes an analysis, {{which we}} {{consider}} extremely {{useful in the}} current economic context, {{of the evolution of}} <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> fiscality, more precisely, the effect of the public debt growth on the tax wedge for the <b>labour</b> <b>income.</b> The <b>share</b> of fiscal revenues from direct taxes, indirect taxes and social contributions is relatively close in the old member states of the European Union in comparison with the new member states, which register a lower level of income from direct taxes. The low level of income from direct taxes is compensated by more significant shares of the social contributions or indirect taxes. The main motivations of cross-border migration are: a successful career in a multinational corporation, high variations of the tax rate, of the salary income between states and, last but not least, the level of the net salary. To this day, there are no plans to harmonize across the European Union the legislation regarding the taxes wages and the social security contributions.

40|$|The paper {{questions}} the predominant view on unemployment and wages in the European Union {{according to which}} high unemployment is primarily caused by labour market rigidities, i. e. social institutions and regulations which prevent ?market-clearing? real wage levels and structures.

Analysing the developments in the EU during the last four decades, no strictly inverse relationship between real wage growth and unemployment can be found. On the contrary, persistently high unemployment has had strong adverse effects on nominal wage growth and on the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share.</b> Weakened labour union bargaining power and changing collective bargaining strategies have contributed to this result.

Instead of imposing rational expectations, direct measures, ie OECD forecasts, are used to proxy economic agents’ inflation expectations. Real marginal costs are measured in three different ways.

Moreover, the driving variable enters the estimated, purely forward-looking, New Keynesian Phillips curve with the correct sign, but it is clearly outperformed by the New Classical and Hybrid Phillips curves. We interpret our results as indicating that the European inflation process is not purely forward-looking, so that inflation cannot instantaneously adjust to new information. Consequently, even allowing for possible non-rationality in expectations, a lagged inflation term enters the New Keynesian Phillips curve for European inflation dynamics. The inflation process seems to have become more forward-looking {{in the recent years}} of low and stable inflation.

40|$|The {{severity}} of the financial and economic crisis which started in 2007 cannot be understood without examining the medium- to long-run developments {{in the world economy}} since the early 1980 s. The following long-run causes for the crisis can be identified: inefficient regulation of financial markets, increasing inequality in the distribution of income, and rising imbalances at the global (and at the Euro area) level. The focus of the paper is on the changes in distribution triggered by ‘finance-dominated capitalism’ embedded in a ‘neo-liberal’ policy stance since the early 1980 s. The three dimensions of re-distribution in the course of ‘financialisation’ and ‘neo-liberalism’ are examined: functional distribution, personal distribution and the development of top incomes. Since the development of functional income distribution is considered to be most important, the channels through which ‘financialisation’ and ‘neo-liberalism’ have contributed to the tendency of the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> <b>share</b> to fall are identified, the effects of re-distribution on aggregate demand and growth are discussed, and the relationship between re-distribution at the expense of labour and regional (Euro area wide) and global current account imbalances are addressed.

40|$|This paper aims at {{identifying}} the labour share (wage-productivity gap) {{as a major}} factor in the evolution of inequality and employment. To this end, we use annual data for the US, UK and Sweden over the past forty years and estimate country-specific systems of labour demand and Gini coefficient equations. Further to the statistical significance of our models, we validate their economic significance through counterfactual simulations. In particular, we evaluate the contributions of the labour share to the trajectories of inequality and employment during specific time intervals in the post- 1990 years. We find that during the nineties the cost of a one percent increase in employment was in the range of 0. 7 %- 0. 9 % higher inequality in all three countries. However, in the 2000 s, whereas the inequality-employment sensitivity ratio slightly fell in the US, it exceeded unity in the countries on the other side of the Atlantic. It obtained its highest value in the UK, where a 1 % growth in employment was achieved at the expense of 1. 3 % worsening in income inequality.

We take a macroeconomic perspective and examine four channels of transmission of financialisation to the macroeconomy: first, the effect on income distribution, second, the effects on investment in capital stock, third, the effects on household debt and consumption, and fourth, the effects on net exports and current account balances. For each of these channels we briefly review some empirical and econometric literature supporting the presumed channels, some theoretical and modelling literature examining the macroeconomic effects via these channels, and finally, we present small models generating the most important macroeconomic effects.

However, each type of these regimes, the 'debt-led consumption boom' type and the 'export-led mercantilist' type, contains internal contradictions, with respect to household debt in the first regime and with respect to foreign debt of the counterpart current account deficit countries in the second regime, which finally undermine the sustainability of these regimes and lead to financial and economic crises...|$|E

With respect to private saving, the mechanism is tax reform – a lower tax on interest income.

This fact may make it difficult to ensure that those with only <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> will <b>share</b> in the spoils. An alternative is to concentrate on public saving. Ultimately, deficit reduction makes possible lower taxes and/or higher transfer payments across the board. This reasoning suggests that debt reduction may be the more equitable government initiative. But there are other options such as investing in human capital and altering the population growth rate through immigration policy. The latter option is pursued in this paper. According to the standard neoclassical growth model, a lower population growth rate raises steady-state living standards, but things are more complicated in an optimization-based overlapping-generations context. This paper extends Blanchard’s constantplanning- horizon model of disjoint agents to allow for retirement, a subset of the population that remains liquidity constrained, and various taxes and transfers – in a small open-economy setting. Tax reform, debt reduction and population growth policies are compared in an internally consistent manner. For each policy, both the immediate and steady-state effects are derived, and the present value of the entire time path for consumption between these two end-points is also analyzed (for all three policy initiatives). A calibrated version of the model is used to identify policy combinations that can deliver long-term gain without short-term pain, and without problems for the hand-to-mouth subset of the population. ...|$|R

The most difficult aspect of the empirical analysis is the approximation of <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> risk as a proxy variable for future <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> uncertainty. Individual disposable income is interacted with the probability of being unemployed and with the probability of job-loss in the next period to generate the <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> risk variables. The econometric results support the precautionary saving hypothesis and <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> risk emerges {{as one of the}} main determinants of household saving decisions. Moreover, households implement alternative strategies to smooth their income streams such as holding a second job and increasing the number of income earners in the family. However, it is observed that they are still vulnerable against <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> risk, which underlines the need for a satisfactory social security system.

In light of this, we examine quantitatively the extent of progressivity or regressivity of optimal <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> taxation in a model with skill heterogeneity, endogenous skill acquisition and a production sector with capital-skill complementarity. We find that wage inequality driven by the resource requirements of skill-creation implies progressive <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> taxation. In particular, in the steady-state, skilled <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> is taxed about forty percent more than unskilled <b>labour</b> <b>income.</b> We further find that the optimal transition path from the exogenous to optimal policy steady-state also exhibits progressive <b>labour</b> <b>income</b> taxation. These results are explained by a lower work time elasticity for skilled versus unskilled labour which results from {{the introduction of the}} skill acquisition technology...|$|R
