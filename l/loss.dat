40|$|AbstractThe {{endogenous}} ileal {{amino acids}} recovered at the terminal ileum of monogastric animals comprises of two components, namely basal and specific <b>losses.</b> The basal <b>losses</b> are fixed and associated with feed dry matter intake, whereas the specific <b>losses</b> are variable and {{induced by the}} presence of dietary components, such as fibre and anti-nutrients. Currently there is no methodology available to directly measure the specific endogenous <b>losses.</b> These <b>losses</b> are calculated by determining the basal and total (basal plus specific) <b>losses</b> and then subtracting the basal <b>losses</b> from total <b>losses.</b> Two techniques, namely the guanidination and isotope markers, can be used for the determination of total endogenous amino acid <b>losses.</b> The fundamental features, specific applications and shortcomings of these two methodologies are discussed. Although the specific endogenous protein <b>losses</b> are significant metabolic costs to the animal, published data quantifying these <b>losses</b> are limited owing to the complexity of available methodologies...|$|R
40|$|This paper details a {{numerical}} investigation of performance <b>losses</b> in low-thrust solar thermal rocket nozzles. The effects of nozzle geometry on {{three types of}} <b>losses</b> were studied; finite rate dissociation-recombination kinetic <b>losses,</b> two dimensional axisymmetric divergence <b>losses,</b> and compressible viscous boundary layer <b>losses.</b> Short nozzle lengths and supersonic flow produce short residence times in the nozzle and a nearly frozen flow, resulting in large kinetic <b>losses.</b> Variations in geometry have a minimal effect on kinetic <b>losses.</b> Divergence <b>losses</b> are relatively small, and careful shaping of the nozzle can nearly eliminate them. The boundary layer in these small nozzles can grow to a major fraction of nozzle radius, and cause large <b>losses.</b> These <b>losses</b> are attributed to viscous drag on the nozzle walls and flow blockage by the boundary layer, especially in the throat region. Careful shaping of the nozzle can produce {{a significant reduction in}} viscous <b>losses...</b>|$|R
