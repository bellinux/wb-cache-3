500|$|... "Push the Button" [...] was conceptualised after {{group member}} Keisha Buchanan {{developed}} an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian {{that she made}} advances towards the man, but {{he was unaware of}} her intentions: [...] "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it's like if you go see it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say." [...] Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to [...] "push that button" [...] or she would eventually move on.|$|E
500|$|Hello, all you Cyberheads! Welcome to the 90's {{version of}} intimacy. You can hear me... You can even see me... But you can't touch me... do you {{recognize}} my voice?... It's Madonna. Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, should I say, often irritated? If you feel like it, you can download the sound file of my new single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you think of my new song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point}} to come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{must know}} what this means to me!" [...] I cried. [...] "It is the {{blasting}} of all my hopes and the ruin of my life! You surely will not inflict such a punishment upon me unheard. You will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is the matter.

6000|$|He did not answer, and {{a moment}} {{afterwards}} Grace burst into tears in spite of herself.
