5|$|Hunting hare with beagles {{became popular}} again in Britain in {{the mid-19th century}} and {{continued}} until it was made illegal in Scotland by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004. Under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the landowner's permission. Drag hunting is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who {{do not wish to}} participate in hunting a <b>live</b> <b>animal,</b> but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of various pure breeds and strains, including {{some that are}} rare today, was once undertaken in North America {{in large part by}} large agriculture-focused colleges and universities. However, many of these institutions have changed their focus to commercial or crossbred strains, with many herds being sent to slaughter. The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened in some of these cases, leading to the survival and {{preservation of}} some gene stocks. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology-based approaches such as gene mapping and germplasm (genetic material) storage. However, although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds, it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed, and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> populations can. The US federal government rarely supports rare breed <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> population conservation, and while agricultural subsidies were once seen more than they are in present times, they were never focused on individual breeds. The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US.|$|E

Eating <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> or parts of <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> may be unlawful in certain jurisdictions under animal cruelty laws. Religious prohibitions on the eating of <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> by humans are also present in various world religions. Animals are also eaten alive for shock value.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyse the {{transport}} of <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> as a very specific type of transport. The first part of work is about legislation, which {{is related to the}} transport of <b>live</b> <b>animals.</b> There is the description of the requirements for the carrying on the transport of <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> necessary documents, permissions and equipment of the means of transport. In the next part of work the statistics related to the transport of <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> are given. For example there are the numbers of transported <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> the numbers of checking or the numbers of the infringements of the rules. Then a description of two specific international transports of <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> implemented by Czech zoological gardens is presented. The final part of work is about the company Boby-Fleisch, which is specialised in the transport of <b>live</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R

5|$|Texas Tech's other mascot, Raider Red, is a {{more recent}} creation. Beginning with the 1971 {{football}} season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school {{did not want to}} allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure. The student serving as Raider Red {{is a member of the}} Saddle Tramps or High Riders.|$|E
5|$|The stolen {{capuchin}} monkey named Oscar {{is played}} by <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> actor Katie, best known for playing Marcel, Ross Geller's pet monkey, on the sitcom Friends. Near {{the time of the}} episode's airing, she had also appeared in Bruce Almighty and an episode of 30 Rock. When the episode's editor first received one take of the scene in which Veronica and Mac sarcastically dance in response to accusations of doing a poor job on a school project, the editor called the writing staff into the editing room; they proceeded to view the scene fifteen times because of its humorous nature. They immediately included the take in the final cut of the episode.|$|E

The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film {{one of the most expensive}} comedies ever produced.|$|E

The Szreniawa Conference on <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> is the first voice {{in the field of}} not only Polish but also international agricultural museology. The topic was consulted with representatives of natural science and technology universities.

5|$|Pushing {{design to}} the limits, Simonovich-Efimova created puppets {{to be worn}} on the head, {{allowing}} the puppeteer to manipulate several characters simultaneously. She patented {{a new type of}} rod puppet with rods attached to the elbows to free up the hands. The rods were hidden behind hanging costumes. To make puppets look more lifelike, the Efimovs devised a system where the arms were elongated. Rods rather than the puppeteer's fingers were inserted into the glove to manipulate the arms, which were allowed to move by manipulating strings inside the body of the doll. Simonovich-Efimova utilized other apparatus, like springs in the body of a cat puppet to give it the flexibility of a <b>live</b> <b>animal.</b> These innovations allowed their finely formed, elegantly clad puppets to move about naturally, rather than with the stiff, jerky movements of their predecessors. In an era when almost all puppet performances were designed to entertain children or present government ideology, Simonovich-Efimova went {{out of her way to}} perform shows for adults, including The Enchanted Pear Tree, Macbeth, and works by Moli√®re and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. Though she also made adaptations in her work with fables to replace what were seen as outmoded ideas, like replacing serfs with young communist characters, Simonovich-Efimova's focus was on artistry, entertainment and professionalism. She also developed a new system of life-sized manikins, blurring the lines between puppetry and acting, when she danced on stage with her Petrushka. Between 1920 and 1940, the Efimovs performed between 1,500 and 2,000 puppet shows.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1990, the {{government}} expanded its agricultural support programs {{to include a}} guaranteed purchase price for major agricultural crops, subsidies, favorable interest rates, government investment, and favorable foreign-trade policies. Primarily because of government support for domestic agriculture, between 1989 and 2003 the import volumes of wheat, sugar, and red meat declined by 77.7 percent, 39.6 percent, and 88.2 percent, respectively. Concurrently, the value of agricultural exports increased from US$461.5 million in 1989 to US$1.7 billion in 2004.

Nicholson and Avery co-founded a subsequent campaign, Save the Hill Grove Cats, which saw the closure two years later of Hill Grove Farm near Oxford, which bred laboratory cats.|$|E
25|$|Swiss doctor Paul Niehans, {{who was one}} of {{the fathers}} of {{cellular}} therapy, developed in 1931‚Äì1949 years the so-called Fresh cell therapy. Fresh cell therapy is mainly the use of <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> embryo organs cells which are injected into the patient with the purpose of achieving a revitalizing effect. These cells are generally extracted from sheep‚Äôs fetuses because in comparison to other animals, like pigs, rabbits and cows, sheep are clean animals and rarely contact diseases. Of course animal cells are not able to be included in human tissue, but they can secrete factors for rejuvenating. That's why this rejuvenation technology, despite the harsh criticism is practiced to this day.|$|E
