40|$|Background. Reliable {{information}} on the incidence of severe reactions to iron dextran is <b>limited.</b> <b>Administration</b> of agents of resuscitation in acute anaphylaxis {{may serve as a}} marker to quantify life-threatening adverse drug reactions. Methods. To determine the incidence of the most serious reactions to intravenous (i. v.) iron dextran, we searched the Gambro Healthcare US medical database for evidence of same-day administration of both i. v. iron dextran and parenteral adrenaline, corticosteroids or antihistamines. We confirmed each case as an iron dextran sensitivity reaction by direct inquiry. We also determined the total reported number of suspected adverse iron dextran reactions. Results. During the 16 month study period, we determined that 1 066 099 doses of i. v. iron dextran were given to 48 509 patients, including 20 213 patients who had not previously received iron dextran (iron dextran naı̈ve). We identified seven patients who experienced reactions requiring resuscitative agents, all in response to a test dose (five patients) or first therapeutic dose (two patients), and therefore all in the iron-naı̈ve (incident) group. Thus, we found the incidence of iron dextran reactions requiring resusci-tative agents to be 0. 035 % (7 out of 20 213). No reaction was fatal. In a combined group of incident and prevalent patients, we found 337 total reports of suspected adverse reactions to iron dextran, without regard to severity of reaction, yielding an overall per patient adverse drug event (ADE) rate of 0. 69 % (337 out of 48 509) and per exposure rate of 0. 03 % (337 out of 1 066 099). Conclusions. The incidence of reactions to iron dextran requiring resuscitative medications, per expo-sure or per patient, is 0. 035 %.

30|$|The mean {{arterial}} pressure, {{which represents}} the perfusion pressure of all organs (except the heart), might serve as a target that physicians must achieve by early fluid administration. A critical element of the resuscitation of the patient with hemorrhagic shock is to prevent a potential increase in bleeding by a resuscitative manoeuvre that is overly aggressive. Fluid resuscitation may promote coagulopathy by diluting coagulation factors and favoring hypothermia. Moreover, an excessive level of mean arterial pressure (MAP) can favor the bleeding by preventing clot formation. Two concepts have emerged in past years: the concept of “low-volume resuscitation” {{and the concept of}} “hypotensive resuscitation.” Often, these two concepts are merged. Several experimental studies have suggested that the <b>limited</b> <b>administration</b> of fluids associated with a low blood pressure level as an end point may limit bleeding without the related increased risk of death [19]. Bickell et al. [20] in 1994 tested this concept in hypotensive patients with penetrating injuries to the torso. They compared immediate and delayed fluid resuscitation and reported that aggressive administration of intravenous fluids should be delayed until the time of operative intervention. Thus, Bickell et al. supported the concept of bringing the patient as quickly as possible to the trauma center and restricting fluid resuscitation until the time of operative intervention. Recently, a retrospective cohort study of patients from the American Trauma Data Bank [21] suggested that there was no survival benefit for prehospital IV placement or IV fluid administration. This concept could be limited by factors, such as older patients, severe brain injuries, or longer prehospital transport times (rural trauma). Future studies are required to clarify the volume and the timing of fluid resuscitation before surgical or angiographic embolization bleeding control. Minimal volume resuscitation is preferable to aggressive volume resuscitation before active bleeding has been controlled. It is critical to prevent hemodilution by limiting fluid resuscitation and using an aggressive transfusion strategy. Additionally, despite adequate fluid resuscitation, only blood transfusion can improve tissue oxygenation [22]. Thus, one key message is that we must consider blood transfusion early during the management of hemorrhagic shock to improve microvascular oxygen delivery.|$|E

40|$|Civil wars {{involving}} non-state armed {{groups in}} Burma {{have been driven}} by a complex mix of historical socio-political grievances and economic factors. The central government and its armed forces have conducted counterinsurgency campaigns against myriad rebel groups in ethnic areas virtually since independence in 1948. Civilian populations caught in these conflicts have suffered immensely as a consequence. The government and army have never completely controlled all the territory and people of the internationally recognised state as it exists on the map. Instead, in some areas it has been armed groups and welfare actors associated with them that {{have been responsible for}} <b>limited</b> <b>administration</b> and service provision to conflict-affected populations. Despite tolerance or support for this non-state governance in some areas, armed groups still present threats to the security of the constituencies they also claim to represent. This thesis assesses the factors that have facilitated or obstructed armed groups’ actions and the extent of their compliance (or not) in response to the norms against landmine use and the recruitment of children. While studies in other regions on armed groups and humanitarian norms have tended to consider policies of violence deliberately directed against civilians, the present study considers these less deliberate threats that armed groups in Burma present to the security of their own constituencies. It explores a set of theoretical propositions drawn from literature that has addressed armed groups from the perspectives of humanitarian engagement, sociology and political economy analysis of armed conflict. These contrasting approaches offer a more inclusive framework for analysis, considering the social, economic and coercive military and political structures influencing armed groups, affected populations and humanitarian actors engaging with them in relation to these issues. This thesis contends that perceived legitimacy and the role of armed group associated welfare and civil society actors have been significant influences on attempts to ameliorate the impact of these issues. The perspectives and influences of legitimacy diverge, however, between international support for the prohibition of landmine use and underage recruitment, and local perceptions, from armed group constituencies and the government, of the groups as credible armed actors. Localised economic agendas combined with geographical dispersion and weak organisational cohesion have also been factors leading to less compliance with these protection norms. The findings indicate that there is also considerable divergence in the extent of compliance between the two norms. Whereas landmine use remains perceived as militarily necessary to most armed groups in Burma and related to their maintenance of local legitimacy, children involved with armed groups are seen as less vital militarily, and external engagement with armed groups to address this issue has met with more acceptance over time. In the light of bilateral ceasefires and ongoing negotiations since 2012, the willingness and capacity of the armed groups and their welfare wings to address these concerns for conflict-affected populations will be important for their future support and for lasting political settlements...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, Faculty of Medicine, 1999. MedicineBibliography: leaves 82 - 110. Since the {{completion}} of the Canadian Multi-centre Post-term Pregnancy Trial, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of inductions of labour at term and beyond term. In many centres, the induction of labour rate exceeds 20 % of all deliveries. [...] Concomitant with this increase in induction rates has been an increase in the use of vaginal prostaglandin primarily dinoprostone, to aid in pre-induction cervical ripening and induction of labour. Dinoprostone has been administered by the oral route in the past, but because of unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects, it's use has been widely abandoned and replaced by its vaginal administration. [...] Because of the high costs and <b>limited</b> <b>administration</b> route of dinoprostone, in recent years attention has turned world-wide to the use of another prostaglandin, "misoprostol", in the induction of human labour at term. This medication, initially designed for the treatment of upper gastrointestinal ulcers has been shown to be an effective agent for induction of labour, when administered vaginally. [...] The purpose of the trial described in this thesis is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of misoprostol in induction of labour, when compared to standard methods of induction. Two groups of patients were formed by random assignation. The first are a control group who received standard care at our unit for induction of labour at term. Standard care for these patients would usually include vaginal prostaglins and/or oxytocin. The second group was the study group. This group received oral misoprostol as the induction of labour agent. The two groups are then compared for both primary and secondary outcome measures. The primary outcome measure is the length of time from commencement of the induction process until delivery. Secondary outcome measures compared between the two groups include multiple parameters of neonatal and maternal morbidity. Finally we were also interested in the acceptability of oral misoprostol for induction of labour as no other prostaglandin induction agent has been shown to have an acceptable side effect profile when administered orally. We therefore also compared labour and delivery maternal satisfaction scores between the two groups. [...] This proved to be a negative trial. There were no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome measure (time for induction of labour until delivery) or in any of the secondary outcome measure figures of neonatal or maternal morbidity or maternal satisfaction. [...] The thesis will be presented in five chapters. The first chapter (Introduction) will provide an overview of why and how induction of labour has been carried out from historical time until the present for the reader new to this area.

40|$|In cardiac {{transplantation}} postoperative right ventricular dysfunction is a {{major cause}} of morbidity and mortality. Recipients with pulmonary hypertension due to end-stage heart failure and a donor heart, fragile because of ischemia-reperfusion injury, and not previously adapted to an elevated pulmonary resistance are the causes of right ventricular dysfunction, that unless aggressively treated may progress to overt right ventricular failure. Dysfunctional pulmonary vascular endothelium with diminished release of NO and increased expression of endothelin- 1 is considered to be the primary pathophysiology that induces pulmonary hypertension. New therapeutic approaches are aimed at ameliorating endothelial dysfunction. How extensively pulmonary hypertension has to be treated depends on the degree of functional impairment of the right ventricle resulting from the acute increase of right ventricular afterload at heart transplantation. Mainstays in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension are optimizing right ventricular preload, increasing contractility, lowering right ventricular afterload, improving coronary perfusion and failing these therapeutic interventions mechanical circulatory support. Judicious use of volume therapy is mandatory to avoid volume overload in the postoperative setting. As a general rule to explore right ventricular preload reserve volume should only be carefully administered by observing filling pressures up to a maximum of a central venous pressure of 10 mm Hg. Volume administration is not indicated if it only increases right atrial filling pressure without subsequently increasing cardiac output. In most cases relative volume overload is the clinical problem and not hypovolemia. In this situation aggressive diuretic therapy and in cases of acute renal failure renal replacement therapy is mandatory. Positive inotropic therapy is indicated to treat consecutive right ventricular dysfunction. Dobutamine may be a choice {{in the presence of a}} low cardiac index but preserved systemic pressures and epinephrine in cases of low cardiac output syndrome and systemic hypotension. A useful adjunct to catecholamine therapy is phosphodiesterase-III-inhibitors in the absence of arterial hypotension. Most importantly, pulmonary arterial pressures and right ventricular afterload have to be lowered in pulmonary hypertension compromising right ventricular function. Systemic vasodilators to treat pulmonary hypertension are non-selective and may induce arterial hypotension. This also applies to intravenously administered prostanoids. Inhaled NO in therapeutic doses selectively dilates the pulmonary vasculature without inducing systemic hypotension. To prevent a rebound phenomenon, inhaled NO therapy has to be slowly weaned. To account for the individually different response to inhaled NO, dose titration is recommended with doses of 10 – 50 ppm NO to lower pulmonary arterial pressures. Inhaled NO has been successfully used for all indications in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in cardiac surgery. It has proved to be especially effective after implantation of left ventricular assist devices and following heart transplantations. As an alternative therapy, inhalation of aerosolized prostanoids similar to inhaled NO selectively decreases pulmonary arterial pressures. In recent years there has been growing evidence that the orally available phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil may be a useful adjunct to therapy in right ventricular failure. Inhibition of posphodiesterase 5 by sildenafil selectively induces pulmonary vasodilatation without deleterious effects on the systemic circulation. It can also be employed to facilitate weaning heart transplant recipients of inhaled NO, catecholamines and mechanical ventilator support. It has also been reported to have synergistic effects with inhaled NO and may be a treatment option in refractory cases. Potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive drugs have to be accounted for. Although clinical data are still <b>limited</b> <b>administration</b> of the calcium sensitizer levosimendan with reported inotropic effects and at the same time decreasing pulmonary pressures may be an attractive treatment option in patients after heart transplantation presenting with right ventricular dysfunction. Endothelin antagonists are effective in the treatment of moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension, but their future role still has to be determined in further studies. Supportive therapeutic measures in acute pulmonary hypertension are the use of 100 % oxygen, moderate hyperventilation and correction of acidosis. If right ventricular failure progresses to a low cardiac output syndrome, implantation of an intraaortic balloon pump has to be considered to improve coronary perfusion. In refractive pulmonary hypertension and frank right ventricular failure implantation of a right ventricular assist device remains the last resort for treatment...|$|E
