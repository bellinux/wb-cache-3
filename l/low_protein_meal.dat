40|$|The {{effect of}} two isocaloric evening meals (low protein-high fat vs. high protein-low fat content) on plasma glucose {{regulation}} {{during the night}} were compared. Eight C-peptide-deficient type-I diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy were treated with fixed doses of continuous infusions of insulin during 2 nights. At 7 p. m. they received in random order either a low protein-high fat (5 % of total energy protein, 60 % fat, 35 % carbohydrate) or a high protein-low fat (35 % protein, 30 % fat, 35 % carbohydrate) evening meal. Venous plasma samples were drawn hourly thereafter. Plasma glucose concentrations were similar postprandially during the 2 nights between 7 p. m. and 11 p. m., but they {{were higher in the}} early morning hours after the high protein meal (p textless 0. 02 vs. the <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> <b>meal).</b> Two subjects developed symptomatic hypoglycemia after the <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> <b>meal.</b> Plasma glucagon concentrations were higher (p = 0. 023) and serum free insulin lower (p textless 0. 05) after the high protein-low fat meal. Plasma cortisol and growth hormone were not significantly different between the two diets. Therefore, an increase in the protein content of the evening meal (fat content diminished) increases plasma glucose concentrations several hours later in the night, possibly due to protein-induced glucagon secretion and to lower plasma free insulin levels. Patients with type-I diabetes with a tendency to develop hypoglycemia during the night may avoid this problem by increasing the protein content of the evening meal...|$|E
40|$|Diet and {{exercise}} are key components to overall health maintenance. Aspects contributing to weight maintenance include the thermic effect of food (TEF) and total energy expenditure (TEE), with TEF contributing to upwards of 10 % TEE. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the interaction between TEF {{and exercise}} on TEE in moderately active females. METHODS: A sample population was established with the use of a health history questionnaire (HHQ). Ten active females of normal body composition, determined by body mass index (BMI) and a dual energy absorptiometry x-ray (DEXA) scan, participated in the study. Maximal aerobic capacity was determined using the standard Bruce graded exercise treadmill test. Participants returned for three additional testing sessions, each consisting of a different feeding protocol combined with 30 minutes of exercise performed at 60 % VO 2 max. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant time effect for the feeding protocols (α =. 05). Post-hoc analyses indicated significantly greater TEF with high protein content compared to low and fasted as well as in low protein compared to the fasted condition. Combined with exercise, TEE was significantly greater under high protein conditions compared to fasted. No significance was found between the high and low protein conditions combined with exercise or with the low protein compared to fasted. CONCLUSION: Findings of this study indicate a relationship between protein content of a meal, TEF, and TEE with moderate-intensity exercise. High protein meal (45 %) consumption potentiated a greater TEF and overall TEE in comparison to <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> <b>meal</b> (15 %) consumption. In relation to exercise and TEE, significance was only found when comparing high protein meal consumption and exercise to the fasted state with exercise. Trends for increased TEF with exercise were present for exercise performed after consumption of a <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> <b>meal</b> compared to the high protein meal and the fasted state, though not statistically significant. Further research should be conducted examining chronic exposure to a high protein diet combined with exercise to observe potential increased interactions longitudinally. Additionally, a broader spectrum of populations should be studied to better understand protein metabolism and TEE potentiated through TEF and exercise...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{alkaline}} tide which compensates for gastric acid secretion suggests the possibility of indirect measurement of gastric acid secretion. This {{study was designed to}} determine whether postprandial changes in renal and respiratory function could be used to assess gastric secretion in healthy adults. Volunteers ate one of three standard (low, medium or high protein) breakfasts on separate days. A fall in urine acid output was observed during 2 h after the high protein meal, but not after the medium or <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> <b>meal.</b> Fasting subjects showed a similar fall in urine acid output over a 2 -hour period. Pretreatment with ranitidine 150 mg b. i. d. had no effect on basal or postprandial urine acid output. We conclude that changes in urine acid output are not related to the gastric secretory response to food. In a separate study, treatment with omeprazole 20 mg daily had no effect on postprandial respiratory function (minute ventilation; mixed expired CO 2; minute volume of CO 2; respiratory exchange ratio; venous blood pH, pCO 2 or bicarbonate; and end tidal CO 2). Thus we were unable to detect a respiratory alkaline tide after a standard breakfast. These findings suggest that any respiratory or urinary compensation for gastric acid secretion is too small to be of physiological or clinical significance...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that a high protein diet improves insulin sensitivity and reduces ectopic lipids in animals and humans with the metabolic syndrome. We therefore tested the hypothesis that a high dietary protein content may stimulate whole body lipid oxidation and alter post-prandial triglyceride (TG) after fructose ingestion. METHODS: The post-prandial metabolism of 8 young males was studied after two 6 -day periods of hyper-energetic, high fructose diet (HiFruD), and after two 6 -day periods of hyper-energetic high fructose high protein diet (HiFruHiProD). The order with which these periods were applied was randomized. At the end of each period, either a <b>low</b> <b>protein,</b> (13) C fructose test meal (Fru meal) or a high protein, (13) C fructose test meal (HiPro Fru meal) was administered. This resulted in the monitoring of metabolic parameters at 4 occasions in random order: a) with Fru meal ingested after HiFruD, b) with HiPro Fru meal ingested after HiFruD, c) with Fru meal ingested after HiFruHiProD or d) with HiPro Fru meal ingested after HiFruHiProD. On each occasion, post-prandial TG concentrations were monitored, energy expenditure and substrate metabolism were measured by indirect calorimetry, and fructose-induced gluconeogenesis was evaluated by measuring plasma (13) C-labeled glucose. RESULTS: TG responses to fructose ingestion were significantly higher after a hyper-energetic HiFruHiProD and after HiPro Fru meals than after a Fru meal ingested after a hyper-energetic HiFruD. Compared to <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> <b>meals,</b> high <b>protein</b> <b>meals</b> increased post-prandial energy expenditure, inhibited post-prandial lipid oxidation, and enhanced fructose-induced gluconeogenesis.

40|$|Loss of {{appetite}} is frequently observed during ageing; termed the ‘anorexia of ageing’. Some {{evidence suggests that}} with advancing age there {{is an increase in}} satiety hormones, such as CCK and PYY, and a decrease in the hunger hormone ghrelin which may contribute to the anorexia of ageing. However, not all studies agree, emphasising the need for more in depth research to clarify age related changes. My first study developed a rat model to replicate the hormonal responses observed in humans. However, {{the results of this study}} did not replicate human studies; there were no alterations gastrointestinal hormones. I then designed a human study to examine more comprehensively, the effect of ageing on gastrointestinal peptide hormone release. Healthy human volunteers aged 20 to 92 years were studied in fasting and post-prandial conditions. The results demonstrated an increase in PYY concentrations post-prandially in older volunteers. In order to understand the mechanism behind this, I followed this study with an investigation looking at the changes in gastrointestinal hormones in ageing mice colons. The data produced results conflicting with the human study, since no increase in PYY levels was observed. Dietary manipulation provides a good opportunity to alter gastrointestinal appetite hormone release, since release differs depending on the macronutrient content of the food consumed. My final studies focused on high protein diets. Results demonstrated that older volunteers were insensitive to the satiating effect of protein, where younger volunteers ate less following a high <b>protein</b> test <b>meal</b> but the older volunteers food intake did not change. Gastrointestinal appetite hormones concentrations did not change significantly between the high and <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> <b>meals</b> in the older and younger adults. These results suggest that age-associated reductions in appetite could be due to a resultant increase in the satiety hormone PYY. More studies need to be conducted to understand the role of protein on appetite and food intake in older adults. Imperial Users onl...|$|R

Limited data {{are available on the}} acute effects of low quality foods on gut metabolism and the consequences for liver metabolism. MethodsA meal with the <b>low</b> quality <b>protein</b> gelatin (tryptophan deficient and low amount of essential amino acids) was compared to a meal with the high quality protein Whey and a tryptophan supplemented gelatin meal (Gel + TRP) in healthy pigs with chronic implanted catheters. In a conscious state, amino acid, ammonia, urea, glucose and lactate fluxes across the portal drained viscera (PDV) and liver were studied for 6  h after administration of the <b>protein</b> <b>meal.</b> ResultsThe average net portal appearance of amino acids was 99. 8  ±  14. 6 % of the intake in the Gel group as compared to 61. 4  ±  9. 0 % (p =  0. 022) in the Whey group. In addition, a net portal appearance of tryptophan was observed in the Gel group (p =  0. 005) of about 42 % of tryptophan released in the Whey group. Intestinal energy metabolism and citrulline production was not affected. Adding tryptophan to the Gel meal diminished net portal AA appearance to 41. 6  ±  24. 0 % of the intake (p =  0. 012), but did not reduce the stimulated liver urea production. ConclusionsIn the post-prandial phase after intake of a <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> quality <b>meal,</b> net anabolism in the healthy intestine is absent. It is likely that the intestine responds with a net breakdown of endogenous (labile) proteins to secure amino acid availability for the body.

Very limited information is available on the requirement of the threonine for broilers. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the threonine requirements of broiler chickens from 22 - 42 days of age. Seventy five Ross 308 one-day-old male broiler chicks were divided into five dietary treatment groups of similar mean weight, comprising 15 birds each. They were fed a basal starting diet containing 23 % CP, 3200 ME kcal/kg, 0. 81 % threonine and 1. 24 % lysine for first 3 weeks. Chicks were randomly assigned to five treatments involving 0. 70, 0. 75, 0. 80, 0. 85 and 0. 90 % of total threonine for 21 days (between 22 - 42 days). Results indicated that a linear response to dietary threonine for final body weight, body weight gain and threonine intake occurred in experiment but other live performance parameters were not impacted by dietary threonine.

As protein is the most closely regulated macronutrient in the diet, the present study addressed whether acute protein deprivation, habitual protein intake or {{a combination of the two}} influenced liking for the taste of MSG. 24 low-restraint male participants (mean age: 22; BMI: 23) consumed either their habitual breakfast (baseline), a <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> breakfast (breakfast <b>meal</b> with <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> milk and milkshake) or a high <b>protein</b> breakfast (breakfast <b>meal</b> with high <b>protein</b> milk and milkshake) on three different days, and then evaluated the acceptability of umami (MSG), salty (NaCl) or sweet (Acesulphame K) tastes at low or high concentrations in a soup context at lunchtime. Participants also completed a habitual protein intake questionnaire (39 -item protein Food Frequency Questionnaire). Liking for all tastes was higher on the low than on the high protein day, and NaCl and Acesulphame K were liked less on both protein manipulation days when compared to the no added flavour control. Habitual protein intake was not related to liking for MSG stimuli alone but habitual high protein consumers rated a high concentration of MSG as more pleasant than any other taste when in protein deficit. Overall, these findings suggest that liking for high MSG concentrations may be moderated by nutritional need in high protein consumers...|$|R

BCKAD is rate-limiting for branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism by muscle; its activity is modulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. In rats fed an adequate protein (25 % casein) diet, BCKAD was approximately 2 % active postabsorptively and increased to 10 % or 16 % active after a 25 % or 50 % <b>protein</b> <b>meal,</b> respectively.

Obligate anautogenous insects, like several species of mosquitoes and flesh flies, need a <b>protein</b> <b>meal</b> in order to produce their first batch of eggs. This <b>protein</b> <b>meal</b> elicits an increase in midgut proteolytic activity that is under neuropeptidergic regulation. Time series of decapitation and rescue experiments of liver fed flies evidenced the need of a peptide factor released by corpora cardiaca (CC) within four hours post <b>protein</b> <b>meal</b> in order to assure complete protein digestion. Q-Exactive quantitative differential peptidomics analysis on CC of sugar fed flies and flies five hours post <b>protein</b> <b>meal</b> respectively, showed a unique consistent decrease in the stored amount of adipokinetic hormone (AKH) ranging between 16 up to 63 %. Injection of AKH into liver fed decapitated flies as well as sugar fed intact flies resulted in enhanced midgut proteolytic activity up to the level of intact protein fed flies. The pharmalogicaly induced release of AKH from CC, using injections of metformin, also resulted in increase of midgut proteolitic activity and as such mimics AKH injection. Our finding of AKH affecting enzymatic digestive activity confirms earlier data obtained using firefbugs (Kodrik et al., 2012). The other 7 different low molecular weight neuropeptides found in the CC extract are Yamides, short neuropeptides F, myosuppressin, corazonin, pyrokinin and CAPA. The literature study suggests that almost all of these molecules are in some way related to feeding behavior. However our analysis demonstrated that none of them are involved in the process of digestion in sugar or liver fed flies. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{strategic}} {{intent of}} the Midwest Feeds Consortium (MFC) was to decrease the dependence of the U. S. agriculture and aquaculture feed industries on imported marine <b>protein</b> <b>meals</b> and to increase the utilization and export {{of plant and animal}} coproduct <b>protein</b> <b>meals</b> to the international aquaculture industry. Replacement of marine meals in feeds traditionally dependent on these protein sources with grains, oilseed, and animal coproduct <b>protein</b> <b>meals</b> common to the U. S. Midwest would be accomplished through innovative, value-added ingredient processing technology. Through systematic, integrated, industry-directed research to develop ingredient composition, quality, digestibility, and economic values, the U. S. and international feed industry would then be able to rapidly incorporate the findings into their ingredient and equipment-purchasing decisions. The work described herein drew heavily upon recommendations developed by the MFC workshop, which was the first United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) -funded undertaking by the Consortium. The priority activities were industry linkages, ingredient processing, ingredient testing, and technology transfer. After the initial workshop, the Consortium underwent several changes in management structure, participants, and directions, which slowed progress considerably. In May 1997, a focus meeting was held in Des Moines, Iowa, between principal Consortium participants to modify priorities and reestablish timelines. The project reemerged with objectives designed to meet the priority issues of the project. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>protein</b> diet {{mediated}} renoprotection in remnant kidneys: Renal autoregulatory versus hypertrophic mechanisms. BackgroundThe {{mechanism of}} <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> diet conferred renoprotection in the ablation model remains controversial. Blockade of glomerular hypertrophy, reduced preglomerular vasodilation, and preserved autoregulation {{have all been}} postulated. The potential differential impact of calcium channel blockers on these mechanisms and glomerulosclerosis was examined. MethodsRats with 5 / 6 renal ablation received either a 25 % standard protein diet, an 8 % <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> diet and a <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> diet with either verapamil or amlodipine. Renal autoregulatory and morphometric studies were performed at 3 weeks before the development of significant injury, and the assessment of glomerulosclerosis after 7 weeks of continuous blood pressure radiotelemetry in additional rats. ResultsThe preserved renal autoregulation in <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> rats was abolished by both calcium channel blockers, with the impairment being either comparable to (<b>low</b> <b>protein</b> + verapamil) or greater than the standard <b>protein</b> rats (<b>low</b> <b>protein</b> + amlodipine). Neither calcium channel blocker blocked the inhibitory effects of <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> diet on renal blood flow, kidney weight, and glomerular volume. Results (mean ± SE) for glomerular volume (μm- 3 × 10 - 6) : <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> (N = 11), 1. 6 ± 0. 1; <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> + verapamil (N = 10), 1. 7 ± 0. 1; <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> + amlodipine (N = 12), 1. 7 ± 0. 2; versus standard protein (N = 10), 2. 2 ± 0. 1; P < 0. 05. Only amlodipine, but not verapamil, reduced average systolic blood pressure (143 ± 2 mm Hg versus <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> rats, 168 ± 5 mm Hg, and standard rats, 170 ± 6 mm Hg; P < 0. 01). Nevertheless, the glomeruloprotection seen in <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> (N = 15) as compared to standard protein (N = 14) rats (9 %± 3 % versus 28 %± 6 % glomerulosclerosis; P < 0. 01) was abolished in both <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> + verapamil (N = 14, 32 %± 7 %) and <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> + amlodipine rats (N = 16, 27 %± 7 %). ConclusionsPreservation of renal autoregulation and not inhibition of hypertrophy is the critical component in <b>low</b> <b>protein</b> diet-conferred glomeruloprotection...|$|R
