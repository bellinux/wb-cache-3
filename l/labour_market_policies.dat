In addition, labor-protection and anti-trust laws were significantly strengthened, while from 1969 to 1975 alone some 140 laws were passed that entitled various socially disadvantaged groups to tax subsidies. During the mid-Seventies recession, eligibility for short-term unemployment benefits was extended from 6 to 12 months, and to 24 months in some cases. Active <b>Labour</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Policies</b> were substantially expanded, {{with the number of}} people benefiting from such schemes increasing from 1,600 in 1970 to 648,000 by 1975. In addition, the SPD-FDP government gave more priority to raising minimum housing standards. The Law on Nursing Homes and Homes for the Elderly (1974) sought to guarantee minimum standards in an important area of social services, while the Beratungshilfegesetz (Legal Advice Act) of 1980 strengthened the position of the indigent in need of out of court legal advice and representation. The Maternity Leave Act of 1979 permitted mothers in work to take leave of 6 months after the birth of a child, granted a maternity allowance, and safeguarded jobs for 8 months.|$|E

40|$|Active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> is {{a widely}} used <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> intervention, which should {{increase}} the efficiency of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> and help increase regular employment. However, its real impacts on <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> conditions are ambiguous. Although the literature concerning effectiveness of active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> (ALMP) measures is extensive, there is no conclusive evidence regarding which ALMP measures are efficient and to what extent.

40|$|In 1994 the OECD {{countries}} {{spent an}} average of almost 1 % of their particular gross domestic product (GDP) on putting into effect <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> objectives. Astonishing differences can, however, be seen between the countries. The size of the expenditure (in each case expressed {{as a percentage of}} the GDP) ranged from the peak of 2. 89 % in Sweden to the minimum of 0. 09 % in Japan. The figure for Germany according to OECD statistics was still 1. 32 %. In the political debate there are some voices pleading for an expansion of active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy,</b> and others speaking for a heavy restriction of these measures. A prerequisite for an assessment of active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> and the related expenditure is, however, the ability to assess the success of these instruments. On the basis of an international comparison, this article deals in particular with the possibilities and limitations of active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> in solving <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> problems. In an initial step, possible connections between general economic <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> indicators (such as unemployment rates, proportion of long-term unemployed) and the total expenditure on <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> measures are examined. In the second step, demand-orientated and supply-orientated types of policy are dealt with in more detail, as well as internationally available evaluation results on this matter. The results suggest that the employment policy starting points of active measures are not so much at a general economic level (measured against macro indicators). These results must not, however, lead to the individual and therefore microeconomic dimension of active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> moving out of the focus of attention, e. g. avoiding the devaluation of human capital through participation in <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> measures, or a new human capital being built up. Active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> should therefore be understood first and foremost as an aid to integration. It would depend on the limited resources for <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> available from the national economy being utilised as sensibly as possible for the integration of otherwise hard-to-place people. Because the different needs and problems of each individual case require the ability to offer 'tailor-made' solutions, in particular local <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> requires a set of flexible instruments which can be bound together to form individual programme packages.

40|$|In many {{countries}} <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> {{has to deal}} with fairly large and persistent regional <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> disparities. In the case of Germany, parts of the country are affected by a deep unemployment crisis whereas others show nearly full employment. Since these disparities cannot be reduced to only one dimension a classification system of <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> was developed. The criterion of this system was the identification of the "regional disadvantage 2 ̆ 01 d for the success of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy.</b> To optimise the results a new two-step classification method was applied.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> on several types of criminal offences for fifteen European countries.

Secondly, the effects of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> vary considerably {{with respect to the}} different types of criminal offences and cannot be subdivided into unambiguous effects on property crimes and violent crimes, respectively. Thirdly, the proxy variables for <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> we consider have different importance with respect to their effect on criminal offences. Benefit replacement rate, benefit duration, and average years of schooling seem to be important, whereas active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> appears not to be linked to crime.
