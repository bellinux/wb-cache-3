We propose an asynchronous method of periodically composing Q table of local learning clusters to form global Q table. In this research, two approaches are implemented.

The asynchronous combination method is compared with a synchronous combination method in order of <b>learning</b> <b>times.</b> A cluster of 40 PCs {{were used in the}} experiments are presented.

In this paper, the most accurate results were obtained when the number of <b>learning</b> <b>times</b> was 20. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior in terms of accuracy and execution time. However, it did not show 100 % accuracy because it did not consider the problem caused by WiFi noise or signal attenuation. Therefore, research on indoor location recognition is needed to solve the WiFi noise problem.|$|R

40|$|Cross-situational {{learning}} is a mechanism for learning the meaning of words across multiple exposures, despite exposure-by-exposure uncertainty as to a word’s true meaning. Doubts have been expressed regarding the plausibility of cross-situational learning as a mechanism for learning humanscale lexicons in reasonable timescales under the levels of referential uncertainty likely to confront real word learners. We demonstrate mathematically that cross-situational learning facilitates the acquisition of large vocabularies despite significant levels of referential uncertainty at each exposure, and we provide estimates of lexicon <b>learning</b> <b>times</b> for several cross-situational learning strategies. This model suggests that cross-situational word learning cannot be ruled out {{on the basis that}} it predicts unreasonably long lexicon <b>learning</b> <b>times.</b> More generally, these results indicate that there is no necessary link between the ability to learn individual words rapidly and the capacity to acquire a large lexicon...|$|R
