40|$|The South African Reserve Bank {{presents}} an {{annual balance sheet}} for the South African household sector constructed from macro-economic data estimates. Broad asset and liability classes are presented which can be disaggregated {{with the use of}} micro-level data obtained directly from households. At the time of the study, however, micro-level data on the different asset and liability classes accumulated by households was not available. The main objective {{of the study was to}} disaggregate and measure the asset and <b>liability</b> <b>base</b> of South African households in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas using micro-level data. The study used a mixed methodological approach, consisting of both qualitative and quantitative data and was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, a comprehensive literature review was conducted on the recognition and measurement of household assets and liabilities. Economic theories that explain asset and liability accumulation were reviewed and international surveys on household net wealth measurement scrutinised. A heuristic model of a financial position section for the South African household sector was developed. In the second and qualitative phase, online and face-to-face focus group deliberations were conducted with experts in the field of household finance to ensure that the newly developed financial position section would robustly recognise and measure all possible household asset and liability classes. In the third and quantitative phase, the financial position section was included in an omnibus survey and data was collected from a representative sample of 2 606 households in South Africa. The weighted data was segmented in terms of metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas and presented as statements of financial position based on the classification, recognition and measurement principles of “The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 2010 ”. Composition analyses presented a secondary objective, namely to explore the effect of identified independent demographic variables on asset and liability accumulation. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) identified meaningful interaction effects for (1) age, income and area; (2) income and age; (3) education, income and age; and (4) education and income on asset accumulation and an age and income interaction effect on liability accumulation. The study contributes to the body of knowledge on the contemporaneous effect of age, income, education and area of residence on household asset and liability accumulation and provides information on South African household net wealth not yet available. The disaggregated asset and <b>liability</b> <b>base</b> will assist policy makers both at micro- and macro-economic level with the overview and management of South African household net wealth.

40|$|Banknotes in {{circulation}} are traditionally {{the most important}} liability item in the balance sheet of central banks. The launch of euro cash created the need to treat this item in new way to reflect the joint liability of all Eurosystem members – the ECB and all national central banks (NCBs) of the euro area – for euro banknotes. In this context, the implications of banknote migration expected {{both within and outside}} the euro area, as well as its potential impact on the distribution of profits among the euro area central banks, were subject to extensive discussions already before the cash changeover. A major challenge for the Eurosystem has been the fair allocation of monetary income. This is the income accruing to the individual NCBs in the performance of their monetary policy functions. In particular, this income – traditionally referred to as seigniorage income – includes income derived from assets held against notes {{in circulation}} and deposit liabilities to credit institutions. The experience of the first five years after the cash changeover shows that the combination of all relevant aspects of the Eurosystem’s banknote circulation and seigniorage income rules has ensured a fair allocation of monetary income, the functional integrity of the Eurosystem, 2 and thus the fulfillment of the objective stipulated by Article 32 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks 3 (ESCB).

40|$|A {{number of}} {{proposed}} theories of tort liability are "monolithic" {{in that they}} seek to explain tort liability by focusing on a single element or concern of the tort situation. Four different monolithic theories of tort liability {{will be discussed in}} this work: personal moral culpability liability; strict or absolute liability; <b>liability</b> <b>based</b> on utility and, more specifically, economic liability; and <b>liability</b> <b>based</b> on reciprocity of risk between the parties. The narrow scope of each of these theories renders them susceptible to both internal and external criticism [...] they are, variously, internally inconsistent and incoherent and they lead to unacceptable results in tort decisions. <b>Liability</b> <b>based</b> on a standard of reasonableness which permits and requires a consideration of a variety of individual and community interests in making a tort decision is to be preferred to any of these monolithic theories. A theory of <b>liability</b> <b>based</b> on reasonableness is in accord with and serves to correctly explicate the majority of decisions in reported tort cases. Furthermore, a theory of <b>liability</b> <b>based</b> on reasonableness dispels the supposed antithesis between liability with fault and strict liability...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis of}} the Article {{is that the}} {{expansion}} of tort <b>liability</b> <b>based</b> on strict <b>liability</b> or enterprise liability {{without regard to the}} proper measurement of damages in such cases {{is at the root of}} the insurance crisis rather than the awarding of excessive damages in ordinary fault cases. Stated another way, the expansion of tort <b>liability</b> was <b>based</b> upon the appropriateness of internalizing the cost of economic activity by spreading the risk among the beneficiaries of such activity, but the damages were measured under full compensation theories rather than a more appropriate insurance approach. This divergence between <b>basing</b> <b>liability</b> upon insurance principles and measuring damages upon fault principles has resulted in the failure of businesses to incorporate the legal charges against them within the price of their product.
