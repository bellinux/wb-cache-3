40|$|Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) is a heterogeneous, common, neurocutaneous {{disorder}} presenting different complications {{during a}} life span, including cerebrovascular dysplasia. To our knowledge {{this is the}} first reported case of NF 1 associated with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and pontine ischemic stroke. We describe a 57 -year-old man with NF 1 who presented an acute onset right-sided facial palsy and hemiplegia, dysarthria, and gait imbalance. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute left paramedian pontine infarct and a hypoplastic right vertebral artery. Brain Computed Tomography Angiography revealed the occurrence of vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. Co-occurrence of VBD and NF 1 might not be merely casual and it may significantly heighten the mortality rate in this multisystem disorder. We suggest a possible role of VBD in the genesis of our patient's clinical-radiological features and prompt the early detection of asymptomatic arteriopathy in individuals with NF 1 in order to ameliorate patients' quality of life and <b>life</b> <b>expectanc...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{estimate}} health expectancy— that is, {{the average}} lifetime in good health—among never smokers, ex-smokers, and smokers in Denmark.  DESIGN—A method suggested by Peto and colleagues in 1992  for estimating smoking attributable mortality rates {{was used to}} construct a life table for never smokers. This life table and relative risks for death for ex-smokers and smokers versus never smokers were used to estimate life tables for ex-smokers and smokers. Life tables and prevalence rates of health status were combined and health expectancy was calculated by Sullivan's method.  SETTING—The Danish adult population.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—The expected lifetime in self rated good health or without longstanding illness for never smokers and smokers.  RESULTS—The expected lifetime of a 20  year old man who will never begin to smoke is 56. 7  years, 48. 7  (95 % confidence interval (CI), 46. 8  to 50. 7) years of which {{are expected to be}} in self rated good health. The corresponding figures for a man who smokes heavily are 49. 5  years, 36. 5  (95 % CI 35. 0  to 38. 1  ) years of which are in self rated good health. A 20  year old woman who will never begin to smoke can expect to live a further 60. 9  years, with 46. 4  (95 % CI 44. 9  to 47. 8) years in self rated good health; if she is a lifelong heavy smoker, her expected lifetime is reduced to 53. 8  years, 33. 8  (95 % CI 31. 7  to 35. 9) years of which are in self rated good health. Health expectancy based on long standing illness is reduced for smokers when compared with never smokers.  CONCLUSIONS—Smoking reduces the expected lifetime in good health and increases the expected lifetime in poor health.    Keywords: <b>life</b> expectancy; health <b>expectanc...</b>|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study is to analyze the {{development of}} this phenomenon in EU coutries, and to compare them. At the beginning, this study considers the historical development of excess male mortality and its general rules. It tries to answer the question, why male mortality rates exceeds female rates. This work also compares biological factors (e. g. genetics) and cultural factors (smoking, alcoholism etc.) This is followed by analytical part of this study, which considers the similarities and dissimilarities of analyzed countries. In this part, male excess mortality rates in different age groups and their development during analyzed period are examined. On the basis of discovered facts, it then tries to create a typology of EU countries by level and structure of excess male mortality. In the end, the study compares non-comunist and postcomunist countries and tries to indicate the future development of this phenomenon.

40|$|Summary Neither testis nor {{epididymis}} {{was found}} to be invaded by L 1210 leukaemic cells in spite of widespread dissemination through other organs and tissues. The same applied to animals in relapse after protracted remissions induced by cyclophosphamide. Prior damage to the gonadal vascular endothelium by Cd+ + did enable leukaemic cells to enter the testicular interstitium, but not the depleted seminiferous tubules. Injection of cells into the lymphatic sinus system of the testis led to rapid peritubular proliferation and systemic dissemination but the seminiferous tubules were not penetrated. The histological appearance resembled that of human ALL. The results suggest that the L 1210 system, using the intratesticular route for inoculation can be used to examine the susceptibility to drugs of leukaemic cells in this environment. The potential of drugs to damage the vascular endothelium of the gonad and perhaps {{contribute to the development of}} testicular relapse could be assessed following intramuscular inoculation of cells. The development of more effective chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) about 25 years ago, led to the recognition that increased <b>life</b> <b>expectanc...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} endoscopic {{and surgical}} treatment in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is presented. Natural history in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome {{often leads to}} multiple and acute laparotomies, resulting in intestinal resections. This {{may lead to a}} short bowel syndrome. In order to gain control over the small intestinal polyposis, a combined approach by the gastroenterologist and surgeon is performed. At laparotomy, an endoscope is introduced orally into the small intestine which is then telescoped over it by the surgeon. The small intestine is inspected in retrograde order and existing polyposis is treated by endoscopic or surgical polypectomy, or both, or by minimal intestinal resection. Thus, a "clean small intestine" is created. Data on five patients thus treated are presented. No recurrences were seen after this procedure at a mean follow-up period of 21 months. Combined endoscopic and surgical treatment of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, together with top and tail endoscopy, results in a "clean intestine" and is supposed to diminish the need for multiple acute laparotomies and, therefore, the risk of a short bowel syndrome.

40|$|As far as {{correlation}} {{does not}} mean causation, even it found a high correlation between some legal rights and economical parameters, it doesn’t mean that the latter are caused by legal dimensions only. However, if strong correlations exist between some legal rights and some socioeconomic outcomes, {{this is a good}} argument for policy makers to improve situation with proper legal rights which highly correlate with their first priority, that of socioeconomic policy aims. It’s important to know the real impact of improving legal rights for society to avoid overestimation or underestimation of this impact. Also, regarding the increase in the amount of different international ratings of legal rights, the question which is more reliable should be raised (“competition of ratings”). The correlation analysis shows that “economic oriented” legal rights such as like property and intellectual property are relatively more correlated with GDP per capita. On the other hand, political rights and civil freedoms such as the right not to be tortured unlawfully detained are relatively more correlated with social progress as a more complex and general socio-economic outcome.

40|$|Background: The healthy worker {{effect may}} hide {{adverse health effects}} in {{hazardous}} jobs, especially those where physical fitness is required. Fire fighters {{may serve as a}} good example because they sometimes are severely exposed to hazardous substances while on the other hand their physical fitness and their strong health surveillance by far exceeds that of comparable persons from the general population. Methods: To study this effect a historic cohort study was conducted to assess mortality and life expectancy of professional fire fighters of the City of Hamburg, Germany. Fire departments and trade unions questioned the validity of existing studies from outside Germany because of specific differences in the professional career. No mortality study had been conducted so far in Germany and only few in Europe. Information on all active and retired fire fighters was extracted from personnel records. To assure completeness of data the cohort was restricted to all fire fighters being active on January 1, 1950 or later. Follow up of the cohort ended on June 30 th 2000. Vital status was assessed by personnel records, pension fund records and the German residence registries. Mortality of fire fighters was compared to mortality of the Hamburg and German male population by means of standardized mortality ratios. <b>Life</b> <b>expectanc...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Endoscopic sphincterotomy {{and stone}} {{extraction}} can clear the bile ducts in 85 % to 90 % of patients. In case endoscopic stone extraction fails, insertion of a biliary endoprosthesis is an alternative. METHODS: Biliary endoprostheses were inserted in 117 patients (73 women and 44 men, median age 80 years). Follow-up {{was achieved by}} contacting referring physicians and general practitioners. RESULTS: Biliary drainage was established in all patients. Early complications occurred in 10 patients (9 %) with a fatal outcome in 1. In 59 patients the endoprosthesis was a temporary measure before elective surgery or repeat endoscopy. Further treatment in these 59 patients caused only mild complications {{and there were no}} deaths. Endoprostheses were inserted as permanent therapy in 58 patients. Median follow-up in these 58 patients was 36 months (range, 1 to 117 months). A total of 34 complications occurred in 23 patients (40 %), cholangitis being the most frequent. During follow-up, 44 patients died, 9 {{as a result of a}} biliary-related cause. CONCLUSIONS: These data favor temporary use of biliary endoprostheses in patients with endoscopically irretrievable bile duct stones. However, as a permanent therapy, late complications occur in many patients and the risk increases proportionally in time. Therefore, permanent biliary stenting should preferably be restricted to patients unfit for elective treatment at a later stage and with a short <b>life</b> <b>expectanc...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose. This paper aims {{to assess}} whether {{disability}} occurrence is related more strongly to proximity to death than to age. Method. Self reported disability and vital status were available from six annual waves and a subsequent 12 -year mortality follow-up of the Dutch GLOBE longitudinal study. Logit and Poisson regression methods were used to study associations of disability occurrence with age and with proximity to death. Results. For disability in {{activities of daily living}} (ADL), regression models with proximity to death had better goodness of fit than models with age. With approaching death, the odds for ADL disability prevalence and incidence rates increased 20. 0 % and 18. 9 % per year, whereas severity increased 4. 1 % per year. For the ages younger than 60, 60 - 69 and older than 70 years, the odds for ADL disability prevalence increased 6. 4 %, 16. 0 % and 23. 0 % per year. Among subjects with asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes increases were 25. 1 %, 19. 5 % and 22. 7 % per year. Functional impairments were more strongly related to age. Conclusions. The strong association of (ADL) disability occurrence with proximity to death implies that a substantial part of the disability burden may shift to older ages with further increases in <b>life</b> <b>expectanc...</b>|$|E
40|$|Concern {{has been}} raised about the {{potential}} risks related to radiation exposure from CT scans, particularly among children. However, to date, there are few data available describing the magnitude of pediatric CT utilization. The aim {{of the study was}} to explore patterns of CT use in pediatric patients, with respect to time, use of multiple scans, body regions imaged, and medical diagnoses. Records of 22, 223 scans performed on 18, 075 people aged <or = 18 years over the period 1999 - 2003, including diagnoses recorded within 21 days after the examination, were obtained from a large Israeli Health Maintenance Organization (1, 600, 000 members). The highest annual CT examination rate (per 1, 000) was recorded in 2001 (10. 1) compared to 7. 0 and 6. 3 in 1999 and 2003, respectively. The lowest rate (three scans per 1, 000) was found for 3 -year-old children, with increasing rates with age. The head was the most frequently scanned region, both in young children (78 %) and adolescents (39 %). Symptoms of ill-defined conditions and injuries were documented in 22 % and 10 % of all scans, respectively. Although the results suggest that children comprise only 3 % of all patients undergoing CT, this important modality must be carefully used because of their increased radiosensitivity, higher effective radiation doses, and longer <b>life</b> <b>expectanc...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nepal {{has entered}} from its unitary system {{into a new}} “Federal Democratic Republic State. ” The current {{constitution}} presents basic health care services as a fundamental right. The Ministry for Health and Population has been providing resources to meet health demands, but managers are wrestling to meet these demands. Persistent disparities between rural and urban and across regions resulted inferior health outcomes e. g. life expectancy in an urban district like Bhaktapur is 71 years, whereas in the rural district of Mugu it is 44 years. The poor health and poor {{access to health care}} in the past systems prompted people to seek a different model. Ultimately, all political parties except one have agreed on federalism. The exact number of federal states {{that are going to be}} created is unknown. In federalism, all federated states have to assume certain relationships between the locality, the region, and the nation that apply not only in politics but in health care too. Managing changes in health care organization during the transitional period and after restructuring the unitary Nepal into federal states should be carefully planned. In case, if new system also fails to deliver necessary health care services, the possibility of igniting of dissatisfaction, public unrest and even disintegration cannot be ignored. In order to outline a structure and give life to a health care system under federalism, health care professionals need to engage themselves seriously.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Femoral neck {{fractures}} {{in the elderly}} are frequent, represent a great health care problem, and {{have a significant impact}} on health insurance costs. Reconstruction options using hip arthroplasty include unipolar or bipolar hemiarthroplasty (HA), and total hip arthroplasty (THA). The purpose of this review is to discuss the indications, limitations, and pitfalls of each of these techniques. METHODS: The Pubmed database was searched for all articles on femoral neck fracture and for the reconstruction options presented in this review using the search terms "femoral neck fracture", "unipolar hemiarthroplasty", "bipolar hemiarthroplasty", and "total hip arthroplasty". In addition, cross-referencing was used to cover articles eventually undetected by the respective search strategies. The resulting articles were then reviewed with regard to the different techniques, outcome and complications of the distinct reconstruction options. RESULTS: THA yields the best functional results in patients with displaced femoral neck fractures with complication rates comparable to HA. THA is beneficially implanted using an anterior approach exploiting the internervous plane between the tensor fasciae latae and the sartorius muscles allowing for immediate full weight-bearing. Based on our findings, bipolar hemiarthroplasty, similar to unipolar hemiarthroplasty, cannot restorate neither anatomical nor biomechanical features of the hip joint. Therefore, it can only be recommended as a second line of defense-procedure for patients with low functional demands and limited live expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: THA is the treatment of choice for femoral neck {{fractures in}} patients older than 60 years. HA should only be implanted in patients with limited <b>life</b> <b>expectanc...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} the genetic etiology of a distinct leukoencephalopathy with autosomal recessive inheritance {{in a single}} family. We analyzed available MRIs and retrospectively reviewed clinical information and laboratory investigations. We performed whole-exome sequencing to find the causal gene variants. We identified 3 family members with a similar MRI pattern characterized by symmetrical signal abnormalities in the periventricular and deep cerebral white matter, thalami, and {{central part of the}} pons. Cerebellar atrophy was noted in advanced disease stages. Clinical features were childhood-onset slowly progressive spastic paraparesis, cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and in 2 patients, optic atrophy as well as vertical gaze and convergence palsies and nystagmus. Whole-exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous missense variants in the HMBS gene, both associated with the autosomal dominant disorder acute intermittent porphyria. Sanger sequencing of 6 healthy siblings confirmed the bi-allelic location of the variants and segregation with the disease. Patients had a slight and moderate increase in urinary and plasma porphobilinogen and 5 '-aminolevulinic acid, respectively, and a 50 % to 66 % decrease in hydroxymethylbilane synthase enzyme activity compared to normal. Bi-allelic HMBS variants have been reported before as cause of severe encephalopathy with early childhood fatality in acute intermittent porphyria. Our cases demonstrate childhood onset, but milder and slower disease progression in middle-aged patients. With this, a novel phenotype can be added to the disease spectrum associated with bi-allelic HMBS variants: a leukoencephalopathy with early onset, slowly progressive neurologic symptomatology, and long <b>life</b> <b>expectanc...</b>|$|E
40|$|Virtually all Western {{countries}} {{are seeking to}} bring retirement ages {{more in line with}} increases in longevity. The central question in this article is whether individuals choose a retirement age that fits their life expectancy. This would be ideal from a public policy perspective. The present study aims to test empirically whether retirement planning varies with expectations of survival among a sample of older employees in the Netherlands. Two questions are addressed: (i) what are older employees’ expectations of their remaining lifetime, and what factors influence this subjective life expectancy? (ii) Are individuals who perceive longer life horizons (high subjective life expectancy) more inclined to retire later than people who expect to live shorter? Methods: Using data from a panel study on retirement behaviour in the Netherlands (N= 1621 older employees aged 50 – 60 years), regression and survival models are estimated to examine the effect of subjective life expectancy on retirement planning and behaviour. Results: The results indicate that subjective life expectancy is a factor that is taken into account in retirement decision making, {{at least as far as}} retirement intentions are concerned. Older employees with longer time horizons have a preference for later retirement. When it comes to actual behaviour, however, time horizon does not appear to play a role. Conclusion: The results suggest that particularly employees with a high perceived life expectancy and an intention to work longer do not succeed in carrying their intentions into effect.

40|$|Background: A {{number of}} {{lifestyle}} factors, including smoking and drinking, {{are known to}} be independently associated with all-cause mortality. However, it might be more effective in motivating the public to adopt a healthier lifestyle if the combined effect of several lifestyle factors on all-cause mortality could be demonstrated in a straightforward manner. Methods: We examined the combined effects of 6 healthy lifestyle behaviors on all-cause mortality by estimating life expectancies at 40 and 60 years of age among 62 106 participants in a prospective cohort study with a 14. 5 -year follow-up. The healthy behaviors selected were current nonsmoking, not heavily drinking, walking 1 hour or more per day, sleeping 6. 5 to 7. 4 hours per day, eating green leafy vegetables almost daily, and having a BMI between 18. 5 to 24. 9. Results: At age 40, we found a 10. 3 -year increase in life expectancy for men and a 8. 3 -year increase for women who had all 6 healthy behaviors, as compared with those who had only 0 to 2 healthy behaviors. Increases of 9. 6 and 8. 2 years were observed for men and women, respectively, at age 60 with all 6 healthy behaviors. When comparing currently nonsmoking individuals with 0 to 1 healthy behaviors, the life expectancy of smokers was shorter in both men and women, even if they maintained all 5 other healthy behaviors. Conclusions: Among individuals aged 40 and 60 years, maintaining all 6 healthy lifestyle factors was associated with longer life expectancy. Smokers should be encouraged to quit smoking first and then to maintain or adopt the other 5 lifestyle factors. Key words: lifestyle; smoking; cohort study; <b>life</b> <b>expectanc...</b>|$|E
