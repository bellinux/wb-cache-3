40|$|Shareholders are {{normally}} {{entitled to the}} surplus, if any, which remains after a liquidator has paid off the company&# 039;s creditors and discharged all of its outstanding liabilities. Surplus distribution to shareholders is an anticipated event in the liquidation of a solvent company. Shareholders in insolvent companies, by contrast, {{are likely to be}} pleasantly surprised to receive surpluses prior to the cancellation of failed investments. Taxation liabilities are likely to arise for the shareholders in both events-under independent and, to a degree, inconsistent regimes provided by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cwth) (&# 039;ITAA 36 &# 039;) and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cwth) (&# 039;ITAA 97 &# 039;). This paper analyses Australian taxation of liquidation surpluses, noting historical factors and the approaches taken in four comparable tax jurisdictions. Company law applicable to <b>liquidation</b> <b>surplus</b> distributions is surveyed by way of introduction...|$|E
40|$|Persons {{who receive}} {{distributions}} of surplus {{assets in the}} liquidation of Australian companies may be liable to taxation under either the deemed dividends or capital gains regimes. The deemed dividend regime is now nearly 80 years old and contains many anomalous features. Inappropriately, the legislation prominently excludes the once tax-free, "capital" class of surplus distributions. Several tax jurisdictions comparable with Australia have legislation which is similar. High Court judgements {{over the years have}} invented a "character" for liquidation distributions and interpreted that legislation in ways that ill accord with modern commerce. Statutory amendments have not removed all the unhelpful judicial glosses that have intruded. By contrast, the capital gains regime has fewer fictions and better reflects the general law nature of <b>liquidation</b> <b>surpluses.</b> However, a further anomaly arises from the manner by which capital gains are subordinated to deemed dividends for the avoidance of "double taxation". In this article suggestions are made for the drafting of an improved code for the future taxation of <b>liquidation</b> <b>surpluses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Direct {{taxation}} {{of persons}} who receive distributions of surplus assets in the liquidation of Australian companies occurs under either the deemed dividends or capital gains regimes. Section 47 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) has deemed dividends for income taxation for over 80 years and the regime contains many anomalies. High Court judgments have attributed a questionable &# 039;character&# 039; to liquidation distributions, {{as a response to}} the Act&# 039;s exclusion of (once) tax-free, &# 039;capital&# 039; amounts. Division 7 A applies to liquidation distributions in quite limited circumstances. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) capital gains regime better reflects the general law nature of <b>liquidation</b> <b>surpluses</b> and does so with fewer fictions. The main e ect of GST on corporate insolvency, by contrast, concerns debt recovery. Positions of the Australian Taxation O ice (&# 039;the ATO&# 039;) and other creditors must be equalised when debts are released subsequent to the payment of imputation tax credits by the ATO. Stamp duty is not payable on commencement of liquidation in any Australian jurisdiction. However, only South Australia exempts distributions of dutiable property made by liquidators to the shareholders of liquidating companies...|$|R

Not wishing to see all that stuff abandoned in place, Olmsted managed to work out a bulk sale to the Chinese government. When he heard about it, President Truman was reported to have said, [...] "this was the best <b>liquidation</b> of <b>surplus</b> US equipment anywhere in the world".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a competitive-equilibrium model of financial in-stitutions optimally choosing their debt maturity {{structure in the}} face of idiosyncratic as well as aggregate risk. Rollover risk arises endogenously from the interaction of creditors in a global-game framework. When only idiosyncratic risk is present short-term debt acts as an effective disciplining device but once aggregate risk is added a two-sided inefficiency arises. Good aggregate states lead to excessive risk-taking while bad aggregate states suf-fer from fire-sale <b>liquidation</b> – economic <b>surplus</b> is destroyed in both cases. In the competitive equilibrium with endogenous liquidation values, the two-sided inefficiency reinforces itself through a feedback effect. It increases the volatility of liquidation values and thereby amplifies the impact of aggregate risk. ∗I am indebted to my advisors Markus Brunnermeier and Stephen Morris for their guidance.
