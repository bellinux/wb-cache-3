In simplified terms, a fast taper will bend a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> the tip area {{and not much}} in the butt part, and a slow taper will tend to bend too much at the butt and delivers a weak rod. A progressive tapering which loads smooth from top to butt, adding in power the deeper the rod is bent.

In this practice, there is no straight relationship anymore between the actual tapering and the bending curve.|$|E

500|$|Prefix writer Craig Hubert {{rated the}} album 5 out of 10, {{and said it}} had more [...] "definable hooks" [...] than most other metal albums, but that still made the record no better or more accessible. He did note that {{he looked forward to}} when the band reached their full potential, which he felt the new record's music {{indicated}} would be soon. Speaking from his perspective as an aged listener and someone who is not a fan of modern rock music, Jay Bennett of the Phoenix New Times gave the album a grade of B. He described the album as “a pleasant surprise”, saying that he was not a fan of metal from recent years but that the album has “a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> common with the late-‘70s and early-‘80s-era Judas Priest and Iron Maiden”, which he liked.|$|E

500|$|Final Nintendo 64 {{specifications}} {{and development}} workstations were not initially available to Rare: a modified Sega Saturn controller {{was used for}} some early playtesting, and the developers had to estimate what the finalised console's capabilities would be. The final Nintendo 64 hardware could render polygons faster than the SGI Onyx workstations they had been using, but the game's textures had to be cut down by half. Karl Hilton explained one method of improving the game's performance: [...] "A lot of GoldenEye is in black and white. RGB colour textures cost a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> terms of processing power. You could do double the resolution if you used greyscale, so a lot was done like that. If I needed a bit of colour, I'd add it in the vertex." [...] At one time, developers planned to implement the reloading of the weapons by the player unplugging and re-inserting the Rumble Pak on the Nintendo 64 controller, though this idea was discarded at Nintendo's behest.|$|E
