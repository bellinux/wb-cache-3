50|$|In {{order to}} use Peirce's criterion, one must first {{understand}} the input and return values. Regression analysis (or the fitting of curves to data) results in residual errors (or {{the difference between}} the fitted curve and the observation points). Therefore, each observation point has a residual error associated with a fitted curve. By taking the square (i.e., residual error raised to the power of two), residual errors are expressed as positive values. If the squared error is too large (i.e., due to a poor observation) it can cause problems with the regression parameters (e.g., slope and intercept for a <b>linear</b> <b>curve)</b> retrieved from the curve fitting.|$|E

We then show that in the more restricted setting of <b>linear</b> <b>curves,</b> even discriminatory markets can be cleared fast in polynomial time.

50|$|The {{simplest}} of fade curves is the <b>linear</b> <b>curve</b> {{and it is}} normally the default fade. It takes a straight line and introduces a curve. This curve represents an equal degree by which the gain increases or decreases during {{the length of the}} fade. A linear fade-in curve makes it sound as though the volume increases sharply at the beginning, and more gradually towards the end. The same principle applies on a fade-out where a gradual drop in volume can be perceived in the beginning, and the fade gets more abrupt towards the end. If in your audio there is a natural ambience or reverb present that one would like to reduce, the linear shape would be ideal because of the initial drop in perceived volume. When applied it shortens the ambience. Also if the music requires an accelerating effect, this <b>linear</b> <b>curve</b> can also be applied. This type of fade is not very natural sounding. The principle of a linear cross-fade is: {{at the beginning of the}} fade the perceived volume drops more quickly, one can see at the halfway point (in the middle of the crossfade) that the perceived volume drops below 50%. This is a very noticeable drop in volume. Also if the control can move from position 0 to 100, and the percentage of the signal that is allowed to pass equals the position of the control (i.e. 25% of the signal is allowed to pass when the control is 25% of the physical distance from the 0 point to the 100 point). At the midpoint of the fade the effect of a linear cross-fade is that both the sounds are below half of their maximum perceived volume; and as a result the sum of the two fades will be below the maximum level of either. This is not applicable when the two sounds are on different levels and the cross-fade time is long enough. In turn if the crossfade is short (for example on a single note) the dip of the volume in the middle of the cross-fade can be quite noticeable.|$|E
50|$|At Rio (pronounced RYE-O), the North River makes a ninety-degree {{bend and}} flows north into the wide fertile North River Valley along North River Mountain (2149 ft). Also {{beginning}} at Rio, the North River parallels West Virginia Route 29 (Delray Road). On its journey northward, {{the river is}} fed from the west by Deep Run and Mick Run, which drain off of Short Mountain. Further north along WV 29, the river passes through the communities of Delray and Sedan at Pearl Ridge (1302 ft). Departing from Sedan, the North River flows under the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) at Hanging Rock and winds its way northward around North River Mountain. Pine Draft Run and Tearcoat Creek join the river south of Hoy before the river bends yet again and joins Gibbons Run. Flowing through the historic village of North River Mills, the river is joined by Hiett's Run, which flows from {{the eastern side of}} Ice Mountain (1489 ft). After North River Mills, the river makes a sharp <b>linear</b> <b>curve</b> around the Devil's Backbone (856 ft) and then commences its movement northward along Pine Mountain (1726 ft).

5000|$|Calculating {{the elastic}} modulus with {{software}} involves using software filtering techniques to separate the critical unloading data {{from the rest of}} the load-displacement data. The start and end points are usually found by using user defined percentages. This user input increases the variability because of possible human error. It would be best if the entire calculation process was automatically done for more consistent results. A good nanoindentation machine prints out the load unload curve data with labels to each of the segments such as loading, top hold, unload, bottom hold, and reloading. If multiple cycles are used then each one should be labeled. However mores nanoindenters only give the raw data for the load-unload curves. An automatic software technique finds the sharp change from the top hold time to the beginning of the unloading. This can be found by doing a linear fit to the top hold time data. The unload data starts when the load is 1.5 times standard deviation less than the hold time load. The minimum data point is the end of the unloading data. The computer calculates {{the elastic modulus}} with this data according to the Oliver-Pharr (nonlinear). The Doerner-Nix method is less complicated to program because it is a <b>linear</b> <b>curve</b> fit of the selected minimum to maximum data. However, it is limited because the calculated elastic modulus will decrease as more data points are used along the unloading curve. The Oliver-Pharr nonlinear curve fit method to the unloading curve data where [...] is the depth variable, [...] is the final depth and [...] and [...] are constants and coefficients. The software must use a nonlinear convergence method to solve for , [...] and [...] that best fits the unloading data.

40|$|Intersection delays are {{the major}} {{contributing}} factor to arterial delays. In this article, we study methods to estimate intersection delay patterns using measured travel times. The model requires sampled travel times between two consecutive locations on arterial streets, most likely upstream and downstream of a signalized intersection, without the need to know signal timing or traffic flow information. Signal phases can actually be estimated from the delay patterns. The proposed model is based on two observations regarding delays for signalized intersections: 1) delay can be approximately represented by piecewise <b>linear</b> <b>curves</b> due to the characteristics of queue forming and discharging before a signalized intersection, and 2) there is a non-trivial increase in delay {{after the start of}} the red time, which enables us to detect the start of a cycle. We then develop a least square based estimation algorithm to match measured delays in each cycle using piecewise <b>linear</b> <b>curves.</b> The proposed model and algorithm are tested using field experiment data with reasonable results. ...|$|R
