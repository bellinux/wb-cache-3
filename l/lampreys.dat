5|$|In larval <b>lampreys,</b> {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into the gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval <b>lampreys</b> (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reports of albino <b>lampreys</b> {{and it has}} been {{estimated}} that this occurs at a frequency of one in 100,000 normal individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{hindbrain}} (or metencephalon) {{is particularly}} involved in swimming and balance. The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest {{part of the}} brain. Hagfish and <b>lampreys</b> have relatively small cerebellae, while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sense.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific <b>lamprey</b> (Entosphenus tridentatus or Lampetra tridentata) is an {{anadromous}} parasitic <b>lamprey</b> {{from the}} Pacific Coast of North America and Asia.

5000|$|The brook <b>lamprey</b> (Lampetra planeri, {{also known}} as the European brook <b>lamprey</b> and the western brook <b>lamprey)</b> is a small European <b>lamprey</b> species that {{exclusively}} inhabits freshwater environments. The species is related to, but distinct from, the North American western brook <b>lamprey</b> (Lampetra richardsoni).|$|R
5000|$|The lake <b>lamprey,</b> Entosphenus macrostomus, {{also known}} as the Vancouver <b>lamprey</b> or Cowichan <b>lamprey,</b> is a species of {{freshwater}} <b>lamprey</b> endemic to two North American lakes: Lake Cowichan and Mesachie Lake in Vancouver Island, Canada. [...] The <b>lamprey</b> was originally called the Vancouver Island <b>lamprey,</b> until an error in filing shortened it to the Vancouver <b>lamprey.</b> The alternate common name of [...] "Cowichan lamprey" [...] was coined and promoted by the species' describer, Dr. Dick Beamish, who originally identified the species in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|The {{position}} of hagfish in the phylum Chordata is not settled. Phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported {{the idea that}} the hagfish and the <b>lampreys</b> form a natural group, the Cyclostomata, that is a sister group of the Gnathostomata.|$|E
5|$|In most fish, the {{esophagus}} is extremely short, {{primarily due to}} the length of the pharynx (which is associated with the gills). However, some fish, including <b>lampreys,</b> chimaeras, and lungfish, have no true stomach, so that {{the esophagus}} effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.|$|E
5|$|In the jawless fish (<b>lampreys</b> and hagfish), true lymphoid {{organs are}} absent. These fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are {{produced}} in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and {{some areas of the}} gut (where granulocytes mature.) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish.|$|E
50|$|The Day of <b>lamprey</b> {{is celebrated}} on the 2nd Saturday of October.

40|$|Other {{names that}} are {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} the sea <b>lamprey</b> are eel sucker, green <b>lamprey,</b> lamper, <b>lamprey</b> eel, nine eyes, shad <b>lamprey,</b> spotted <b>lamprey</b> as well as sucker. SCIENTIFIC NAME: Petromyzon marinus L. The sea <b>lamprey</b> is in the family Petromyzontidae, the <b>lamprey</b> family. It’s genus Petromyzon is made up of the Latin word “petra ” meaning “stone ” and the Greek word “myzon ” meaning “to suckle”. DISTRIBUTION: Natively the sea <b>lamprey</b> inhabits the Atlantic coast from Labrador to the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the Atlantic coast of Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. Currently they have expanded their range to include the Great Lakes.

5|$|Early {{fish from}} the fossil record are {{represented}} {{by a group of}} small, jawless, armored fish known as ostracoderms. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the <b>lampreys</b> may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in Placodermi fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.|$|E
5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} {{species has}} occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct. Carp, snakeheads, tilapia, European perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea <b>lampreys</b> are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E
5|$|The first {{vertebrates}} appeared over 500million {{years ago}} (Mya), during the Cambrian period, {{and may have}} resembled the modern hagfish in form. Sharks appeared about 450Mya, amphibians about 400Mya, reptiles about 350Mya, and mammals about 200Mya. Each species has an equally long evolutionary history, but the brains of modern hagfishes, <b>lampreys,</b> sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence. All of these brains contain {{the same set of}} basic anatomical components, but many are rudimentary in the hagfish, whereas in mammals the foremost part (the telencephalon) is greatly elaborated and expanded.|$|E

5000|$|The silver <b>lamprey</b> (Ichthyomyzon unicuspis) is a <b>lamprey</b> {{commonly}} found in the Northern and Central United States, {{as well as a}} large part of southern Canada. Its binomial name means [...] "fish to suck" [...] in Greek and [...] "one point" [...] in Latin. The silver <b>lamprey</b> {{is a member of the}} Class Agnatha, sometimes referred to as cyclostomes (round-mouths). Other common names include: Bloodsucker, Blue <b>Lamprey,</b> Hitch-hiker, Lamper, <b>Lamprey</b> Eel.

5|$|The various fish groups {{account for}} more than half of {{vertebrate}} species. There are almost 28,000 known extant species, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish, with 970 sharks, rays, and chimeras and about 108 hagfish and <b>lampreys.</b> A third of these species fall within the nine largest families; from largest to smallest, these families are Cyprinidae, Gobiidae, Cichlidae, Characidae, Loricariidae, Balitoridae, Serranidae, Labridae, and Scorpaenidae. About 64 families are monotypic, containing only one species. The final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32,500.|$|E
5|$|Most fish {{exchange}} gases using gills {{on either}} side of the pharynx. Gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments. Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like sharks and <b>lampreys,</b> possess multiple gill openings. However, bony fish have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum.|$|E
5|$|The optic tectum allows {{actions to}} be {{directed}} toward points in space, most commonly in response to visual input. In mammals it is usually {{referred to as the}} superior colliculus, and its best-studied function is to direct eye movements. It also directs reaching movements and other object-directed actions. It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as <b>lampreys,</b> this region is the largest part of the brain. The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain.|$|E
40|$|We cloned a cDNA {{encoding}} a novel (GnRH), named <b>lamprey</b> GnRH-II, {{from the}} sea <b>lamprey,</b> a basal vertebrate. The deduced amino acid sequence of the newly identified <b>lamprey</b> GnRH-II is QHWSHGWFPG. The architecture of the precursor {{is similar to that}} reported for other GnRH precursors consisting of a signal peptide, decapeptide, a downstream processing site, and a GnRH-associated peptide; however, the gene for <b>lamprey</b> GnRH-II does not have introns in comparison with the gene organization for all other vertebrate GnRHs. <b>Lamprey</b> GnRH-II precursor transcript was widely expressed in a variety of tissues. In situ hybridization of the brain showed expression and localization of the transcript in the hypothalamus, medulla, and olfactory regions, whereas immunohistochemistry using a specific antiserum showed only GnRH-II cell bodies and processes in the preoptic nucleus/hypothalamus areas. <b>Lamprey</b> GnRH-II was shown to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary axis using in vivo and in vitro studies. <b>Lamprey</b> GnRH-II was also shown to activate the inositol phosphate signaling system in COS- 7 cells transiently transfected with the <b>lamprey</b> GnRH receptor. These studies provide evidence for a novel <b>lamprey</b> GnRH that has a role as a third hypothalamic GnRH. In summary, the newly discovered <b>lamprey</b> GnRH-II offers a new paradigm of the origin of the vertebrate GnRH family. We hypothesize that due to a genome/gene duplication event, an ancestral gene gave rise to two lineages of GnRHs: the gnathostome GnRH and <b>lamprey</b> GnRH-II...|$|R

40|$|We {{will report}} {{results of an}} ongoing project in the Deschutes River Subbasin to {{describe}} Pacific <b>lamprey</b> (Lampetra tridentata) life history. Project objectives were to determine adult <b>lamprey</b> escapement from Sherars Falls located at Rkm 70. 4 and determine <b>lamprey</b> focal spawning areas, spawn timing and habitat through radio telemetry. A mark-recapture study and tribal creel was conducted to determine adult escapement. <b>Lamprey</b> were radio tagged and are currently being mobile, aerial and fixed site tracked to describe spawning. Adult <b>lamprey</b> were collected at Sherars Falls using a long-handled dip net from June-September 2007. The fate of <b>lamprey</b> collected at Sherars Falls was determined based on girth measurements. Fish measuring less than 10. 5 cm received two markings for the mark-recapture estimation while those measuring 10. 5 cm or greater were implanted with radio transmitters. Two-hundred and nine <b>lamprey</b> were marked during first event sampling, 2, 501 <b>lamprey</b> inspected for marks and 64 recaptured during second event sampling. We estimate <b>lamprey</b> abundance to be 8, 083 (6, 352 - 10, 279) with a relative precision of 19. 8. Tribal harvest was 2, 303 +/- 88. Escapement was estimated at 5, 780 adult <b>lamprey.</b> Thirty-six <b>lamprey</b> received radio transmitters. <b>Lamprey</b> were transported upstream 6. 3 Rkm for surgery, held to recover from anesthesia and released. Mobile tracking efforts started mid-July 2007 and are on-going. To date 35 of the 36 <b>lamprey</b> have been detected. Upon release, extensive ground-based tracking was conducted until fish became dormant in mid-October. Since, fixed site downloading and tracking have occurred weekly on the mainstem Deschutes River. Majority of <b>lamprey</b> (88 %) are holding in the mainstem Deschutes River. Three <b>lamprey</b> moved upstream more than 70 Rkms into westside tributaries from August-December. Three moved approximately 18 Rkms downstream of the release site. Tracking will continue through the spawning season when redd characteristics will be measured and reported in the 2008 - 2009 annual report...|$|R
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{variation in the}} size and shape of the cerebellum in different vertebrate species. In amphibians, it is little developed, and in <b>lampreys,</b> and hagfish, the cerebellum is barely distinguishable from the brain-stem. Although the spinocerebellum is present in these groups, the primary structures are small, paired-nuclei corresponding to the vestibulocerebellum. The cerebellum is a bit larger in reptiles, considerably larger in birds, and larger yet in mammals. The large paired and convoluted lobes found in humans are typical of mammals, but the cerebellum is, in general, a single median lobe in other groups, and is either smooth or only slightly grooved. In mammals, the neocerebellum is the major part of the cerebellum by mass, but, in other vertebrates, it is typically the spinocerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Henry campaigned {{throughout}} the autumn, strengthening the southern frontier, and then travelled to Lyons-la-Forêt in November to enjoy some hunting, still apparently healthy. There Henry fell ill– {{according to the}} chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, he ate a number of <b>lampreys</b> against his physician's advice– and his condition worsened {{over the course of}} a week. Once the condition appeared terminal, Henry gave confession and summoned Archbishop Hugh of Amiens, who was joined by Robert of Gloucester and other members of the court. In accordance with custom, preparations were made to settle Henry's outstanding debts and to revoke outstanding sentences of forfeiture. The King died on 1 December 1135, and his corpse was taken to Rouen accompanied by the barons, where it was embalmed; his entrails were buried locally at Port-du-Salut Abbey, and the preserved body was taken on to England, where it was interred at Reading Abbey.|$|E

40|$|Vav guanine {{nucleotide}} exchange factor 3 (Vav 3), a Rho family GTPase, regulates multiple cell signaling pathways {{including those of}} T- and B-cell receptors in vertebrates through mediating {{the activities of the}} Rho family members. Whether the <b>lamprey</b> possesses Vav 3 homolog and what role it plays in immune response remain unknown. Gene cloning, recombinant expression, antibody production and expression pattern analyses were performed to characterize the <b>lamprey</b> Vav 3 in the current study. The <b>lamprey</b> Vav 3 is closer to jawed vertebrates’ Vav 3 molecules (about 53 % identities in general) than to Vav 2 molecules of jawless and jawed vertebrates (about 51 % identities in general) in sequence similarity. Conserved motif analysis showed that the most distinguished parts between Vav 3 and Vav 2 proteins are their two Src-homology 3 domains. The relative expression levels of <b>lamprey</b> vav 3 mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated in <b>lamprey</b> lymphocytes and supraneural myeloid bodies after mixed-antigens stimulation, respectively. In addition, <b>lamprey</b> Vav 3 were up-regulated drastically in lymphocytes and supraneural myeloid bodies after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) rather than phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation. <b>Lamprey</b> Vav 3 distributed in the cytoplasm of variable lymphocyte receptor B positive (VLRB+) lymphocytes, and the number of plasmacytes (VLRB and <b>lamprey</b> Vav 3 double positive) in blood lymphocytes also increased after LPS stimulation. Our results proved that <b>lamprey</b> Vav 3 was involved in the LPS-mediated immune reaction of <b>lamprey</b> and provided a clue for the further study of the precise role <b>lamprey</b> Vav 3 played in the signaling pathway of <b>lamprey</b> VLRB+ lymphocytes...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, the sea <b>lamprey</b> (Petromyzon marinus) has grown {{substantially}} {{as a model for}} understanding the evolutionary fundaments and capacity of vertebrate developmental and genome biology. Recent work on the <b>lamprey</b> genome has resulted in a preliminary assembly of the <b>lamprey</b> genome and led to the realization that nearly all somatic cell lineages undergo extensive programmed rearrangements. Here we describe the development of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) resource for <b>lamprey</b> germline DNA and use sequence information from this resource to probe the subchromosomal structure of the <b>lamprey</b> genome. The arrayed germline BAC library represents ~ 10 × coverage of the <b>lamprey</b> genome. Analyses of BAC-end sequences reveal that the <b>lamprey</b> genome possesses a high content of repetitive sequences (relative to human), which show strong clustering at the subchromosomal level. This pattern is not unexpected given that the sea <b>lamprey</b> genome is dispersed across a large number of chromosomes (n[*]∼[*] 99) and suggests a low-copy DNA targeting strategy for efficiently generating informative paired-BAC-end linkages from highly repetitive genomes. This library therefore represents a new and biologically informed resource for understanding the structure of the <b>lamprey</b> genome and the biology of programmed genome rearrangement...|$|R
