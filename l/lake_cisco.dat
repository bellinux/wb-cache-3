5000|$|There {{has been}} {{scientific}} disagreement {{on whether or}} not the Ives <b>Lake</b> <b>cisco</b> is a distinct species from the widespread C. artedi; hence there is no consensus on the conversation status.

[...] However, a 2013 report from the same publisher gave the Ives <b>Lake</b> <b>cisco</b> a [...] "critically imperiled" [...] G-rank and S-rank for conservation status, and listed the fish as [...] "extremely vulnerable" [...] to climate change.|$|E

50|$|Cisco in {{its early}} days was plagued with {{inadequate}} water supply. In the 1920s the Williamson Dam was built north of town, resulting {{in the formation of}} <b>Lake</b> <b>Cisco.</b> The dam was named after James Milton Williamson, long-time mayor and survivor of the 1893 tornado. At its base was built what was billed as the largest concrete swimming pool in the world. The complex boasted a two story building with a skating rink upstairs, a zoo, an amusement park with rides, and a park. Bob Wills was only one of the celebrities to entertain there. For decades it was a major attraction for folks from miles around. The hollow dam was at one time open to the public, but this is no longer the case. The pool closed in the 1970s and the vacant skating rink burned a few years later.|$|E

40|$|Cisco (Coregonus artedi) is {{the most}} common coldwater {{stenothermal}} fish in Minnesota lakes. Water temperature (T) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in lakes are important controls of fish growth and reproduction and likely change with future climate warming. Built upon a previous study, this study uses a modified method to identify which of 620 <b>cisco</b> <b>lakes</b> in Minnesota can still support cisco populations under future climate and therefore be classified as <b>cisco</b> refuge <b>lakes.</b> The previous study used oxythermal stress parameter TDO 3, the temperature at DO of 3 mg/L, simulated only from deep virtual lakes to classify 620 <b>cisco</b> <b>lakes.</b> Using four categories of virtual but representative <b>cisco</b> <b>lakes</b> in modified method, a one-dimensional water quality model MINLAKE 2012 was used to simulate daily T and DO profiles in 82 virtual lakes under the past (1961 – 2008) and two future climate scenarios. A multiyear average of 31 -day largest TDO 3 over variable benchmark (VB) periods, AvgATDO 3 VB, was calculated from simulated T and DO profiles using FishHabitat 2013. Contour plots of AvgATDO 3 VB for four categories of virtual lakes were then developed to reclassify 620 <b>cisco</b> <b>lakes</b> into Tier 1 (AvgATDO 3 VB 17 °C). About 20 % of 620 <b>cisco</b> <b>lakes</b> are projected to be refuge lakes under future climate scenarios, which is a more accurate projection (improving the prediction accuracy by ~ 6. 5 % from the previous study) since AvgATDO 3 VB was found to vary by lake categories...|$|R

40|$|This report makes {{projections}} of potential (refuge) habitat for cisco, a coldwater fish, in Minnesota lakes under projected warmer climate scenarios. It {{is about the}} identification and selection of potential refuge <b>lakes</b> for <b>cisco</b> under future climate scenarios in Minnesota. This is {{the third and final}} project report in a series that describes computer model simulations of <b>cisco</b> (tullibee) <b>lakes</b> for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The first report gave an overview of the characteristics of <b>cisco</b> <b>lakes</b> in Minnesota, the second gave results of water quality (temperature and dissolved oxygen, DO) model simulations for selected Minnesota <b>cisco</b> <b>lakes,</b> and this third report identifies and quantifies in which Minnesota <b>lakes</b> <b>cisco</b> habitat is most likely to continue to exist under global warming scenarios. Cisco habitat simulations were first made for continuous, year-round weather time series from 1962 to 2008 (47 years) at the daily time scale. Simulations were then extended to projected future climate scenarios. A year-round water quality model MINLAKE 2010, that had previously been calibrated against 7384 pairs of temperature and DO data points measured in 28 lakes between 1979 and 2008 with overall standard errors of 1. 47 oC for water temperature, and 1. 50 mg/L for DO, was used in all cisco habitat simulations (Fang et al. 2010). Adult cisco habitat is limited by critical water temperature and DO conditions in different strata of a <b>cisco</b> <b>lake.</b> The selection was based on the oxythermal parameter TDO 3, which relates to the survival stress of adult cisco. The lower the TDO 3 is, the lower the stress is to cisco. TDO 3 is a water temperature that occurs where DO = 3 mg/L and was used as the oxythermal parameter to select suitable habitat for adult cisco (Jacobson et al. 2010). Twelve TDO 3 parameters ranging from single-day values to multi-year averages, and from extreme values to mean values, were defined in Table 3. 1 and calculated from simulated daily temperature and DO profiles. The multi-year values AvgATDO 3 FB and AvgATDO 3 VB were ultimately chosen from Table 3. 1, lines 6 and 12, for the selection of <b>cisco</b> refuge <b>lakes.</b> Each of these two TDO 3 parameters is calculated over the length of a 31 -day benchmark period; one uses a fixed benchmark period from DOY 209 to DOY 239 (July 28 to August 27); the other uses a variable (sliding) benchmark period of 31 days.

Some fish consumption guideline restrictions have been placed on the <b>lake's</b> bluegill, <b>cisco,</b> crappie, northern pike, walleye, and white sucker due to mercury contamination. [...] Many feel the increased population of muskies has had a detrimental effect on the walleye population, although walleye fishing has improved since the implementation of a walleye slot limit (18" [...] to 26") and reduced bag limit (from 6 to 4) in recent years.|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} the second {{in a series of}} three reports that {{describe}} model simulations of <b>cisco</b> (tullibee) <b>lakes</b> for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. This report describes the adaption, calibration and application of the year-round water quality model MINLAKE 2010, used for the year-round simulation of daily water temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles in 28 lakes in Minnesota. The results of this report will be applied in the third report to make projections of potential (refuge) habitat for cisco, a cold-water fish, in Minnesota lakes under warmer future climate scenarios. Twenty-one <b>cisco</b> <b>lakes</b> and seven non-cisco habitat lakes were selected for the model simulations including adaptation, calibration and application of the model. Lake bathymetry data and measured water quality data (water temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles, Secchi depths, chlorophyll-a concentrations) were assembled and analyzed. Weather data were assembled for the periods 1961 to 2008 from six Class I weather stations, and 1991 to 2008 from three Class II weather stations. In order to more accurately project water quality conditions in <b>cisco</b> <b>lakes,</b> which are typically deep mesotrophic or oligotrophic lakes, modifications and refinements were made in the MINLAKE 96 computer program, especially the simulation procedures and utility functions of the model. The model simulations of daily water temperature and DO profiles in the 28 lakes were calibrated using six calibration parameters. After calibration the average standard error of estimate (S. E.) against measured data for all 28 lakes is 1. 47 oC for water temperature (range from 0. 8 to 2. 06 oC) and 1. 50 mg/L for DO (range from 0. 88 to 2. 76 mg/L). The average regression coefficient (R 2) is 0. 92 for water temperature (range from 0. 84 to 0. 97) and 0. 75 for DO (range from 0. 12 to 0. 91). Simulation results are presented as profile plots and time-series plots. Individual model calibration parameters were analyzed, and regional values were proposed for <b>cisco</b> <b>lakes</b> without data. The model performance using proposed calibration parameter values was examined. Minnesota Department of Natural Resource...|$|R
