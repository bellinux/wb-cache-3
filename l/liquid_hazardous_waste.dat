40|$|Today {{we see a}} {{substantial}} increase in the use of alternative fuels in the cement industry. The prospect of reduction in fuel costs and the environmental benefits of waste to energy conversion are the driving forces. For several years Norcem have steadily increased their use of alternative fuels such as refuse derived fuel (RDF), <b>liquid</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> (LHW), solid hazardous waste (SHW), animal meal (AM) and waste oil (WO). Alternative fuels behave differently compared to e. g. coal during combustion, which is a factor that may influence the clinker quality, kiln operation, energy consumption and emissions. Scancem International ANS and Telemark University College has therefore initiated a research program to provide a better basis for characterization and understanding of alternative fuels in cement kilns. The study focus on the effect of alternative fuel properties on NOx reduction by advanced reburning and reburning in conjunction with CO emission.

40|$|Today {{virtually}} all cement clinker burning processes {{take place in}} rotary kilns. A mixture of calcareous and argilaceous materials is heated to a temperature of about 1450 °C. In this process decarbonation followed by partial fusion occurs, and nodules of so-called clinker are formed. The cooled clinker is mixed with a few percent of gypsum, and ground into a fine meal - cement. The most modern cement kilns are equipped with a precalciner, in {{which most of the}} calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide, before the precalcined meal enters the rotary kiln, where the rest of the burning takes place. The endothermic cement burning process requires large amounts of thermal energy, which is supplied by fuel combustion in the rotary kiln and in the precalciner. Coal and petcoke are most frequently used, but oil and natural gas, are also burnt in some plants. However, due the negative impact of the fossil fuels on the environment, alternative fuels are utilized to an ever increasing extent.

The typical requirement of the industry sector is rapid screening to support decisions on the most appropriate treatment of the waste. This paper reports the use of high resolution EDXRF spectrometry for the {{analysis of}} halides and toxic heavy elements using a new rapid technique incorporating an unique sample preparation methodology. Calibrations are developed using traceable certified 1000 mg 1 -T aqueous standards and pure organic solvents. Samples are stabilised in an alumina matrix and measured against a suitable calibration. The benefits of this new technique are: l Ease of obtaining calibration standards l Removal of sample history- i. e. control of matrix effects l Minimisation of analyte loss during sample preparation l Wide range of matrix types measurable using a single calibration- e. g. clean solvents to turbid sewage sludge l Accuracy of measurement- typically within 10 % relative in the concentration range lo- 1 OOmg kg- 1 with a precision better than 5 % relative l Speed of analysis- for> 20 elements typically ~ 15 minutes from receipt of sample. Results presented in this paper show high resolution EDXRF to be ideally suited to the analysis of LHW due to good heavy element detection in the atomic number range 30 - 82 (Zn- Pb).

Characterisation of solid and liquid industrial <b>wastes</b> generated, including <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes,</b> is presented together with current and projected waste loads, recycling opportunities, and export/import practices. Institutional capacity and needs pertaining to the enforcement of relevant environmental legislation, staffing and resources, monitoring schemes, and public participation are critically evaluated. Finally, realistic options for industrial-waste management {{in the context of}} country-specific institutional economic and technical limitations are outlined. The industrial sector in Lebanon consists of small-scale industries (84 % employ less than 10 persons), primarily involved in light manufacturing (96 %). These industries which are distributed among 41 ill-defined zones and deficient in appropriate physical infrastructure, generate solid, <b>liquid,</b> and <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> estimated at 346 730 tons/year, 20 169 600 m 3 /year and between 3000 to 15 000 tons/year, respectively.

The process is affected by many parameters (curing time, curing temperature, relative humidity etc.) and leads to a resistant matrix usable for inertization of hazardous waste. In this study an industrial liquid waste containing a high amount of chromium (≈ 2. 3 wt%) in the form of metalorganic salts is inertized into a metakaolin based geopolymer matrix. One of the innovative aspects is the exploitation of the water contained in the waste for the geopolymerization process. This avoided any drying treatment, a common step in the management of <b>liquid</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> The evolution of the process - from the precursor dissolution to the final geopolymer matrix hardening - of different geopolymers containing a waste amount ranging from 3 to 20 %wt and their capability to inertize chromium cations were studied by: i) the leaching tests, according to the EN 12, 457 regulation, at different curing times (15, 28, 90 and 540 days) monitoring releases of chromium ions (Cr(III) and Cr(VI)) and the cations constituting the aluminosilicate matrix (Na, Si, Al); ii) the humidity variation for different curing times (15 and 540 days); iii) SEM characterization at different curing times (28 and 540 days); iv) the trend of the solution conductivity and pH during the leaching test; v) the characterization of the short-range ordering in terms of TOT bonds (where T is Al or Si) by 29 Si and 27 Al solid state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (ss MAS NMR) for geopolymers containing high amounts of waste (10 - 20 %wt).

WLP is difficult to recycle and hazardous to the environment due to the volatile organic compounds it contains. Several methods exist for disposing WLP including paint swaps, combustion, drying and discarding in a landfill, and by placing pigments in cement. Many communities are moving to dispose WLP by drying and placing in a landfill due to the reduced cost. However, this is the least preferred technique for the environment because it creates a need for new resources. Concrete {{is one of the most}} widely used construction materials in the world. Nonetheless, normal concrete has several disadvantages including low tensile strength, low weight to strength ratio, and low chemical resistance. Latex-modified concrete (LMC) was created to overcome several disadvantages found in normal concrete. The latex in LMC increases the cost of concrete which makes LMC economically practical only in special applications, such as bridge overlays, anti-corrosive linings, water-proofing, parking decks, and patching deteriorating concrete. This thesis studies the ability of WLP to be used as a replacement for pure latex and as a method to improve normal concrete for special applications. These applications include bridge overlays, rigid pavements, and pervious concrete. Bridge overlays were studied due to latex being commonly used in bridge overlay concrete mixtures. Rigid pavements were studied because pavements are commonly used and WLP has the ability to improve normal concrete properties. Finally, WLP was studied in pervious concrete due to the importance of having a strong cementitious paste in pervious concrete. Fresh concrete properties were tested along with hardened and durability properties. Testing was performed on the latex paint, pure latex, and the cementitious paste. The tested fresh properties include slump, air entrainment, and unit weight. The tested hardened properties will consist of compressive strength, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and modulus of rupture.

40|$|A spaceflight-compatible {{flow cytometer}} {{would be useful}} for the {{diagnosis}} of astronaut illness during long duration spaceflight and for conducting in-flight research to evaluate the effects of microgravity on human physiology. Until recently, the primary limitations preventing {{the development of a}} spaceflight compatible flow cytometer have been largely mechanical. Standard commercially available flow cytometers are large, complex instruments that use high-energy lasers and require significant training to operate. Standard flow cytometers function by suspending the particles to be analyzed inside a sheath fluid for analysis. This requires the presence of several liters of sheath fluid for operation, and generates a corresponding amount of <b>liquid</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> The particles are then passed through a flow cell which uses the fluid mechanical property of hydrodynamic focusing to place the cells in single-file (laminar flow) as they pass through a laser beam for scanning and evaluation. Many spaceflight experiments have demonstrated that fluid physics is dramatically altered in microgravity (MSF [Manned Space Flight] Fluid Physics Data Sheet-August 1997) and previous studies have shown that sheath-fluid based hydrodynamic focusing may also be altered during microgravity (Crucian et al, 2000). For these reasons it is likely that any spaceflight compatible design for a flow cytometer would abandon the sheath fluid requirement. The elimination of sheath fluid would remove both the problems of weight associated with large volumes of liquids as well as the large volume of liquid waste generated. It would also create the need for a method to create laminar particle flow distinct from the standard sheath-fluid based method. The spaceflight prototype instrument is based on a recently developed commercial flow cytometer possessing a novel flow cell design that creates single-particle laser scanning and evaluation without the need for sheath-fluid based hydrodynamic focusing. This instrument also possesses a number of design advances that make it conditionally microgravity compatible: it is highly miniaturized and lightweight, uses a low energy diode laser, has a small number of moving parts, does not use sheath fluid and does not generate significant liquid waste. Although possessing certain limitations, the commercial cytometer functions operationally like a standard bench top laboratory flow cytometer, aspirating liquid particle samples and generating histogram or dot-plot data in standard FCS file format. In its current configuration however, the cytometer is limited to three parameter/two-color capability (two color PMTs + forward scatter), does not allow compensation between colors, does not allow linear analysis and is operated by rather inflexible software with limited capabilities. This {{is due to the fact}} that the cytometer has been designed and marketed as an instrument specific to a few particular assays, not as a multipurpose cytometer...|$|E
