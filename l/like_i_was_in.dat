500|$|Although Gay {{withdrew from}} the second race of the competition, the Jamaican once again {{produced}} world record-breaking form in the 200 metres final. He broke his own record by 0.11 seconds, finishing {{with a time of}} 19.19 seconds. He won the 200 m race by the biggest margin in World Championships history, even though the race had three other athletes running under 19.90 seconds, the greatest number ever in the event. Bolt's pace impressed even the more experienced of his competitors; third-placed Wallace Spearmon complimented his speed, and the Olympic champion in Athens 2004 Shawn Crawford said [...] "Just coming out there...I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a video game, that guy was moving – fast". Bolt pointed out that an important factor in his performance at the World Championships was his improved start to the races: his reaction times in the 100 m (0.146) and 200 m (0.133) were significantly faster than those he had produced in his world record runs at the Beijing Olympics. However, he, together with other members of Jamaican 4x100 m relay team, fell short of their own world record of 37.10 s set at 2008 Summer Olympics by timing 37.31 s, which is, however, a championship record and the second fastest time in history at that date.|$|E
500|$|During {{his brief}} second term as mayor in 1912, Armstrong and council {{approved}} {{a plan to}} construct 110 miles of electric railway lines in the city, considered legislation permitting band concerts on Sundays, oversaw {{the opening of the}} Royal Alexandra Hospital, advocated for the availability of housing accommodations for all Edmontonians {{in the face of an}} influx of new settlers, and welcomed a visit from Governor General of Canada Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn to the city, planning a grand celebration. It was also in 1912 that the Hudson's Bay Company put its Edmonton land holdings on the market, the first bridge across the North Saskatchewan River in the city's east end opened, and that Armstrong commissioned a master plan for the newly amalgamated city, from an American firm based out of Minneapolis named Morell and Nichols. Among the suggestions in the report was the recommendation for a civic square to be built, which was opened 53 years later as Sir Winston Churchill Square. In his final week as mayor, the retiring Armstrong delivered the city's annual report at an annual meeting, thanked the people of Edmonton for entrusting him as mayor, and advised his successor to be fiscally responsible; stating, [...] "If a reckless administration gets in next year, Edmonton will become a city <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> recently, where they could not borrow enough money to clean their streets." [...] In the election held later that week, he would be succeeded by former mayor from 1901–04, William Short, whom he supported and campaigned for. Armstrong was later honoured with an informal gathering in the city council chamber where he was presented with a gift of silverware; with the city fire chief proclaiming that [...] "Mayor Armstrong is bound to become a historical character".|$|E

She told Rolling Stone that she recorded her vocals for the song [...] "Window Seat" [...] in her shower, stating [...] "I wanted to sound <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a tunnel. I got my laptop and closed the door." [...] In an interview for Billboard, Badu explained that [...] "we used a lot of analog instruments—harps, strings, drums, piano, and even a Theremin—to give the album that sonic feel. There's a strong undercurrent of bottom, a rumbling to these songs that feels good to me. It feels like a hug." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{setting the}} record in Salamanca, Sotomayor told reporters, [...] "I wanted {{to set the record}} here because it is a small city in which <b>I</b> feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> Cuba.

2500|$|At the US Open, Dementieva {{reached the}} quarterfinals {{for the fourth}} time, losing to Janković 6–2, 6–1. The three games she won were all breaks of serve. Dementieva remarked afterwards, [...] "Yeah, it is disappointing, you know. I'm getting older, and I haven't won a Grand Slam, so that's really what I'm {{thinking}} about all the time. I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a good shape here. That's why it's sad"[...] She relinquished to Sharapova, who won the tournament, {{the distinction of being}} the Russian player to have won the most career prize money. Dementieva qualified for the year-ending WTA Tour Championships for the seventh straight time, the only active player to do so. She lost to all three players in her round robin group: Sharapova 6–1, 6–4; Svetlana Kuznetsova 7–5, 6–3; and Clijsters 6–4, 6–0. Her career win-loss record at this tournament fell to 3–14. She had lost her last nine matches played there.|$|E
2500|$|After {{placing her}} career on hiatus, Lopez {{released}} her fourth studio album, Rebirth, in February 2005. According to Lopez, Rebirth [...] "came about because I was {{on such a}} roller-coaster ride, that was my career from my first album to my last album, and I did a bunch of movie projects in between. I finally took some time just for myself, and [...] I came back, {{this was the first}} project I did. I felt like it was a new beginning for me, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> a way, reborn." [...] Tracy Hopkins of NBC's Today Music noted that after [...] "fawning" [...] over Affleck on This Is Me... Then", Lopez [...] "wisely keeps her love life out of the spotlight" [...] on Rebirth and only references her relationship with Anthony on a few tracks. The album produced the single [...] "Get Right", which peaked at number one in the United Kingdom. In May, she starred alongside Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy Monster-in-Law, for which she received a salary of $15million. The film's marketing played up Lopez's [...] "Gigli-and-tabloid tarnished image", and it became a box office success. In August, Lopez starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in An Unfinished Life, a drama film based on the novel of the same name.|$|E

500|$|The {{musician}} Andrew W.K. {{said that}} he strongly identifies with the over-enthusiastic character of Pinkie Pie. He said, [...] "She's another creature, much <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> this world, who is doing everything she can to have fun," [...] and that he feels inspired by the character spreading excitement and joy to others. He hosted a panel called [...] "What Would Pinkie Pie Do?" [...] at the Canterlot Gardens convention in September 2012, and described it as [...] "the most intense experience of [...] life".|$|R
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} me human beings could not have more eagerly and swiftly obeyed an order. Herky and Bill and Bud jerked their arms down and {{extended}} their hands out behind. After that quick action they again turned into statues. There was a breathless suspense in every act. And {{there was something about}} Jim Williams then that I did not <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a cold perspiration for fear one of the men would make some kind of a move. As the very mention of the Texan had always caused a little silence, so his presence changed the atmosphere of that cabin room. Before his coming there had been the element of chance--a feeling of danger, to be sure, but a healthy spirit of give and take. That had all changed with Jim Williams's words [...] "Hands up!" [...] There was now something terrible hanging in the balance. I had but to look at Jim's eyes, narrow slits of blue fire, at the hard jaw and tight lips, to see a glimpse of the man who thought nothing of life. It turned me sick, and I was all in a tremor till Dick and Hiram had the men bound fast.|$|E

5000|$|Particulars of {{her first}} journey remain {{shrouded}} in secrecy. She crossed into Pennsylvania {{with a feeling of}} relief and awe, and recalled the experience years later: When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person.

50|$|She was a forerunner, musically.

40|$|A Renaissance on the Eastside: Motivating Inner-City Youth Through Art Research {{tells us}} that {{children}} {{are more susceptible to}} temptations between the hours of 2 : 00 p. m. and 6 : 00 p. m. —the hours following {{the end of the school}} day when parents are not yet home from work. This study looks at the "life histories " of child participants in the Artists in the Making (AIM) program—a program that aims to motivate inner-city youth through the use of visual arts classes. Despite the diversity of the children who participated in the AIM program, several common themes emerged from the interview process: self-discovery, problem-solving skills, opportunities for positive risk taking, and the mastery of artistic skills.
