25|$|Gödel's Platonism postulates {{a special}} kind of {{mathematical}} intuition that <b>lets</b> <b>us</b> perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things Husserl said about mathematics, and supports Kant's idea that mathematics is synthetic a priori.) Davis and Hersh have suggested in their book The Mathematical Experience that most mathematicians act as though they are Platonists, even though, if pressed to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to formalism (see below).|$|E

This line can be plotted as a point on the disk just as any line through the origin can. So the stereographic projection also <b>lets</b> <b>us</b> visualize planes as points in the disk.

25|$|In {{the key of}} C major {{the first}} degree of the scale, called the tonic, is the note C itself, so a C major chord, a triad built on the note C, may be called the one chord of that key and notated in Roman numerals as I.

It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it.

The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around." [...] At Metacritic the film has received an average score of 86, based on 34 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "The movie is powerful precisely because it doesn't preach. It is so restrained that at one momentthe judge's final speechI wanted one more sentence, making a point, but the movie <b>lets</b> <b>us</b> supply that thought for ourselves". Stephen Holden, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "Traffic is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller.

In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Traffic marks [...] definitively as an enormous talent, one who never <b>lets</b> <b>us</b> guess what he's going to do next.

[...] James Dinh of MTV noted that the song [...] "features an uplifting country/pop melody and a big chorus" [...] and it talks about [...] "the wonders of being in a happy relationship after surviving a rocky past."

Shenae Grimes, whose complex portrayal of a young woman in mental pain—and the conflicting emotions that entails—makes her depiction not only believable, but to those who have had similar experiences, entirely relatable." [...] Raju Mudhar of the Toronto Star also had praise for the season, commenting that [...] "the way that it has managed to deal with aging—which has been the destruction for many of its peers, and the level of honesty and attempted authenticity has always set Degrassi apart. The fact that show has always cast actors within a year or two of their characters' ages has always helped."

500|$|On March 13, Kristin Dos Santos of E! {{confirmed}} that the series would be a spin-off with new characters, and not a remake. In order for the project {{to be ready for}} the network's [...] "upfront" [...] presentations to advertisers in May, casting began before the script was completed. The first actor to be cast was Dustin Milligan on April 1, followed by AnnaLynne McCord on April 14. Sachs found Milligan to be [...] "really funny", and changed Ethan to better represent his personality. McCord was cast because, according to Sachs, [...] "she's someone who is worldly, and there's a sophistication to her that's interesting". Actress and singer Hilary Duff was rumored to have been offered the part of Annie, but she told reports that it was [...] "not true". The role was eventually given to Shenae Grimes, who says she was raised watching the original series. Sachs and Judah had seen Grimes' work before and knew [...] "she had the acting chops", and she was cast after acting a dramatic scene which she [...] "just killed".

500|$|In 2006, supervising {{animator}} on {{the film}} Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: [...] "Getting {{a full range of}} performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that <b>lets</b> <b>us</b> communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right." ...|$|E

It was not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. On the evolution of S.H.I.E.L.D. to featuring so many powered characters, Whedon said [...] "the dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E
