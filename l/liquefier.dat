The process was {{optimized}} to produce the highest amount of <b>liquefied</b> wood. Wood <b>liquefied</b> at 160 ºC for 90 min {{was used in the}} adhesion tests. The bond strength of veneer glued with urea-formaldehyde and melamine-urea-formaldehyde resins and several mixtures of <b>liquefied</b> wood with urea- formaldehyde and melamine-urea-formaldehyde wasevaluated by automated bonding evaluation system.

Nevertheless for 20 % <b>liquefied</b> wood the reduction of internal bond strength is relatively small and still within the minimum standards required.

The beam model {{based on the}} theory of beam on elastic foundation {{is used for the}} pipeline buried in non-liquefied and <b>liquefied</b> soil. The soil property is nonlinear, the floating force induced by the soil liquefaction is related to the position of pipeline, is nonlinear also. For the convenience and simplification of analysis, the nonlinear increment element method was used and lots of numerical analysis was conducted, including: the floatation response of pipeline buried in homogeneous soil, the floatation response of pipeline buried in non-homogeneous soil, and the floatation response of pipeline buried in discontinuous <b>liquefied</b> area. The influential factors on the floatation response of buried pipeline buried in <b>liquefied</b> soil including spring stiff of <b>liquefied</b> soil, the initial deformation, the length of <b>liquefied</b> area, the axial force acting on the pipeline, the material of pipeline, and the diameter of pipeline. The calculation results of discontinuous <b>liquefied</b> area draw a significant conclusion that for a long <b>liquefied</b> area, to make the soil non-liquefied in the middle of <b>liquefied</b> area may decrease the length of <b>liquefied</b> area and reduce the flotation displacement of pipeline greatly...|$|R

40|$|<b>Liquefied</b> wood is a {{potential}} alternative to the synthetic adhesives which are used for the bonding of wood. Despite the ability of <b>liquefied</b> wood to self-crosslink, bonds formed during the bonding of wood with <b>liquefied</b> wood do not achieve sufficient shear strength and have poor resistance to water. For this reason {{the process of the}} curing of <b>liquefied</b> wood, the influence of various parameters on the shear strength of bonds, and the structure of bonds formed during the bonding were analyzed. It was found that the chemical curing of <b>liquefied</b> wood started after water and solvent had been removed from it. When bonding wood, the curing of <b>liquefied</b> wood takes place faster because, in addition to evaporation, the transition of both vaporous components from the <b>liquefied</b> wood to the lamellas also occurs.

In fig. 8, the pressures and temperatures refer to the case of a nitrogen <b>liquefier.</b> At the inlet of the compressor the gas is at room temperature (300 K) and a pressure of 1 bar (point a).

Next it enters the warm (high-pressure) side of the counterflow heat exchanger where it is precooled. It leaves the exchanger at point c. After the JT expansion, point d, it has a temperature of 77.36 K and a pressure of 1 bar. The liquid fraction is x.
