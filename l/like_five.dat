25|$|When the Qing dynasty {{collapsed}} with {{establishment of}} the new Republic of China (ROC) in 1911, majority of the Inner Mongolian principalities allied themselves with the Outer Mongols rather than with the Mongolian Bogd Khaganate. China's early republican leaders used slogans <b>like</b> <b>Five</b> Races Under One Union, democracy, and meritocracy {{to try to persuade}} all of the Mongols to join the new republic. However, they were never really able to hide their condescension towards the frontier peoples. In the summer of 1911, Mongolia's princes had already decided to declare independence and turn towards Russia for support. They gathered with Russian representatives in Ulan Bator and persuaded Russia to defend Mongol autonomy within China. The Russians understood this autonomy to apply only in Outer Mongolia, but the princes interpreted it as sanctifying a Greater Mongolia of Outer Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Eastern Mongolia, and Tannu Uriankhai (Tuva).|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Shoppes of Avondale" [...] is {{an upscale}} {{shopping}} center comprising about 46 storefronts on St. Johns Avenue. <b>Like</b> <b>Five</b> Points, it {{dates to the}} 1920s, when Avondale was first developed. Its small-scale buildings were designed to blend with the residential neighborhood; the most notable is a 1927 edifice designed by Henry J. Klutho in partnership with Fred S. Cates and Albert N. Cole at 3556-3560 St. Johns Avenue. The center was renovated in 2010 under Jacksonville's Town Center Program, which allocated funds for revitalizing neighborhood commercial districts.|$|E
500|$|The album's sleeve was {{designed}} by pop artist Richard Hamilton, in collaboration with McCartney. Hamilton's design was {{in stark contrast to}} Peter Blake's vivid cover art for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and consisted of a plain white sleeve. The band's name was blind embossed slightly below the middle of the album's right side, and the cover also featured a unique stamped serial number, [...] "to create", in Hamilton's words, [...] "the ironic situation of a numbered edition of something <b>like</b> <b>five</b> million copies". In 2008, an original pressing of the album with serial number 0000005 sold for £19,201 on eBay. In 2015, Ringo Starr's personal copy number 0000001 sold for world record $790,000 on auction.|$|E

[...] Janssen, who could not [...] "say enough things about Tommy [...] ", said she was especially impressed at how he stuck to his specific vision and [...] "fought" [...] hard to hire a number of unknown European actors {{that would otherwise be}} unlikely to appear in a big studio American film, in effect making it a much more international production.|$|E

500|$|... "Heavy Competition" [...] {{was written}} by Ryan Koh and {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham. It was the fifth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba {{said he did not}} watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." [...] Rainn Wilson said he liked the episode because it demonstrated growth for his character and the relationship between Michael and Dwight; he said [...] "I like the way they let characters grow and change on the show," [...] and said of his character, [...] "It's not the same acolyte ass kissing as season 2". Wilson said the moment Dwight spun around the HarperCollins secretary saying [...] "Spin move", which was included in the script, {{was one of the most}} popular moments of the episode among the writers. Wilson said of filming the move, [...] "We did <b>like</b> <b>five</b> spin moves and once I did a somersault. I thought I was being all nimble and quick, but no. I watch it and it looks like a manatee doing ballet at SeaWorld." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{describing}} the film's accuracy, Burton explained, [...] "it's {{not like a}} completely hardcore realistic biopic. In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some {{of the film is}} trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it." [...] Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating {{he did not want to}} ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes. He said in an interview, [...] "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy– saying in, <b>like,</b> <b>five</b> sentences what it would take most normal people one [...] Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode Jack (Sean Hayes) learns he will have an audition to be a backup dancer for singer Janet Jackson. The audition was set up by singer Jennifer Lopez, whom Jack worked for in the same position after Lopez let him go. At the audition, Jackson decides that she would <b>like</b> <b>five</b> dancers instead of the six originally planned. Jack, [...] "the newbie," [...] and Artemus (Will Arnett), [...] "the guy who's been here the longest," [...] compete in a dance-off to determine the fifth dancer. Before the dance-off, Karen (Megan Mullally)—Jack's friend—visits to support her friend. She sees Artemus and reveals to Jack the two are former lovers. The two get back together which outrages Jack. Karen reassures Jack that their reconciliation will not affect him in any way, only for her to tell Jack to lose the dance-off. Jack tells Karen he will not throw the competition. During the dance-off, Karen pleads with Jack to lose which Jack ultimately does. Believing he won, Artemus tells Karen he used her to win. After deciding that she only needs four dancers, Jackson fires both Jack and Artemus. At the end, Karen apologizes to Jack for getting him fired.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} for Drowned in Sound, Alexander Tudor {{observed}} the album's [...] "abrasiveness, brute force, and determination {{to push the}} instrument to its limits," [...] describing a [...] "relentless pummelling of metal in motion; often aggressive or chaotic, but using scales to evoke a sense of discipline" [...] while noting that Stetson was [...] "equally at home with classical minimalism." [...] Exclaim! reviewer Vincent Pollard noted how Vol. 3 [...] "organically and coherently blends Stetson's avant-garde playing and dark, complex themes with accessible and compelling compositions," [...] while MusicOMH commented that Stetson was [...] "finding guttural, fuzzy, violent sounds from his saxophone... but also finding a disarming warmth where necessary." [...] In his review for No Ripcord, Stephen Wragg stated that [...] "there’s such a polyphonic richness to these recordings that it sounds, at times, <b>like</b> <b>five</b> people are present" [...] and noted that the techniques employed in the recording of the album [...] "creates this heady, vertiginous rush– adrenaline-inducing in its deftness; and that’s an effect that strikes me as incredibly difficult to recreate in music." [...] Spins Richard Gehr suggested that the music was [...] "densely multiphonic, often claustrophobic, and reeks of fear and flight" [...] but that it [...] "offers at least a slight sense of salvation," [...] {{and concluded that the}} final album in the trilogy was [...] "music of the moment, a work of granular epiphanies that accrete, finally, into a magnificent whole." ...|$|E
500|$|The tenth track, [...] "White Christmas", was {{the first}} song to be {{recorded}} for Wrapped in Red. A cover of Rodgers and Hammerstein's [...] "My Favorite Things" [...] follows up as the eleventh track. Clarkson opted for the Broadway performance of the song to stray away from Julie Andrews' version, citing: [...] "I think you shouldn't go near anywhere of what she's doing because she's so good." [...] Clarkson and Kurstin co-wrote [...] "4 Carats" [...] with Cathy Dennis and Livvi Franc. Originally written as a pop song, they converted it into a Christmas song to fit the album's theme, describing it as a crossover between Eartha Kitt's [...] "Santa Baby" [...] (1953) and Madonna's [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1984). A rendition of Imogen Heap's [...] "Just for Now" [...] was described by Clarkson as her highly dysfunctional environment, saying: [...] "Can we just stop for <b>like</b> <b>five</b> minutes and have like a normal Christmas setting?" [...] The song begins by sampling the melody of the Christmas tune [...] "Carol of the Bells". The closing track, a rendition of the traditional carol [...] "Silent Night", features McEntire and Trisha Yearwood and ends in an a cappella setting between the trio. In addition, two tracks were {{also included in the}} deluxe edition of the album: the first, Clarkson's cover of [...] "I'll Be Home for Christmas" [...] from her iTunes Session extended play, and the second, her rendition of the first stanza of the ecclesiastical hymn [...] "Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel".|$|E
500|$|The main {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Closing Time {{took place at}} Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California—where Buffalo Springfield, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and The Doors had previously recorded—during spring 1972. Yester fronted production and the sessions were held almost immediately after Waits' record deal, and were described [...] "quick and efficient." [...] Waits was [...] "nervous, but confident enough in his own material" [...] during {{the beginning of the}} sessions; however, as the sessions progressed, Waits and Yester [...] "were pulling against each other" [...] over the direction which the album would take, with Waits wanting a jazz-laden record and Yester more focused on producing a folk-based album. Despite this, Waits was [...] "absolutely communicative" [...] with his fellow musicians, articulating his direction and using metaphors to describe how he wanted the songs to sound. The sessions took a total of ten days, with the first two days focusing on [...] "getting used to [...]" [...] Both Waits and Yester wanted to record during the evening, but as no slots were available, it was recorded through the morning and afternoon [...] "from ten to five every day." [...] During the recording of [...] "Ol' '55", Seiter contributed backing vocals and [...] "came up with a perfect harmony line that started faintly before the chorus even began." [...] The sessions concluded with a total of nine songs completed. Though unsatisfied with the amount of songs, a second recording session was arranged the following week in United Western Recorders. The final session for Closing Time began the following Sunday, with guest musicians Arni Egilsson replacing Plummer and Jesse Erlich performing cello. The title track, [...] "Closing Time", was the only song recorded in full, and Yester later described the session as [...] "the most magical session I've ever been involved with. At the end of it, no one spoke for what felt <b>like</b> <b>five</b> minutes, either in the booth or out in the room. No one budged. Nobody wanted the moment to end." [...] String overdubs were later cut for [...] "Martha" [...] and [...] "Grapefruit Moon" [...] the following day. The final recordings were mixed and mastered at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco.|$|E
