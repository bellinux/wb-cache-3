5|$|Although {{the army}} was summoned to {{assemble}} at York on 24 June, it did not approach Scotland until mid-August. This {{was due to the}} gradual arrival of army supplies (in some cases, with much delay — the King's own tents, for example, were not despatched from Westminster until halfway through July). Brown suggests that Henry was well aware of the delays these preparations would cause the campaign. At some point before the army left for Scotland, the muster was met by the Constable of England, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and the Earl Marshal, Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland. Individual leaders of each retinue present were then paid a lump sum to later distribute in wages to their troops: Men-at-arms reived one shilling a day, archers half that, but captains and <b>leaders</b> <b>do</b> not apear to have been paid at a higher rate. The army left York on 25 July and reached Newcastle-upon-Tyne four days later; it was plagued by shortages of supplies, particularly food, of which more had had to be requested before even leaving York. As the campaign progressed, bad weather exacerbated the problem of food shortages, and Brown has speculated that this was an important consideration in the short duration of the expedition.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, {{one needs to}} understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative <b>leaders</b> <b>do.</b> For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on {{the tips of the}} decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called recoil leaders, usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a dart leader travels across all, or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground is what causes a majority of subsequent return strokes.|$|E

2500|$|According to Dmitri Trenin (2004), Head of the Moscow Carnegie Center, {{the then}} Russia {{was one of}} the least ideological {{countries}} around the world: [...] "Ideas hardly matter, whereas interests reign supreme. It is not surprising then that the worldview of Russian elites is focused on financial interests. Their practical deeds in fact declare In capital we trust." [...] Trenin described Russia's elite involved in the process of policy-making as people who largely owned the country. Most of them were not public politicians, but the majority were bureaucratic capitalists. According to Trenin, [...] "having survived in a ruthless domestic business and political environment, Russian leaders are well adjusted to rough competition and will take that mindset to the world stage." [...] However, Trenin called Russian-Western relations, from Moscow's perspective, [...] "competitive, but not antagonistic". He said, [...] "Russia does not crave world domination, and its <b>leaders</b> <b>do</b> not dream of restoring the Soviet Union.

2500|$|Harvard University {{international}} relations professor Stephen Walt wrote an [...] to his congressman outlining reasons he {{urged him to}} vote against intervention in Syria. [...] Walt's first argument against intervention was that the United States lacks any vital strategic interests in Syria. [...] After acknowledging that Assad government is a [...] "brutal dictatorship," [...] {{he points out that}} this has not bothered previous presidents in the past. [...] Indeed, intervening in Syria could make matters worse and harm US interests by creating a failed state and [...] "igniting a struggle for power among competing sectarian factions," [...] some of which [...] "are deeply hostile to America and sympathetic to al Qaeda... U.S. intervention could help bring some of our worst enemies to power." [...] Walt's second reason is that moral case for intervening in Syria fails to be compelling. [...] Although Syrians are suffering, air strikes would not alter that, but could make things worse. [...] Walt argues that [...] "recent scholarly research on civil wars shows that outside intervention tends to increase civilian killings and doesn't shorten the length of wars." [...] He suggests focusing on helping refugees instead. [...] Third, Walt rebuts the argument {{that it is necessary to}} go to war over Assad's use of chemical weapons, particularly when other regimes that used chemical weapons in the past were not then punished by the United States. [...] Walt argues that [...] "chemical weapons have only been used a handful of times over the past 80 years, mostly because they are less effective than conventional arms in most battlefield situations." [...] Fourth, Walt argues that intervention is not necessary to maintain US credibility because [...] "if we refrain from using force when vital interests are not involved or when doing so would only make things worse, it says nothing about our willingness to use force when it is truly necessary and when it can achieve clear and well-defined objectives." [...] Finally, Walt argues that [...] "wise <b>leaders</b> <b>do</b> not go to war without robust international and domestic support," [...] which President Obama does not have.|$|E

60|$|The Republican <b>leaders</b> <b>do</b> {{not talk}} to the public of these almost certain results of success in the present conflict.

The preservation of the Union is an object about which the North are agreed; and it has many adherents, as they believe, in the South generally. That nearly half {{the population of the}} Border Slave States are in favor of it is a patent fact, since they are now fighting in its defence. It is not probable that {{they would be willing to}} fight directly against slavery. The Republicans well know that if they can reëstablish the Union, they gain everything for which they originally contended; and it would be a plain breach of faith with the Southern friends of the Government, if, after rallying them round its standard for a purpose of which they approve, it were suddenly to alter its terms of communion without their consent.|$|E
