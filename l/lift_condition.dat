5000|$|An {{example of}} an {{optimization}} proof of concept was done in 2003 by Leoviriyakit using the Boeing 747-200. [...] Using the variable list above, he optimized for only a single point - a lift coefficient of 0.42 and a speed of Mach 0.87, just above cruising. With just those few variables, {{he was able to}} realize a 12% decrease in drag and a 0.1% decrease in wing weight. The code that was run produced a longer span but less sweep-back than the original wing planform. While the reduction in sweep-back actually increases drag it also increases lift allowing a lower AoA and the extended wing span decreases the induced drag (wing tip vortex) resulting in a net reduction of drag. Unfortunately, his optimized design uses too simple of a model; he realized that had more variables, such as viscous effects, been taken into consideration, the resulting model would have been far different. The other major limitation of the single point approach is that it only optimizes the wing for one speed and <b>lift</b> <b>condition.</b> While the drag may have been reduced at cruising speed, it might have been drastically increased for take-off and landing, resulting in a net fuel loss for the airline.|$|E

The test was carried out in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel. Fluids tested include a Newtonian deicing fluid, three non-Newtonian anti-icing fluids commercially available during or before 1988, and eight new experimental non-Newtonian fluids developed by four fluid manufacturers. The results show that fluids remain on the wind after liftoff and cause a measurable lift loss and drag increase. These effects are dependent on the high-lift configuration and on the temperature. For a configuration with a high-lift leading-edge device, the fluid effect is largest at the maximum <b>lift</b> <b>condition.</b> The fluid aerodynamic effects are related to the magnitude of the fluid surface roughness, particularly in the first 30 percent chord.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} aerodynamic and flow-field characteristics of three 50 -percent partial-span jet-augmented flap configurations located at three spanwise positions has been conducted in the Langley 300 MPH 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel. The model was a semispan, rectangular unswept wing with a full-span aspect ratio of 8. 3 and a thickness-to-chord ratio of 0. 167. The results of this investigation showed that an inboard partial-span jet-augmented flap is less effective than a full-span blowing flap. A further reduction in effectiveness is obtained as the blaring is shifted outboard along the span. At a given lift coefficient and angle of attack, the nose-down moment about the quarter chord increases as the blowing is moved outboard. This increase in nose-down moment is due primarily {{to the fact that}} the momentum coefficient must be increased in order to obtain the same <b>lift</b> <b>condition.</b> Flow surveys indicate that the tail contribution to static longitudinal stability would be greater for the outboard blowing locations...|$|E

There are many accidents of aircraft caused by aerodynamic efficiency degradation due to heavy rain. In this paper we have studied the heavy rain effects on the aerodynamic efficiency of cambered NACA 64210 and symmetric NACA 0012 airfoils with cruise and landing configuration. For our analysis, CFD method and preprocessing grid generator are used as our main analytical tools, and the simulation of rain is accomplished via two phase flow approach named as Discrete Phase Model (DPM).

Methods: Barefoot quasi-static stance pressure measurements were taken during double limb stance (n= 22). Four forefoot lift (i. e. metatarsal head (MTH) and corresponding phalanges) conditions at three heights (4, 8, 12 mm) elevated the forefoot. A barefoot condition with no forefoot lift served as the control. Maximum mean pressure was measured for each test condition. All findings are compared to the no forefoot <b>lift</b> <b>condition.</b> Findings: The 1 st MTH forefoot lift increased pressure at the 1 st MTH while the 3 rd- 5 th MTH forefoot lift decreased pressure at the 1 st MTH. The 1 st- 2 nd MTH forefoot lift resulted in no change in pressure at the 1 st MTH, but the 2 nd MTH forefoot lift increased pressure at the 2 nd MTH. The 1 st MTH forefoot lift decreased pressure at 3 rd- 5 th MTHs and the 3 rd- 5 th MTH forefoot lift increased pressure at the 3 rd- 5 th MTHs. Interpretation: Orthotic forefoot lifts can be used to redistribute plantar pressures in the foot during double limb stance. The results of this study will be helpful in predicting lift height and position necessary to offload particular areas. Clinical Relevance: This research provides evidence-based practices in orthotic forefoot lifts. Clinicians can use the included table to predict plantar pressure reductions to certain areas of the foot. By using the table a percent decrease in pressure can be calculated based on a 25 subject population. Géza F. Kogle...|$|E

These sloped ground surfaces may {{have an impact on}} the lifting strategy/technique employed by the lifter, which may, in turn, alter the biomechanical loading of the spine. Describing the changes in kinematics and kinetics of the torso is the first step in assessing the impact of these changes and is the focus of the current research. Subjects' wholebody motions were recorded as they lifted a 10 kg box while standing on two inclined surfaces (facing an upward slope: 10 ° and 20 °), two declined surfaces (facing a downward slope: - 10 ° and - 20 °), and a flat surface (0 °) using three lifting techniques (leg lift, back lift and freestyle lift). These data were then used in a two-dimensional, five-segment dynamic biomechanical model (top-down) to evaluate the effect of these slopes on the net moment about the L 5 /S 1 joint. The results of this study showed an interesting interaction effect wherein the net L 5 /S 1 moment was relatively insensitive to changes in slope angle under the back <b>lift</b> <b>condition,</b> but showed a significant effect during the leg lift and freestyle lifting conditions. The results show that under the freestyle lifting condition the peak L 5 /S 1 moment was significantly higher for the inclined surfaces as compared to the flat surfaces (6. 8 % greater) or declined surfaces (10. 0 % greater). Subsequent component analysis revealed that both trunk flexion angle and angular trunk acceleration were driving this response. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that ground slope angle does influence the lifting kinematics and kinetics and therefore needs to be considered when evaluating risk of low back injury in these working conditions. close 172...|$|E

The present study aimed to clarify this by examining whether the recruitment of individual hip and knee muscles during the squat exercise differs between <b>lifting</b> <b>conditions</b> adopted for muscular endurance and power training regimens. Moderately trained men performed back squats (BS), with a load of approximately 60 % of one repetition maximum, as a muscular endurance training exercise, and they performed plyometric squat jumping (PSJ) for power training. During each exercise, the lower limb joint torques and the recruitment of five hip and knee muscles were determined with inverse-dynamics and T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. While the maximal and mean knee joint torques were greater during PSJ than during BS (p, 0. 01), the T 2 values for the quadriceps femoris muscle did not differ between the exercises. In contrast, the T 2 values of the gluteus maximus and hip adductor muscles were higher during PSJ (p, 0. 05) than during BS, {{although there was no}} significant difference in the mean hip extension torque between the two exercises.

The rain simulation system manifold, which was located 10 chord lengths upstream of the model, produced liquid water contents ranging from 16 to 46 g/m 3. Aerodynamic measurements {{in and out of}} the simulated rain environment were obtained for dynamic pressures of 30 and 50 psf and an angle-of-attack range of 0 to 20 for the cruise con guration and 4 to 20 for the landing con guration (leading-edge slat and trailing-edge double-slotted ap). Both con gurations experienced signi cant losses in maximum lift capability, increases in drag for a given <b>lift</b> <b>condition,</b> and a progressive decrease in the lift curve slope at both dynamic pressures as the liquid water content increased. The results obtained on the landing con guration also indicated a progressive decrease in the angle of attack at which maximum lift occurred and an increase in the slope of the pitchingmoment curve as the liquid water content increased. Accompanying the reduction in the stall angle of attack was the general attening of the lift curve past stall as the liquid water content was increased. The NACA 64 - 210 data indicated that the severity of the rain e ect appears to be con guration-dependent and is most severe for high-lift con guration airfoils with leading- and trailing-edge devices con gured for landing or take-o operations.
