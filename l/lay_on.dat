40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{procedural}} techniques, significance and the tangible {{effects of the}} <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands in the New Testament. The introductory chapter reviews critically previous contributions {{to the subject of}} the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands in the New Testament and establishes the purpose and delimitations of this study and the methodology used. The next two chapters are devoted to a study of the background of the New Testament practice of the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands. The investigation is conducted in the Old Testament and contemporary Judaism (Chapter Two) and in the Graeco-Roman and Near-Eastern literature (Chapter Three). Chapters Four through Seven are exegetical, each discussing a particular use of the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands in the New Testament. Chapter Four examines the function of the gesture in healing. Special attention is given to the inner process of transfer of power through physical contact. A comparative study of Jesus' method of healing with similar practices of his contemporaries challenges the idea that the origin of the healing touch is Hellenistic. The custom of blessing with the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands, as practised by Jesus, is examined in Chapter Five in terms of origin, significance and the form of the gesture. The next chapter is devoted {{to the use of the}} <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands for the reception of the Holy Spirit. In addition to the exegetical analysis of the relevant pericopes, an attempt is made to explain the circumstances which led to the birth of this distinctive Christian practice. Chapter Seven examines the use of the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands in ordination and commissioning. It discusses the significance of the gesture, argues for the Jewish origin of the Christian rite and opposes the view that in the post-Pauline period charismata are tied to an office and thus institutionalised. In the final section of the thesis, an attempt is made to gauge the possibility of any uniformity in the significance of the various New Testament uses of the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands...|$|R

5|$|Four stone {{courses of}} the eastern spring of the arch, {{consisting}} of a row of impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs, have survived to modern times. This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name. At that time, prior to any excavations, remains of the arch were at ground level. The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries. Robinson believed he had identified {{the eastern edge of}} a bridge that linked the Temple Compound with the Upper City which <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ridge to the west.|$|E

5|$|Goodrich Castle {{appears to}} have been in {{existence}} by 1101, when it was known as Godric‚Äôs Castle, named probably after Godric of Mappestone, a local Anglo-Saxon thane and landowner mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Victorian historians, however, believed the castle to date back further to the pre-Norman conquest days of King Canute, and the site may have been among a small number of Saxon fortifications along the Welsh border. By Norman times, Goodrich formed part of the Welsh Marches, a sequence of territories granted to Norman nobles in, and alongside, Wales. Although Goodrich <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the safer, English side of the border, the threat of raids and attacks continued throughout most of the period.|$|E

2500|$|That {{specific}} ordinations {{to preach}} or perform ordinances are made through the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands was a concept formulated early in Joseph Smith's ministry. He stated the principle {{as one of}} the church's articles of faith, that a calling to preach or perform rituals in the name of Christ was to be made through [...] "prophecy and the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands by those who are in authority" [...] (see Fifth Article of Faith in The Wentworth Letter). A Book of Mormon example of ordination by the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands is found in the Book of Alma, where Alma [...] "ordained priests and elders, by <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch over the church". Modern day priesthood holders ordained to the office of priest (or higher) are able to ordain other worthy members to priesthood offices up to their office.|$|R

The challenging question is whether the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands in these texts is to be understood {{as a part of a}} normal rite of initiation in an early Christian setting, or whether it has a special function not related to baptism. In the first section the Old Testament and Jewish background to <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands in the New Testament is investigated. The second section gives an introduction to modern Luke-Acts research, especially related to the theme of Salvation History, and a discussion of recent literature <b>on</b> the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands. Some of the major theological themes of Luke-Acts, which are considered to be important for the understanding of {{the function of the}} <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands, are also explored. These are: the role of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of the term ‚Äòpeople of God‚Äô, the nature of the early Christian mission, and the importance of prayer. A detailed examination of the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands texts is carried out in the third main section. Our conclusion is that the <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> of hands in these texts has a twofold function. It is an act of acceptance and solidarity which often follows the inclusion of groups of ‚Äòoutsiders‚Äô into the new people of God. But it is also a fixed component in an early rite of baptism and initiation. The emphasis on the manifestations of the Spirit in relation to this act, does not, however, seem to represent ordinary events, but has to do with the special perspective of Salvation History where new groups of people are demonstrated to belong to the messianic people of God...|$|R
