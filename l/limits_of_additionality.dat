Our analysis first provides an overview of conceptual aspects of CDM as a tool for climate policies in developing countries. It then places special emphasis on the Asian region as the world's major host of CDM projects, in spite of wide disparities in national levels of development and energy consumption.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{explores the}} Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) which creates carbon credits from {{emission}} abatement projects in developing economies. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to examine the operation of the CDM with specific reference to fraud vulnerabilities regarding the <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> a project. An examination of the process of establishment, certification and verification <b>of</b> <b>additionality</b> (confirmation that emissions post-implementation of the CDM project are lower than those that would have occurred under the most plausible alternative scenario) is used to highlight the need for particular vigilance in respect to sustaining and improving the integrity of future market-based mechanisms post-Kyoto. Design/methodology/approach: The study takes a case study approach, examining the CDM project cycle and associated key entities. Findings: The study posits that the processes associated with establishing and verifying <b>additionality</b> <b>of</b> a project are potentially key areas of systemic weakness that must be addressed. This case study explores the design features of the CDM that may afford greater opportunities for fraudulent or deceptive practices. Originality/value: The CDM takes a project-by-project approach to establishment, verification and certification <b>of</b> <b>additionality.</b> Whilst conceptually this design may be appropriate from an operational perspective, it potentially provides opportunities for fraudulent outcomes. The individualised approach is, by its very nature, highly resource-intensive and inherently difficult to verify.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the question <b>of</b> <b>additionality,</b> which is {{dealt with in}} Article 12. 5 of the Kyoto Protocol {{in the context of}} defining the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The Protocol requires that emission reductions certified under the CDM be "additional " to what would have occurred in the absence of project activities. This paper treats two main components of the subject: financial and environmental additionality. No specific recommendations are made below, but rather implications of various ways <b>of</b> applying <b>additionality</b> [...] some <b>of</b> them quite controversial are explored. The first section explains the importance <b>of</b> <b>additionality</b> and establishes conceptual definitions for financial and environmental additionality. The second section treats the range of definitions and interpretations <b>of</b> financial <b>additionality,</b> and the third explains baseline construction methodologies that have been put forth to measure environmental additionality. These methodologies can be divided into two categories: "top-down " baselines derived from aggregate national or sectoral emissions data or "bottom-up " baselines derived from specific projects. I. What is Additionality and Why is it Important? The Kyoto Protocol created a suite of "flexibility mechanisms. " In addition to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an instrument for co-operation between developed (Annex I) countries and developing (non-Annex I) countries, the flexibility mechanisms include international emissions trading (Article 17); Joint Implementation between Annex I countries (JI, Article 6); and bubbles (Article 4). More than the other mechanisms, the CDM has the potential to reward projects that do not limit emissions, or that would have occurred anyway. To guard against Reports and Publication...|$|R

5000|$|Emerson {{proposed}} the term “Blended Value” {{within the context}} of impact investing to describe the various categories of returns an investor should be looking for. Emerson posits the idea that measuring investments purely in terms of financial returns is a disingenuous assessment of reality because there are social and environmental implications to any business activity. There is a slight distinction between a business model that generates blended value, and an investment creating blended value. The difference can be explained through the concept <b>of</b> <b>additionality.</b> Additionality is the added value that {{can be attributed to the}} investment (i.e. if an investment has high level <b>of</b> <b>additionality,</b> then a large part of the organizations impact can be isolated and attributed to that specific injection of capital). This isolation is meant to convey how exactly the capital from the investment creates varying levels of value. Organizations gather data in order to report their performance to their investors. When investors seek blended value, they look for social, environmental, and financial returns. Although there is no single standardized measurement system to define these returns for investors, efforts are being taken by organizations such as GIIN and GIIRS to create a set of measurement tools and metrics that make holistic assessment of investments more feasible.
