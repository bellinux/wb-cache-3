60|$|Looking eastward or westward {{on the map}} of India, we {{perceive}} that the phenomenon of perpetual snow is regulated by the same laws. From the longitude of Upper Assam in 95 degrees E to that of Kashmir in 75 degrees E, the <b>lowest</b> <b>limit</b> of perpetual snow is 15,500 to 16,000 feet, and a shrubby vegetation affects the most humid localities near it, at 12,000 to 14,000 feet. Receding from the plains of India and penetrating the mountains, the climate becomes drier, the snowline rises, and vegetation diminishes, whether the elevation of the land increases or decreases; plants reaching 17,000 and 18,000 feet, and the snow-line, 20,000 feet. To mention extreme cases; the snow-level of Sikkim in 27 degrees 30 minutes is at 16,000 feet, whereas in latitude 35 degrees 30 minutes Dr. Thomson found the snow line 20,000 feet on the mountains near the Karakoram Pass, and vegetation up to 18,500 feet--features I found to be common also to Sikkim in latitude 28 degrees.|$|E

60|$|But I am {{far from}} {{depending}} on this {{authority for the}} age of the Mesopotamian plain. On the contrary, I venture to rely, with much more confidence, on another kind of evidence, which tends to show that {{the age of the}} great rivers must be carried back to a date earlier than that at which our ingenuous youth is instructed that the earth came into existence. For, the alluvial deposit having been brought down by the rivers, they must needs be older than the plain it forms, as navvies must needs antecede the embankment painfully built up by the contents of their wheel-barrows. For thousands of years, heat and cold, rain, snow, and frost, the scrubbing of glaciers, and the scouring of torrents laden with sand and gravel, have been wearing down the rocks of the upper basins of the rivers, over an area of many thousand square miles; and these materials, ground to fine powder {{in the course of their}} long journey, have slowly subsided, as the water which carried them spread out and lost its velocity in the sea. It is because this process is still going on that the shore of the delta constantly encroaches on the head of the gulf [5] into which the two rivers are constantly throwing the waste of Armenia and of Kurdistan. Hence, as might be expected, fluviatile and marine shells are common in the alluvial deposit; and Loftus found strata, containing subfossil marine shells of species now living, in the Persian Gulf, at Warka, two hundred miles in a straight line from the shore of the delta. [6] It follows that, if a trustworthy estimate of the average rate of growth of the alluvial can be formed, the <b>lowest</b> <b>limit</b> (by no means the highest limit) of age of the rivers can be determined. All such estimates are beset with sources of error of very various kinds; and the best of them can only be regarded as approximations to the truth. But I think it will be quite safe to assume a maximum rate of growth of four miles in a century for the lower half of the alluvial plain.|$|E

5000|$|An aquastat is {{a device}} used in {{hydronic}} heating systems for controlling water temperature. To prevent the boiler from firing too often, aquastats {{have a high}} limit temperature and a <b>low</b> <b>limit.</b> If the thermostat is calling for heat, the boiler will fire until the high limit is reached, then shut off (even if the thermostat is still calling for heat). The boiler will re-fire if the boiler water temperature drops below a range around the high limit. The high limit exists {{for the sake of}} efficiency and safety. The boiler will also fire (regardless of thermostat state) when the boiler water temperature goes below a range around the <b>low</b> <b>limit,</b> ensuring that the boiler water temperature remains above a certain point. The <b>low</b> <b>limit</b> is intended for tankless domestic hot water---it ensures that boiler water is always warm enough to heat the domestic hot water.

30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the SuperDARN radar needs ionospheric irregularities to receive echoes, which {{are considered to be}} generated mainly by gradient-drift instability (e.g., Keskinen and Ossakow 1983), growing in intensity if the electric field and plasma density are strong enough and properly oriented. In fact, there is a weak relationship between the SuperDARN echo power and Doppler velocity (Fukumoto et al. 1999; Fukumoto et al. 2000). We therefore examined whether the <b>low</b> speed <b>limit</b> of SAPS is also the <b>low</b> speed <b>limit</b> of SuperDARN observations by checking the echo power around the above limit. The result is that the echo power is mostly 3 to 25  dB, well above the noise level (0  dB) around the <b>lowest</b> speed <b>limit</b> of SAPS (250 to 300  m/s) (not shown in the figure).
