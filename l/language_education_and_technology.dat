40|$|Thanks to the {{advances}} in digital audio technology, it becomes {{much easier for}} language teachers to present any two given points of listening material repeatedly to their students without losing sound quality. However, the effectiveness of repeated material presentations {{has not yet been}} proven satisfactorily. An empirical study therefore was conducted to test the following two hypotheses; (1) repeated presentations of material are effective for EFL learners’ listening, and (2) the effectiveness of repeated presentations is influenced by i) the length of the sentence, ii) the grammatical complexity of the sentence, and iii) the proficiency level of the learner. The subjects were 148 Japanese college students learning EFL. The results indicated that repeated presentations are indeed effective, although the degree of effectiveness varies with learners’ proficiency as well as material length and difficulty. Along with full description of the findings, some pedagogical implications are also mentioned.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of {{technology}} for language education, fandom and online interest communities encompass a range of affinity groups in which individuals can develop skills and knowledge potentially supporting language learning or language mastery relevant to use in online and offline contexts. Initial work on online interest groups investigated individual and collaborative literacy practices and identity development among users of pre-Web 2. 0 technologies such as Usenet discussions and personal fan websites. More recent research on online interest groups, language learning and use looks to the creative work and gameplay of international and multilingual users whose communities have flourished {{as a result of}} Web 2. 0 technologies, including fanfiction archives, gaming forums, and wikis, and more general social media platforms. Altogether, studies of fandom and online interest groups within the area of <b>language,</b> <b>education,</b> <b>and</b> <b>technology</b> have revealed ways in which language learners and language users make use of these online communities for language learning, identity work, and the development of other skills and knowledge and which hold implications for the integration of technology and digital practices in language teaching...|$|E
40|$|With {{the boom}} of {{computers}} and the Internet, the growth of e learning too has increased along with it. The advantages of e-learning are many. The flexibility of time, pace, and location makes e-learning both attractive and popular. This new trend of learning is seen across the globe but with the exception in developing countries in South Asia and Latin America. According to the Economists Intelligent Unit e-Learning Readiness Rankings of 2003, countries like Sri Lanka and Pakistan are ranked 55 and 59 respectively, while most European countries are ranked among the lop. The ranking is done based on connectivity, capability, content, and culture. This paper focuses on the cultural dimensions, and attempts to identify which cultural factors cause the failure of e-learning in South Asia. The reasons are identified by the Cultural Framework developed by Terpstra & Sarathy. Among these reasons, the main reasons can be identified as <b>language,</b> <b>education,</b> <b>and</b> <b>technology</b> and material culture. Interviews were conducted with the problem owners {{to find out what}} cultural factor sexist as barriers to e-learning and what solutions have been proposed or implemented to address these.

A University Curriculum Innovations Grant supported the Project entitled ‘The paperless tiger: Moving the 1 st year B Ed core subject into the online world’. During the planning phase the professional action learning team (academics, Library and IT personnel) faced a series of challenges as we grappled {{with the idea of}} facilitating an exploration of the lived experiences of learners. Understanding how Webct, CD-ROM, synchronous and asynchronous communication forums could support face-to-face classes and tutorials was part of the professional learning and debate. During the journey, academics and preservice teachers collected artefacts; and these helped us to unpack our ideas and identify what was most valued in the subject. The preservice teachers used digital portfolio presentations to describe both their personal learning and their growing awareness about learning. Teachers and preservice teachers agreed that stepping outside their comfort zone and facing the challenges i. e. riding the paperless tiger was achievable because {{it became clear that the}} ‘learning is in the struggle&rsquo...|$|E

However, in terms of achievement levels, they have the lowest level of achievement. (x: 2. 19). The achievement level of the graduates of high schools with foreign language focus appear to be the highest (n: 377, x: 2. 69).
