25|$|The {{units that}} were {{considered}} to be the most reliable and loyal by Wang Jingwei included the three Guards divisions in Nanjing (about 10,000 men per division), the 1st Front Army (about 20,000 men), based throughout the Lower Yangtze, and the Taxation Police Corps (about 3,000 men), which had been raised personally by Zhou Fohai and were loyal to him. The Capital Guards Divisions were formed from an independent brigade created in May 1941 in Nanjing, which was considered a success and raised {{to the size of a}} division. Shortly afterwards another two divisions were created. These Guards units were given the best equipment, weapons, and uniforms, with a personal loyalty to Wang himself. The Taxation Police Corps was created in Shanghai by Finance Minister Zhou Fohai for his own protection and owed its loyalty to him, and he sought to raise its quality to that of a regular IJA division. It increased in size from 3,000 to around 20,000 men. They, like Wang's Capital Guard divisions, received some of the best supplies and were highly regarded as among the Nanjing regime's best units. They were later moved out of Shanghai and were used for fighting guerillas. Morale and reliability of the average Nanjing Army units was a matter of their <b>location.</b> <b>Intelligence</b> reports from 1944 indicate that those units who were stationed near Nanjing and took orders from Wang Jingwei's government were more effective and motivated than those who were further away and commanded by others.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in {{technologies such as}} Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) and advanced control systems have stimulated new interest in bus priority facilities using traffic signals. The use of AVL systems has generated opportunities for implementing flexible bus-specific priority strategies according to performance. The extent of the opportunities available depends {{very much on the}} architecture of a bus priority system, including the <b>location(s)</b> of <b>intelligence</b> determining the priority level and its implementation, and the method of priority request to the traffic signal. These aspects are important {{from the point of view}} of bus priority performance, communication requirements and the cost of the system. This paper draws together and compares the various architectures currently being used for AVL-based bus priority, providing an overall review to supplement other papers which are usually concerned with individual systems. The paper reviews current bus priority systems used across Europe under five different architecture categories. The present bus priority architecture in London is then analysed in more detail as a case study. The paper concludes with a discussion of issues for this application, given the continuing advances in locations and communication technologies, and issues for the future. 1...|$|R

40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} indicates that early-life exposure to particulate air pollutants pose threats to children's cognitive development, but studies about the neurotoxic effects associated with exposures during adolescence remain unclear. We examined whether exposure to ambient fine particles (PM 2. 5) at residential <b>locations</b> affects <b>intelligence</b> quotient (IQ) during pre-/early- adolescence (ages 9 - 11) and emerging adulthood (ages 18 - 20) in a demographically-diverse population (N = 1, 360) residing in Southern California. Increased ambient PM 2. 5 levels were associated with decreased IQ scores. This association was more evident for Performance IQ (PIQ), but less for Verbal IQ, assessed by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. For each inter-quartile (7. 73 μg/m 3) increase in one-year PM 2. 5 preceding each assessment, the average PIQ score decreased by 3. 08 points (95 % confidence interval = [- 6. 04, - 0. 12]) accounting for within-family/within-individual correlations, demographic characteristics, family socioeconomic status (SES), parents' cognitive abilities, neighborhood characteristics, and other spatial confounders. The adverse effect was 150 % greater in low SES families and 89 % stronger in males, compared to their counterparts.

An ANN (artificial neural network) based method was developed, trained and tested to model the spectral distributions between wavelengths ranging from 350 to 1050 nm. Only commonly available input data such as geographical information regarding location, specific date and time together with horizontal global irradiance and ambient temperature are required. Historical information from a 24 -month experimental campaign carried out in Jae n (Spain) provided the necessary data to train and test the ANN tool. A Kohonen self-organized map was used as innovative technique to classify the whole input dataset and build a small and representative training dataset. The shape of the spectral irradiance dis- tribution, the in-plane global irradiance (GT) and irradiation (HT) and the APE (average photon energy) values obtained through the ANN method were statistically compared to the experimental ones. In terms of shape distribution fitting, the mean relative deformation error stays below 4. 81 %.

The goals of the project are the development of guidelines for cost-effective selection of candidate reservoirs and wells, along with estimating recovery potential. The selected site for the demonstration project is the Central Vacuum Unit waterflood in Lea County, New Mexico. Work is nearing completion on the reservoir characterization components of the project. The near-term emphasis is to, (1) provide an accurate distribution of original oil-in-place on a waterflood pattern entity level, (2) evaluate past recovery efficiencies, (3) perform parametric simulations, and (4) forecast performance for a site specific field demonstration of the proposed technology. Macro zonation now exists throughout the study area and cross-sections are available. The Oil-Water Contact has been defined. Laboratory capillary pressure data was used to define the initial water saturations within the pay horizon.

Range safety is required {{in the first place}} because current launch vehicle navigation systems cannot meet a level of trust needed to determine if the mission is really under control and on course. Existing launch vehicle navigation is generally based on attitude and acceleration sensing instrumentation that are subject to drift, initialization errors and failures. Thus, a launch vehicle can easily be under the control of a seemingly operating navigation system, yet be steering the launch vehicle along an incorrect and dangerous flight path. Inertial-based navigation systems are good, but they cannot be trusted. The function of Range safety is to assure that untrustworthy navigation is backed up with a trusted system that has positive knowledge of the launch vehicle <b>location,</b> and the <b>intelligence</b> to decide when and where a launch vehicle must be destroyed. Combining inertial navigation, GPS derived position information and knowledge-based computer control has the potential to provide trusted and autonomous Range safety functions.

40|$|A company {{business}} {{environment in the}} market and characteristics of modern business determine global processes and internationalisation of all business activities. Complexity of facts, indicated also by recent researches, means the modernization of business policies in all business fields. Competition, changes in technology and their intensity characterize the existing business environment. Developments in this field impose profound changes that contribute to increased dynamics in all activities undertaken by an economic operator within its business environment. Being permanently developed information technology plays an important role to that effect, especially during the last decade. It opens new possibilities in business application, requiring at the same time considerable and radical changes in business plans taking into consideration the importance of information, its amount, the speed it flows at, as well as its interconnection and causes. Within modern business making, timely and precise information accompanied with the knowledge gained therefrom, becomes, together with the capital and workforce, a dominant business resource but also a platform for a company's survival. The problem that the management faces daily is that the company with large databases frequently misses sufficient usable information and the knowledge based on it, that is essential for adequate decision-making. In contrast to the traditional approach to the value chain model that treats the information as a supporting element, business intelligence {{is based on the assumption}} that the information is a resource that creates a new, added value. Some companies are not familiar with the structure of their logistics costs yet, so they do not efficiently manage the information. The result is that executives do not get precise information available in real time and in real <b>location.</b> Business <b>intelligence</b> is a process based on the usage of the information and the resulting facts learned from it, that can be applied for an efficient masurement, supervision, prediction and management of that chain. Successful application of such an approach contributes to considerable reduction of costs, increase in the performance of the whole supply chain, more efficient utilization of working capital, proper selection of suppliers, optimisation of input and output logistics, realization of active stock policy, and also contributes to the growth, development and improvement of the business as a whole.
