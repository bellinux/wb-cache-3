The H6 starts as a [...] <b>local</b> <b>distributor</b> <b>road</b> between the districts of Kingsmead and Whitney. After crossing Whitney Roundabout the road becomes [...] but remains as a single carriageway. After bridging Powis Lane in between Westcroft and Oxley Park the road becomes a dual carriageway at Shenley Roundabout. It then passes {{very close to the}} Grove Independent School and subsequently bridges both the A5 and the West Coast Main Line. The road then crosses the V6 Grafton Street and runs along the southern edge of Central Milton Keynes and Campbell Park before passing Willen Lake. After this it passes the original Milton Keynes village and then curves up to meet the A509, briefly becoming the A4146.|$|E

5000|$|The Meadows {{is an area}} of Nottingham, {{due south}} of the castle and city centre., it lies entirely within Bridge Ward. The Meadows was {{originally}} a large area of wetland/floodplain which extended from the River Leen to the River Trent. After enclosure, this area was drained and gradually developed for a variety of uses, incorporating terraced housing, public houses, factories, warehouses and public buildings such as libraries and swimming baths.To the north it is bounded by the low red sandstone hill of Nottingham City Centre, to the south west, south and east it is bounded by the meandering River Trent: to the north and west by the Beeston and Nottingham Canal. Furthermore, it is separated from the rest of Nottingham by the A60, London Road that runs along the canal bank from Trent Bridge and the A453 Queens Drive/ A6019 Queens Road ringroad. A <b>local</b> <b>distributor</b> <b>road</b> Meadows Way runs in parallel to these roads for the entire length: The embankment of the Great Northern Railway ran to the north.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 22 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 14 - 16 July 2003 "National issues affecting the movement of people and goods - strategic approaches", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: Provincial roads mostly provide strategic links between different regions and are characterised by a reasonable level of mobility and dispersed accesses. Facilities for non-motorised traffic are sparse and generally not provided for. These characteristics {{as well as the}} need to plan towards alternative modes of transport as a component of a congestion management strategy, led Gautrans to initiate an investigation for the development of provincial guidelines to cater for non-motorised transport. The urban sprawl characterising the majority of South Africa’s centres of economic activity, has resulted in some of these provincial roads changing their functionality and level in the overall road hierarchy. Urban areas filled in available land along former rural-type roads and thereby changed their functionality and road hierarchy. Many examples exist where provincial roads now operate as normal urban collector arterials or even as <b>local</b> <b>distributor</b> <b>roads.</b> This fundamental change brought about the need to incorporate planning and revised standards that cater for other modes of transport and in particular, non-motorised transport (cyclists and pedestrians). The guideline document currently under development by the Department of Transport (National Department of Transport, 2002. Pedestrian and Bicycle Facility Guidelines: Manual to Plan, Design and Maintain Safe Pedestrian Facilities) will serve as overall manual for the detail design and specification of non-motorised facilities. The focus of the provincial guideline document on cycles and pedestrians, however, will be on guidelines and measures to promote safe, reliable and efficient infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists moving along provincial roadways within the South African roads context, with particular focus on rural and regional roads incorporated into the urban environs as a result of urbanisation. The focus of the provincial document concerns current on-street realities and how to deal with these. The presence of cyclists and pedestrians is not preferred on higher order mobility roads,, and by developing this document Gautrans by no means intend to promote this. The presence of these modes, however, is a reality on many provincial roadways, and guidelines are presented to deal with these.

40|$|In this region, {{especially}} in Serbia, common {{belief is that}} <b>local</b> <b>distributors</b> of gas used by households don’t charge for gas properly. It is suspected {{that there are two}} sources for improper ways of gas charging. <b>Local</b> <b>distributors</b> charge for delivered gas only, according to flow rat but not according to gas quality. It is usual that <b>local</b> <b>distributors</b> deliver gas of different quality than one signed in contract. In this work will be considered only one of aspects inefficient charging for delivered gas by <b>local</b> gas <b>distributors,</b> which is connected to variable atmospheric pressure. There is doubt, that <b>local</b> <b>distributors</b> make mistakes during accounting for delivered gas to costumers in regard atmospheric pressure. At the beginning of every investigation, problem has to be located and recognized. Authors are going to collect as much as possible available data, to elaborate and analyze data by scientific methods and to represent conclusions. So, the aim of this work is to diagnose current state and to approve or disapprove above mentioned suspicions. In our region this theme is very interesting, both because of energy efficiency and air pollution control. In this way both consumer and distributor will know, how mush energy they have really spent...|$|R
