[...] He built a steam-driven workshop in his garden, salvaging parts from various mills, including <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> gear and a stationary engine from a mill in Oldham. [...] He gave a conservative estimate of four years to complete the work, but the restoration eventually took 27years. The engine was sold at auction in July 2010 for £240,000.|$|E
500|$|Mechanization was {{gradually}} introduced to make most {{aspects of the}} industry more efficient, particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north, and therefore easier to work by machine. The slate mill evolved between 1840 and 1860, powered by a single <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> running along the building and bringing together operations such as sawing, planing and dressing. In 1859, John Whitehead Greaves invented the Greaves sawing table to produce blocks for the splitter, then in 1856 introduced a rotary machine to dress the split slate. The splitting of the blocks to produce roofing slates proved resistant to mechanization, and continued {{to be done with}} a mallet and chisel. An extra source of income from the 1860s was the production of [...] "slab", thicker pieces of slate which were planed and used for many purposes, for example flooring, tombstones and billiard tables.|$|E

50|$|To {{overcome}} {{the distance and}} friction limitations of <b>line</b> <b>shafts,</b> wire rope systems were developed in the late 19th century. Wire rope operated at higher velocities than <b>line</b> <b>shafts</b> and were a practical means of transmitting mechanical power for a distance of a few miles or kilometers. They used widely spaced, large diameter wheels and had much lower friction loss than <b>line</b> <b>shafts,</b> and had one-tenth the initial cost.|$|R
5000|$|Factories were {{fitted with}} {{overhead}} <b>line</b> <b>shafts</b> providing rotary power. Short line-shaft systems were described by Agricola, connecting a waterwheel to numerous ore-processing machines. [...] While the machines described by Agricola used geared connections from the shafts to the machinery, by the 19th century, drivebelts {{would become the}} norm for linking individual machines to the <b>line</b> <b>shafts.</b> One mid 19th century factory had 1,948 feet of <b>line</b> <b>shafting</b> with 541 pulleys.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of <b>line</b> <b>shafts</b> date {{back into the}} 18th century, but truly {{came of age in}} the early 19th century with industrialization. <b>Line</b> <b>shafts</b> were widely used in manufacturing, woodworking shops, machine shops, saw mills and grist mills.|$|R
2500|$|Many power {{requirements}} {{were less than}} that of a horse. [...] Shop machines, such as woodworking lathes, were often powered with a one- or two-man crank. [...] Household sewing machines were powered with a foot treadle; however, factory sewing machines were steam-powered from a <b>line</b> <b>shaft.</b> [...] Dogs were sometimes used on machines such as a treadmill, which could be adapted to churn butter.|$|E
2500|$|Electrification is {{the process}} of {{powering}} by electricity and, in many contexts, the introduction of such power by changing over from an earlier power source. The broad meaning of the term, such as in the history of technology, economic history, and economic development, usually applies to a region or national economy. [...] Broadly speaking, electrification was the build-out of the electricity generation and electric power distribution systems that occurred in Britain, the United States, and other now-developed countries from the mid-1880s until around 1950 and is still in progress in rural areas in some developing countries. This included the transition in manufacturing from <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> and belt drive using steam engines and water power to electric motors.|$|E
2500|$|Lathes {{have four}} main {{components:}} the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and the tailstock. [...] The bed is a precise & very strong base {{which all of}} the other components rest upon for alignment. The headstock's spindle secures the workpiece with a chuck, whose jaws (usually three or four) are tightened around the piece. The spindle rotates at high speed, providing the energy to cut the material. While historically lathes were powered by belts from a <b>line</b> <b>shaft,</b> modern examples uses electric motors. The workpiece extends out of the spindle along the axis of rotation above the flat bed. The carriage is a platform that can be moved, precisely and independently parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. A hardened cutting tool is held at the desired height (usually the middle of the workpiece) by the toolpost. The carriage is then moved around the rotating workpiece, and the cutting tool gradually removes material from the workpiece. The tailstock can be slid along the axis of rotation and then locked in place as necessary. It may hold centers to further secure the workpiece, or cutting tools driven into the end of the workpiece.|$|E

50|$|With factory {{electrification}} in {{the early}} 1900s, many <b>line</b> <b>shafts</b> began converting to electric drive. In early factory electrification only large motors were available, so new factories installed a large motor to drive <b>line</b> <b>shafting</b> and millwork. After 1900 smaller industrial motors became available and most new installations used individual electric drives.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{forms of}} pre-electric power {{transmission}} were <b>line</b> <b>shafts,</b> hydraulic power networks and pneumatic and wire rope systems. <b>Line</b> <b>shafts</b> were the {{common form of}} power transmission in factories from the earliest industrial steam engines until factory electrification. [...] <b>Line</b> <b>shafts</b> limited factory arrangement and suffered from high power losses. Hydraulic power came into use in the mid 19th century. [...] It was used extensively in the Bessemer process and for cranes at ports, especially in the UK. [...] London {{and a few other}} cities had hydraulic utilities that provided pressurized water for industrial over a wide area.|$|R

50|$|The <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> is the {{accessory}} that enables a steam engine to drive {{more than one}} tool. The <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> first appeared back in 1936 when Geoffrey Malins took {{on the task of}} making a set of engines for Hobbies of Dereham, after Geoffrey Bowman-Jenkins left Bowman models. The early line shafts all featured flatbases and, before the war, came in two models: the C1 and the C2; the former having 4 pulleys and the latter having 7. Both types of <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> carried the Meccano-type red pulleys as well as turned brass types. The pedestal supports, like those of the early tools, were made from cast iron and the baseplates were drilled to fit Meccano. Production of the <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> and the tools continued right up to the beginning of Second World War, possibly into 1940, the <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> by then being incorporated into the SC2, 3 and 4 engines. After the war (c1948) the <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> gained brass pulleys as well as the hammer and punch. The flat base plate was retained but the C1 <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> was dropped. By the mid-1980s the Mamod company was in trouble; the SP1, 3 and 5 were dropped along with the separate tools and <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> but all five components continued to be made as part of the WS workshop.|$|E

50|$|Factory {{electrification}} revolutionized manufacturing. Unit drive, {{which means}} using a single electric motor for powering a single machine, eliminated <b>line</b> <b>shafts</b> previously used to transmit power {{from a small}} number of steam engines or hydraulic turbines. <b>Line</b> <b>shafts</b> created constraints on building arrangement that impeded the efficient flow of materials because they presented traffic barriers and required multi-story buildings for economy. It was not uncommon for large manufacturing sites to have many miles of <b>line</b> <b>shafts.</b> Electric motors were much more economical to operate than steam engines in terms of energy efficiency and operator attention. Electric motors were also lower in capital cost.|$|R

50|$|According to Henry Ford:The {{provision}} {{of a whole}} new system of electric generation emancipated industry from the leather belt and <b>line</b> <b>shaft,</b> for it eventually became possible to provide each tool with its own electric motor. This may seem only a detail of minor importance. In fact, modern industry could not be carried out with the belt and <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> {{for a number of}} reasons. The motor enabled machinery to be arranged in the order of the work, and that alone has probably doubled the efficiency of industry, for it has cut out a tremendous amount of useless handling and hauling. The belt and <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> were also tremendously wasteful - so wasteful indeed that no factory could be really large, for even the longest <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> was small according to modern requirements. Also high speed tools were impossible under the old conditions - neither the pulleys nor the belts could stand modern speeds. Without high speed tools and the finer steels which they brought about, there could be nothing of what we call modern industry.|$|E
