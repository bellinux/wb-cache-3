5000|$|Video <b>Lottery</b> <b>Machines</b> (slot machines) {{have become}} one of the most popular forms of {{gambling}} in casinos. [...] investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.|$|E
50|$|A <b>lottery</b> <b>machine</b> is {{the machine}} used {{to draw the}} winning numbers for a lottery.|$|R
50|$|Mark Six is {{a lottery}} style game where players guess what numbers {{will be drawn}} out of a <b>lottery</b> <b>machine.</b> The <b>lottery</b> <b>machine</b> is a {{transparent}} plastic cylinder which contains coloured Red, Blue and Green balls with numbers 1 to 49. The cylinder is rotated to provide randomisation in the drawing process. Each drawing occurs on 9:30PM (Hong Kong Time) every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday(or Sataurday if horse races occurs on Sunday), while bets are accepted until 15 minutes prior to the drawing.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, {{winning a}} stunt would award a token for the Wall o' Stuff. In these instances, those who won their tokens would take their {{turn at the}} Wall before any balls were drawn from the <b>lottery</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Camelot name is {{reflected}} in the actual <b>lottery</b> <b>machines</b> used in the National Lottery draw, which are named for characters, places, and objects in Arthurian Legend (Guinevere, Lancelot, Excalibur, Arthur, etc.).|$|E
50|$|The Gaming Control Act affects {{businesses}} {{or individuals}} {{that have been}} authorized to conduct lottery schemes, which supply goods such as bingo paper or lottery tickets, services, and equipment (<b>lottery</b> <b>machines)</b> to charitable and religious organizations.|$|E
50|$|An exhibit {{within the}} Contemporary Art Gallery {{includes}} {{a pair of}} an antique rotary <b>lottery</b> <b>machines.</b> These were known as Provedoria <b>lottery</b> <b>machines</b> manufactured in Lisbon. A few pictures also display the procedure for operating these machines. They have thousands of wooden balls, and the first lottery draw is stated to have been held in 1947. There are many miniature paintings from different regions of India. The gallery has paintings and sculptures of Goan and Indian artists such as R. Chimulkar, F. N. Souza, S. H. Raza, M. F. Hussain, K. H. Ara and many more which have been borrowed from the Kala Academy and Institute of Menezes Braganza. A flag which marks Portuguese victory over the Dutch is also on display.|$|E
50|$|Rollover - The {{next round}} {{features}} a <b>lottery</b> <b>machine</b> like device {{that starts with}} a jackpot prize pool of 200 points. The jackpot increases by 200 points for every wrong answer until one player answers correctly and wins the points that have accumulated in the prize pool.|$|R
25|$|In {{the main}} game of Lotto, six balls and one bonus ball {{are drawn from}} a Ryo Catteau Stresa <b>lottery</b> <b>machine</b> {{containing}} 40 balls numbered 1 to 40. To win First Division (the top prize), one has to simply mark off all six numbers on the same line.|$|R
50|$|Once a {{contestant}} {{goes to the}} Red Area, another ball {{is drawn}} from the <b>lottery</b> <b>machine</b> and that contestant moves from the Waiting Area to Winners' Row. The host then asks an open-ended question to the contestant in the Red Area. A correct answer allows them to return to Winners' Row behind the newly chosen contestant, but a miss sends {{them back to the}} Waiting Area. No money is at stake on these questions.|$|R
50|$|Common <b>lottery</b> <b>{{machines}}</b> {{consist of}} balls with numbers printed on them, {{which are then}} mixed in the central chamber, and then drawn one at a time. Such machines are transparent so the balls are visible throughout the entire process instead of disappearing inside chambers or tubes.|$|E
50|$|People in the {{audience}} were selected to press the button that activated each draw from the Ryo-Catteau <b>lottery</b> <b>machines</b> mixing on stage. Known as Wintario Button Pressers, {{it could be a}} festival mascot, a recent grand prize winner, a town crier, a performer from the town's pre-show, the mayor, or a member of Ontario's Provincial Parliament.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the massive}} payoff for a {{successful}} cheat (especially after the 1980 Pennsylvania Lottery scandal where drawing balls were rigged to draw {{a certain number of}} results), <b>lottery</b> <b>machines</b> are subject to strict security measures. In some cases there are several machines and several sets of balls, and the combination to be used is selected at random just before the draw.|$|E
50|$|Week 4 is {{all about}} the luck of the draw, as the {{contestant}}s must face the Biggest Loser Lottery. Every contestant has a Ping-Pong ball with their name on it in a <b>lottery</b> <b>machine.</b> Alison draws the balls out one by one until there is one left, and that contestant will be sent home for a week, with his or her trainer. At first, many contestants voice their interest in going home... until they learn that only the chosen person's weight will count for their entire team that week.|$|R
50|$|Five contestants {{compete for}} a chance to win up to £100,000. They are {{initially}} seated in the Waiting Area, {{on one side of the}} studio, and each is assigned one of five colours. One ball is drawn at random from a <b>lottery</b> <b>machine,</b> and the contestant matching its colour crosses the studio to sit in Winners' Row. They are asked a series of multiple-choice questions, each with three answer options. Every correct answer adds £5,000 to a prize fund, but a miss sends the contestant to the Red Area, between the Waiting Area and Winners' Row.|$|R
50|$|The first Lotto drawing {{was held}} on Saturday, 16 April 1988. In its {{original}} 6/36 format, six numbered balls were drawn from a <b>lottery</b> <b>machine</b> containing 36 balls. Players could win a share of a guaranteed £250,000 jackpot by matching all six numbers, or win smaller prizes by matching four or five numbers. If no winning ticket was sold, the jackpot rolled over for the next draw. Drawings continued each Saturday night until 30 May 1990, when the National Lottery introduced a midweek Lotto draw on Wednesday nights. Lotto draws have been held twice weekly since that time.|$|R
50|$|Originally, Pick 3 and Cash 5 {{were drawn}} using {{traditional}} drawing machines and numbered balls (which the Lottery purchased from Missouri after the latter switched to computerized drawings. When Oklahoma joined Hot Lotto in 2008, that game had already {{switched to a}} random number generator (RNG). On September 20, 2009, Oklahoma changed its two in-house games to RNG drawings. Mega Millions (usually drawn in Georgia) and Powerball (drawn at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida) have always used traditional <b>lottery</b> <b>machines</b> and numbered balls.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} <b>lottery</b> <b>machines,</b> the {{shuffling}} devices continued to evolve. In 1934, Ralph Potter invented an electromechanical machine that would read perforated cards and generates random sequences. The data would be {{then used to}} power up lamps on the gaming table. These lights symbolized cards and roulette values. Players pressed on buttons to indicate their choices to the machine. To some extent, his device {{was one of the}} first attempts to make a computerized pseudo-random generator and game console.|$|E
5000|$|Random number {{generators}} {{can also}} be built from [...] "random" [...] macroscopic processes, using devices such as coin flipping, dice, roulette wheels and <b>lottery</b> <b>machines.</b> The presence of unpredictability in these phenomena can be justified by the theory of unstable dynamical systems and chaos theory. Even though macroscopic processes are deterministic under Newtonian mechanics, the output of a well-designed device like a roulette wheel cannot be predicted in practice, because {{it depends on the}} sensitive, micro-details of the initial conditions of each use.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, 150 Delaware <b>Lottery</b> racino slot <b>machines</b> stopped working.|$|R
50|$|The {{player is}} able to collect coins; an in-game currency, characterised by its squarish shape and red C in its middle. These are {{obtained}} in-game by collection during gameplay, watching advertisements, completing tasks, collecting a free gift given every few real-time hours, and using legal currency to buy them in various amounts. Coins are counted the top {{right corner of the}} screen. One hundred coins can be used for a chance at a new character from a <b>lottery</b> <b>machine.</b> If the player owns the Piggy Bank mascot, red coins worth five coins each are added to the game, and coins received from free gifts or watching ads are doubled.|$|R
50|$|To {{determine}} the winner, fourteen ping pong balls numbered 1-14 {{are placed in}} a standard <b>lottery</b> <b>machine</b> and four balls are randomly selected from the lot. Just as in most traditional lotteries, {{the order in which}} the numbers are drawn is not important. That is, 1-2-3-4 is considered to be the same as 4-3-2-1. There are a total of 1,001 combinations (or 14! / (10! x 4!)). Of these combinations, one outcome is disregarded and the remaining outcomes are distributed among the 14 non-playoff NBA teams. The combination 11-12-13-14 (in any order that those numbers are drawn) is not assigned and is ignored if drawn; this has never occurred in practice.|$|R
50|$|The Gambling Act of 2005 {{permitted}} {{the sale of}} charity lottery tickets from machines, and Gamestec Plc and Tabboxx (UK) Ltd rolled out Tabboxx lottery vending machines throughout UK pubs. Ironically, Tabboxx machines are often being used to replace cigarette machines in those pubs. Major pub chains in the UK including Punch, Marston's, and Greene King, are removing cigarette machines across the UK and replacing them with TaBBOXX <b>lottery</b> <b>machines.</b> In January 2012, as the London Olympics approached, TaBBOXX joined Dame Kelly Holmes Legacy Trust in launching a lottery {{to raise money for}} sports programs for disadvantaged youths.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2007, reports {{surfaced}} {{suggesting that}} then New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was considering closing Aqueduct Racetrack, which is ten {{miles west of}} Belmont in Ozone Park, New York, and turning Belmont into a nearly year 'round race track when the New York Racing Association lease for all three of New York State's tracks expired {{at the end of}} 2007. According to the plans being discussed, Belmont's stands would be heated, additional barns built for Aqueduct's 400 horses, and the track modified to accommodate winter racing. In addition, video <b>lottery</b> <b>machines</b> would be introduced. A new entity would operate Belmont from fall to spring while the New York Racing Association would operate Saratoga Race Course in the summer. [...] Any plans the former governor might have had for the track alignment likely left office with him when Spitzer was forced to resign amid a prostitution scandal in March 2008.|$|E
50|$|In May 2007, reports {{indicated}} that then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was considering closing Aqueduct and selling the 192 acre track and its stables, which currently house 400 horses, to developers when the New York Racing Association lease expired {{at the end}} of 2007. According to the reports, Belmont Park, which is 8 mi east in Elmont, New York, would have become a nearly year-round track and would get the video <b>lottery</b> <b>machines</b> authorized to operate at Aqueduct. Belmont Park would have been modified to handle winter requirements which would have included heated stands and the construction of new stables. According to the plans that were discussed, the oldest and most historic track in the state, Saratoga Race Course, would have been operated by the New York Racing Association and a new entity would have operated Belmont Park. Aqueduct traditionally has been considered a track frequented by blue collar fans while Belmont Park has a more upscale reputation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem of}} {{ensuring}} randomness using mechanical means {{was hard to}} resolve. In the early 1930s, Robert McKay proposed an ingenious machine containing a chamber with 52 balls of different diameters (for each player, there were 13 balls with the same size). Like in a <b>lottery</b> <b>machine,</b> the balls would be shaken and randomly chosen by driving {{them one by one}} into a wheel with 52 slots. This wheel would then rotate, slot by slot, and a rod in contact with the ball would [...] "detect" [...] its diameter. A distribution mechanism could then use the diameter information and take the appropriate action to deal the card to the correct player.|$|R
2500|$|To {{determine}} the winner, fourteen ping pong balls numbered 1–14 {{are placed in}} a standard <b>lottery</b> <b>machine</b> and four balls are randomly selected from the lot. Just as in most traditional lotteries, {{the order in which}} the numbers are drawn is not important. That is, 1–2–3–4 is considered to be the same as 4–3–2–1. There are a total of 1,001 combinations (or 14! / (10! x 4!)). Of these combinations, one outcome is disregarded and the remaining outcomes are distributed among the 14 non-playoff NBA teams. [...] The combination 11–12–13–14 (in any order that those numbers are drawn) is not assigned and is ignored if drawn; this has never occurred in practice.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the back}} of the studio is the [...] "Golden Bank," [...] a giant contraption like a <b>lottery</b> <b>machine.</b> Inside are 100 golden balls, {{containing}} cash values that range from £10 to £75,000. Twelve of these balls are randomly drawn from the machine and put into a mixer, and four [...] "Killer" [...] balls are added by Amanda Grant, referred to by Carrott as the [...] "Balls' Assistant" [...] or [...] "Killer Queen." [...] These 16 balls are split equally and randomly among four contestants, each of whom places two balls on their own front and back row holders without looking inside. The front-row balls are then opened for all to see, while the back-row balls are visible only to their respective owners.|$|R
5000|$|The {{machines}} were manually loaded by three lottery staff introduced {{at the beginning}} of the show. Once loaded, Faye would instruct the machines needed to mix. Then she would send the proceedings out to the audience. The cohost would interview the [...] "button presser" [...] and ask them to press the button that activated the trap doors on the <b>lottery</b> <b>machines.</b> It then was a matter of waiting for a ball to come out of each machine. Only one ball was allowed to emerge. Sometimes a machine might take a couple of minutes to drop a ball. The integrity of the draw was monitored by a Montreal Trust officer. Each number was presented to the TV camera by a lottery staffer known as the [...] "ball girl". Faye would announce each number until the proper number of digits needed were read. The {{machines were}} reloaded by the ball girl, and the same process would happen again.|$|E
5000|$|The lottery {{drawing in}} Taiwan {{falls on the}} 25th of every odd-numbered month, i.e., January, March, May, July, September and November. Six sets of eight-digit numbers are drawn and {{announced}} in a 'live' televised ceremony presented by an emcee, during which four models roll out the winning numbers from hand-turned <b>lottery</b> <b>machines.</b> Six prizes are announced during the ceremony. As of 2011, the “Special Prize” has been increased from NT$2 million (US$63,000) to NT$10 million (US$342,000). “First Prize” of NT$200,000 (USD $6,200) are offered to customers with the receipts matching the 8-digit numbers drawn. Subsequent prizes valued at NT$40,000 (US$1,300), NT$10,000 (US$313), NT$4,000 (US$136), NT$1,000 (US$31) and NT$200 (US$7) are available to receipt holders who match the final 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3 digits, respectively, on their invoices. In keeping with Taiwan's [...] "convenience store culture", some major convenience store chains will redeem receipts for the smallest (NT$200) prize by allowing customers to buy that amount of products with a winning receipt; larger prizes must be redeemed at a government tax ministry office.|$|E
50|$|Perry first {{discussed}} his idea with Peter Maragos and Jack Maragos, {{two of his}} partners in a vending business. Once committed to the plan, Perry approached local Pittsburgh lettering expert and WTAE art director Joseph Bock about creating weighted ping-pong balls that were replicas of the official balls used in the <b>lottery</b> <b>machines.</b> Bock agreed to help, and experimented with powder and other substances until he settled on white latex paint. Bock performed careful experiments to determine {{just the right amount}} of paint to use so that the weighted balls could fly up off the bottom of the machine, but not high enough to reach the vacuum tube so the ball would be drawn out of the machine. The men thought it would be too risky to weight nine of the ten balls for each machine, so they decided to leave both the 4 and 6 balls unchanged. Those would be the only balls light enough to actually be drawn. This would reduce the number of possible combinations to eight: 444, 446, 464, 466, 644, 646, 664, and 666. Bock then applied labels on the balls (obtained from an art supply store) that matched the originals.|$|E
50|$|The Z8000 {{also saw}} use in {{embedded}} systems, {{such as the}} <b>lottery</b> ticket sales <b>machines</b> used in some convenience stores.|$|R
5|$|Returning from Melee are trophies, statuettes {{of video}} game {{characters}} and objects that give brief histories or descriptions of their subjects, such as Mario and Link, or other characters and items {{that appear in}} their respective series. A minigame, the Coin Launcher, replaces the <b>lottery</b> <b>machine</b> from Melee as the primary method of obtaining trophies. The Coin Launcher is a machine that uses coins as projectiles to shoot trophies and counter incoming dangers such as missiles. Coins {{can also be used}} to bet on the victor of online battles via Spectator mode. Trophies unavailable in Coin Launcher mode are obtained by using an item called the Trophy Stand on weakened enemy characters and bosses within The Subspace Emissary. Trophies obtained in this manner may contain information on the backstory of the Subspace Emissary.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} season, the Medley was {{replaced}} with the Wall o' Stuff, a wall of numbered doors, each hiding a prize or surprise. Each audience member was assigned a number. If their number was drawn from a <b>lottery</b> <b>machine,</b> that participant received a token to open one of the 20 doors. Some of the doors had What Would You Do? merchandise, such as a T-shirt or a gym bag. Others concealed pies that would be flung at the contestants' face (or a water cannon filled with whipped cream which would be squirted at the contestant). In addition, an unlucky participant could receive a card that sent them {{to one of the}} pie contraptions upon reading the paper containing a poem that is associated with the pie contraptions. Sometimes the contestant received a card that instructed them to open another door.|$|R
