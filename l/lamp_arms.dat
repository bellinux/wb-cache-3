By relaxing one or more string elements, the tensegrity lamp can be easily folded and transported. The novelty of the present design, over existing lamp designs and mechanisms, follows from the following features: - use of a novel tensegrity architecture, which {{is composed of}} three bars that do not touch each other; - possibility to optimize the design variables according to a given merit function; - deployment through string control and/or rotation of the <b>lamp</b> <b>arm</b> on a spherical hinge; - foldability of the lamp; - multifunctional use of power cords (insulated), as both electrical conductors and structural members...|$|R

With counterweights (named forks) on the arms, the Chappe system was controlled by only two handles and was mechanically simple and reasonably robust. Each of the two 2-metre-long arms could display seven positions, and the 4.6-metre-long cross bar connecting the two arms could display four different angles, for a total of 196 symbols (7×7×4). Night operation with <b>lamps</b> on the <b>arms</b> was unsuccessful. To speed up transmission and to provide some semblance of security a code book was developed for use with semaphore lines.

40|$|Position {{sense is}} an {{important}} proprioceptive ability. Disorders of arm position sense (APS) often occur after unilateral stroke, and {{are associated with a}} negative functional outcome. In the present study we assessed horizontal APS by measuring angular deviations from a visually defined target separately for each arm in a large group of healthy subjects. We analyzed the accuracy and instability of horizontal APS as a function of age, sex and arm. Subjects were required to specify verbally the position of their unseen arm on a 0 - 90 ° circuit by comparing the current position with the target position indicated by a LED <b>lamp,</b> while the <b>arm</b> was passively moved by the examiner. Eighty-seven healthy subjects participated in the study, ranging from 20 to 77 years, subdivided into three age groups. The results revealed that APS was not a function of age or sex, but was significantly better in the non-dominant (left) arm in absolute but not in constant errors across all age groups of right-handed healthy subjects. This indicates a right-hemisphere superiority for left arm position sense in right-handers and neatly fits to the more frequent and more severe left-sided body-related deficits in patients with unilateral stroke (i. e. impaired arm position sense in left spatial neglect, somatoparaphrenia) or in individuals with abnormalities of the right cerebral hemisphere. These clinical issues will be discussed...|$|R

O primeiro capítulo abordou as espécies de Mantispinae, da Amazônia brasileira, antes inclusas no gênero Mantispa Illiger, 1978, recentemente dividido em seis gêneros. Foram analisadas 14 espécies. Uma espécie foi transferida para o gênero Dicromantispa Hoffman 2002, D. moulti (Navás, 1909) nov. comb.; duas para o gênero Leptomantispa Hoffman 2002, L. ariasi (Penny, 1982) nov. comb. e L. axillaris (Navás, 1908) nov. comb. L. nymphe Hoffman 2002 e uma espécie do gênero Haematomantispa Hoffman 2002 (Haematomantispa sp. n.) foram registradas pela primeira vez no Brasil. Três novas espécies foram descritas, Dicromantispa sp. n., Haematomantispa sp. n. e Leptomantispa sp. n [...] Duas novas sinonímias foram estabelecidas: Mantispa (Mantispilla) lineaticollis Enderlein, 1910 com Dicromantispa debilis (Gestaecker, 1888) e M. parvula Penny, 1982 com Zeugomantispa compellens (Walker, 1860). D. synapsis, D. {{gracilis}} e Z. virescens não sofreram alterações taxonômicas. Foram elaboradas chaves de identificação para estas espécies assim, como para os gêneros de Mantispinae e subfamílias que ocorrem no Brasil. O segundo capítulo teve como objetivo estimar a distribuição anual destes insetos, e para isto uma armadilha luminosa (lençol branco iluminado com lâmpada de 250 W, luz mista de vapor de mercúrio e lâmpada BLB) foi montada em nível superior da maioria das copas das árvores, a 45 m de altura, em uma torre localizada no Km 14 do núcleo ZF- 2 (uma área de floresta primária), Manaus, AM, Brasil. As coletas foram realizadas mensalmente de 18 h às 6 h, durante três noites, no período de transição lunar minguante/nova, noites mais escuras, durante todo o ano de 2004. Foram coletados 143 indivíduos (80 fêmeas e 63 machos), divididos em 12 espécies. Três exemplares pertencem à subfamília Symprhasinae e o restante a Mantispinae. O local onde a armadilha foi instalada mostrou-se satisfatório. Os espécimes foram coletados em todos os meses. O número de indivíduos apresentou uma fraca correlação positiva mas não significativa com a pluviosidade (r= 0, 42; p= 0, 16) e uma correlação inversa, também não significativa com a temperatura (r=- 0, 26; p= 0, 40), indicando que o número de exemplares pode ser maior no período chuvoso. A espécie mais comum foi Buyda phthisica (Gerstaecker, 1885) (61 indivíduos), ocorrendo em todos os meses, seguida por Zeugomantispa virescens (Rambur, 1842) (27 indivíduos), que só não esteve presente em fevereiro e dezembro. Little {{is known}} about the Amazonian Mantispidae and this work aims to increase the taxonomic and ecological knowledge of this group of insects. The first part addresses the Amazonian Brazilian species of Mantispidae previously belonged to the genus Mantispa Illiger, 1978, recently divided into six genera. It was analyzed 14 species. One species was transferred to the genus Dicromantispa Hoffman 2002, D. moulti (Navás, 1909) nov. comb.; and two to the genus Leptomantispa Hoffman 2002, L. ariasi (Penny, 1982) nov. comb. and L. axillaris (Navás, 1908) nov. comb. L. nymphe Hoffman 2002 and one species belonged to the genus Haematomantispa Hoffman 2002 (Haematomantispa sp. n.) were registered {{for the first time in}} Brazil. Three new species were described, Dicromantispa sp. n., Haematomantispa sp. n. and Leptomantispa sp. n [...] Two new synonymies were established: Mantispa (Mantispilla) lineaticollis Enderlein, 1910 with Dicromantispa debilis (Gestaecker, 1888) and M. parvula Penny, 1982 with Zeugomantispa compellens (Walker, 1860). D. synapsis, D. gracilis and Z. virescens have not suffered taxonomic alterations. Identification keys were elaborated for these species, for the genera of Mantispinae, and subfamilies that occur in Brazil. In the second part we estimate the annual distribution of this insects using a light trap (white pane iluminated by a 250 watts mixed lightand a 20 watts black-light (BLB) <b>lamps)</b> <b>armed</b> in a superior level of the majority of the tree s canopy, 45 m height in a metallic tower located in Km 14 to the "núcleo ZF- 2 " (a area with a primary forest) in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.

Three specimens belonged to the subfamily Symprhasinae and the remaining to Mantispinae. The place where the trap was installed was shown to be satisfactory. The specimens were present in the collections of all months. A low but no significant correlation between the number of individuals and pluviosity was found (r= 0, 42; p= 0, 16), whereas an inverse but no significant correlation was found between the number of individuals and temperature (r=- 0, 26; p= 0, 40), indicating that the number of specimens could be larger during the rainy season.

40|$|International audienceTo {{investigate}} {{the involvement of}} the hippocampal-accumbens system in goal-oriented displacement behaviors, hippocampal neuronal activity was recorded in rats learning and recalling new distributions of different volumes of liquid reward among the arms of a plus maze. Each arm had a reward box containing a water trough and identical visual cues that could be illuminated independently. As the water-restricted rat successively visited the respective boxes, it received 7, 5, and 3 drops of water, and then 1 drop, provided at 1 -s intervals. (Reward distributions were reassigned daily and mid-session.) In the training phase, reward boxes were lit individually. In the recall phase, the <b>lamps</b> on all <b>arms</b> were lit and then turned off as the rat visited the boxes in order of descending value. Neuronal firing rates were analyzed for changes related to reward value or to shifts between learning and recall phases. The principal finding is that place responses remained unchanged after these manipulations and that these neurons showed no evidence of explicit coding of reward value. In addition, two other types of responses appeared while the rat was stationary at the reward boxes awaiting multiple rewards. These were observed primarily in neurons within the dentate gyrus, but also in CA 1. Position-selective reward site responses were regular at 20 - 60 impulses per second, while position-independent discharges bursted irregularly at about 5 impulses per second. Such responses could explain controversial reports of reward dependence in hippocampal neurons. The higher incidence of the latter responses in the temporal ("ventral") hippocampus is consistent with the distinctive anatomical and functional properties of this subregion...|$|R

Gyro agreed to fix Donald's lamp but Donald suggested that he should {{find a way to}} get Scrooge's Money out of the cavern that it was stuck in. Scrooge and Donald showed Gyro where the money was kept and explained the situation. When they went back to Gyro's shop he asked someone to turn on the light but the lamp turned itself on. The lamp was hit by the unfinished think box that Gyro accidentally hit earlier. Gyro modified the <b>lamp</b> to have <b>arms</b> and legs and doll shoes and Donald put in a lightbulb and they created Gyro's Little Helper. Gyro's Little Helper went in the cavern and found some money. They found out how deep the cavern is and pumped up some helium gas into the cavern as the money slowly went back up to the Money Bin. Unfortunately the gas worked too well as it made the Money Bin float into the air. Little Helper used his head to break the plastic cover to let the gas out and The Money Bin wound up on the statue of Cornelius Coot. Scrooge called for some rescue plans to his Money Bin off the statue. The Construction workers covered the hole with cement and gravel and The Money Bin was restored to its original location. After that Gyro and his Little Helper cleaned up Gyro's Workshop. Donald let Gyro keep Little Helper alive despite the fact that it was made from his lamp. The story ends with Gyro and Little Helper trying to sell inventions as Donald finishes telling the nephews his story.|$|R
