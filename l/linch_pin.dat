40|$|Archaeological {{fieldwork}} at Enderby and Huncote {{has recorded}} two contrasting clayland late Iron Age enclosures. At Enderby (SP 550 999), a cropmark enclosure was excavated {{in advance of}} proposed development. The enclosure revealed at least two main phases of occupation, characterised {{by a pair of}} differing sized roundhouses enclosed within a large ditch. Evidence for a gated entrance into the enclosure was also revealed. To the west of Forest Road, Huncote (SP 516 985), some 4 km to the south-west, a sub-rectangular Iron Age enclosure was located close to the discovery of a late Iron Age <b>linch</b> <b>pin.</b> This was a small farmstead, which was in use during the late Iron Age with possible continuation into the early Roman period. This included two circular buildings and a later series of stock control boundaries within the enclosure. The excavations have enabled comparisons in the chronology, development, trading contacts and economies of these two neighbouring Later Iron Age settlements to be made...|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. According to Seboni (2007), {{narrowing}} the wage gap {{is a key}} concern for the trade unions and the <b>linch</b> <b>pin</b> on which many of the current negotiations have been based. Attempts to find a negotiated settlement to the wage dispute between the employer organisations and trade unions in various sectors are {{more often than not}} protracted leading to threat and ultimately strike actions by unions and their members. On the other hand Statistics South Africa (StatisticsSA) (2010) has indicated that inflation is down, spending is down, and economic confidence is at its lowest ebb for years. As businesses face up to their most challenging conditions for some time, the pressure on Human Resource (HR) to act is immense because jobs must be cut, wages frozen and recruitment stopped(Charman, 2008). This would not augur well with the unions within the South African environment where there are continuous endeavours to protect jobs, increase wages and a quest to get more unemployed into the job market. The current global economic meltdown requires of all role players to act cautiously in order for organisations to stay competitive whilst at the same time riding the storm. For the purposes of this study, remuneration includes components such as base pay, fringe benefits and perks, short and medium term incentives as well as long term incentives...|$|E
