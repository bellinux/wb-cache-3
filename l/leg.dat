5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the unmatched left <b>leg</b> found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her <b>leg</b> could replace another unmatched <b>leg</b> that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched <b>leg</b> had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the <b>leg</b> could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the <b>leg</b> could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left <b>leg.</b>|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, {{knocking}} a {{ball from}} Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep {{from a long}} hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the <b>leg</b> trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine <b>leg</b> from a <b>leg</b> glance by padding the inswingers away with his front <b>leg.</b> Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat {{three times in a}} row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the <b>leg</b> trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the <b>leg</b> side and taking the shine off the new ball.|$|E
5|$|After the day's play, former Australian Test <b>leg</b> spinner Bill O'Reilly {{and former}} {{teammate}} of Bradman, now a journalist, consulted Bedser on {{his use of}} <b>leg</b> theory. O'Reilly had much experience in attacking <b>leg</b> stump in his career and helped Bedser refine his <b>leg</b> trap plan to ensnare Bradman.|$|E
2500|$|Spiders {{and many}} of their {{relatives}} move on eight <b>legs</b> – they are octopedal. However, some creatures move on many more <b>legs.</b> Terrestrial crustaceans may have a fair number - woodlice having fourteen <b>legs.</b> Also, as previously mentioned, some insect larvae such as caterpillars and sawfly larvae have up to five (caterpillars) or nine (sawflies) additional fleshy prolegs in addition to the six <b>legs</b> normal for insects. Some species of invertebrate have even more <b>legs,</b> the unusual velvet worm having stubby <b>legs</b> under the length of its body, with around several dozen pairs of <b>legs.</b> Centipedes have one pair of <b>legs</b> per body segment, with typically around 50 <b>legs,</b> but some species have over 200. The terrestrial animals with the most <b>legs</b> are the millipedes. They have two pairs of <b>legs</b> per body segment, with common species having between 80 and 400 <b>legs</b> overall [...] with the rare species Illacme plenipes having up to 750 <b>legs.</b> [...] Animals with many <b>legs</b> typically move them in metachronal rhythm, which gives the appearance of waves of motion travelling forwards along their rows of <b>legs.</b>|$|R

5|$|Edrich then {{relieved}} Coxon, who had bowled {{his first}} seven overs in Test cricket {{for the loss}} of only 10 runs. Edrich bowled a bouncer, which Bradman tried to swing to the <b>leg</b> side, but the leading edge instead went in the air and landed behind point. On 13, Bradman <b>leg</b> glanced a Bedser ball from his legs, narrowly evading Hutton in the trap at short fine <b>leg.</b> After one hour, he was on 14. Bradman had fallen twice for the <b>leg</b> trap in the previous Test. Bedser continued to the probe the Australian captain with inswingers, trying to extract a lofted <b>leg</b> glance in the vicinity if the waiting Hutton. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scoring many runs from the back cut.|$|E

Their worst placement was a last place finish (9th) in <b>Leg</b> 3, a non-elimination <b>leg.</b> They ended up in seventh place and were eliminated in <b>Leg</b> 7 after being issued two 30-minute penalties for using a cab to travel between tasks on the <b>leg</b> when they were instructed to walk; another team had also issued a similar penalty and checked in after them, but only had one half-hour penalty, resulting in Kevin and Michael's elimination.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, most cricketers {{considered}} it unsportsmanlike to bowl {{the ball at}} the <b>leg</b> stump or for batsmen to hit on the <b>leg</b> side. But by {{the early years of}} the 20th century, some bowlers—usually slow or medium-paced—used <b>leg</b> theory as a tactic; the ball was aimed outside the line of <b>leg</b> stump and the fielders placed on that side of the field, the object being to test the batsman's patience and force a rash stroke. Two English left-arm bowlers, George Hirst in 1903—04 and Frank Foster in 1911—12, bowled <b>leg</b> theory to packed <b>leg</b> side fields in Test matches in Australia; Warwick Armstrong used it regularly for Australia. In the years immediately before the First World War, several bowlers used <b>leg</b> theory in county cricket.|$|E
