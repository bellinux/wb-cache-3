5|$|After {{unearthing}} {{an ancient}} crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen {{discovered that the}} cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, {{could be used to}} calculate the height of a distant mountain {{in the same way that}} mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and <b>looked</b> <b>past</b> its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.|$|E
5|$|Jacob's staff: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{scholar and}} {{politician}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095), an antiquarian who pursued studies of archaeological finds, unearthed an ancient crossbow-like mechanism from a garden in Jiangsu which had on its stock a graduated sighting scale in minute measurements. He wrote that while viewing {{the whole of}} a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing {{a small part of}} the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and <b>looked</b> <b>past</b> its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated. Shen wrote that this was similar to mathematicians who used right-angled triangles to measure height. Joseph Needham writes that what Shen had discovered was Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which was not known in Europe until the medieval French Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) described it in 1321.|$|E
25|$|On 10 June 1940, when Mussolini led Italy into World War II {{against the}} British and the French, Italian forces in Africa became a {{potential}} threat to British supply routes along the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. While Egypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets, an Italian invasion of French Somaliland or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini initially <b>looked</b> <b>past</b> both of these small, isolated colonies and instead looked forward to propaganda triumphs in the Sudan and British East Africa (Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda). The Italian General Staff (Comando Supremo) was planning for a war starting after 1942. In the summer of 1940, they were not prepared for a long war or to occupy large areas of Africa.|$|E

500|$|The story, on {{the other}} hand, {{received}} mixed reviews though some critics <b>looked</b> <b>past</b> these flaws. GameSpot wrote that [...] "the story in Resonance of Fate is told in a drawn-out, stilted way that only reveals its agenda dozens of hours into your quest" [...] but what [...] "makes this story engaging even before your ultimate goal becomes clear is that the characters are well-developed and easy to relate to," [...] concluding that the [...] "quirky story provides laughs and drama." [...] Destructoid noted that [...] "Resonance of Fate builds its world mostly through inference and implication rather than exposition" [...] and added [...] "the main plot being somewhat threadbare, it never really ascends {{to the kind of}} epic scale one would expect from the genre." [...] RPGamer praised the storytelling, stating that it uses [...] "a futuristic sci-fi setting as a backdrop {{to tell the story of}} its main characters" [...] who are [...] "trying to survive in a futuristic world gone mad." [...] It chose the game as the runner-up for its Best Script award, for bringing the [...] "characters to life" [...] and [...] "doing an amazing job with the localization." [...] The game was also the runner-up for RPGamer's Best Voice Acting award.|$|E
