5|$|As Prince of Wales, Edward's {{arms were}} the royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom, differenced with a <b>label</b> <b>of</b> three points argent, with an inescutcheon {{representing}} Wales surmounted by a coronet (identical to those of Charles, the current Prince of Wales).

5|$|Before his succession, George {{was granted}} the royal arms differenced by a <b>label</b> <b>of</b> five points Azure, the centre point bearing a fleur-de-lis Or on 27 July 1749.

5|$|As Prince of Wales, Charles's {{coat of arms}} was {{the royal}} arms (which he later inherited), differenced by a <b>label</b> <b>of</b> three points Argent.

40|$|In this paper, we are {{studying}} vertex-magic total labelings of simple graphs. We introduce a procedure called mutation which transforms one labeling into another by swapping sets of edges among vertices. The {{result of a}} mutation may be a different <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> the same graph or a <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> a different graph. Mutation proves to be a remarkably fruitful process — for example {{we are able to}} generate labelings for all the order 10 cubic graphs from a single initial <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> the 5 -prism. We describe all possible mutations <b>of</b> a <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> the path and the cycle. ...|$|R

5|$|As Duke of York, George's {{arms were}} the royal arms, with an inescutcheon {{of the arms}} of Saxony, all differenced with a <b>label</b> <b>of</b> three points argent, the centre point bearing an anchor azure.

5|$|As Prince of Wales, George Augustus {{bore the}} royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a <b>label</b> <b>of</b> three points Argent.

His arms followed {{the change in the}} royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the French quarter was dropped altogether. The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King.|$|E
