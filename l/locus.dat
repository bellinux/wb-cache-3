5|$|The total {{complement}} of genes in an organism or cell {{is known as}} its genome, which may be stored on one or more chromosomes. A chromosome consists of a single, very long DNA helix on which thousands of genes are encoded. The region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its <b>locus.</b> Each <b>locus</b> contains one allele of a gene; however, members of a population may have different alleles at the <b>locus,</b> each with a slightly different gene sequence.|$|E

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the H- 2 polymorphism is adaptive, the degree of polymorphism of <b>loci</b> linked to the H- 2 complex on chromosome 17 of the house mouse was compared to the degree of polymorphism of <b>loci</b> located on other chromosomes. Published theoretical analyses show that polymorphisms subject to natural selection usually reduce the polymorphism of linked neutral <b>loci.</b> The first test of the hypothesis was based on data obtained from a survey of the polymorphism of 12 isozyme-encoding <b>loci</b> in wild house mice from Europe, North Africa and South America. Results of this test showed that, on the average, H- 2 -linked <b>loci</b> were as polymorphic as <b>loci</b> located on other chromosomes. In fact, the data suggested that H- 2 linked <b>loci</b> might be more polymorphic than other <b>loci.</b> To test this hypothesis more rigorously, data for the 12 isozyme-encoding <b>loci</b> were augmented with data from published surveys of the polymorphisms of 59 <b>loci</b> in house mice from Europe and North America. Results of these tests showed that polymorphic <b>loci</b> linked to the H- 2 complex tended to be more, rather than less, polymorphic than <b>loci</b> located on other chromosomes. The cluster of highly polymorphic <b>loci</b> seems to be related to linkage of these <b>loci</b> to the highly polymorphic H- 2 complex, but {{the way in which the}} influence is exerted could not be readily explained...|$|R
40|$|Microsatellite <b>loci</b> {{are widely}} used in {{ecological}} and evolutionary studies to assess inbreeding, genetic parentage and population structure. Such <b>loci</b> are often optimised in multiplexes to allow for economical and efficient use. Here, we tested 11 microsatellite <b>loci</b> designed for use in European bee-eaters (Merops apiaster), along with 31 <b>loci</b> isolated in other species, for their utility in European bee-eaters sampled on Susak Island, Croatia. Of these 42 <b>loci,</b> 20 were polymorphic in 38 individuals. These polymorphic <b>loci</b> were further assessed in a sub-set of 23 adults, excluding close relatives, and exhibited between three and 13 alleles each. All <b>loci</b> were autosomal, {{as indicated by the}} presence of heterozygotes in both males and females. One of the polymorphic <b>loci</b> exhibited low heterozygosity, three <b>loci</b> deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and three pairs of <b>loci</b> displayed linkage disequilibrium. The remaining selected eight cross-species <b>loci</b> and seven <b>loci</b> isolated in European bee-eaters were combined with two sex-typing markers and optimised in five multiplexes. A combination of 15 autosomal <b>loci</b> of varying degrees of polymorphism makes this multiplex set particularly suitable for both parentage and spatial genetic analyses. This multiplex set therefore provides a useful toolkit for studying kin selection and population genetics in the cooperatively breeding European bee-eater and, potentially, in other closely related species...|$|R

40|$|The {{utility of}} short tandem repeat <b>loci</b> beyond human identification: Implications for {{development}} of new DNA typing systems Since the first characterization of the population genetic properties of repeat polymor-phisms, the number of short tandem repeat (STR) <b>loci</b> validated for forensic use has now grown to at least 13. Worldwide variations of allele frequencies at these <b>loci</b> have been studied, showing that variations of interpopulation diversity at these <b>loci</b> do not compromise the power of identification of individuals. However, data collected for vali-dation of these <b>loci</b> for forensic use has utility beyond human identification; the origin and past migration history of modern humans can be reconstructed from worldwide variations at these <b>loci.</b> Furthermore, complex forensic cases previously unresolvable can now be investigated {{with the help of}} the validated STR <b>loci.</b> Here, we provide the absolute power of the validated set of 13 STR <b>loci</b> for addressing these issues using multilocus genotype data on 1, 401 individuals belonging to seven populations (US European-American, US African-American, Jamaican, Italian, Swiss, Chinese and Apache Native-American). Genomic research is discovering new classes of polymor-phic <b>loci</b> (such as the single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) and lineage markers (such as the mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome markers); our aim, therefore, was to determine how many SNP <b>loci</b> are needed to match the power of this set of 13 STR <b>loci.</b> We conclude that the current set of STR <b>loci</b> is adequate for addressing most problems of human identification (including interpretations of DNA mixtures). However, if suitable number of SNPs are used that would match the power of the STR <b>loci,</b> they alone cannot resolve more complex cases unless they are supplemented by the vali-dated STR <b>loci...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{classical}} {{concept is}} related to genetic linkage: Linkage between two <b>loci</b> is established by the observation of lower-than-expected recombination frequencies between them. In contrast, any <b>loci</b> on the same chromosome are by definition syntenic, even if their recombination frequency cannot be distinguished from unlinked <b>loci</b> by practical experiments. Thus, in theory, all linked <b>loci</b> are syntenic, but not all syntenic <b>loci</b> are necessarily linked. Similarly, in genomics, the genetic <b>loci</b> on a chromosome are syntenic regardless of whether this relationship can be established by experimental methods such as DNA sequencing/assembly, genome walking, physical localization or hap-mapping.|$|R

5|$|The goal of elucidating {{pathophysiology}} {{has also}} led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the gene expression of nearby genes, the so-called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. The reason is that GWAS studies identify risk-SNPs, but not risk-genes, and specification of genes is one step closer towards actionable drug targets. As a result, major GWA studies by 2011 typically included extensive eQTL analysis. One of the strongest eQTL effects observed for a GWA-identified risk SNP is the SORT1 <b>locus.</b> Functional follow up studies of this <b>locus</b> using small interfering RNA and gene knock-out mice have {{shed light on the}} metabolism of low-density lipoproteins, which have important clinical implications for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

40|$|Many {{lines of}} {{evidence}} show that several HLA <b>loci</b> have experienced balancing selection. However, distinguishing among demographic and selective explanations for patterns of variation observed with HLA genes remains a challenge. In {{this study we}} address this issue using data from a diverse set of human populations at six classical HLA <b>loci</b> and, employing a comparative genomics approach, contrast results for HLA <b>loci</b> to those for non-HLA markers. Using a variety of analytic methods, we confirm and extend evidence for selection acting on several HLA <b>loci.</b> We find that allele frequency distributions for {{four of the six}} HLA <b>loci</b> deviate from neutral expectations and show that this is unlikely to be explained solely by demographic factors. Other features of HLA variation are explained in part by demographic history, including decreased heterozygosity and increased LD for populations at greater distances from Africa and a similar apportionment of genetic variation for HLA <b>loci</b> compared to putatively neutral non-HLA <b>loci.</b> On the basis of contrasts among different HLA <b>loci</b> and between HLA and non-HLA <b>loci,</b> we conclude that HLA <b>loci</b> bear detectable signatures of both natural selection and demographic history...|$|R
