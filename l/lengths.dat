5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the {{algorithm is}} formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for <b>lengths</b> of line segments. (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for real numbers. But <b>lengths,</b> areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two <b>lengths</b> a and b corresponds to the greatest length g that measures a and b evenly; in other words, the <b>lengths</b> a and b are both integer multiples of the length g.|$|E
