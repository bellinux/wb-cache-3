25|$|While {{the effects}} of a {{four-year}} drought limited the potential of landslides, the steep terrain near the epicenter was prone to movement, and up to 4,000 landslides may have occurred during the event. The majority of landslides occurred to the southwest of the epicenter, especially along road cuts in the Santa Cruz Mountains and in the Summit Road area, but also along the bluffs of the Pacific Coast, and as far north as the Marin Peninsula. Highway 17 was blocked for several weeks due to a large slide and one person was killed by a rockfall along the coast. Other areas with certain soil conditions were susceptible to site amplification due to {{the effects of}} liquefaction, especially near the shore of San Francisco Bay (where its effects were severe in the Marina District) and {{to the west of the}} epicenter near rivers and other bodies of water. Minor <b>lateral</b> <b>spreading</b> was also seen along the shores of San Francisco Bay and to the south near Monterey Bay. Other ground effects included downslope movement, slumps, and ground cracks.|$|E
25|$|Olympus Mons lies at {{the edge}} of the Tharsis bulge, a vast {{volcanic}} plateau that is very ancient. The formation of Tharsis was likely complete by the end of the Noachian Period. At the time Olympus Mons began to form in Hesperian times, the volcano was located on a shallow slope that descended from the high in Tharsis into the northern lowland basins. Over time, these basins would have received large volumes of sediment eroded from Tharsis and the southern highlands. The sediments likely contained abundant Noachian-aged phyllosilicates (clays) formed during an early period on Mars when surface water was abundant. The sediments would be thickest in the northwest where basin depth was greatest. As the volcano grew through <b>lateral</b> <b>spreading,</b> low-friction detachment zones preferentially developed in the thicker sediment layers to the northwest, creating the basal escarpment and widespread lobes of aureole material (Lycus Sulci). Spreading also occurred to the southeast; however, it was more constrained in that direction by the Tharsis rise, which presented a higher-friction zone at the volcano's base. Friction was higher in that direction because the sediments were thinner and probably consisted of coarser grained material resistant to sliding. The competent and rugged basement rocks of Tharsis acted as an additional source of friction. Thus, basal spreading of Olympus Mons was inhibited in the southeast direction, accounting for the structural and topographic asymmetry of the mountain. Numerical models of particle dynamics involving lateral differences in friction along the base of Olympus Mons have been shown to reproduce the volcano's present shape and asymmetry fairly well.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Predicting {{locations}} of boundaries of earthquake-induced <b>lateral</b> <b>spreads</b> {{is an important}} challenge in geotechnical earthquake engineering. These boundaries are where differential ground displacements cause damaging strains. Eight <b>lateral</b> <b>spreads</b> were analyzed {{to determine the extent}} to which subsurface conditions determined their boundaries. Either local subsurface geologic or hydrogeologic conditions determined the boundaries of most of the <b>lateral</b> <b>spreads.</b> An abrupt change in geologic facies was a common geologic boundary condition. These facies changes included edges of buried channel sands in both floodplain and alluvial fan environments and edges of sandy artificial fill. At one <b>lateral</b> <b>spread,</b> local changes in fines content of a sand bed determined the location of the boundary. Some boundaries were determined by where the water table passed beneath susceptible Holocene sediment into nonsusceptible Pleistocene sediment at the margins of these <b>lateral</b> <b>spreads.</b> This left Holocene sediment dry outside the area of the <b>lateral</b> <b>spread.</b> These geologic and hydrogeologic conditions generally determined the lateral margin of the liquefied interval...|$|R

Outcrop evidence indicates that a single <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> occurring on a single continuous, bentonitic clay bed and encompassing approximately 125 km 2 occurred between 1. 5 and 28 Ma. Steeply dipping shears separating <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> blocks mimic the structure in the nearby La Nacion fault zone. Future studies of faults in areas suspected to be within the <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> will need to differentiate tectonic faulting from <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> deformation.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the pathophysiological mechanism of hemifacial spasm (HFS), we performed electrophysiological examinations, such as supraorbital nerve stimulation with orbicularis oris muscle recording and <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> tests, after suppressing the patient’s {{central nervous system}} by administering intravenous diazepam. Methods Six patients with HFS were recruited. Supraorbital nerve stimulation with orbicularis oris muscle recording and the <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> test were performed, followed by intravenous application of 10 mg diazepam to achieve facial motor neuron suppression. Subsequently, we repeated the two electrophysiological experiments mentioned above at 10 and 20 minutes after the patients had received the diazepam intravenously. Results Orbicularis oris muscle responses were observed in all patients after supraorbital nerve stimulation and <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> tests. After the diazepam injection, no orbicularis oris muscle response to supraorbital nerve stimulation was observed in one patient, and the latencies of this response were evident as a slowing tendency with time in the remaining five patients. However, the latencies of the orbicularis oris muscle responses were observed consistently in all patients in the <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> test. Conclusion Our results suggest that ectopic excitation/ephaptic transmission contributes to the pathophysiological mechanisms of HFS. This is because the latencies of the orbicularis oris muscle responses in the <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> tes...|$|R

This study examined the effect of irrigation frequency on <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> and inflorescence development of annual, perennial, and intermediate P. annua biotypes. Three treatments were imposed by watering to field capacity and allowing depletion to 12, 8, or 4 % volumetric water contents (VWC) before rewatering.

The soil/pile model uses the stress-strain response of reinforced concrete and steel, incorporating both the axial and lateral loads for structural elements, and p-y curves to represent interface elements to assess the pile response during earthquake induced <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> displacement demands.; The analysis approach is incorporated in an improved design methodology using concepts documented in the FHWA "Recommended LRFD Guidelines for the Seismic Design of Highway Bridges (2003) ".; Case studies of earthquake events, during which <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> displacement has caused damage to the bridge pile foundations are revisited to examine the response of these piles using the methodology developed in the research.; Design examples of several bridges supported by various types of pile foundations are also presented and the pile response in terms of plastic hinge development, pile ductility ratio and pile curvature response are studied. It is shown using the methodology developed in this research that given the subsurface conditions, the liquefaction and <b>lateral</b> <b>spread</b> potential and the structural details of the piles at a given bridge site, one can reasonably assess how close the pile is to acceptable ductility levels in plastic hinge zones.
