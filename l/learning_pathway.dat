The study is located {{in the context of a}} joint research programme focusing on understanding issues of articulation and <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> development for sustainable development, established between the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) in partnership with Rhodes University, Environmental Learning Research Centre (ELRC). Phase 1 of the SAQA/ELRC research showed that researching workplace learning requires an understanding of <b>learning</b> <b>pathways,</b> if it is to be meaningful. It is for this reason that this research in phase 2 focuses specifically on <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in the context of a local municipality in Makana. Using a case study research approach and qualitative data, this study investigated <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> for three occupational categories at different levels in the Makana Municipality: 1) key managerial occupations; 2) key supervisory occupations; and 3) key workers occupations relevant to sustainable development and how they are shaped and experienced. It also identified system and structural factors influencing articulation and access issues relevant to progress in <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> relevant to these key occupations. The study was designed using a case study research. Primarily, qualitative research techniques were employed to generate data, including observations, interviews and document analysis. The study used inductive, abductive and retroductive modes of inference to interpret and analyse data, using critical realist and systems perspectives. The findings on worker <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> show that there is a discrepancy between the Training Policy and the Environmental Training and Education Strategy of Makana Municipality. The issue of complexity in <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> and social structural factors such as inequality emerged as factors that strongly influenced <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> for workers. <b>Learning</b> <b>pathways</b> for workers involved in sustainable development practices hardly existed or simply did not exist. Interesting transitions associated with <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> such as from home, to work or no schooling in the case of the workers, showed a pattern of emergence. These showed that <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> are not accessible and equally available to everyone as can often erroneously be assumed. The findings on supervisor <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> show diverse complexities as well as related issues, when compared to the worker’s <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> Issues such as overlapping of study and work emerge as influential to supervisor <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> Lack of support is, however, an influencing factor, but in a different context compared to the workers, and mainly focuses on lack of bursaries, highlighting training policy issues. This aspect was found to also relate to lack of proper resources in order to enable them to learn and do their job better; an issue raised by the workers too. This challenge of lack of support in various forms posed a barrier to <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> Findings related to the manager’s <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> show a noticeable gap between the workers, supervisors and managers. The manager’s generally have higher education qualifications related to sustainable development, and in certain cases managers have had exposure to international training related to sustainable development. Factors such as ample opportunities for learning, mentoring, association on professional bodies, and decision making powers influenced the manager’s <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> It was also notable that while managers receive occupationally directed training, it is not necessarily sustainable development related. In theory, the results highlighted a need to understand systems as a whole and how their integration is important in influencing <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> There were also underlying mechanisms and structures identified which needed to be unravelled and understood as these were found to influence <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in this study. The study highlighted critical insights in understanding how <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in a local municipality context (the case of Makana Municipality) are constructed by both systems and structural factors in the workplace, while also identifying ways in which agency of those engaged in learning for sustainable development in workplaces is enabled and /or constrained by such factors.

40|$|Policy, environmental, {{social and}} {{economic}} factors are all driving South Africa's transition to sustainable development and a greener economy. Various policies {{have been developed to}} foster sustainable development in the post-apartheid era in South Africa (i. e. since 1994) and there are various projections on potential job creation for a green economy. However, there is a problem related to both the achievement of sustainable development and green economy objectives: South Africa is said to lack adequately qualified people to implement these goals resulting in what is termed 'scarce skills' in the environmental and sustainable development sector. This problem has, in turn, prompted various skills development studies in the environmental sector, including a national Environmental Sector Skills Plan produced in 2010. All these studies point to a reactive skills development system that provides inadequate <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> for existing and newly emerging green occupations, which provided the impetus for a more proactive, transformative praxis oriented system of skills development that supports environmental <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in South Africa. A second problem is that the concept of 'learning pathway' is poorly defined in the South African environmental education and wider education and training policy context. This term is often used in policy discourse within the notion of 'seamless learning pathways' and is only vaguely defined. This study set out to investigate selected occupationally directed environmental <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in the South African National Qualifications Framework (NQF) and green transitioning context. In attempting to characterise the nature of the environmental pathway, the study utilised critical realist metatheory which serves as an underlabourer for domain specific theory of transitioning societies and systems, life-course transitions and career development. This theoretical work allowed the characterisation of environmental <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> as educational and occupational progression. The study investigated the nature of learning and work transitions across the life- course of selected environmental professionals in two key occupational categories - environmental engineer and environmental scientist - both of which have been defined as scarce skills in South Africa. This enabled a nuanced examination of the formation of what emerged as 'boundaryless' career stories of professionals engaged in these two occupations. The study also sought to engage with a methodological problem in <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> research, notably that studies are generally framed either at the micro level career story, emphasising agency of individuals (voluntarism), or at the policy level, emphasising structural aspects of the skills development system (determinism). This study sought to bridge the macro-micro problem drawing on critical realist retroductive analysis; this facilitated the shift from a focus on events and experiences that can be empirically observed (captured in case study approaches) to the causal mechanisms influencing environmental <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in these two scarce skill occupations (discussed and analysed using dialectical critical realism), shedding light on how systemic and structural dynamics and mechanisms shape and influence the emergence of <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> as experienced in scarce skill occupations in the environmental sector. The opening chapters of the thesis provide an historical view of how the South African education and training system, itself in a transitioning process, has had to grapple with how to respond to and meaningfully take up the new emerging environmental / sustainable development mandate, which is increasingly framed within a multi-levelled transitioning social-ecological system perspective in post-apartheid South Africa. These transitioning systems are shaped by substantive policy imperatives for societal transformation, social justice, sustainable development and equity. Since 1994, various transformations have been taking place, often in paradoxical forms, in both the environmental and educational sectors, shaping a complex multi-levelled transitioning systems perspective for the study. This background work on transitioning systems provides the foundation for the first data chapter, which provides a descriptive outline of key supply side systemic elements as these pertain to environmental <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> more broadly (qualifications; occupational framing; career systems; sector skills planning). It also points to the lack of adequate mechanisms for analysing demand for environmental occupations, and highlights some of the contradictions in the supply- demand relation as these pertain to newly emerging environmental occupations. This helps to explain the empirical findings of previous environmental sector studies on the slow and reactive defining of environmental education and training for environmental occupations within the transforming education and training system in South Africa. The next two chapters, using case-based qualitative data, present the analysis of the two scarce skill occupations investigated - environmental engineer and environmental scientist. These chapters outline the dominant institutional educational pathway and the key supply platforms that support these pathways (career guidance; qualifications, occupational framings, skills planning) and the learning and work transitions of professionals within the occupation. The chapters highlight the factors and causal mechanisms influencing these <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> and thus provide insight into the multi-level dynamics that underpin <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> The final chapter uses dialectical critical realism to outline generative mechanisms influencing the construction of the <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> It also highlights key absences that are shaping the emergence (or not) of environmental <b>learning</b> <b>pathways,</b> thus pointing to opportunities for how the NQF might respond to the two scarce skill occupations under study, and to the emergence of environmental <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> more broadly within the framework of society-in-transition. Through this, the study links the career stories as analysed within the framework of <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> and skills system transitioning literature, to generative mechanisms and system development elements. The study concludes with providing occupational and systemic insights into absences and disjunctures that characterise the emergence (or not) of occupationally oriented environmental <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> It also provides insight into what leads to these absences, and how they are kept in place and suggests possibilities and openings for transformative praxis within a multi-levelled transitioning system framework. The study makes the following contributions: At a theoretical level, the study has shown that environmental <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> need to be viewed as a complex phenomenon that is emergent in open systems and constituted by dialectically interdependent planes. A deeper understanding of environmental <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> is driven by both educational and occupational progression. It utilises key contemporary ideas around learning and work transitions but links them to the broader analyses of transitioning societies influencing the environmental sector, indicating the significance of how environmental education and training system development is situated within the wider transitioning process oriented towards social-ecological sustainability, social justice and greener economies. This study has further identified green skills as an important focus in research work on transitioning societies. At a methodological level, the study has shown how macro-micro and laminated system research can be useful in studying transitioning systems. As a laminated systems study with a focus on transitioning societies, it provides a baseline for further systems study on green work and green skills. At a practical level, the study has made actual contributions to the conceptualisation of <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> in the South African NQF context, to building and informing future green skill developments in the South African post-school system, the environmental sector and to informing conceptualising in the emergent Green Skills project...|$|R

The next section outlines {{the position of the}} Master’s thesis in the engineering curriculum. Furthermore, the three workshops organized by the Faculty are illustrated. Likewise, the Teaching Assistants also get a training to guide the Master’s thesis. Finally, conclusions, discussions and future work is outlined. The Master’s thesis is considered as {{an essential part of the}} academically oriented engineering program. It gives the students the opportunity to show both their competences to do scientific research as well as to report their results. The <b>learning</b> <b>pathway</b> is designed within the structure of a five-year engineering program, containing two Bachelor’s programs and fourteen Master’s programs, with more than 3, 000 students enrolled. The focus of this paper lays on the last phase of the <b>learning</b> <b>pathway</b> when students are asked to report on their research by writing a Master’s thesis. There is a slight overlap with the <b>learning</b> <b>pathway</b> Problem-solving and Design, where students work in groups up to eight persons. One of the aspects of the Problem-solving and Design courses is the research report. The faculty organizes three workshops, aimed at guiding the students, convincing them that not only the research forms an important part of the course. The first workshop, Information Literacy, is organized in corporation with the Campus Library. During a two-hour session, students are encouraged in an interactive way to explore their Master’s thesis topic and try to find references. The second workshop, Intellectual Integrity and Plagiarism, lays focus on the ethical side of plagiarism and why you should quote or refer. The third Master’s thesis workshop, Academic Writing, emphasizes two aspects of the Master’s thesis: an academic writing style and the structure of the Master’s thesis. The role of the Master’s thesis advisor and mentor must not be neglected. Therefore, the Faculty of Engineering Science provides a workshop during the Starters Week of Engineering and Education: Training for TAs (SWEET²). The Teaching Assistants receive information about guiding a Master’s thesis and giving feedback on the written reports of their students.

40|$|Rapid vocal motor {{learning}} is observed when acquiring a language in early childhood, or learning to speak another language later in life. Accurate pronunciation {{is one of}} the hardest things for late learners to master and they are almost always left with a non-native accent. Here I propose a novel hypothesis that this accent could be improved by optimizing variability in vocal learning brain circuits during learning. Much of the neurobiology of human vocal motor learning has been inferred from studies on songbirds. Jarvis (2004) proposed the hypothesis that as in songbirds there are two pathways in humans: one for learning speech (the striatal vocal <b>learning</b> <b>pathway),</b> and one for production of previously learnt speech (the motor pathway). Learning new motor sequences necessary for accurate non-native pronunciation is challenging and I argue that in late learners of a foreign language the vocal <b>learning</b> <b>pathway</b> becomes inactive prematurely. The motor pathway is engaged once again and learners maintain their original native motor patterns for producing speech, resulting in speaking with a foreign accent. Further, I argue that variability in neural activity within vocal motor circuitry generates vocal variability that supports accurate non-native pronunciation. Recent theoretical and experimental work on motor learning suggests that variability in the motor movement is necessary for the development of expertise. I propose that there is little trial-by-trial variability when using the motor pathway. When using the vocal <b>learning</b> <b>pathway</b> variability gradually increases, reflecting an exploratory phase in which learners try out different ways of pronouncing words, before decreasing and stabilizing once the ‘best’ performance has been identified. The hypothesis proposed here could be tested using behavioral interventions that optimize variability and engage the vocal <b>learning</b> <b>pathway</b> for longer, with the prediction that this would allow learners to develop new motor patterns that result in more native-like pronunciation...|$|E

In the second run, this was supplemented with live Q & A sessions and increased educator feedback. Course data show that that some learners use the space provided for social interaction and mutual support. A <b>learning</b> <b>pathway</b> that engages learners in discussion and progression from week to week facilitates a deep approach to learning. However, this requires more support from the educators and the course host...|$|E
40|$|Video {{recordings}} {{have been}} used in the educational process for a long time, especially as an addition to the traditional way of teaching. In the diploma thesis “Web Application PEFtube”, I have presented the importance of video recordings in the educational process. Why and how to use them? I have researched what theorists think of the integration of video recordings into the process of teaching, their advices and experiences. I have recapped the well-known Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. I have also presented the importance of interactivity in video recordings. I have developed a web application named “PEFtube” which enables storage and viewing of video recordings, and creation of video <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> The application is intended for students who view the video recordings and video <b>learning</b> <b>pathways,</b> and solve quizzes. It is also intended for teachers who upload video recordings, create quizzes and video <b>learning</b> <b>pathways,</b> and monitor the students’ progress through the results of solved quizzes. Based on the Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning I know that the elements of interactivity increase the effectiveness of learning {{with the help of a}} video recording. For this purpose, I have enabled teachers who upload the video recordings to add interactivity in the form of quizzes between parts of video recordings. ...|$|R

On the basis of data from neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neuroimaging, a biologically plausible model is developed to illustrate the neural mechanisms of learning from instructions. The model consists of two complementary <b>learning</b> <b>pathways.</b> The slow-learning parietal pathway carries out simple or habitual stimulus–response (S-R) mappings, whereas the fast-learning hippocampal pathway implements novel S-R rules. Specifically, the hippocampus can rapidly encode arbitrary S-R associations, and stimulus-cued responses are later recalled into the basal ganglia-gated pFC to bias response selection in the premotor and motor cortices. The interactions between the two model <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> explain how instructions can override habits and how automaticity can be achieved through motor consolidation. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} how content-based multimedia search technologies {{can be used}} to help learners find new materials and <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> by identifying semantic relationships between educational resources in a social learning network. This helps users – both learners and educators – to explore and find material to support their learning aims. Exciting new technologies are emerging for designing and deploying multi-modal, interactive educational tools such as video, 3 D models, games, remote sensors or collaborative community-created resources (e. g. wikis). With the increasing availability of open educational resources in online, semantically marked-up and socially connected spaces, users are building their own <b>learning</b> <b>pathways</b> by exploring and remixing content. In this article the authors look at how the integration of multimedia search into the SocialLearn platform for shared learning spaces can contribute to this vision...|$|R
