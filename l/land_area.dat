5|$|New York County is the United States' second-smallest county by <b>land</b> <b>area</b> (larger only than Kalawao County, Hawaii), and is {{also the}} most densely {{populated}} U.S. county.

50|$|Short-field landing is a {{demanding}} procedure for pilots in aircraft, utilized when {{the length of}} the runway or <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> is relatively short, or where obstacles in close vicinity to the landing approach limit the available <b>landing</b> <b>area.</b> In the latter case, the runway likely have a Displaced threshold.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Landing</b> <b>areas</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} marked by coloured smoke.

The aircraft pilot(s) radio back when the smoke is spotted and what colour smoke they see. Troops on the ground then respond with what colour the smoke should be. Smoke of a different colour can mean that the <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> has been discovered and compromised by the enemy, and the pilot will usually have the authority to cancel any landing.|$|R

5|$|A variant on {{this design}} {{is the use}} of arrays, whose tilt angle can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They also require more <b>land</b> <b>area</b> to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations the reform was neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans.

5|$|Historically, California Zinfandel vines {{were planted}} {{as a field}} blend {{interspersed}} with Durif (Petite Sirah), Carignan, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Mission and Muscat. While most vineyards are now fully segregated, California winemakers continue to use other grapes (particularly Petite Sirah) in their Zinfandel wines. Zinfandel is grown on approximately 11% of California's vineyard <b>land</b> <b>area.</b> Around 400,000 short tons (350,000 tonnes) are crushed each year, depending on the harvest, placing Zinfandel third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot.|$|E

5000|$|The British-developed angled {{flight deck}} {{solved the problem}} of {{aircraft}} that failed to engage an arrestor wire, and created the routine option for aircraft to [...] "bolter". By angling the <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> off the ship's axis, thus [...] "removing" [...] obstructions forward of the <b>landing</b> <b>area,</b> aircraft that failed to arrest - that bolter - simply accelerate down the <b>landing</b> <b>area</b> and become airborne again. Bolter aircraft then climb back to landing pattern altitude and sequence in with other landing aircraft to re-attempt the landing. These bolter aircraft {{are said to be}} in the [...] "bolter pattern".|$|R

5|$|Kumbakonam {{continued}} to grow even after India's independence though it fell behind {{the nearby town of}} Thanjavur in terms of population and administrative importance. The population growth rate began to fall sharply after 1981. This decline has been attributed to limited <b>land</b> <b>area</b> and lack of industrial potential. During the Mahamaham festival of 1992, there was a major stampede in which 48 people were killed and 74 were injured. On July 16, 2004, a devastating fire accident in the Sri Krishna school killed 94 children.|$|E

40|$|Remotely sensed {{imagery is}} a type of data that is {{compatible}} with the monitoring and mapping of changes in built-up and bare <b>land</b> within urban <b>areas</b> as the impacts of population growth and urbanisation increase. The application of currently available remote sensing indices, however, has some limitations with respect to distinguishing built-up and bare <b>land</b> in urban <b>areas.</b> In this study, a new index for transforming remote sensing data for mapping built-up and bare <b>land</b> <b>areas</b> is proposed. The Enhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index (EBBI) is able to map built-up and bare <b>land</b> <b>areas</b> using a single calculation. The EBBI is the first built-up and bare land index that applies near infrared (NIR), short wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) channels simultaneously. This new index was applied to distinguish built-up and bare <b>land</b> <b>areas</b> in Denpasar (Bali, Indonesia) and had a high accuracy level when compared to existing indices. The EBBI was more effective at discriminating built-up and bare <b>land</b> <b>areas</b> and at increasing the accuracy of the built-up density percentage than five other indices...|$|R
