40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to search for the {{occurrence}} of communicative and subcommunicative units and to identify the linguistic features commonly used by the authors to realize the communicative and subcommunicative units. Three groups of English RAs by Indonesian speakers were chosen for this study: 10 RAs from engineering science, ten from science and ten from medical science journals. This study used genre-based method to investigate the communicative units in the text by using Swales’ CARS as a model. The results show that 1) only 11 out of 30 (36. 66 %) <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> have a ‘niche establishment’, 2) out of 11 <b>RA</b> <b>introduction</b> with a niche establishment none is of counter claiming type, and 3) the discourse markers often used in the niche establishment are of the contradictory type and the linguistic features used are of lexical negation and negation of the phrasal verb.

40|$|Introductions to {{research}} articles (RAs) {{have become an}} important site {{for the analysis of}} academic writing. However, analysts have apparently not considered whether <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> typically include statements of principal findings. In contrast, this issue is often addressed in the manuals and style guides surveyed, most advocating the desirability of announcing principal findings (APFs) in <b>RA</b> <b>introductions.</b> Therefore, a study of actual practice in two leading journals from two different fields (physics and educational psychology) was undertaken. In the Physical Review 45 % of the introductions sampled contained APFs (with some increase in percentage over the last 40 years), while in the Journal of Educational Psychology the percentage fell to under 7 %. These figures are at variance with the general trend of recommendations in primary and secondary sources. Thus preliminary evidence points to (a) a mismatch between descriptive practice and prescriptive advice and (b) diversity in this rhetorical feature between the two fields...|$|R

40|$|Rhetorical style {{transfer}} from ﬁ rst language {{to a foreign}} language can be serious problems in academic writing, such as research articles (RAs). This study is aimed at analyzing the rhetorical style of Indonesian <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> in multiple disciplines written by Indonesian authors and published in Indonesian research journals especially on the ways authors justify their research topic and research activity and suggesting potential problems if this style is used when writing RAs in English. Four hundred RAs written in Indonesian by Indonesian speakers were selected for this study from mostly university-based research journals. The analyses were conducted using a genre-based analysis method following a problem justifying project model by Safnil [2001. Rhetorical structure analyses of Indonesian research articles. An unpublished PhD diss., the Australian National University, Canberra Australia]. The results show that: (1) unlike English authors, Indonesian authors consider establishing shared background knowledge important in their <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> but not justifying their research project; (2) Indonesian authors justify their research topic by personal reasons and reviewing the current knowledge and practices and (3) while some use subjective and practical reasons to justify their research projects, many do not justify it at all.

40|$|Genre-based {{studies of}} {{academic}} texts have mainly focused on research articles written by native English writers. The objectives {{of this study}} are to examine the rhetorical structure of Malaysian research article introductions and to investigate {{the ways in which the}} rhetorical structure of Malaysian research article introductions may differ from the internationally published research article introductions. This study explores the relation of texts generic structure and the context. A corpora of 30 research articles were selected. For the purpose of conducting a comparative study, 15 introductions from locally published journal ‘The English Teacher’ and 15 from internationally published ‘ELT’ Journal' were taken. This study developed a framework for the generic structure analysis based on Swales CARS and OARO model. It was found that the international research articles complied with the CARS model whereas the Malaysian research article introductions adhered to the OARO model. It must be mentioned that two of the Malaysian introductions opaquely complied with the CARS model. This may be due to the exposure that the authors may have had in writing introductions the conventional way. Overall, the findings tend to confirm Swales’s claim that the research in the nonnative speakers’ world tend to be less antagonistic and thus geared more towards establishing readership rather than establishing the research. One prominent feature o f both ELT related introductions is that they are prone to discussing theories, personal experience and personal thoughts.

40|$|Retinoic acid (RA), {{an active}} form of vitamin A, is {{essential}} for life in vertebrates, owing to its capacity of influencing expression of a sizable fraction of all genes and proteins. It functions via two modes: (1) as controlling ligand for specific transcription factors in the nucleus it stimulates or inhibits gene expression from RA response elements in gene promoters; (2) in non-genomic pathways it activates kinase-signaling cascades that converge with additional influences to regulate gene expression and mRNA translation. RA performs {{a critical role in}} morphogenesis of the developing embryo, which is reflected in spatio-temporally changing expression patterns of RA-synthesizing and RA-degrading enzymes and in its biophysical characteristics as a small diffusible lipid. Because its histological localization cannot be directly visualized for technical reasons, its sites of action in vivo are inferred from the locations of the metabolic enzymes and through use of two kinds of RA reporter systems. Here we explain techniques for use of RA reporter cells and RA reporter mice, and we describe in situ hybridization methods for the three major RA-degrading enzymes: CYP 26 A 1, CYP 26 B 1, and CYP 26 C 1. Comparisons of the different indicators for sites of RA signaling demonstrate that <b>local</b> <b>RA</b> peaks and troughs are important for inferring some but not all locations of RA actions.

The analysis revealed that each section displayed a schematic structure, consisting of a set of moves and steps. In addition, clusters of lexico-grammatical features associated with a communicative function were identified. This two-tier genre analysis suggests that the structural patterns and linguistic features interact with each other functionally.

Here, we have investigated the functions of <b>local</b> <b>RA</b> synthesis in the process of motoneuron specification and early differentiation using a conditional knockout strategy that ablates the function of the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh 2) synthesizing enzyme essentially in brachial motoneurons, and later in mesenchymal cells {{at the base of the}} forelimb. Mutant (Raldh 2 L-/-) embryos display an early embryonic loss of a subset of Lim 1 + brachial motoneurons, a mispositioning of Islet 1 + neurons and inappropriate axonal projections of one of the nerves innervating extensor limb muscles, which lead to an adult forepaw neuromuscular defect. The molecular basis of the Raldh 2 L-/- phenotype relies in part on the deregulation of Hoxc 8, which in turn regulates the RA receptor RARbeta. We further show that Hoxc 8 mutant mice, which exhibit a similar congenital forepaw defect, display at embryonic stages molecular defects that phenocopy the Raldh 2 L-/- motoneuron abnormalities. Thus, interdependent RA signaling and Hox gene functions are required for the specification of brachial motoneurons in the mouse...|$|R
40|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} cells regulate their mobility {{by external}} cues. Genetic studies have identified > 100 components that participate in chemotaxis, which hinders {{the identification of}} the conceptual framework of how cells sense and respond to shallow chemical gradients. The activation of Ras occurs during basal locomotion and is an essential connector between receptor and cytoskeleton during chemotaxis. Using a sensitive assay for activated Ras, we show here that activation of Ras and F-actin forms two excitable systems that are coupled through mutual positive feedback and memory. This coupled excitable system leads to short-lived patches of activated Ras and associated F-actin that precede the extension of protrusions. In buffer, excitability starts frequently with Ras activation in the back/side of the cell or with F-actin {{in the front of the}} cell. In a shallow gradient of chemoattractant, <b>local</b> <b>Ras</b> activation triggers full excitation of Ras and subsequently F-actin at the side of the cell facing the chemoattractant, leading to directed pseudopod extension and chemotaxis.

However, factors that can increase or reduce the expressivity and penetrance of malformations in pregnancies in women with diabetes remain poorly identified. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) plays crucial roles in embryogenesis. Here, we find that Cyp 26 a 1, which encodes a key enzyme for catabolic inactivation of RA required for tight control of <b>local</b> <b>RA</b> concentrations, is significantly downregulated in embryos of diabetic mice. Embryonic tissues expressing Cyp 26 a 1 show reduced efficiency of RA clearance. Embryos exposed to diabetes are thus sensitized to RA and more vulnerable to the deleterious effects of increased RA signaling. Susceptibility to RA teratogenesis is further potentiated in embryos with a preexisting genetic defect of RA metabolism. Increasing RA clearance efficiency using a preconditioning approach can counteract the increased susceptibility to RA teratogenesis in embryos of diabetic mice. Our findings provide new insight into geneenvironment interactions that influence individual risk in the manifestation of diabetes-related birth defects and shed light on environmental risk factors and genetic variants for a stratified medicine approach to screening women with diabetes who are of childbearing age and assessing the risk of birth defects during pregnancy.

Here we investigated whether iBALT forms in patients with a variety of interstitial lung diseases. We show that while iBALT {{can be found in the}} lungs of patients suffering from multiple diseases, well-developed iBALT is most prevalent in patients with pulmonary complications of RA and Sjögren syndrome. In these patients, iBALT consisted of numerous B cell follicles containing germinal centers and follicular dendritic cells.

Increased expression of lymphoid-organizing chemokines, such as CXCL 13 and CCL 21, as well as molecules involved in the immunopathology of RA, such as B cell–activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), ICOS ligand, and lymphotoxin, correlated with more well-developed iBALT. Finally, the presence of iBALT correlated with tissue damage in the lungs of RA patients, suggesting that iBALT participates in <b>local</b> <b>RA</b> pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the first-ever incidence of {{acute myocardial infarction}} and stroke in a community based RA cohort compared with the general population. Methods: The RA cohort consisted of all patients in a <b>local</b> <b>RA</b> register in Malmo, Sweden (n = 1022). The patients were recruited from private and hospital based rheumatology practices, and made up the absolute majority of patients with RA in the city. The general population of Malmo, aged 16 and above, served as controls. From the Swedish National Hospital Discharge Register and the national Swedish Causes of Death Register, information about all first-ever myocardial infarctions and strokes in Malmo" residents between July 1997 and December 1999 was retrieved. The age and sex adjusted standardised morbidity ratio (SMR) of the two cohorts was calculated. Results: Fifty four patients with RA had first-ever myocardial infarctions or stroke during the study period, compared with 3862 subjects in the general population. The age and sex adjusted SMR was 161 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 121 to 210). The first-ever incidence of cardiovascular disease was increased among female and male patients when studied separately. The increase of cardiovascular events in the RA cohort was mainly due to an excess of myocardial infarctions (n = 36; SMR = 176 (95 % CI 123 to 244).

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies in recent years of written {{academic}} genres and they have highlighted the importance of genre analysis in the structure of student writing. The study utilised a content document analysis method to investigate the use of rhetorical moves in the introductions to academic exercise written by B. ed TESL students in Universiti Teknologi MARA (“UiTM”) Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia. The thesis describes how genre analysis was used to analyse the academic exercise introductions of a corpus composed of 30 texts written in English by Malaysian writers. The analysis reveals that the rhetorical patterns and some moves proposed by Swales in his Open a Research Option model are found in introductions even though not in sequence orders. Another significant finding is that the Malaysian writers did not summarise their finding in the introduction sections compared to Anglo-American writers. The objectives of this analysis are to verify whether the rhetorical patterns of organisation and the moves found in introductions coincide with those proposed by Swales (1993) in his study of research articles introductions. Besides analyzing the CARS model by Swales (1993), it also identifies the alternative model of Open a Research Option (OARO) in the introductions. The finding was different from those for English <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> because Malaysian and Anglo-American writers have different backgrounds and environments due to the social-cultural aspects with also reflect the organisation of discourse and rhetoric. Malaysian writers do not like to comment on other peoples’ works compared to cultures who like to give and accept criticism.

40|$|Objectives. Environmental {{risk factors}} are of {{potential}} interest for both {{prevention and treatment}} of RA. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of pulmonary function, smoking and socio-economic status on the future risk of RA. Methods. Between 1974 and 1992, 22 444 men and 10 902 women were included in the Malmö Preventive Medicine Program (MPMP). Pulmonary function was assessed by a standard screening spirometry. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and restrictive pulmonary dysfunction were defined based on pulmonary function tests. Individuals who developed RA were identified by linking the MPMP database to national and <b>local</b> <b>RA</b> registers. The patients were classified according to the 1987 ACR criteria for RA. Four matched controls for every case were selected. Results. We identified 290 cases of incident RA (151 men/ 139 women; mean age at diagnosis 60 years). The median time from inclusion to diagnosis was 12 years. Forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume within 1 s values were similar in cases and controls, overall and also in separate analysis of those screened ≤ 8 years before diagnosis. There was no association between COPD or restrictive pulmonary dysfunction and subsequent development of RA. Current smoking was a strong predictor for RA [odds ratio (OR) 1. 79; 95 % CI 1. 32, 2. 42]. Blue-collar workers had an increased risk of RA (OR 1. 54; 95 % CI 1. 12, 2. 10), independent of smoking.

40|$|This thesis studies {{resource}} allocation (RA) problems in multi-cell orthogonal frequency {{division multiple access}} (OFDMA) downlink systems with co-channel interference (CCI). This thesis contains four parts. In the first part, four signal models used for formulating RA problems in multi-cell OFDMA downlink systems are overviewed. For comparison, the classic sum rate maximized RA problem with per-station individual power constraints is considered. Applying the four signal models, exact formulations of the considered RA problem are proposed. Properties of the different formulations are unveiled and compared. Based on existing RA methods, suggestions about choosing a suitable signal model and problem formulation are given. Finally, an interesting property of the recommended formulations is unveiled. In the second part, the sum (over all cells and all destinations) rate maximized problem is considered in multi-cell decode-and-forward (DF) relay-aided OFDMA downlink systems. An iterative RA algorithm is proposed to optimize mode selection (decision whether the relay should help or not), subcarrier assignment and pairing (MSSAP) and power allocation (PA) in an alternate way. The proposed algorithm is coordinate ascent (CA) based and can reach a local optimum in polynomial time. In the third part, user fairness is further considered in multi-cell DF relay-aided OFDMA downlink systems. The problem of maximizing the weighted sum of per cell min-rate (WSMR) with per-cell total power constraints is formulated and its per-cell maximum fairness property is proven. An iterative RA algorithm is proposed to obtain a local optimum of the problem. The convergence and the per-cell user fairness of the proposed RA algorithm are proven. In the fourth part, multiple DF relay stations (RSs) are considered to assist data transmission in each cell. An iterative semi-distributed RA algorithm is firstly proposed to reach a local optimum with guaranteed convergence. Then a modified iterative waterfilling (IWF) algorithm is further proposed {{to solve the problem}} autonomously.

40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} {{challenges}} faced by non-native researchers writing their scientific papers for publication in English. To publish in peer-reviewed international mainstream journals, researchers {{should be able to}} write in a genre-specific and persuasive manner. Academic writing requires explicit organization of texts, caution in making claims, signposting connections, and creating coherence and clarity in the text. The research article (RA) is a key genre of scientific publishing with a special communicative and rhetorical structure. The structure and language of the RA partly depend on the disciplinary knowledge-making practices and writing conventions applied in the field of research. The subjects of this study were doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in Materials Science at Tampere University of Technology (TUT), all of them non-native speakers of English. The objective of the study was twofold: first, to explore the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, challenges, and wishes for further training of the researchers writing in English; second, to examine how they employed certain linguistic devices to present the results of their research. The study applied two methods to answer the research questions: an e-mailed questionnaire and a descriptive analysis of published sample RAs written by the subjects. Swales’ Create-A-Research-Space (CARS) model for <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> and Hyland’s model of interactive and interactional metadiscourse were used as investigative tools to study certain rhetorical and textual features. On the whole, the TUT respondents showed a positive attitude to writing in English. Approximately half of them felt disadvantaged in writing RAs when compared to native speakers. The researchers considered “creating text flow and coherence to make my reasoning easy to understand” and “expressing my interpretation of the results with an appropriate degree of confidence” most challenging. Both skills involve the ability to write reader-friendly and professionally convincing text. Most sample RAs followed the 3 -move rhetorical pattern of the CARS model. Most of the metadiscoursal items were interactive, which is characteristic of quantitative RAs in natural sciences and engineering. Overall, the writers employed a rather limited selection of metadiscoursal devices. Since proofreaders often pay attention only to obvious lexico-grammatical mistakes in scientific papers, an interactive system with early-stage consultation between writers and proofreaders can help to create persuasive and genre-specific argumentation. Discipline-based writing instruction and materials on textual and rhetorical organization beyond the sentence level could help writers to construct coherent texts...|$|R

Aberrant Ras activity {{as a result}} of oncogenic mutations causes de novo cell transformation and promotes tumor growth and progression. Results: Here, we describe a novel strategy to block deregulated Ras activity by means of oligomerized cognate protein modules derived from the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf (RBD), which we named MSOR for multivalent scavengers of oncogenic <b>Ras.</b> The <b>introduction</b> of well-characterized mutations into RBD was used to adjust the affinity and hence the blocking potency of MSOR towards activated Ras.

Two high-grade, unconformity-associated, monometallic U deposits in the eastern margin of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, Canada were used as case studies; the Millennium deposit (750 m deep) and the McArthur River deposit (approx. 500 m deep). Extensive glacial sediments up to 100 m thick cover both deposits. Groundwater was sampled from diamond drill-holes and monitoring wells, and surface water was sampled from lakes, and analyzed for the abundance of 3 H, minor elements (Cl, Br, F, N, S, U, Th, Pb), stable isotope composition (13 C/ 12 C, 2 H/H, 18 O/ 16 O, 3 He/ 4 He), dissolved organic and inorganic carbon content, pH, conductivity and oxidation-reduction potential. B and C horizon soil samples were collected and leached by ammonium acetate at pH 5 to identify elements adsorbed or co-precipitated on secondary minerals such as carbonates, Fe-Mn-oxyhydroxides, and clays. Soils were also leached with HF-HNO 3 -HClO 4 and measured by ICP-MS for major, trace and rare-earth elements. Rn in soil was measured from 30 cm - 80 cm deep within undisturbed soils at both sites. Coatings on drill-core fracture surfaces were leached sequentially with different strengths of nitric acid to determine the concentrations of P, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, As, Zr, Ba, Pb, Th, U and Ca. The Ra content of fracture coatings and soil from McArthur River was determined by γ-ray spectrometry, and the mineralogy was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and sequential leach geochemistry. All groundwater (down to 50 m depth) at Millennium and McArthur River is < 20 -year old meteoric water, based on 3 H results. Groundwater has undergone minor evaporation, which is evident from the greater abundance of 2 H and 18 O than the local meteoric water line, and is representative of Saskatchewan precipitation. The negative δ 13 C signature of DIC in groundwater suggests that potential sources of inorganic carbon are dissolved non-marine carbonates, the oxidation of DOC, and soil-derived CO 2. The organic carbon signature {{is similar to that of}} terrestrial C 3 plants (δ 13 C DOC = - 24 to - 27 ‰). Radiogenic 4 He in groundwater is reported to be up to 100 times the expected value in equilibrium with the atmospheric at the Millennium deposit (Power, 2014), but is atmospheric near the McArthur River deposit. Rn radioactivity in groundwater has a similar range at both deposits; from 44 – 5342 cpm (approx. 2 - 232 Bq/L) at McArthur River, and from 0. 8 – 278 Bq/L at Millennium. These values are within the range of Rn radioactivity throughout the Athabasca Basin reported by Earle and Drever (1983). Drill-core fracture coatings contain Ra (≤ 32. 2 pg/g) and the dominant mineral phases determined by XRD are illite, kaolin and quartz. Fe-Mn oxy-hydroxides are evident from sequential leach geochemistry. Ra is less abundant in B-horizon soils (≤ 0. 220 pg/g) than fracture coatings and Ra in B-horizon soils is highest near the surface projection of the McArthur River deposit, where Rn in soil gas is also highest (6. 3 kBq/m 3) near drill-hole MC- 251. The abundance of Ra adsorbed to secondary minerals on core fracture coatings is likely impacted by groundwater flow and the Fe and Mn concentration of fracture surfaces. Secondly, Rn in groundwater above Millennium and McArthur River U deposits is a decay product primarily from <b>local</b> <b>Ra</b> on fracture surfaces, and less so from Ra in B-horizon soils. Additionally, Rn in soil gas correlates with Ra in soils; however, Rn does not correlate with U in groundwater, soil or coatings along fractures. Furthermore, Rn in soil gas is at background levels of < 10 kBq/m 3 above both deposits, and therefore not an indication of U mineralization in these glaciated terrains. This study’s findings suggest that the concentration of Rn in groundwater is controlled by radon’s 3. 82 -day half-life, the mobility of U 6 + in oxidized conditions, and radium’s affinity for Mn-oxy-hydroxides. Rn within young groundwater above the two deeply buried U deposits is a decay product from <b>local</b> <b>Ra</b> on fracture surfaces. Rn gas in oxidized, shallow groundwater does not correlate with the concentration of U in nearby soil, groundwater, or core fracture coatings...|$|R
40|$|Early rises of pro-inflammatory cytokines play a {{key role}} in tissue damage and has {{detrimental}} consequences for functional outcome after spinal cord injury (SCI). All-trans retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to be a therapeutic agent reducing cytokine expression in vitro, but its use may be limited due to adverse side effects associated with systemic delivery. <b>Local</b> delivery of <b>RA</b> may circumvent adverse side effects, but may simultaneously reduce the therapeutic benefits of the therapy. Here, we investigated whether <b>local</b> or systemic <b>RA</b> treatment differentially affected pro-inflammatory cytokine expression early after rat SCI. Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNFα were investigated at 6 h after moderate contusion injury of the thoracic (T 9) spinal cord, when mRNA levels are known to peak. Rats were either treated with intrathecal RA (0, 2. 5, 10, or 100 ng) or received an intraperitoneal injection of RA (15 mg/kg bodyweight). Surprisingly intrathecal RA up to amounts of 100 ng did not attenuate SCI-induced increases in gene-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, intraperitoneal RA rendered a 60 %, 35 % and 58 % reduction of IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNFα mRNA levels, respectively. Although local doses higher than 100 ng RA may reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine gene-expression, such doses precipitate and possibly increase risks of adverse side effects. We conclude that in contrast to systemic delivery, intrathecal administration of RA up to doses of 100 ng is ineffective in reducing early pro-inflammatory cytokine gene-expression. Future studies are required to investigate the effects of single intraperitoneal RA treatment on long-term SCI outcome...|$|R
