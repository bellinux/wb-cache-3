50|$|Modern hand-rakes {{usually have}} steel, plastic, or bamboo teeth or tines, though {{historically}} {{they have been}} made with wood or iron. The handle is often made of wood or metal. Some rakes are two-sided and made with dull blades in the shapes of slight crescents, used for removing dead grass (thatch) from <b>lawns.</b> When <b>rakes</b> have longer teeth, they may be arranged {{in the shape of}} an old-style folding fan.|$|R

40|$|Prepared by Pennsylvania Department of Health Division of Environmental Health Epidemiology Under a Cooperative Agreement {{with the}} Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. In {{response}} to the BoRit asbestos site (22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆dcthe site 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122) being listed on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Priorities List (NPL) and EPA 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s collection of environmental sampling data {{as part of the}} site Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS), the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) prepared this Public Health Assessment (PHA) document. PADOH 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s primary goal is to evaluate whether a community is being exposed to levels of contaminants that may harm their health and make any necessary recommendations to prevent and mitigate exposures, as well as to ensure that the community has the best information possible to protect public health. PADOH worked under a cooperative agreement with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to complete this PHA document. PADOH evaluated air sampling and soil data for asbestos, collected at both on- site and off-site locations. As part of the removal activities and the RI/FS, EPA collected ambient air samples for asbestos, as well as activity-based sampling (ABS), to determine the potential exposure levels to asbestos in the air during vigorous activities such as <b>lawn</b> <b>raking,</b> children outdoors playing while lawn maintenance occurs, jogging, disturbing site soils and potential trespassing on the site itself. Using the air sampling data, PADOH assessed potential cancer risk for inhalation exposures to asbestos, on and off the BoRit site. PADOH also reviewed on-site soil and adjacent surface water data collected for asbestos. Lastly, PADOH compiled health outcome data, from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, for the Ambler community. The purpose of this PHA is to provide a summary of PADOH 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s review, answer community concerns, and provide relevant public health findings and recommendations. The public comment period for the PHA was from July 25, 2013 through September 30, 2013. After reviewing the comments and incorporating any changes or revisions, this version of the PHA now reflects PADOH 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s final conclusions and recommendations for the BoRit site, based on the information available about the site at this time...|$|R
60|$|His bicycle was {{now very}} old, {{and it is}} one of the concomitants of a bicycle's {{senility}} that its free wheel should one day obstinately cease to be free. It corresponds to that epoch in human decay when an old gentleman loses an incisor tooth. It happened just as Mr. Polly was approaching Mr. Rusper's shop, and the untoward chance of a motor car trying to pass a waggon on the wrong side gave Mr. Polly no choice but to get on to the pavement and dismount. He was always accustomed to take his time and step off his left pedal at its lowest point, but the jamming of the free wheel gear made that lowest moment a transitory one, and the pedal was lifting his foot for another revolution before he realised what had happened. Before he could dismount according to his habit the pedal had to make a revolution, and before it could make a revolution Mr. Polly found himself among the various sonorous things with which Mr. Rusper adorned the front of his shop, zinc dustbins, household pails, <b>lawn</b> mowers, <b>rakes,</b> spades and all manner of clattering things. Before he got among them he had one of those agonising moments of helpless wrath and suspense that seem to last ages, in which one seems to perceive everything and think of nothing but words that are better forgotten. He sent a column of pails thundering across the doorway and dismounted with one foot in a sanitary dustbin amidst an enormous uproar of falling ironmongery.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that physical activity is beneficial for the elder person {{to reduce the}} risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke, anxiety and depression but many forms of exercise are unsuitable for the elderly or they quit after a short period of time through lack of motivation or desire to attend a gym (American College of Sports Medicine, 2004; Hui and Rubenstein, 2006; Lee et al, 1991). However, gardening is an activity which many elderly people enjoy (Yusuf et al, 1996), rather than doing it for therapeutic reasons. The potential benefits of gardening as a form of age-appropriate exercise has particular emphasis on maintaining strength and flexibility to avoid fractures resulting from falls or osteoporosis. The gardening activities considered included digging, weeding, pruning, wheelbarrow operation, lifting of heavy objects, <b>lawn</b> mowing and <b>raking.</b> This project has measured the movement and loads placed on gardeners during a range of gardening activities and calculated the consequential forces occurring within the muscles, tendons, joints and bones of the gardener. The motion of gardeners was measured using a 12 camera 3 -dimensional optical tracking system. The forces acting between the gardening equipment and the gardener was measured using force transducers, static weight plus inertia forces. The loads generated within the gardener were calculated using the Biomechanics of Bodies (BoB) software (Shippen & May 2010). The musculoskeletal model within BoB consists of 36 rigid segments connected with 33 joints whose actions represent their anatomical counterparts and 606 locomotor muscle units. The torques occurring at the joints were calculated using a Lagrangian inverse dynamics method. The force distribution within the muscles were calculated by minimising an objective function defined as the sum of the squares of the muscle activations constrained by the muscle torque equalling the inverse dynamics torque. This study suggests techniques and tool design to minimise the injury risk for the gardener...|$|R
