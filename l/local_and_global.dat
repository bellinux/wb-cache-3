5|$|At this time, {{the first}} serious student revolts started to emerge, {{motivated}} by the <b>local</b> <b>and</b> <b>global</b> changes of the decade, like the Vietnam war, the European student movement, {{the presence of the}} Peace Corps in Latin-America and specially in Colombia, the rejection of the IDB loan and the presence of the foreign foundations. On February 15, 1971, after the unconsulted election of the Dean of the Division of Social Science and Economics, some students took the rectory. This marked the first incursion of the police force to the university campus. For these events, some professors and students were expelled of the university. Nevertheless, the support for the rector dropped, who had to resign. Since mid February to April, the university was closed until the new rector was appointed.|$|E

25|$|Most fission {{products}} {{have too many}} neutrons to be stable so they are radioactive by beta decay, converting neutrons into protons by throwing off beta particles (electrons) and gamma rays. Their half lives range from milliseconds to about 200,000 years. Many decay into isotopes that are themselves radioactive, so from 1 to 6 (average 3) decays {{may be required to}} reach stability. In reactors, the radioactive products are the nuclear waste in spent fuel. In bombs, they become radioactive fallout, both <b>local</b> <b>and</b> <b>global.</b>|$|E
