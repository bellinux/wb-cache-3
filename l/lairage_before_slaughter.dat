40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study {{of the effect of}} time spent in lairage on salmonellas in the caecum and on the skin surface of 450 slaughter pigs from a single producer was conducted. Pigs were tested in 6 groups at 2 abattoirs, with one-third of a group being slaughtered after 18 h, one-third after 42 h and one-third after 66 h spent in lairage. The salmonella isolation rate from caeca and carcass surfaces increased significantly with increasing time spent in lairage. Salmonellas were isolated from the caeca of 18. 5 % of pigs held less than 24 h in lairage, 24. 1 % of pigs held a further 24 h and 47. 7 % of pigs held for 66 h in <b>lairage</b> <b>before</b> <b>slaughter.</b> The salmonella isolation rates from carcasses were 9. 3 %, 12. 8 % and 27. 3 % for the same groups. Thirteen salmonella serotypes were isolated from the caecal contents and carcasses over the 6 weeks of the trial. One abattoir had a higher salmonella isolation rate from pigs than the other and this was probably related to lairage management. It appeared that lairage {{is an important factor in}} the manipulation of the salmonella contamination of pig carcasses...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} were done {{to determine whether}} short-term supplementation (5 days pre-slaughter) with magnesium acetate, {{or a combination of}} magnesium acetate, tryptophan, vitamin E and vitamin C would improve pork quality. In the first experiment the pigs (Pietrain x Yorkshire, n = 96) were fed a standard feed or a magnesium supplemented feed for 5 days prior to slaughter. As a possible stress factor half of the animals were slaughtered upon arrival at the slaughterplant whereas the remaining animals were allowed two hours of rest in <b>lairage</b> <b>before</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Magnesium supplementation did not result in an increase in plasma magnesium concentration at slaughter. Omission of lairage resulted in higher plasma glucose concentrations, but plasma lactate concentrations were not affected. Drip loss and ultimate pH were not affected by diet or omission of lairage. Omission of lairage resulted in poorer color characteristics. This effect was prevented by supplementation with magnesium. In the second experiment the pigs (Pietrain x Yorkshire, n = 92) were fed a standard feed or this standard feed supplemented with magnesium acetate, tryptophan, vitamin E and vitamin C for 5 days prior to slaughter. Supplementation with vitamin E did not increase muscle vitamin E concentration. Inclusion of supplements in the diet failed to improve water-holding capacity or color characteristics. These results indicate that short-term supplementation with magnesium acetate, tryptophan, vitamin E and vitamin C is of little value in improving pork quality when pigs are not stressed beyond levels associated with routine slaughter procedures.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of the pre-slaughter process on Salmonella caecal contamination of pigs at slaughter. An observational study was carried out in 2001 on 101 conventional farrow-to-finish pig farms. On each farm, one batch of contemporary pigs was followed from the end of the fattening period until slaughter. The Salmonella bacteriological status of the batches was assessed by environmental samples of faecal material. The serological Salmonella status was obtained on 30 individually identified market-age pigs using an indirect ELISA test. At the slaughterhouse, 25 g of caecal contents were taken from 10 of the identified pigs. Faecal and caecal material were analysed according to a classical bacteriological method. A questionnaire was designed to obtain information about the type of feeding during the fattening period (dry versus wet), the duration of fasting on the farm before leaving for the slaughterhouse, the duration of transport between the farm and the slaughterhouse, the holding time in lairage at the slaughterhouse and loading and unloading conditions on the farm and at the slaughterhouse. To assess the relationships between these factors and the Salmonella caecal status of the pigs and the batches, two logistic models were fitted at the individual and at the batch level, respectively. The first analysis was performed using a random effects logistic regression model. The second analysis was based on a cumulative logit model with a positive caecal rate classified into three classes as the outcome variable. The results showed that the Salmonella status of market-age pigs assessed on the farm either by serological or bacteriological examinations and the time spent in <b>lairage</b> <b>before</b> <b>slaughtering</b> played a crucial role on caecal contamination. In the light of these results, actions should be considered both on the farm and at the slaughterhouse to decrease the risk of Salmonella contamination of the caecal contents...|$|R

Carcasses contamination determination was carried out by swabbing (neck, flank and rump). Meat quality was assessed by pH, colour coordinates, drip loss (DL), shear force (SF) ad lipid oxidation. SA did not have effect on carcass microbiological quality. TL caused a significant effect on total viable count and Pseudomonas spp values. Flank was the most contaminated site.

Calves were born from 2003 to 2007, and evaluated shortly after weaning. Steers were evaluated shortly <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> for all 5 disposition traits and at slaughter for overall disposition. Heifers were evaluated for overall disposition at calving every year. Scores ranged from 1 to 9, with 1 being docile and 9 being unruly, except at calving where {{scores ranged from}} 1 to 5. Between sires for overall disposition, calves by 297 J were lowest at weaning (2. 83), <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> (2. 84), and at slaughter (2. 45) and second lowest in first calf heifers (2. 27). Calves by 437 J were highest at weaning (4. 10), <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> (3. 54), at slaughter (2. 89) and in first calf heifers (3. 10). Bulls had the lowest scores at weaning (2. 54), although the number was small (n= 10); females were the highest (4. 01), and steers were intermediate (3. 70). All 5 weaning traits were correlated (P < 0. 05) with each other (0. 73 to 0. 96). The correlation of recipient disposition and weaning disposition of the calves was 0. 12 (P < 0. 05).

A study {{involving}} {{two groups}} of feedlot cattle (n = 84 and 112) was undertaken to compare the effect of two preslaughter lairage (L) durations (3 h v. 18 h) on carcass and meat quality properties. The cattle were grainfed for 150 days <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> and had a mean carcass weight of 347. 0 ± 25. 4 kg. Cattle from the same feedlot pen were randomly allocated to the two treatments on the day <b>before</b> <b>slaughter.</b> One group was transported to the abattoir the day <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> and held overnight (L– 18 h) whereas the other group remained at the feedlot and was transported the following morning and remained in the lairage for 3 h <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> (L– 3 h). After slaughter, meat quality was evaluated on a subset of 15 carcasses/lairage treatment from the two slaughter groups. Objective meat quality measures were made on unaged and 14 -day-aged striploins (longissimus lumborum) from these carcasses. Cattle from the reduced lairage treatment had heavier bled bodyweights at slaughter (P 0. 05) on carcass weight, muscle glycogen concentration, pH 3 h, ultimate pH, shear force or Minolta lightness values.

40|$|Stunning is {{the process}} of {{rendering}} animals immobile or unconscious, with or without killing the animal, when or immediately prior to slaughtering them for food. In modern slaughterhouses a variety of stunning methods are used on livestock. Methods include: Electrical stunning, Gas stunning, Percussive stunning. There are three opinions of Islamic scholars about stunning. Those scholars; who do not allow stunning at all; are of the view that the method of rendering animals unconscious <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> is against the shairah method and Sunnah, and it is Makrooh e Teḥreemi. <b>Before</b> <b>slaughtering,</b> if an animal died due to stunning, then that animal is carcass and is not allowed to be eaten. But, if <b>before</b> <b>slaughter,</b> ḥayat e Mustaqirrah is present in animal and it is slaughtered in that condition then it is permissible to eat it. Certain scholars allow stunning in certain situations with some terms and conditions. The decisions of Mjam e Faqhiyyah of modern age are also based on conditional permission. Moreover, Mufti Muḥammad Taqi Usmani, Dr. Wahabah Zoḥaili and Abdul Aziz Bin Baaz agree with conditional permission, while some other scholars allow all types of stunning without any condition; Mufti Muḥammad Abduho and his pupil Allamah Rasheed Raza Miṣri agree with later opinion...|$|R

Forty-eight Angus crossbred heifers were allotted randomly to 8 pens. Six heifers were in each pen, and there were 2 pens per treatment. The 4 treatments included control (no 25 -OH D 3 or vitamin E); 25 -OH D 3 (500 mg of 25 -OH D 3 administered as a one-time oral bolus 7 d before slaughter); vitamin E (1, 000 IU of vitamin E administered daily as a top-dress for 104 d before slaughter); or combination (500 mg of 25 -OH D 3 administered as a one-time oral bolus 7 d <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> and 1, 000 IU of vitamin E administered daily as a top-dress for 104 d <b>before</b> <b>slaughter).</b> Blood samples were obtained on the day that heifers were allotted to treatments, on the day 25 -OH D 3 was administered, and on the day <b>before</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Plasma calcium concentration was increased when 25 -OH D 3 was administered with or without vitamin E (P 3 ̆c 0. 007). In LM, calcium concentration tended to increase (P = 0. 10) when 25 -OH D 3 was administered alone but not when 25 -OH D 3 was administered with vitamin E. Concentrations of 25 -OH D 3 and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 in plasma were increased when 25 -OH D 3 was administered with or without vitamin E (P 3 ̆c 0. 001).

At the slaughterhouse, blood samples were taken from 86 lambs after the transport and <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> for plasma cortisol analysis. The method of transport influenced in the cortisol concentration (0 h; P< 0. 01). The animals transported in the closed compartment had a lower level (28. 97 ngml− 1) than the animals transported in the open compartment (35. 49 ngml− 1). After the resting period in the slaughterhouse, there was a decline in the plasmatic cortisol concentration, with the animals subjected to 3 h of rest presenting the lower average cortisol value (24. 14 ngml− 1; P< 0. 05) than animals subjected to 1 h of rest (29. 95 ngml− 1). It can be inferred that the lambs that remained 3 h in standby <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> had more time to recover from the stress of the transportation than those that waited just 1 h. Visual access to the external environment during the transport of the lambs is a stressful factor changing the level of plasmatic cortisol, and the resting period <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> was effective in lowering stress, reducing the plasmatic cortisol in the lambs...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of birth weight on growth performance and carcass quality. Data were collected from 80 crossbred piglets.

Fattening period was finished at the same day for all pigs. Lean meat percentage and pH 1 value were measured after slaughter, drip loss and intramuscular fat content were analysed in laboratory. Data were divided into 4 groups according to the birth weight of piglets (I: less than 1000 g, II: 1001 – 1200 g, III: 1201 – 1500 g, IV: 1501 g and more). Increased birth weight resulted in increased daily weight gain from birth to weaning (28 days), after weaning and also from birth to slaughter (P ≤ 0. 05, P ≤ 0. 01). The high daily weight gain in group IV enabled pigs to reach the slaughter weight one month earlier than pigs from group II. The lowest lean meat content (52. 74 ± 2. 82 %) was found in group IV. This is connected with high slaughter weight (132. 50 ± 7. 27 kg). Intramuscular fat content, pH 1 value and drip loss were not affected by birth weight of piglets...|$|R
