25|$|The {{reason for}} {{the high number of}} people driving under a Provisional Licence under the old system was because a Provisional <b>Licence</b> <b>holder</b> could drive unaccompanied after obtaining their second Provisional Licence, and many drivers chose this route rather than going through the full testing process.

Although ATV had purpose-built a modern colour production complex in the centre of Birmingham, most of its major productions were recorded at its main studios at Elstree in Hertfordshire, a legacy of when the company also served London at the weekends prior to 1968.

25|$|Until 2013, the Croatian {{driving licence}} had a pink booklet format, which was common in Europe at the time. A {{separate}} booklet {{was required for}} each vehicle category endorsement.

Since 2013, Croatian driving licences are issued in a EU-standard, credit-card-style format. Only one card is required per <b>licence</b> <b>holder</b> as it contains information on all vehicle categories that the holder is allowed to operate. Old (pre-2013) licences remain to be valid until their expiry, or until year 2033, whichever comes sooner.|$|E

The company was launched as Southern Television Limited and the title Southern Television was consistently used on-air throughout its life. However, in 1966 during the application process for contracts running from 1968 the company renamed itself Southern Independent Television Limited, a title which was used until 1980, when the company reverted to its original corporate name. Southern Television ceased broadcasting on the morning of 1 January 1982 at 12.43am, after a review during the 1980 franchise round gave the contract to Television South.|$|E

40|$|The project {{aimed to}} develop a better {{understanding}} of the patterns of riding and risk factors associated with older motorcyclists and to recommend measures that may reduce the crash involvement of these riders. The survey of motorcycle <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> aged 30 and over found that only 53 % had ridden in the last year. The percentage fell with age, from 60 % of <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> aged 30 to 39 to 41 % of <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> aged 60 and over. Overall, 43 % of riders who responded were “continuing riders”, 27 % were “returned riders ” and 31 % were “new riders”. These groups were compared in terms of demographics, crash involvement and riding patterns and motorcycles owned now and in the past. The number and percentage of riders in crashes who were aged 30 and over doubled from 1991 - 2000. Notwithstanding this increase, the crash involvement rate of <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> aged 30 and over is lower than that of younger <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> and it decreases with age. Reductions in the amount of riding and more experience (on average) as rider age increases may underlie this decrease.
