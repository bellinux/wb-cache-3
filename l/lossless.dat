5|$|In 2009, {{the album}} was made {{available}} globally as a digital download, alongside the band's debut and second albums Go to the Future (2007) and Night Fishing (2008). In 2015, {{the album was}} reissued on CD, LP record and <b>lossless</b> digital formats.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 {{the album}} was reissued, {{initially}} on vinyl record and a CD re-release in March, followed by a <b>lossless</b> digital release. Originally the band had planned on releasing a new studio album around March 2015, however could not do so due to bassist Kusakari's pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|On April24,2013, {{the video}} {{distribution}} company Section23 and the licensing company Sentai Filmworks announced their {{acquisition of the}} license and plans to release a digital version and the North American bilingual DVD and Blu-ray later in the year. The DVD and Blu-ray were both were released on August6,2013. The Blu-ray used 1080p AVC (Advanced Video Coding) with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 Widescreen and audio encoded with the <b>lossless</b> DTS-HD Master Audio codec. Its packaging did not include inserts or a reversible cover.|$|E
5|$|The Asus Xonar HDAV1.3 {{became the}} first HDMI sound card that {{implemented}} the Protected Audio Path and could both bitstream and decode <b>lossless</b> audio (Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD MA), although bitstreaming is only available if using the ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre software. It has an HDMI 1.3 input/output, and Asus says that it can work with most video cards on the market.|$|E
5|$|Campbell had {{previously}} utilised the condition {{discovered in the}} work of Oliver Heaviside for <b>lossless</b> transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using lumped component inductors (loading coils). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using ladder network topology using capacitors and inductors. Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. Sharper cut-offs and higher stop-band rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, Minaj was {{announced}} {{as the new}} face of the Roberto Cavalli spring/summer 2015 campaign. The campaign images, shot in Los Angeles by Italian photographer Francesco Carrozzini, see Minaj posing in flowy bohemian dresses, defined by embroideries and animal prints typical of the Cavalli brand. On March 30, 2015, it {{was announced}} that Minaj is a co-owner of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in <b>lossless</b> audio and high definition music videos. In addition to Minaj and company owner Jay Z, sixteen stakeholders including Beyoncé, Madonna, Rihanna and Kanye West own a 3% equity stake in the service.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Beyoncé {{became a}} co-owner, with other artists, {{of the music}} {{streaming}} service Tidal. The service specializes in <b>lossless</b> audio and high definition music videos. Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z acquired {{the parent company of}} Tidal, Aspiro, {{in the first quarter of}} 2015. Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.|$|E
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is <b>lossless,</b> there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the live albums Live on Two Legs, Live at Benaroya Hall, Live in NYC 12/31/92, Live at Easy Street, Live at the Gorge 05/06, Live at Lollapalooza 2007, Live on Ten Legs and myriad live versions of studio songs spread across singles as B-sides, the band has released an official bootlegs series of live recordings for each show of each tour since its 2000 European tour, {{with the exception of}} the 2004 Vote for Change tour and its 2007 European tour. The band has sold more than 3.5 millioncopies of shows since launching the bootleg series in 2000. For its 2000 and 2003 tours the bootlegs consisted of double-disc (and sometimes triple-disc) albums. The bootleg series switched over to MP3 format for the band's 2005 shows and expanded to include <b>lossless</b> FLAC format for its 2006 tour. Official bootlegs are available for the band's 2008 United States Tour and 2009 North American Tour in FLAC, MP3, and CD formats.|$|E
25|$|Besides lossy {{compression}} methods, <b>lossless</b> formats {{are a significant}} alternative to MP3 because they provide unaltered audio content, though with an increased file size compared to {{lossy compression}}. <b>Lossless</b> formats include FLAC (Free <b>Lossless</b> Audio Codec), Apple <b>Lossless</b> and many others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lossless</b> audio formats: These formats {{maintain}} the Hi-fi quality of every song or disc. These {{are the ones}} used by CDs, many people recommend the use of <b>lossless</b> audio formats to preserve the CD quality in audio files on a desktop. Some of them are: Apple <b>Lossless</b> (proprietary format) and FLAC (Royalties free) are increasingly popular formats for <b>lossless</b> compression, which {{maintain the}} Hi-fi quality.|$|E
25|$|Windows Media Audio <b>Lossless</b> (WMA <b>Lossless)</b> is a <b>lossless</b> {{audio codec}} that competes with ATRAC Advanced <b>Lossless,</b> Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, Shorten, Monkey's Audio, FLAC, Apple <b>Lossless,</b> and WavPack (Since late 2011, {{the last three}} have the {{advantage}} of being open source software and available for nearly any operating system.) Designed for archival purposes, it compresses audio signals without loss of quality from the original using VBR. When decompressed, the audio signal is an exact replica of the original. The first version of the codec, WMA 9 <b>Lossless,</b> and its revisions support up to 96kHz, 24-bit audio for up to 6 discrete channels (5.1 channel surround) with dynamic range compression control. The typical compression ratio for music varies between 1.7:1 and 3:1.|$|E
25|$|Apple <b>Lossless</b> (in version 6.5.1).|$|E
25|$|Dirac: {{a part of}} the {{specification}} of dirac covers <b>lossless</b> compression.|$|E
25|$|A deeper {{connection}} exists with finite-state gamblers (FSGs) {{and information}} <b>lossless</b> finite-state compressors (ILFSCs).|$|E
25|$|The LZMA <b>lossless</b> data {{compression}} algorithm combines Markov chains with Lempel-Ziv compression to achieve very high compression ratios.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} {{data for}} all 8×8 blocks is further compressed with a <b>lossless</b> algorithm, {{a variant of}} Huffman encoding.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, JPEG {{may not be}} as well suited for line {{drawings}} and other textual or iconic graphics, where the sharp contrasts between adjacent pixels can cause noticeable artifacts. Such images may be better saved in a <b>lossless</b> graphics format such as TIFF, GIF, PNG, or a raw image format. The JPEG standard actually includes a <b>lossless</b> coding mode, but that mode is not supported in most products.|$|E
25|$|JPEG's lossy {{compression}} also suffers from generation loss, where repeatedly decoding and re-encoding an image {{to save it}} again causes a loss of information each time, degrading the image. This does not happen with repeated viewing or copying, {{but only if the}} file is edited and saved over again. Because PNG is <b>lossless,</b> it is suitable for storing images to be edited. While PNG is reasonably efficient when compressing photographic images, there are <b>lossless</b> compression formats designed specifically for photographic images, <b>lossless</b> WebP and Adobe DNG (digital negative) for example. However these formats are either not widely supported, or are proprietary. An image can be stored losslessly and converted to JPEG format only for distribution, so that there is no generation loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} general-purpose, <b>lossless</b> {{compression}} algorithm used with TIFF is Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW). This compression technique, {{also used in}} GIF, was covered by patents until 2003. TIFF also supports the compression algorithm PNG uses (i.e. Compression Tag 000816 'Adobe-style') with medium usage and support by applications. TIFF also offers special-purpose <b>lossless</b> compression algorithms like CCITT Group IV, which can compress bilevel images (e.g., faxes or black-and-white text) better than PNG's compression algorithm.|$|E
25|$|A {{theoretical}} {{lower bound}} for the encoding bit rate for <b>lossless</b> data compression is the source information rate, {{also known as the}} entropy rate.|$|E
25|$|Compare to {{the version}} of DPCM used in <b>lossless</b> JPEG, and to the {{discrete}} wavelet transform using 1×2, 2×1, or (for the Paeth predictor) 2×2 windows and Haar wavelets.|$|E
25|$|PNG uses DEFLATE, a non-patented <b>lossless</b> data {{compression}} algorithm {{that uses a}} combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. Permissively-licensed DEFLATE implementations, such as zlib, are widely available.|$|E
25|$|The {{film and}} special {{features}} on the HD DVD version are presented in 2:35:1 Widescreen high definition 1080i and offer Dolby TrueHD 5.1 <b>lossless</b> and Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 audio options.|$|E
25|$|Even though PNG {{has been}} {{designed}} as a <b>lossless</b> format, PNG encoders can pre-process image data in a lossy fashion (so as to reduce colors used) to improve PNG compression.|$|E
25|$|In the Ogg {{multimedia}} framework, Theora {{provides a}} lossy video layer. The audio layer is most commonly {{provided by the}} music-oriented Vorbis format or its successor Opus. <b>Lossless</b> audio compression formats include FLAC, and OggPCM.|$|E
25|$|GIFs are {{suitable}} for sharp-edged line art (such as logos) with {{a limited number of}} colors. This takes advantage of the format's <b>lossless</b> compression, which favors flat areas of uniform color with well defined edges.|$|E
25|$|In March 2017, Google {{released}} the open source project Guetzli, which trades off {{a much longer}} encoding time for better appearance and smaller file size (similar to what Zopfli does for PNG and other <b>lossless</b> data formats).|$|E
25|$|Rotations {{where the}} image is not a {{multiple}} of 8 or 16, which value depends upon the chroma subsampling, are not <b>lossless.</b> Rotating such an image causes the blocks to be recomputed which results in loss of quality.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} Shuffle could play MP3, MP3 VBR, AAC, Protected AAC, Audible (formats 2, 3 and 4), WAV and AIFF. Due to its low processing power the only iTunes-supported file format that the iPod {{did not support}} is Apple <b>Lossless.</b>|$|E
25|$|Windows Media Audio (WMA) is {{the name}} of a series of audio codecs and their {{corresponding}} audio coding formats developed by Microsoft. It is a proprietary technology that forms part of the Windows Media framework. WMA consists of four distinct codecs. The original WMA codec, known simply as WMA, was conceived as a competitor to the popular MP3 and RealAudio codecs. WMA Pro, a newer and more advanced codec, supports multichannel and high resolution audio. A <b>lossless</b> codec, WMA <b>Lossless,</b> compresses audio data without loss of audio fidelity (the regular WMA format is lossy). WMA Voice, targeted at voice content, applies compression using a range of low bit rates. Microsoft has also developed a digital container format called Advanced Systems Format to store audio encoded by WMA.|$|E
25|$|The {{compression}} method is usually lossy, meaning that some original image information is lost and cannot be restored, possibly affecting image quality. There is an optional <b>lossless</b> mode {{defined in the}} JPEG standard. However, this mode is not widely supported in products.|$|E
25|$|The DC {{coefficients}} {{when taken}} together resemble a downscale {{version of the}} original image multiplied by a scaling factor. Well-known schemes for <b>lossless</b> coding of continuous-tone images can be applied, achieving somewhat better compression than the Huffman coded DPCM used in JPEG.|$|E
