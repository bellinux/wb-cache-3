50|$|The {{front fairing}} of the VF1000R was {{split into two}} pieces. These both {{attached}} to a metal bracket which ran {{around the perimeter of}} the engine. The <b>lower</b> <b>fairing</b> was held on primarily by the use of 6 quarter-turn, race type fasteners (3 per side) with the aid of 4 traditional bolts (2 per side). The bolts which held the <b>lower</b> <b>fairing</b> on at the connection to the upper fairing also went through holes in the upper fairing in order to ensure proper panel gaps and alignment. On models from 1985 and later, the <b>lower</b> <b>fairing</b> also featured spring-loaded vent doors which could be opened and closed in order to cool the engine and rider during high temperature conditions.|$|E

The major changes were a new frame, made of aluminum rather than steel, four-into-one exhaust system replacing the original four-into-two, new digital instrument panels, and a redesigned fairing/screen.

5000|$|In 1983 a new GPz1100 {{design was}} {{released}} that featured Unitrack single suspension, anti-dive units on the forks {{and a major}} styling overhaul often called the [...] "swish" [...] look.

This model contained many features that were {{to appear on the}} GPz900R model leading to the suspicion that it was used to test the acceptability of newer technology such as Unitrack and Anti-Dive forks and the newer styling. The 1983 model featured the same EFI design with a few small modifications, such as the inclusion of a warning light that flashed service codes when the DFI system was having a problem, a rev-limiter, and a 'limp' mode that would allow the engine to keep running if one of the sensors failed.|$|E

This paper seeks to investigate two major risk measures namely the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) {{in dealing with the}} risk capital allocation problem. Data from the London Stock exchange was used for this study. Assuming no dividends payment, the Geometric Brownian motion (Black-Scholes Model) and a fair per-unit capital allocation principle were applied to ascertain the coherence of the two considered risk measures within a two year time horizon.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of crop and revenue insurance policies sold in North America are single-crop policies that insure against low yields or low revenues for each crop grown on a particular farm. This practice of insuring one crop at a time runs counter to the traditional risk management practice of diversifying across several enterprises to avoid putting all of one’s eggs in a single basket. This paper examines {{the construction of a}} whole-farm crop revenue insurance program to include livestock price risk. The results show that at coverage levels of 95 % or <b>lower,</b> the <b>fair</b> insurance premiums for this product on a well-diversified Iowa farm are far <b>lower</b> than the <b>fair</b> premiums for the corn crop alone on the same farm. The calculation of premium rates for the whole-farm insurance product is derived from a method for imposing correlations first proposed by Iman and Conover in 1982. The potential income transfer from crop insurance is also examined. We find that the income transfer due to the subsidization of single-commodity policies is greater than the total premium for whole-farm policie...|$|R

50|$|Ross also {{proposed}} a major {{overhaul of the}} state’s personal income tax structure and said the plan {{would have to be}} phased in over time as allowed by the state’s finances. The total price tag of the restructuring would cost an estimated $574.5 million, according to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. Ross said his tax cut plan, when fully implemented, would cut income taxes by as much as $465 for incomes at $30,000; $665 at $40,000; $880 at $50,000; and, $1,148 at $75,000 and up. He proposed mimicking Gov. Mike Beebe’s phase-out of the sales tax on groceries as his blueprint for restructuring the tax code. Ross said, “I want to modernize our income tax code in a way that means <b>lower,</b> <b>fairer</b> taxes for working families and small businesses in Arkansas, and I want to do so in a fiscally responsible way that maintains our balanced budget and protects vital state services like education, Medicaid and public safety,” Ross said. “Just like Governor Beebe did with the sales tax on groceries, I will also gradually phase in my tax cut plan as the state can afford to do so.” The crux of Ross’ plan would be to retroactively index Arkansas income tax brackets taking a 1997 state law and applying it to the 1971 realignment of the tax code. Act 328 of 1997 tied state income tax brackets to inflation on a forward-going basis.|$|R

The paper shows that a linear tax on annuity payoffs, which raises more revenues from long-living individuals than from short-living, represents an appropriate instrument for redistribution, in addition to an optimally designed labour income tax. Further, we find that a nonlinear tax on annuity payoffs can be directly employed to correct the distortion of the rate of return caused by asymmetric information. These results are contrasted with theoretical findings concerning the role of a tax on capital income. optimum taxation, life annuities, adverse selection...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to start a national conversation on tax reform and invites submissions from the public. Foreword Australia has experienced {{nearly a quarter of}} a century of uninterrupted economic growth. As a result, Australians continue to have some of the highest living standards in the world. Over the next few decades, the challenge for Australia is to maintain and improve standards of living through economic growth. The recent Intergenerational Report shows that continuing steps to boost productivity and encourage higher workforce participation will be critical to driving future economic growth. Tax reform is a key part of the Government’s policy agenda to build jobs, growth and opportunity. Last year, the Government abolished the carbon and mining taxes, which were a drag on growth. We also announced changes to the taxation arrangements for employee share schemes to provide generous incentives for new start-ups. This year, we will deliver a package for small business to expand opportunities for Australian businesses and workers. The Government is committed to ensuring that everyone is paying their fair share of tax. This year, we are continuing to work with the G 20 on the modernisation of international tax rules to address tax avoidance by multinational companies. But that is just the start. We want to have an open and constructive conversation with the community on how we can create a better tax system that delivers taxes that are <b>lower,</b> simpler, <b>fairer.</b> To deliver lasting, workable reforms, the community needs to be on board and engaged in the conversation. That’s why the Government is committing to a comprehensive and inclusive process. Releasing this tax discussion paper marks the start of what we hope will be a broad conversation about the current tax system and the issues confronting it. All are encouraged to take part. This conversation will support the development of a tax system to build jobs, growth and opportunity — a better tax system to deliver taxes that are <b>lower,</b> simpler, <b>fairer.</b>   Submissions can be lodged until 1 June 2015...|$|R
