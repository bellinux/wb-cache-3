5|$|Ryder {{appeared}} in David Wain's comedy The Ten. The film centers around ten stories, each inspired {{by one of}} the Ten Commandments. The film debuted at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival on January 10, 2007, with a theatrical release on August 3, 2007. Ryder played the female lead opposite Wes Bentley and Ray Romano in Geoffrey Haley's 2008 offbeat romantic drama The <b>Last</b> <b>Word.</b> <b>In</b> 2009, she starred as a newscaster in the movie version of The Informers.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{had shown}} the {{potential}} of the Soviet armies to successfully conduct an offensive. This battle can be seen {{as one of the first}} major instances in which the Soviets attempted to preempt a German summer offensive. This later unfolded and grew as Stavka planned and conducted Operation Mars, Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn. Although only two of the three were victories, it still offers concise and telling evidence of the ability of the Soviets to turn the war in their favor. This finalised itself after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a positive effect on Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to have the <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> naming front commanders for instance). After the great purge in 1937, failing to anticipate the war in 1941, and underestimating German military power in 1942, Stalin finally fully trusted his military.|$|E

25|$|The new Elector, George William, who {{resided in}} Prussia, was appalled {{when he heard}} of his mother's {{independent}} action.

It was the Electress Dowager, however, who, in accordance with Hohenzollern family custom, had the <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> bestowing her daughter's hand in marriage. She sent Maria Eleonora to territory outside of George William's reach and concluded the marriage negotiations herself.|$|E

500|$|Two {{months after}} its {{completion}} in January 1910, Minas Geraes {{was featured in}} Scientific American, which described it as [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> heavy battleship design and the ... most powerfully armed warship afloat". In November 1910, Minas Geraes was {{the focal point of}} the Revolt of the Lash. The mutiny spread from Minas Geraes to other ships in the Navy, including its sister , the elderly coastal defense ship Deodoro, and the recently commissioned cruiser [...] Led by the [...] "Black Admiral" [...] João Cândido Felisberto, the mutineers threatened to bombard the Brazilian capital of Rio de Janeiro if their demands were not met. As it was not possible to end the situation militarily—the only loyal troops nearby being small torpedo boats and army troops confined to land—the National Congress of Brazil gave in and the rebels disbanded.|$|E
500|$|It was, however, {{difficult}} for the Air Force to do otherwise. Observation of the trail from the air was difficult at best. Human intelligence was provided by CIA-backed Laotian irregulars and Thai volunteers operating from {{the western side of}} the system while the eastern side was covered by SOG. [...] The depth of penetration by these reconnaissance efforts was hampered by the same man who had the <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> the bombing effort, Ambassador William H. Sullivan in Vientiane. The ambassador (with the full backing of the State Department and the CIA) maintained a firm hold over all military operations conducted within the supposedly [...] "neutral" [...] Kingdom of Laos. All targets had to be pre-approved either by Sullivan himself or by the air attaché within Project 404, the understaffed U.S. military operations center within the embassy.|$|E

500|$|The {{order for}} the dreadnoughts caused an {{immediate}} stir in the United States and Europe; {{in the words of}} the British Navy League Annual, they [...] "astonished the naval world". The American New York Times opened an article on Minas Geraes launch with [...] "What on paper at least is the most powerful warship ever built for any navy ...", while Scientific American called Minas Geraes [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> heavy battleship design and the ... most powerfully armed warship afloat." [...] Some publications, like the American Advocate of Peace, decried the dreadnought purchase for its cost, calling it [...] "a showy and pretentious naval policy seemingly for the sheer indulgence of national pride" [...] and continuing with [...] " [...] money into useless warships when, it is understood, foreign money has had to be borrowed for city improvements in Rio de Janeiro is pitiful politics." ...|$|E
500|$|Looking at how [...] "Steinman's old-fashioned teen-dream rock 'n' roll fantasies" [...] fits in {{with the}} music culture of 1993, Kerrang! {{suggests}} that it wouldn't appeal to [...] "Nirvana and Metallica fans, but there's an older generation of rockers out there who will, quite properly, worship this album." [...] Their four-star review declares that [...] "it {{is a work of}} genius, a ready made rock classic and arguably the <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> rock operas." [...] In The Tip Sheet, Jonathan King labelled it a [...] "glorious, splendid album," [...] celebrating Meat Loaf's [...] "operatically gorgeous" [...] voice and Steinman's [...] "superb" [...] songs, arrangements and production. [...] "You'll be blown away. Better still you'll catch yourself openly laughing out loud at times with delight. You know what to expect yet it's constantly better, fresher and brighter than you hope.

500|$|Olds {{was known}} for the extravagantly waxed (and decidedly non-regulation) {{handlebar}} moustache he sported in Vietnam. It was a common superstition among airmen to grow a [...] "bulletproof mustache", but Olds also used his as [...] "a gesture of defiance. The kids on base loved it. Most everybody grew a mustache." [...] Olds started the mustache {{in the wake of}} the success of Operation Bolo and let it grow beyond regulation length because [...] "It became the middle finger I couldn't raise in the PR photographs. The mustache became my silent <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> the verbal battles...with higher headquarters on rules, targets, and fighting the war." [...] Returning home, however, marked the end of this flamboyance. When he reported to his first interview with Air Force Chief of Staff General John P.

500|$|Between 1890 and 1907, the Ponds {{were the}} architects for the Hull House {{as the project}} {{expanded}} rapidly. [...] The first building they designed for Hull House was the Butler Art Gallery. [...] Built in 1891, the Butler Gallery was situated on the same lot as Hull House. [...] It consisted of a reading room, an exhibition hall that was [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> design and lighting for those days," [...] and a studio above. Numerous other building projects followed, including the original coffee house and gymnasium in 1893, the Children's Building in 1895, remodels and additions to the original building in 1895 and 1899, the Jane Club in 1898, a new Coffee House and Hull House Theater in 1899, the Hull House Apartments and Men's Club in 1901 and 1902, the Woman's Club (Bowen Hall) in 1904, the Boys' Club in 1906 and the Mary Crane Nursery in 1907. [...] The Pond brothers were affectionately known by residents of the Hull House complex as Allen the [...] "deep Pond" [...] and Irving the [...] "wide pond." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in life, when Cibber {{himself had}} the <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> casting at Drury Lane, he wrote, or patched together, several tragedies that were {{tailored}} to fit his continuing hankering after playing [...] "a Hero". However, his performances of such parts never pleased audiences, which {{wanted to see}} him typecast as an affected fop, a kind of character that fitted both his private reputation as a vain man, his exaggerated, mannered style of acting, and his habit of ad libbing. His most famous part {{for the rest of his}} career remained that of Lord Foppington in The Relapse, a sequel to Cibber's own Love's Last Shift but written by John Vanbrugh, first performed in 1696 with Cibber reprising his performance as Sir Novelty Fashion in the newly ennobled guise of Lord Foppington. Pope mentions the audience jubilation that greeted the small-framed Cibber donning Lord Foppington's enormous wig, which would be ceremoniously carried on stage in its own sedan chair. Vanbrugh reputedly wrote the part of Lord Foppington deliberately [...] "to suit the eccentricities of Cibber's acting style".|$|E
500|$|The Harriet Hoctor ballet {{music was}} scored by Con Conrad to lyrics written by Herb Magidson. The circus ballet was an {{adaptation}} {{from the old}} Ziegfeld stage shows. Variety called the Hoctor ballet [...] "in itself intricate with its maneuverings of six Russian wolfhounds in terp formations", {{and said that the}} [...] "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" [...] sequence in the film is a [...] "nifty Berlin tune [...] becomes the fulcrum for one of Frank Skinner's best arrangements as Arthur Lange batons the crescendos into a mad, glittering potpourri of Saint-Saëns and Gershwin, Strauss and Verdi, beautifully blended against the Berlinesque background. It's a scenic flash which makes the auditor wonder 'What can they do to follow that?' meaning in this or future film production." [...] Juan Antonio Ramírez refers to the wedding cake as a [...] "famous spiral column", citing it {{as one of the best}} known pieces of mobile architecture in film, but notes that in design the cake was not exclusive to The Great Ziegfeld, explaining that a wedding cake, albeit less flamboyant, had appeared in previous films such The King of Jazz (1930), The Kid from Spain (1932), Top Hat (1935), and Follow the Fleet (1935). Ramírez describes the film's Mise en scène as representing [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> flashy vulgarity, Surrealist kitsch, or perhaps both at once".|$|E
