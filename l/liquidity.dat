5|$|Most {{classical}} theories, including Fisher's, {{held that}} velocity was stable and independent of economic activity. Cambridge economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, began to challenge this assumption. They developed the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which looked at money demand {{and how it}} impacted the economy. The Cambridge theory did not assume that money demand and supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding more cash when the economy sagged. By factoring {{in the value of}} holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant steps toward the concept of <b>liquidity</b> preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate transactions and to maintain <b>liquidity.</b> In later work, Keynes added a third motive, speculation, to his <b>liquidity</b> preference theory and built on it to create his general theory.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November 2011, the ECB, the US Federal Reserve, {{the central}} banks of Canada, Japan, Britain and the Swiss National Bank {{provided}} global financial markets with additional <b>liquidity</b> {{to ward off}} the debt crisis and to support the real economy. The central banks agreed to lower the cost of dollar currency swaps by 50 basis points to come into effect on 5 December 2011. They also agreed to provide each other with abundant <b>liquidity</b> to make sure that commercial banks stay liquid in other currencies.|$|E
5|$|The European Central Bank (ECB) {{has taken}} a series of {{measures}} aimed at reducing volatility {{in the financial markets}} and at improving <b>liquidity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Through its Global Trade Finance Program, the IFC {{guarantees}} trade payment {{obligations of}} more than 200 approved banks in over 80 countries to mitigate risk for international transactions. The Global Trade Finance Program provides guarantees to cover payment risks for emerging market banks regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange, letters of credit, bid and performance bonds, supplier credit for capital goods imports, and advance payments. The IFC issued $3.46 billion in more than 2,800 guarantees in 2010, of which over 51% targeted IDA member nations. In its fiscal year 2011, the IFC issued $4.6 billion in more than 3,100 guarantees. In 2009, the IFC launched a separate program for crisis response, known as its Global Trade <b>Liquidity</b> Program, which provides <b>liquidity</b> for international trade among developing countries. Since its establishment in 2009, the Global Trade <b>Liquidity</b> Program assisted with over $15 billion in trade in 2011.|$|E
5|$|As the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the <b>liquidity</b> crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting {{in favor of the}} $700billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{and again}} during the 1950s, the {{relationship}} between the loanable funds doctrine and the <b>liquidity</b> preference theory were discussed at length. Some authors considered the two approaches as largely equivalent but this issue is still unresolved.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{standards}} for nonprofit financial statements are {{set by the}} Financial Accounting Standards Board. The Board's most recent proposal, announced to the public on April 22, 2015, could establish new {{standards for}} financial performance and <b>liquidity</b> information available to donors and lenders.|$|E
5|$|KPE {{disclosed}} in May 2008 {{that it had}} completed approximately $300 million of secondary sales of selected limited partnership interests in, and undrawn commitments to, certain KKR-managed funds in order to generate <b>liquidity</b> and repay borrowings.|$|E
5|$|Ofotbanen {{lost their}} license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 7 October 2008 at 12:00. This was because Ofotbanen had not {{documented}} necessary accounting for 2007, nor provided evidence of necessary <b>liquidity.</b> On 24 October, the company filed for bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|On 14 September 2007, the Northern Rock Bank {{sought and}} {{received}} a <b>liquidity</b> support facility from the Bank of England, following problems in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 2007–2010. The government took Northern Rock into public ownership in February 2008 {{as a result of}} its financial problems caused by the subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{from a small}} {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (which are also a form of external debt). Households also took on {{a large amount of}} debt, equivalent to 213% of disposable income, which led to inflation. This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing <b>liquidity</b> loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{macroeconomics}} {{can be said}} to {{have begun}} with Keynes and the publication of his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. Keynes expanded on the concept of <b>liquidity</b> preferences and built a general theory of how the economy worked. Keynes's theory was brought together both monetary and real economic factors for the first time, explained unemployment, and suggested policy achieving economic stability.|$|E
5|$|Ofotbanen {{lost their}} license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 7October 2008. This was because Ofotbanen had not {{documented}} necessary accounts for 2007, nor provided evidence of necessary <b>liquidity.</b> On 24October, {{the company was}} declared bankrupt. Rail Management subsequently established the new company Ofotbanen Drift, and stated {{that the cause of}} the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK10 million.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Fannie and Freddie, the FHFA had sued UBS and 17 other banks in July 2011 over mortgage-backed {{securities}} {{sold to the}} two government-sponsored enterprises that buy mortgages in the secondary market and repackage them as securities to boost <b>liquidity</b> in the mortgage business. The lawsuit claimed that UBS misrepresented the quality of mortgages sold to the two housing agencies for US$4.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|The IFC {{fulfills}} a treasury role {{by borrowing}} international capital to fund lending activities. It is usually {{one of the}} first institutions to issue bonds or to do swaps in emerging markets denominated in those markets' local currencies. The IFC's new international borrowings amounted to $8.8 billion in 2010 and $9.8 billion in 2011. The IFC Treasury actively engages in <b>liquidity</b> management in an effort to maximize returns and assure that funding for its investments is readily available while managing risks to the IFC.|$|E
5|$|The IFC's {{investment}} services consist of loans, equity, trade finance, syndicated loans, structured and securitized finance, client risk management services, treasury services, and <b>liquidity</b> management. In its fiscal year 2010, the IFC invested $12.7 billion in 528 projects across 103 countries. Of that total investment commitment, approximately 39% ($4.9 billion) was invested into 255 projects across 58 member {{nations of the}} World Bank's International Development Association (IDA).|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{made worse by}} the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary. As such, it was completely dependent on the Central Bank of Iceland for emergency loans of <b>liquidity,</b> and could not turn to the Bank of England for help. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special <b>liquidity</b> requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in the weeks before the crisis. However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and might even have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent. The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks ("parental upstreaming"). Landsbanki operated in Guernsey through a legally independent subsidiary.|$|E
5|$|Young was Great Southern's Executive Chairman when it {{listed on}} the Australian Stock Exchange in 1999, and co-founder Sewell {{remained}} in a full-time role until her retirement in February 2001. When the ASX200, a new stock exchange index comprising the top 200 Australian companies by market capitalisation and <b>liquidity,</b> was instituted in March 2000, Great Southern {{was one of the}} stocks included.|$|E
25|$|The SEC {{is giving}} money fund boards of {{directors}} the discretion whether to impose a <b>liquidity</b> fee if a fund’s weekly <b>liquidity</b> level falls below the required regulatory threshold, and/or to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to “gate” funds, under the same circumstances. These amendments will require all non-government money funds to impose a <b>liquidity</b> fee if the fund’s weekly <b>liquidity</b> level falls below a designated threshold, unless the fund’s board determines that imposing such a fee {{is not in the}} best interests of the fund.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even after}} sidelining CRR as an instrument, {{there was still}} less <b>liquidity</b> and skewedness in the market. And thus, on the {{recommendations}} of the Narsimham Committee Report (1998), The RBI brought together a <b>Liquidity</b> Adjustment Facility (LAF). It commenced in June, 2000, and it was set up to oversee <b>liquidity</b> on a daily basis and to monitor market interest rates. For the LAF, two rates are set by the RBI: repo rate and reverse repo rate. The repo rate is applicable while selling securities to RBI (daily injection of <b>liquidity),</b> while the reverse repo rate is applicable when banks buy back those securities (daily absorption of <b>liquidity).</b> Also, these interest rates fixed by the RBI also help in determining other market interest rates.|$|E
25|$|Capital flight {{can cause}} <b>liquidity</b> crises in {{directly}} affected countries {{and can cause}} related difficulties in other countries involved in international commerce such as shipping and finance. Asset holders may be forced into distress sales. Borrowers typically face higher loan costs and collateral requirements, compared to periods of ample <b>liquidity,</b> and unsecured debt {{is nearly impossible to}} obtain. Typically, during a <b>liquidity</b> crisis, the interbank lending market stalls.|$|E
25|$|Krugman {{has done}} much to revive {{discussion}} of the <b>liquidity</b> trap as a topic in economics. He recommended pursuing aggressive fiscal policy and unconventional monetary policy to counter Japan's lost decade in the 1990s, arguing {{that the country was}} mired in a Keynesian <b>liquidity</b> trap. The debate he started at that time over <b>liquidity</b> traps and what policies best address them continues in the economics literature.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve {{introduced}} {{a number of}} short-term credit and <b>liquidity</b> facilities to help stabilize markets. Some of the transactions under these facilities provided <b>liquidity</b> to institutions whose disorderly failure could have severely stressed an already fragile financial system.|$|E
25|$|India {{experiences}} large capital inflows every day, {{and even}} though the OMO and the LAF policies were able to withhold the inflows, another instrument was needed to keep the <b>liquidity</b> intact. Thus, on the recommendations of the Working Group of RBI on instruments of Sterilization (December, 2003), a new scheme known as the Market stabilization scheme (MSS) was set up. The LAF and the OMO’s were dealing with day-to-day <b>liquidity</b> management, whereas the MSS was set up to sterilize the <b>liquidity</b> absorption and make it more enduring.|$|E
25|$|The studies {{confirm what}} the {{marketplace}} knows intuitively: Investors covet <b>liquidity</b> and loathe obstacles that impair <b>liquidity.</b> Prudent investors buy illiquid investments {{only when there}} is a sufficient discount in the price to increase the rate of return to a level which brings risk-reward back into balance.|$|E
25|$|A {{detailed}} {{financial and}} <b>liquidity</b> analysis is needed.|$|E
25|$|The FDIC {{created the}} Temporary <b>Liquidity</b> Guarantee Program (TLGP) to {{strengthen}} confidence and encourage <b>liquidity</b> {{in the banking}} system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount.|$|E
25|$|Through its {{discount}} window and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide <b>liquidity</b> to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer term <b>liquidity</b> {{may also be}} provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate).|$|E
25|$|As with reserves, {{other sources}} of <b>liquidity</b> are managed with targets.|$|E
25|$|To perform {{stress testing}} and {{scenario}} analysis, the observed data {{needs to be}} altered, e.g. some payments delayed or removed. To analyze the levels of <b>liquidity,</b> initial <b>liquidity</b> levels are varied. System comparisons (benchmarking) or evaluations of new netting algorithms or rules are performed by running simulations with a fixed set of data and varying only the system setups.|$|E
25|$|Secondary buyouts may {{generate}} <b>liquidity</b> {{more quickly}} than other routes (i.e., IPOs).|$|E
25|$|Exceeding $110.2 million {{must have}} a <b>liquidity</b> ratio of 10% of NTAs.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} credit crunch presented the first challenge to AIB— namely a dramatic fall-off in <b>liquidity.</b> As AIB depends {{to a significant}} extent on the international financial markets for <b>liquidity</b> due to an insufficient deposit base, this has impacted the bank severely. The Irish government stepped in with a guarantee which effectively granted a triple A rating on AIB debt, thus freeing up its access to finance.|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{treasury}} {{is responsible}} for an investment bank's funding, capital structure management, and <b>liquidity</b> risk monitoring.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of this difference, while Krugman suggests using monetary policy to manage the economy, and resolving a <b>liquidity</b> trap by creating inflationary expectations to make saving less desirable, Miller suggests using fiscal policy to manage the economy (matching administrative debt to desired private savings), and resolving a <b>liquidity</b> trap by issuing more scrip, hence increasing the administrative debt, to fund this desired saving.|$|E
25|$|There will be {{financing}} and investing {{relationship with the}} U.S. Treasury via three different financing facilities to provide critically needed support to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and also to the <b>liquidity</b> of the mortgage market. One of the three facilities is a secured <b>liquidity</b> facility, which will be not only for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, {{but also for the}} 12 Federal Home Loan Banks that are regulated by FHFA.|$|E
