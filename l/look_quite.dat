25|$|Banknotes in {{circulation}} are 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 manat. They {{were designed by}} Austrian Robert Kalina, who also designed the current banknotes of the euro and the Syrian Pound. Therefore, the notes <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> {{similar to those of}} the euro and the choice of motifs was inspired by the euro banknotes.|$|E
25|$|In combat, Marines {{will also}} wear {{one of two}} {{ballistic}} vests: the Outer Tactical Vest and the newer Modular Tactical Vest, {{as well as the}} Lightweight Helmet (replacing the PASGT helmet) and Improved Load Bearing Equipment. Marines in a combat area may also wear Flame resistant organizational gear, or FROG uniforms. These combat uniforms are designed to reduce fire-related injuries, and <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> similar to the MCCUU. Other individual equipment may be worn as directed.|$|E

25|$|New Delhi is {{particularly}} {{renowned for its}} beautifully landscaped gardens that can <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> stunning in spring. The largest of these include Buddha Jayanti Park and the historic Lodi Gardens. In addition, there are the gardens in the Presidential Estate, the gardens along the Rajpath and India Gate, the gardens along Shanti Path, the Rose Garden, Nehru Park and the Railway Garden in Chanakya Puri. Also of note is the garden adjacent to the Jangpura Metro Station near the Defence Colony Flyover, as are the roundabout and neighbourhood gardens throughout the city.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{designs were}} adapted to local {{circumstances}} and available building materials such that, outwardly, two pillboxes {{of the same}} basic design could <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> different. The height of a pillbox could vary significantly according to local needs: some were half buried so that the embrasures might be as low as ground level, others were raised up to give a better view; those built into hillsides might lack embrasures on some walls; the entrance could be moved and its size varied as might be convenient {{and there may be}} additional walls to protect the entrance, a free standing blast wall or a steel door.|$|E
25|$|The {{index of}} a {{differential}} operator {{is closely related}} to the number of independent solutions (more precisely, it is the differences of the numbers of independent solutions of the differential operator and its adjoint). There are many hard and fundamental problems in mathematics that can easily be reduced to the problem of finding the number of independent solutions of some differential operator, so if one has some means of finding the index of a differential operator these problems can often be solved. This is what the Atiyah–Singer index theorem does: it gives a formula for the index of certain differential operators, in terms of topological invariants that <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> complicated but are in practice usually straightforward to calculate.|$|E

25|$|Many locals say Orang Pendek's feet {{look like}} those of a child, {{evidenced}} by foot prints they have found while walking through the forest. However, another local animal, the sun bear, is a possible source of these sightings. Bears in general are known for having feet that <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> human-like, and the size of a sun bear's {{are similar to those of}} a child. In addition, gibbons populate the forests in this area and are known to occasionally descend to the ground and walk for a few seconds at a time on two legs. Witnesses could possibly be seeing orangutans; however: 1) this species has long been thought to have died out in all but the northern regions of Sumatra and 2) witnesses almost never describe the animal as having orange fur.|$|E
25|$|Some 4% of the {{population}} are German-speaking Mennonite farmers and craftsmen. The vast majority are so-called Russian Mennonites of German descent who settled in the Russian Empire during the 18th and 19th centuries. Most Russian Mennonites live in Mennonite settlements like Spanish Lookout, Shipyard, Little Belize, and Blue Creek. These Mennonites speak Plautdietsch (a German dialect) in everyday life, but use mostly Standard German for reading (the Bible) and writing. The Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites came mostly from Mexico {{in the years after}} 1958. There are also some mainly Pennsylvania German-speaking Old Order Mennonites who came from the United States and Canada in the late 1960s. They live primarily in Upper Barton Creek and associated settlements. These Mennonites attracted people from different Anabaptist backgrounds who formed a new community. They <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> similar to Old Order Amish, but are different from them.|$|E
500|$|The {{immersive}} gaming {{experience and}} the interactive environment were cited by several reviewers as being revolutionary. AllGame said, [...] "It isn't everyday that you come across a game that totally revolutionizes an entire genre, but Half-Life has done just that". Hot Games commented on the realism of the game, and how the environment [...] "all {{adds up to a}} totally immersive gaming experience that makes everything else <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> shoddy in comparison". Gamers Depot found the game engaging, stating that they have [...] "yet to play a more immersive game period".|$|E

500|$|On August 3, 2011, contestants Ricky Jaime and Sasha Mallory {{danced to}} [...] "Schoolin Life" [...] in Top 6 Perform {{round of the}} eighth season of the American {{television}} reality program and dance competition So You Think You Can Dance. Their dance performance was choreographed by Kumari Suraj. Gwen Orel of The Wall Street Journal further described their performance during a review of that episode of the show: [...] "He's in a fedora, and she's got a cute short swingy sheer skirt, with thigh high stockings and a garter belt, and a sheer purple blouse. I don’t get what this style really is, {{it seems to have}} a lot of arm movements, and some crouching jumps. He doesn’t <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> sharp enough next to her. His split leap is phenomenal." ...|$|E
500|$|Metro complimented the visuals of the remaster, {{saying that}} [...] "The game still doesn't <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> {{as good as}} the last couple of Call Of Duty's, but it's {{extremely}} close. And whatever else you say about it, on a presentational level this is an excellent remaster." [...] The multiplayer they praised for being more pleasingly simple than recent Call of Duty games and pointed out how it was sure to bring considerable nostalgia to players of the original, but nonetheless criticized it for feeling limited and shallow. They also noted that the remaster inadvertently felt clichéd and overfamiliar, due to the original having inspired numerous sequels and imitations, but praised the modern-day setting as feeling surprisingly fresh again. Metro summarized their review by saying [...] "One of the most influential video games of all time gets the remaster it deserves, and is still impressively entertaining after all these years." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord Somers, {{following}} his dismissal as Lord Chancellor, introduced an Act in 1706 which [...] "became {{the most important}} act of law reform which the 18th century produced". The Act significantly amended the existing law and court procedure, and while {{most of it was}} aimed at the common-law courts, it did affect the Chancery. For equity, the Act provided that a party trying to have his case dismissed could not do so until he had paid the full costs, rather than the nominal costs that were previously required; at the same time, the reforms the Act made to common-law procedure (such as allowing claims to be brought against executors of wills) reduced the need for parties to go to equity for a remedy. Legal historian Wilfrid Prest writes that despite these legislative enactments, the tally of which [...] "begins to <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> impressive", the old problems continued, albeit less frequently; one barrister of the time claimed that going to the Court with a case worth anything less than £500 was a waste of time.|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where I see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Biologists from Darwin onwards [...] have puzzled {{over how}} [...] whose adult members look {{extraordinarily}} alike, and distinctively {{different from the}} members of other species. Lions and leopards are, for instance, both large carnivores that inhabit the same general environment, and hunt much the same prey, but <b>look</b> <b>quite</b> different.

2500|$|After a hard {{winter of}} 1856–57, and a wet spring, {{construction}} resumed in July 1857. Sandstone {{was used for}} the first twenty five vertical feet of each tower base. Limestone encased this sandstone, acting as an armor covering against the constant flow of water and the accidental collision with watercraft. The remaining height of each tower was to be constructed of sandstone, rough cut and with a large draft. Roebling said this gave the towers [...] "a massive <b>look,</b> <b>quite</b> suitable to their function." ...|$|E
