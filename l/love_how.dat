[...] In a review of the sixth season of The Simpsons, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide writes: [...] "I especially like the contrasts between how Bart and Lisa accept the strike. The show doesn’t quite manage to soar consistently, but it has more than enough to make it positive." [...] In his review of the episode for TV Squad, Adam Finley comments: [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>how</b> Bart and Lisa both handle the news differently. Bart is thrilled ... Lisa, on the other hand, can't handle not being graded and evaluated every day, and slowly begins to lose her mind." ...|$|E

He is a hero, but heroes are inherently incautious." [...] Weiss added, [...] "At {{the end of the}} day, Jon is his father’s son, he’s a person who’s honorable to a fault and does the right thing even when the right thing is extremely dangerous to him personally." [...] In the June 2015 season 5 finale [...] "Mother's Mercy", Jon is stabbed to death by Alliser Thorne and several men of the Night's Watch after being labeled a traitor. With Martin's 2011 novel A Dance with Dragons vague on Jon's fate, Harington confirmed the character's death in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying [...] "I’ve been told I’m dead. I’m dead. I’m not coming back next season." [...] He added, [...] "I loved how they brought [...] Olly in to be the person who kills me.

500|$|... "Stay High" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as an alternative EDM track. Its instrumentation consists of a [...] "soft" [...] bass beat, and Lo's [...] "distorted" [...] vocals. Tyler Almodovar of Raver Rafting noted that the track [...] "is relatively simple, with most of the focus directed at the ethereal vocals" [...] provided by Lo. For the remix, Hippie Sabotage increased the speed and the pitch of the original track, and reworked Lo's vocals. [...] Digital Spy's Amy Davidson said that the lyrics talk about a [...] "decadent devotion to a night 'where the fun ain't got no end'". Miles Raymer of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the remix shared [...] "a similar theme of getting through emotional struggles with copious amounts of chemical assistance" [...] with the original version, although feeling that the latter was [...] "more bluntly honest". In an interview with PopBytes, Lo told that [...] "I just <b>love</b> <b>how</b> [...] made a proper dance remix of the song, but it still has that darkness to it. It’s just the way that they used all the parts. They did a genius job on it." ...|$|E

Bryant also praised the story arc between Torres and Robbins, adding: [...] "I really like how honest Arizona is with Callie, {{and the way she}} puts the firecracker in her place." [...] He was {{positive}} of Leigh's performance, writing: [...] "Chyler Leigh gave a powerful performance in this episode. Her speech to Meredith was a little overwritten, but she almost made you forget that with her emotion. And the bond that is growing between Lexie and Meredith is nice to see. From Meredith finally saying out loud how she feels about Lexie, to Lexie being at Mer's side when she wakes up, I am really glad to see these sisters' happy." [...] Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post gave a positive review of the episode, commenting: [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>how</b> Grey's Anatomy can bounce between serious and hysterical moments. Old people wanting penile implants, bears attacking a groggy Alex, counterbalanced with Mercy West drama, Cristina being ignored, and Lexie's father arriving at the hospital hacking blood."

500|$|The guest {{performances}} made by Kathy Griffin and Loretta Devine {{were met}} with mixed reception from several critics. Amy Reiter was more critical on Griffin's performance as Tammy Jean Albertson, and noted [...] "while Kathy Griffin was sight-gag funny as local tea party candidate Tammy Jean Albertson [...] her lines fell a bit flat." [...] She went on to praise Devine's performance as Sister Mary Constance, saying that her lines [...] "totally hit the bull's-eye." [...] Robert Canning praised both performances, {{saying that it was}} {{the best part of the}} episode. He continued, [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>how</b> the guest judge segments of these contest episodes are beginning to become mini-series unto themselves. I hope that tradition continues." [...] James Poniewozik had mixed feelings regarding Griffin's performance. He went on to write, [...] "Glee can be sharp and topical enough that I thought it could actually do something clever with the much-publicized cameo. Instead, the performance hinged on expected gags [...] and Griffin delivered it all with a stiffness that felt more like a recitation than a performance." [...] Todd VanDerWerff reacted negatively to both performances. In his review of the episode, he opined, [...] "That judges’ scene [...] was a pale retread of the original, only this time, it had Kathy Griffin and Loretta Devine, as well as a bunch of tired Tea Party gags that were tired when this episode was written." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, the {{recording}} finds Spears [...] " [...] {{through the early}} throes of love." [...] Adam R. Holz of Plugged In claimed that the song is [...] "about Spears and a partner 'bangin' all over [...] bedroom,' which {{can be seen in}} the lines, [...] "Clumsy, bangin' all over this bedroom again and again." [...] Sasha Geffen of MTV added that during the track, Spears shows off her [...] "flirty side" [...] with lines like, [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>how</b> you go down." [...] Spin Andrew Unterberger explained that the lyrics of [...] "Clumsy" [...] "offer varying degrees of double-entendred literalness within the clumsiness conceit, as Britney’s lack of physical dexterity leads to her 'slippin’ off this dress." [...] Writing for Bustle, Alexis Rhiannon noticed that the text of {{the recording}} is [...] "frankly pretty filthy" [...] and [...] "also essentially a description of pure sex." [...] For the pre-chorus, Spears sings, [...] "Call me a fool/ Call me insane/ But don't call it a thing/ Closer to you/ Closer to pain/ It's better than far away", following which she repeats [...] "clumsy" [...] as a hook. During every breakdown of the track, the singer [...] "playfully squeals", [...] "Oops!", making reference to her 2000 song [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again". Throughout the track, Spears delivers vocals in her [...] "nasal come-on tone" [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Jon Blistein. The critic furthermore opined that the song [...] "marks a rhythmic, almost swing-inspired turn for Spears." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the track}} for AOL Radio Blog, Voerding wrote [...] "Michele's voice {{is among the}} cast's most versatile, striding {{confidently}} through growls and whispers, proclamations and wavering cries.

[...] Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called Michele's voice on the song [...] "phenomenal," [...] and commented [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>how</b> her vocals are reined in, and then build up to that wonderful glory note. I seriously got chills while listening to it." [...] She also commented how the song's narrative fit Michele's storyline on the show. Christopher Rosen of Movieline wrote [...] "If you love Lea Michele’s voice, you’ll like [...] "Get It Right." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator said [...] "This one, compared to the instantly catchy “Loser Like Me”, {{is a bit more}} underwhelming, though Lea kills it." [...] Jarret Wieselman of The New York Post said [...] "Lea Michele's voice was on point throughout this soaring ballad, but without that secret ingredient, lyrics like [...] "my best intentions keep making a mess of things" [...] are best left to Rachel's diary." [...] Although she called it [...] "boring" [...] and said it was like every other reflection-ballad performed by Michele, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone said that the song would fit in on Top 40 radio. Melinda Newman of HitFix said the song was [...] "lovely, but a bit dull." ...|$|E

While Canning also noted the shift in tone [...] "from despicable Sue to cartoony evil Sue", he enjoyed her [...] "attempt to hijack Secret Santa", and said it was [...] "another fun reason to love to hate Sue Sylvester". Hankinson felt that the Grinch was [...] "the perfect touchstone for the heartless Ms. Sylvester and Jane Lynch's lanky frame made the physical humor (think gliding around the base of the tree on her belly) really sing." [...] Poniewozik called Sue's transformation [...] "pretty amusing to watch", admitted that he doubted he would [...] "have been able to resist the urge to put the rangy Jane Lynch in that classic role" [...] and called Brittany as Cindy Lou Who [...] "unexpected, clever and surprisingly touching". Several reviewers commented favorably on Becky playing Max, including Canning, who wrote [...] "it was all worth it to realize Becky is and always will be the Max to Sue's Grinch", and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack declared, [...] "I totally <b>love</b> <b>how</b> Becky is becoming Sue’s little minion.

500|$|Connor’s {{characterization}} {{and main}} storyline {{with his father}} in season three and four received mixed reviews. Ben from thescifichristian.com was not fond of the initial episodes with baby Connor because Angel wasted time “baby-talking,” but he loved the development with teenage Connor, “The [...] season ends with a great storyline as Connor returns [...] and betrays Angel.” Jes Battis praised the father/son dynamics and described as “highly dramatic and (engagingly perverse)”. Journalist Sarah D. Bunting called Connor [...] "a frustrating character" [...] and wrote that while she [...] "gets where he is coming from" [...] and his ”twitchy, PTSD-ish interactions ring true", they become old too quick {{due to lack of}} real development of character and the relationship with Angel for most of season four. Kartheiser himself expressed this development concern, but he said that [...] "Towards {{the end of the season}} I was really happy about the chances I was getting." [...] This last statement is echoed in Jamie Pool's review, who called the “ending” to Connor [...] "emotionally satisfying", despite noting him to not have been particularly endearing through most of the remaining season. S.Wiebe of eclipsemagazine.com, described Connor’s overall characterization [...] "sharp" [...] with [...] "really intriguing sub-textual material" [...] and among the saving graces of the season. Strega of Television Without Pity, also praised the character's psychology, [...] "The thing I like most is that they've not only created a teenager who doesn't just feel like he's the most alienated person in the world -- he actually is," [...] and [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>how</b> unloved Connor [...] is…” Jean Lorrah described the Darla-Angel-Connor-Jasmine arc as [...] "surely one of the most ambitious story arcs any television show has ever attempted“ Stacey Abbott of PopMatters called the Darla-Angel-Connor storyline [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "pure family melodrama".

500|$|Magnus [...] "adores her {{daughter}} Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance – but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction". Tapping {{has said that}} there is a [...] "huge amount of respect" [...] between the two characters, adding [...] "Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't." [...] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive {{her daughter}}. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated [...] "I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to come a time when he's going to become a bit jaded... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect." [...] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>how</b> this relationship has developed. [...] "It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary." [...] Dunne meanwhile stated [...] "there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of." ...|$|E

It just flew out of my mouth and came out in lyrics [...] I had great writers involved." [...] While recording her vocals, Rowland was inspired by several singers, citing former bandmate Beyoncé Knowles, and singers Brandy and Whitney Houston as major inspirations, [...] "I listened to a lot of Whitney Houston for her vocals.

2500|$|Spector {{commissioned}} Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil {{to write}} a song for the group, bringing them over from New York to Los Angeles {{to stay at the}} Chateau Marmont Hotel so they could write the song. Taking a cue from [...] "Baby I Need Your Loving" [...] by The Four Tops that was then rising in the charts, Mann and Weil decided {{to write a}} ballad. Mann wrote the melody first, and came up with the opening line [...] "You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips", influenced by a line from the song [...] "I <b>Love</b> <b>How</b> You Love Me" [...] that was co-written by Mann - [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>how</b> your eyes close whenever you kiss me". Mann and Weil wrote the first two verses quickly, including the chorus line [...] "you've lost that lovin' feelin'", and Spector added [...] "gone, gone, gone, whoa, whoa, whoa" [...] {{to the end of the}} chorus, which Weil disliked. [...] The line [...] "you've lost that lovin' feelin'" [...] was originally only intended to be a dummy line that would be replaced later, but Spector liked it and decided to keep it. The form of the song is of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus or ABABCB form. [...] Mann and Weil had problems writing the bridge and the ending, and asked Spector for help. Spector experimented on the piano with a [...] "Hang On Sloopy" [...] riff that they would then use to build on for the bridge.|$|E
