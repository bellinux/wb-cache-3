Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal; it came in a 4–0 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November. The season ended sourly, however, as Shearer was forced to miss January through to May due to injury and England's World Cup qualification chances were hit by a run of poor form.|$|E
5|$|With Warnock {{replacing}} Ternent as Bury {{manager and}} Ternent {{moving on to}} manage Burnley, this signalled a return to Turf Moor for Swan. Ternent moved Swan back into defence, but could only give him eleven starts and six substitute appearances following a combination of suspensions, illness and injury.

5|$|An {{upper body}} injury forced Tanguay {{out of the}} Flames' line-up for 15 games in 2011–12. The team never {{identified}} the injury, which was speculated to be a concussion. He still finished third in team scoring, with 49 points in 64 games. Tanguay again finished third in team scoring in the lock-out-shortened 2012–13 NHL season, scoring 27 points in 40 games. On February 2, 2013, in a 3–2 shoot-out defeat to the Chicago Blackhawks, Tanguay registered his 500th career assist on a Dennis Wideman goal. His season was again impacted by injury, as he missed the Flames' final games of the campaign after suffering a sprained medial collateral <b>ligament</b> <b>in</b> {{a game against the}} Phoenix Coyotes.|$|E
5|$|Despite much {{speculation}} that Henry {{would lose the}} All Black coaching job to coach Robbie Deans, he was retained on a contract {{for the next two}} years, later extended to include the 2011 World Cup. He immediately stated that he would retain McCaw as his captain. Robbie Deans instead signed with the Australian Rugby Union, becoming head coach of Australia. In Deans' last season (2008) as Crusaders coach they won the Super Rugby title for the seventh time.

5|$|From 2004 to 2009, Nathan was {{considered}} one of the top closers in Major League Baseball (MLB) with four All-Star appearances and a league-leading 246 saves. In 2010, Nathan underwent Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ulnar collateral <b>ligament</b> <b>in</b> his throwing elbow and missed the entire season. On April 3, 2011, Nathan recorded his first save since his injury against the Toronto Blue Jays and later that year in July, Nathan regained the role as closer. On August 10, 2011, he became the Twins all-time leader in saves with his 255th in a game against the Boston Red Sox. After the 2011 season, Nathan left the Twins via free agency to sign with the Texas Rangers, becoming an All-Star again in 2012 and 2013. On April 8, 2013, he earned his 300th save.

5|$|In {{the third}} {{game of the}} 1992 season, Majkowski injured a <b>ligament</b> <b>in</b> his ankle against the Cincinnati Bengals, an injury severe enough {{that he would be}} out for four weeks. Favre {{replaced}} Majkowski {{for the remainder of the}} game. Favre fumbled four times during the course of the game, a performance poor enough that the crowd chanted for Favre to be removed in favor of another Packers backup quarterback at the time, Ty Detmer. However, down 23–17 with 1:07 left in the game, the Packers started an offensive series on their own 8-yard line. Favre then completed a 42-yard pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe. Three plays later, Favre threw the game–winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Kitrick Taylor with 13 seconds remaining.|$|E
5|$|Josefson {{participated in}} the {{pre-season}} camp with the Devils in September, but was assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Albany Devils after the camp. Josefson was called up to the Devils on 14 October 2010, and made his NHL debut the next day, in a 3–2 victory against Colorado Avalanche at the Prudential Center. Josefson was slashed on {{his left hand and}} later fell on the same hand during the game against San Jose Sharks on 27 October, this caused a <b>ligament</b> <b>in</b> his thumb to tear, and forced him to undergo surgery. At last, Josefson returned from his injury on 7 January 2011, when the Albany Devils played against the Charlotte Checkers. Josefson scored his first NHL goal against Al Montoya of the New York Islanders on 12 March 2011. The Devils failed to reach the playoffs and Josefson ended up with three goals and ten points in 28 regular season games.|$|E
5|$|Simms' {{next four}} years were marred by {{injuries}} and inconsistent play. He finished the 1980 season with 15 touchdowns and 19 interceptions, while completing a subpar 48.0% of his passes for 2,321yards. In 1981, Simms threw for 2,031yards, 11 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions on 54.4% completion percentage before suffering a separated shoulder in a November 15 loss to the Washington Redskins. With Simms out, the Giants went on a run led by Scott Brunner and advanced to {{the second round of}} the playoffs. Simms suffered a torn knee <b>ligament</b> <b>in</b> a preseason game against the New York Jets, preventing him from playing the entire 1982 season. Following the season, Ray Perkins resigned as head coach to take over the same position at the University of Alabama, and was replaced by the team's defensive coordinator Bill Parcells. In the coming years this change would prove crucial to the Giants and Simms.|$|E

5|$|The Stone has {{suffered}} repeated desecrations and damage {{over the course}} of time. It {{is said to have been}} struck and smashed to pieces by a stone fired from a catapult during the Umayyad Caliphate's siege of Mecca in 683. The fragments were rejoined by Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr using a silver <b>ligament.</b> <b>In</b> January 930, it was stolen by the Qarmatians, who carried the Black Stone away to their base in Hajar (modern Eastern Arabia). According to Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din, writing in 1857, the Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir al-Jannabi set the Black Stone up in his own mosque, the Masjid al-Dirar, with the intention of redirecting the hajj away from Mecca. However, this failed, and pilgrims continued to venerate the spot where the Black Stone had been.|$|E
5|$|Though Shuey {{struggled}} upon {{joining the}} Dodgers, recording a 9.35 ERA {{in his first}} eleven appearances after the trade, he altered his approach and began to obtain better results, allowing no runs in his next five appearances. Shuey played for the Dodgers {{through the end of}} the 2003 season. During spring training prior to the 2004 season, he tore a <b>ligament</b> <b>in</b> his thumb and reinjured his hip while fielding a bunt during his rehabilitation. Shuey spent the entire season on the disabled list. The Dodgers sued the Hartford Life Insurance Company, who insured Shuey's contract, over Shuey's $3.25 million salary for the 2004 season, saying the insurance company did not honor their claim.|$|E
5|$|After the 1988 season, the Brewers added Bates {{to their}} winter roster as the 1989 season approached. However, when 12-year Brewer second baseman Jim Gantner re-signed with the club, Bates was demoted to Denver, and the Journal-Sentinel {{predicted}} {{that he would}} remain there due to his limited defensive versatility. Bates began the season with the Zephyrs and in July {{was named to the}} Triple-A All-Star Game. On the MLB level, the Brewers suffered multiple injuries to starting players, having 9 athletes on the disabled list (DL) on August 22 and 14 total players on the DL up to that point. In a game against the New York Yankees on August 15, Gantner played at second base as the Brewers tried to hold on to a 1–0 lead. With Marcus Lawton on first base, Yankees batter Wayne Tolleson hit a ground ball to shortstop Bill Spiers for a potential double play. Lawton ran into Gantner, who had trouble fielding a low throw from Spiers; umpire Dave Phillips called both Lawton and Tolleson out due to Lawton's illegal roll-block, but Gantner tore the medial collateral <b>ligament</b> <b>in</b> his left knee and was placed on the DL. Bates was called up as his replacement.|$|E
