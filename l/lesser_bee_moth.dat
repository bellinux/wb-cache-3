50|$|Aphomia sociella, the <b>bee</b> <b>moth,</b> {{is a small}} moth of {{the family}} Pyralidae. It is native to Europe, but may be found synanthropically outside its {{original}} range.|$|R
50|$|Aphomia terrenella, the terrenella <b>bee</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of the Pyralidae family. It {{is found}} in North America from Michigan, Ontario, Quebec and New York south to Georgia.|$|R
50|$|The word {{pollinator}} {{is often}} used when pollenizer is more precise. A pollinator is the biotic agent that moves the pollen, such as <b>bees,</b> <b>moths,</b> bats, and birds. Bees are thus {{often referred to as}} 'pollinating insects'.|$|R

50|$|The {{flowers are}} strong smelling and produce copious nectar and are visited by <b>bees,</b> <b>moths</b> and {{sunbirds}} {{but none of}} these are big enough to pollinate it. At times of year when fruit is not available, the Madagascan fruit bat feeds on nectar and has been observed to visit the flowers of A. suarezensis and the kapok tree Ceiba pentandra. This bat is believed to be a significant pollinator of the flowers of these trees.|$|R
50|$|Yellow house bats are fond {{of small}} insects. Depending on the {{habitats}} at the different regions, yellow house bats have different food preys. They prefer to feed on airborne insects, hymenopterans and dipterans, {{which can be found}} under the canopies of tall trees and riparian forests at nights. Small insects such as wasps, <b>bees,</b> <b>moths,</b> and beetles are all fearful of yellow house bats. Larger soft-bodied insects can also become yellow house bats' food.|$|R
50|$|The tree is a {{food plant}} for the larvae of some species of hawk moths {{such as the}} Oriental <b>Bee</b> Hawk <b>moth,</b> Cephonodes hylas.|$|R
50|$|The stamens borne on the hypanthium are the pollen-producing {{reproductive}} organs of the flower. The hypanthium helps {{in many ways}} with the reproduction and cross pollination pathways of most plants. It provides weather protection and a medium to sustain the lost pollen, increasing the probability of fertility and cross-pollination. The retained pollen can then attach to pollinators such as birds, <b>bees,</b> <b>moths,</b> beetles, bats, butterflies and other animals. Wind can act as an instigator for fertilisation. The hypanthium is also an adaptive feature for structural support. It helps the stem fuse together with the flower, in turn strengthening the bond and overall stability and integrity.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a lot}} of insects: mosquitoes, flees, wasps, <b>bees,</b> gypsy <b>moths,</b> green crickets, hornets, {{different}} louses, crickets, ladybugs, moths, butterflies, etc. Among {{agricultural pests}} the widest spreads are: potato beetle, turnip beetle, grain weevil and bean weevil.|$|R
50|$|Insects and {{arthropods}} in the Arabian desert habitat include scorpions, spiders (including {{the large}} Galeodes arabs), ants, <b>bees,</b> wasps, <b>moths</b> and beetles. Scarab beetles (Scarabaeoidea) {{are the most}} common type of beetle on the peninsula and consume dung and plant material.|$|R
50|$|Mary and Peter {{are in fact}} {{engaged in}} a low-intensity supernatural proxy war against one another. She can only use <b>bees,</b> <b>moths,</b> cats and flies against his control over golems, spiders, snakes and rats, and {{initially}} seems to kill Mary through his servitors. However, even this traumatic event {{is not enough to}} cause Dr. Meade to abandon the comforting illusion of his false human identity. Two vast, supernatural entities loom over Millgate, however, and Barton realises that Meade is one of them, as Peter Trilling reverts to his own, malignant divine self. He uses his servitors to attack Barton, Christopher and the Wanderers, but is stopped as Meade remembers his past, and reassumes his own divine identity.|$|R
50|$|Gunton Warren is {{a coastal}} site which has sand dunes, shingle, lowland heath and cliff slopes. Birds include rare {{migrants}} including icterines and yellow-browed warblers. Corton Woods has mature trees and diverse flora such as <b>lesser</b> celandine, <b>bee</b> orchids and common spotted orchids.|$|R
50|$|The mantis almost {{exclusively}} eats flying prey, with Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies being {{the food of}} preference for young nymphs in captivity. Adults and fifth or sixth instar nymphs can tackle much larger prey, such as house flies, small <b>bees</b> and <b>moths.</b>|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, English Nature {{identify}} a further 117 species that use ragwort as a nectar source whilst travelling between feeding and breeding sites, or between metapopulations. These consist mainly of solitary <b>bees,</b> hoverflies, <b>moths,</b> and butterflies {{such as the}} small copper butterfly (Lycaena phlaeas). Pollen is collected by solitary bees.|$|R
50|$|The plant {{grows to}} {{a height of}} up to 120 cm. Stipules are absent, the taproot is white or brown, and the stem is quadrangular. Sub-sessile leaves are linear-lanceolate or elliptic-lanceolate, 2.5-7.5 cm long, not lobed or divided, blunt at the tip, obtuse, entire or cerrulate, glandular, hispid and {{coarsely}} dentate at the margins. Whorls of many flowers are bisexual, sessile or sub-sessile, usually in terminal whorls 1-2 cm in diameter, grouped together in an axillary, corolla white in color and 2 cm long. Calyx is 5-7 mm long, and obliquely turbinate, with minute teeth, apex acute, base acute, pinnately veined, erect or spreading horizontally. It is reproduced by seed and pollinated by <b>bees</b> <b>moths</b> and flies. Leucas belongs to the subfamily Lamioideae, and {{is closely related to}} the small genera Acrotome and Leonotis.|$|R

50|$|The bats eat a {{combination}} of nectar, fruit, and insects, though fruit dominates their diet. Based on fecal droppings, {{it was found that}} 50% of the bats tested had eaten all three in a single night while the remaining ate only two of the three types of food. The insects eaten are primarily beetles, but also eat flies, <b>bees</b> and <b>moths.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} recent {{applications of}} vertical-looking radar to monitor migratory insect movements at high altitude, and of harmonic radar {{to record the}} flight paths of low-flying insects. Examples are given of how these radars have revealed novel information about the flight of <b>bees,</b> butterflies, <b>moths</b> and carabid beetles. The paper also briefly mentions some technical innovations designed to improve the performance of these radars...|$|R
50|$|Individuals do not {{typically}} reproduce {{until they have}} a trunk diameter of 30 cm. Once mature, the trees produce flowers each year, but not all females produce fruit each year. Their flower morphology is typical of being pollinated by generalist small insects such as <b>bees</b> and <b>moths.</b> It {{has been reported to}} be pollinated by non-sphingid moths, but other authors have questioned whether this is correct.|$|R

40|$|Description: A {{perennial}} woody shrub with a weeping {{form that}} can grow 3 - 12 {{feet in height}} and has a spread of 4 - 15 feet. Opposite, lance-shaped leaves (6 - 10 inches) with margins finely toothed grow on long arching stems. Leaves are gray-green above with lower surface white-tomentose. Small fragrant flowers are borne in long, erect or nodding spikes that are 8 - 18 inch with cone-shaped clusters that droop in a profusion of color. The flower clusters can be so profuse that they cause the branches to arch even more. Flower colors may be purple, white, pink, or red, and they usually have an orange throat in the center. It spreads by seeds that are produced in abundance and dispersed by the wind. Habitat: Butterfly bush likes well drained, average soil. They thrive in fairly dry conditions once established. Roots may perish in wet soil. Distribution: In the United States, it is recorded in states shaded on the map. Ecological Impacts: It has been planted in landscapes to attract butterflies, <b>bees,</b> <b>moths</b> and birds. It can escape from plantings and become invasive {{in a variety of}} habitats such as surface mined lands, coastal forest edges, roadsides...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} new records, range extensions, and {{a checklist}} of arthropod species found associated with {{the most common and}} widespread native tree in the Hawaiian Islands, ‘öhi‘a lehua (Myrtaceae: Metrosideros polymorpha Gaudichaud-Beaupré). Metrosideros polymorpha is found on all the main islands, naturally occurs from sea level to tree line (> 2000 m), in dry, mesic, and wet forests, and is the canopy dominant in old growth and the first woody colonist on recent basaltic lava flows (Dawson & Stemmerman, 1990). Numerous insect species use ‘öhi‘a lehua as a resource for either food or habitat space, and it may have the largest fauna of any native plant (Southwood, 1960; Stein, 1983). Metrosideros is an important, year-round nectar resource for native <b>bees,</b> <b>moths,</b> thrips and other insects, and for native nectarivorous birds, such as the ‘apapane (Himatione sanguinea), ‘i‘iwi (Vestiara coccinea), and ‘akohekohe (Palmeria dolei). Metrosideros also provides important habitat for birds that forage for arthropod prey in the foliage (e. g., ‘akepa [Loxops coccineus]) and bark (e. g., Hawai‘i creeper [Oreomystis mana]). It can be argued that M. polymorpha is the backbone of Hawaiian forests {{and one of the most}} important resources for the long-term stability of ecosystems and watersheds in the islands...|$|R
40|$|The effect-response {{framework}} {{states that}} {{plant functional traits}} link the abiotic environment to ecosystem functioning. One ecosystem property is the body size of the animals living in the system, which is assumed to depend on temperature or resource availability, among others. For primary consumers, resource availability may directly be related to plant traits, while for secondary consumers the relationship is indirect. We used plant traits to describe resource availability along an elevational gradient on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Using structural equation models, we determined the response of plant traits to changes in precipitation, temperature and disturbance with and assessed whether abiotic conditions or community-weighted means of plant traits are stronger predictors of the mean size of <b>bees,</b> <b>moths,</b> frugivorous birds, and insectivorous birds. Traits indicating tissue density and nutrient content strongly responded to variations in precipitation, temperature and disturbance. They had direct effects on pollination and fruit traits. However, the average body sizes of the animal groups considered could only be explained by temperature and habitat structure, not by plant traits. Our results demonstrate a strong link between traits and the abiotic environment, but suggest that temperature is the most relevant predictor of mean animal body size. Community-weighted means of plant traits and body sizes appear unsuitable to capture the complexity of plant-animal interactions...|$|R
