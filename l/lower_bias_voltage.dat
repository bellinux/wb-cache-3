However, incorporating Au immobilization layer in the cantilever stack increases the net TCE {{difference in the}} multilayer structure, thereby enhancing TCE-induced thermal drift in the sensor terminal characteristics. TCE-induced cantilever deflection becomes a serious problem, especially when metal piezoresistors and bias voltage more than 1  V are used. The aforementioned factors combined with low thermal conductivity of SU- 8 polymers result in sensor failure due to plastic deformation of cantilever structure. Possible solutions to overcome thermal drift include direct immobilization of SU- 8 surface, <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage,</b> and complete polymeric cantilevers.

Additionally, there is a strong indication that in the case when heavy elements (> 89) are involved in the growth process, which evolves by continuous re-nucleation. Conversely, when only light elements (< 52) are involved then the coating evolves by competitive growth. This observation is limited only for the <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> range of U-B - 75 to - 120 V However, as the bias voltage is increased (up to U-B = - 150 V) the texture becomes increasingly sharp and in all cases a { 111 } texture develops. A lower residual compressive stress (typically - 1. 8 GPa) is observed when one of the bi-layers is dominated by a heavier element. The stress increases (up to - 6. 8 GPa) in these coatings when the bias voltage is increased to U-B = - 150 V which is always systematically lower than in coatings containing only lighter elements which are typically up to - 11. 7 GPa at the same bias voltage.

Sputter deposition is attractive {{as an alternative}} to chemical vapor deposition because sputtering is a well-characterized and cost effective technique which is already widely implemented. Conformal copper deposition may be feasible since copper reflow at temperatures much lower than the melting point of 1083 °C has been observed by a number of workers. In this case, an attractive approach is sputter deposition of copper at a sufficiently high temperature so that the need for a separate reflow anneal is eliminated.

30|$|The {{emission}} wavelength of GaN-based semiconductor, a directly transitional wide bandgap material, is theoretically capable of covering the whole visible spectrum from UV to IR, and GaN-based semiconductors attract considerable attention {{due to their}} continuously expanding applications for optoelectronic devices, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs) [1, 2]. Recently, the applications of UV-LEDs with {{emission wavelength}}s of about 365  nm are widely expanding, such as in sterilization, medicine, biochemistry, water purification system, light sources for optical recording, fluorescence analyzer, biological sensor, and air purification systems. However, the external quantum efficiency (ηex) of UV-LEDs is still much lower than blue LEDs, including the differences between LED structural design, chip area, or other package design. Yamada et al. reported that ηex was improved up to 35  % by using patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) [3]. The enhanced light extraction efficiency by scattering the emission light in the epi-layers has been considered, and also related reports demonstrate that the crystal quality can be enhanced by using PSS [4 – 6]. Despite this, the performance of UV-LEDs is sensitive to defects in epitaxial layer {{because of the lack}} of localized states in the multiple-quantum-well (MQW) active regions [7, 8]. Therefore, improvement of GaN crystal quality for UV-LED is a crucial issue in order to promote related applications. A nucleation layer of GaN hetero-epitaxially grown on PSS is the most important factor for suppressing the formation of threading dislocation densities (TDDs). Lai et al. [9] have recently reported that the ex situ sputtered AlN nucleation layer prepared by radio-frequency (RF) sputtering could reduce the TDDs of GaN and enhance the LED performances due to improvement on crystal quality. The surface of PSS could be damaged by recoil argon ions, though, owing to higher bias voltage (200 [*]~[*] 400  V) of RF sputtering system and a short distance from the target to the sample. Thus, it is necessary to deposit AlN nucleation layer on PSS but not cause PSS surface damages. In this study, we demonstrated an UV-LEDs with an ex situ reactive plasma deposited (RPD) AlN nucleation layer on PSS. Comparing the RF sputtering system, the RPD system utilizes a <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> (15 [*]~[*] 20  V), and the distance between the target and the sample is longer. It is practical for avoiding the substrate from being damaged. Moreover, the deposition temperature of RPD AlN nucleation layer was kept at high temperature (600 °C) that could lead to the preferred orientation growth. Systematic experiments and investigations have been described in detail, which showed an up to 30  % output performance increase by using RPD AlN nucleation layer on PSS.|$|E

We derive a numerically exact expression for the particle current and examine its characteristics as it evolves in time from the transient regime to the long-time steady-state regime. We find that just after switch-on the current initially overshoots the expected long-time steady-state value, oscillates and decays as a power law, and eventually settles to a steady-state value consistent with the value calculated using the Landauer formula. The power-law parameters depend on {{the values of the}} applied <b>bias</b> <b>voltage,</b> the strength of the couplings, and the speed of the switch-on. In particular, the oscillating transient current decays away longer for <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages.</b> Furthermore, the power-law decay nature of the current suggests an equivalent series resistor-inductor-capacitor circuit wherein all of the components have time-dependent properties. Such dynamical resistive, inductive, and capacitive influences are generic in nano-circuites where dynamical switches are incorporated. We also examine the characteristics of the dynamical current in a nano-oscillator modeled by introducing a sinusoidally modulated interleads coupling between the two leads. We find that the current does not strictly follow the sinusoidal form of the coupling. In particular, the maximum current does not occur during times when the leads are exactly aligned. Instead, the times when the maximum current occurs depend on the values of the bias potential, nearest-neighbor coupling, and the interleads coupling.

[...] [...] "At this bias, the electric field is so high than 3×105 that a single charge carrier injected into the depletion layer can trigger a self-sustaining avalanche. The current rises swiftly rise-time to a macroscopic steady level in the milliampere range. If the primary carrier is photo-generated, {{the leading edge of}} the avalanche pulse marks picosecond time jitter [...] the arrival time of the detected photon." [...] The current continues until the avalanche is quenched by <b>lowering</b> the <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> VD down to or below VB: the lower electric field is no longer able to accelerate carriers to impact-ionize with lattice atoms, therefore current ceases. In order to be able to detect another photon, the <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> must be raised again above breakdown.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the behavior of}} carrier populations generated at the interface of an n-Si wafer to an Si quantum dot (QD) array embedded in SiO 2 with a photon flux ranging from 1. 24 to 2. 48 [*]eV (1000 to 500 [*]nm). The optically assisted IV method was used with the Si wafer as hot carrier (HC) absorber and the Si QD array as energy selective contact (ESC). Charge carriers obtain excess energy from photons with energies significantly exceeding the band gap, resulting in an HC population. This reduces the bias field required to provide kinetic energy by field emission. The ESC can collect HCs at <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages.</b> Tunneling resonances show the energy selective behavior under illumination at 80 [*]K and room temperature (295 [*]K). The data at 80 [*]K can arguably be interpreted as an HC population in Si {{within the range of}} the ballistic mean free path from the QD array. We discovered a correlation between the energetic shift of the average hot hole temperature near the valence band edge and the energy of the photons impinging on the mesa structures. The optically assisted IV technique delivers a proof of principle for operation of an Si QD array as an ESC at room temperature, and furthermore for an HC solar cell with one ESC at 80...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{collected}} charge and the Lorentz angle on non-irradiated and the irradiatedminiature {{of the current}} test silicon micro-strip sensors (ATLAS 12) of the future ATLAS innertracker are measured. The samples are irradiated up to 51015 1 MeV neq=cm 2 and some of themalso measured after short-term annealing (80 min at 60 C). The measurements are performedat the DESY II test beam, which provides the advantage of tracking to suppress noise hits. The collected charge is measured at various <b>bias</b> <b>voltages</b> for each sample. The results arecompared with the measurements performed using a Sr 90 radioactive source. It is shown thatthe measurements with beam and radioactive source are consistent with each other, and theadvantage of tracking at the beam measurements provides the measurement of collected chargeon highly irradiated sensors at <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages.</b> The Lorentz angle is measured for each sample at dierent magnetic eld strengths between 0 T and 1 T, the results are extrapolated to 2 T, which is the magnetic eld in the inner trackerof the ATLAS detector. Most of the measurements are performed at [...] 500 V bias voltage,which is the planned operation <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> of the future strip tracker. Some samples are alsomeasured at dierent <b>bias</b> <b>voltages</b> to observe the eect of <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> on the Lorentz angle. Thesignal reconstruction of the strip sensors are performed using the lowest possible signal-to-noisethresholds. For non-irradiated samples, the measured Lorentz angle agrees with the prediction ofthe BFK model. On the irradiated samples, {{the results suggest that}} the Lorentz angle decreaseswith increasing <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> due to the increasing electric eld in the sensor. The Lorentz angledecreases with increasing irradiation level; however, if the sample is under-depleted, the eectof electric eld dominates and the Lorentz angle increases. Once the irradiation level becomestoo high, hence {{the collected}} charge is small due to increasing trapping, the visible eect ofthe Lorentz force in the detector decreases, therefore the measured Lorentz angle decreases. Short-term annealing increases the Lorentz angle, due to the decrease in full depletion voltage. However, on the highly irradiated samples the annealing further decreases the Lorentz angle. The analysis is also re-performed using the signal threshold that will be used in the digitalreadout of strip sensors at the future ATLAS inner tracker. It is seen that the visible eect ofthe Lorentz force decreases at lower uences due to the higher threshold...|$|R
