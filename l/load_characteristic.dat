50|$|PV {{solar systems}} exist in many {{different}} configurations {{with regard to their}} relationship to inverter systems, external grids, battery banks, or other electrical loads. Regardless of the ultimate destination of the solar power, though, the central problem addressed by MPPT is that the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell depends on both the amount of sunlight falling on the solar panels and the electrical characteristics of the load. As the amount of sunlight varies, the <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> that gives the highest power transfer efficiency changes, so that the efficiency of the system is optimized when the <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> changes to keep the power transfer at highest efficiency. This <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> is called the maximum power point and MPPT is the process of finding this point and keeping the <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> there. Electrical circuits can be designed to present arbitrary loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage, current, or frequency to suit other devices or systems, and MPPT solves the problem of choosing the best load to be presented to the cells {{in order to get the}} most usable power out.|$|E

Therefore matching between Air Conditioning (AC) systems strategies with the cooling <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> is crucial to ensure effectiveness. Previous researches have been done to determine cooling <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> for offices and residential buildings. However, same research for academic buildings is rare and still need further development.

The results showed that the major contributor to the cooling load was heat gain from building envelope which was counted up to 52. 57 % of the total cooling load in a year. The result also implied that cooling energy wasted during peak and off-peak period was approximately 50 % of the total cooling load. Once transient cooling <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> was presented, three possible solutions were applied to the system to find best solution in reducing the cooling load.

40|$|Abstract. Filters between {{voltage source}} {{converter}} and the batteries in power {{system can be}} categorized into constant voltage source excited filters. The paper discusses {{the importance of the}} matched structure and parameters for power filters. The relation between matched structure and filter’s output characteristic is demonstrated and the design principle is introduced. The work above proved that even if the filters are designed for the same transfer function, so long as filter’s load resistance is different, their designed parameters are also different. Traditional power system filter seldom consider its both ends load matching characteristic. When the difference between filter's <b>load</b> <b>characteristic</b> and practical system equivalent impedance are large, the actual filtering effect becomes worse, current loss arises and even there may be the possibility of resonance. As the lack of energy resource and energy crisis is gradually becoming a serious problem, energy conservation is important.

40|$|Abstract-To {{measure the}} {{characteristics}} of ultrasonic mo-tors, such as the maximum torque, torque-speed relationship and the frictional coefficient at the contact surface, a method in which the torque is calculated from the transient responses is proposed. The rise curve that is the transitional change in the rotor speed soon after turning on the motor gives the <b>load</b> <b>characteristics,</b> while the fall curve that is the decay of the ro-tor speed after turning off the motor yields the frictional coef-ficient of the contact surface. This method requires {{only a short time}} (the transient time of the motor) to complete the measure-ment.

In {{order to}} obtain the <b>loading</b> <b>characteristics</b> of {{magnetic}} particle brake (MPB) in rotary system, the servo-motor controlling and testing experimental platform is used to research MPB <b>loading</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The key step is designing different experiments that include static loading experiment, step loading experiment, and tracking loading experiment.

The response time in step experiment is longer in upward section than in downward section and it has no relation with the speed of MPB by lucubrating step experiment data. Phase difference is relevant to input current excitation frequency after analyzing tracking experiment data. The <b>loading</b> <b>characteristic</b> of MPB is closely relation to the MPB velocity which is proposed in rotary loading system. When the input current doesn’t change, the output torque increases along with the rotary speed increasing.
