Keep all your style for me when I come. I can't tell you when, it's mighty uncertain before the rainy season. But I'm coming soon. Don't go back on your promise about lettin up on the tramps, and being a little more high-toned. And don't you give 'em so much. It's true I sent you hats TWICE. I clean forgot all about the first; but I wouldn't have given a ten-dollar hat to a nigger woman who had a sick baby because I had an extra hat. I'd have let that baby slide. I forgot to ask whether the skirt is worn separately; I must see the dressmaking sharp about it; but I think you'll want something on besides a jacket and skirt; at least, it looks like it up here. I don't think you could manage a piano down there without the old man knowing it, and raisin' the devil generally. I promised you I'd let up on him. Mind you keep all your promises to me. I'm glad you're gettin' on with the six-shooter; tin cans are good at fifteen yards, but try it on suthin' that MOVES! I forgot to say that I am on the track of your big brother. It's a three years' old track, and he was in Arizona. The friend who told me didn't expatiate much on what he did there, but I reckon they had a high old time. If he's above the earth I'll find him, you bet. The yerba buena and the southern wood came all right,--they smelt <b>like</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Say,</b> Flip, do you remember the last--the VERY last--thing that happened when you said 'Good-by' on the trail? Don't let me ever find out that you've let anybody else kiss--" ...|$|E
60|$|In fact, {{there was}} not a word to be said against us except that which {{referred}} to the feelings of the young and old. Feelings are changeable, I told them at that great and glorious meeting which we had at Gladstonopolis, and though naturally governed only by instinct, would be taught at last to comply with reason. I had lately read how feelings had been allowed in England to {{stand in the way of}} the great work of cremation. A son will not <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> to lead his father into the college. But ought he not to like to do so? and if so, will not reason teach him to like to do what he ought? I can conceive with rapture the pride, the honour, the affection with which, when the Fixed Period had come, I could have led my father into the college, there to enjoy for twelve months that preparation for euthanasia which no cares for this world would be allowed to disturb. All the existing ideas of the grave would be absent. There would be no further struggles to prolong the time of misery which nature had herself produced. That temptation to the young to begrudge to the old the costly comforts which they could not earn would be no longer fostered. It would be a pride for the young man to feel that his parent's name had been enrolled to all coming time in the bright books of the college which was to be established for the Fixed Period. I have a son of my own, and I have carefully educated him to look forward to the day in which he shall deposit me there as the proudest of his life. Circumstances, as I shall relate in this story, have somewhat interfered with him; but he will, I trust, yet come back to the right way of thinking. That I shall never spend that last happy year within the walls of the college, is to me, from a selfish point of view, the saddest part of England's reassuming our island as a colony.|$|E

5000|$|The band {{produced}} the album themselves {{along with their}} manager, Bob Brown. Several outside tunes were included on the album. One of these tunes was [...] "Do You Believe in Love", written by Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange. It {{turned out to be}} their first hit single, reaching the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. A video for the single was also produced. The follow-up single, [...] "Hope You Love Me <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> <b>Say</b> You Do", reached the Top 40; while the third single, [...] "Workin' for a Livin'", just missed the Top 40, peaking at number 41.|$|E
5000|$|Later in 1980, {{the band}} issued their first studio album, a self-titled LP, Huey Lewis and the News. It went largely unnoticed. In 1982, the band {{released}} their second studio album, the self-produced Picture This. The album turned gold, {{fueled by the}} breakout success of the hit single [...] "Do You Believe in Love", written by former Clover producer Mutt Lange. Largely because of the single, the album remained on the Billboard 200 album chart for 35 weeks and peaked at No. 13. The follow-up singles from Picture This, [...] "Hope You Love Me <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> <b>Say</b> You Do" [...] and [...] "Workin' for a Livin'", followed with limited success.|$|E
