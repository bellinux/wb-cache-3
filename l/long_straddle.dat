5000|$|A <b>long</b> <b>straddle</b> {{involves}} [...] "going long," [...] {{in other}} words, purchasing both a call option and a put option on some stock, interest rate, index or other underlying. The two options are {{bought at the}} same strike price and expire at the same time. The owner of a <b>long</b> <b>straddle</b> makes a profit if the underlying price moves {{a long way from}} the strike price, either above or below. Thus, an investor may take a <b>long</b> <b>straddle</b> position if he thinks the market is highly volatile, but does not know in which direction it is going to move. This position is a limited risk, since the most a purchaser may lose is the cost of both options. At the same time, there is unlimited profit potential.|$|E
5000|$|Straddle - {{holding a}} {{position}} in both a call and put with the same strike price and expiration. If the options have been bought, the holder has a <b>long</b> <b>straddle.</b> If the options were sold, the holder has a short straddle. The <b>long</b> <b>straddle</b> is profitable if the underlying stock changes value in a significant way, either higher or lower. The short straddle is profitable {{when there is no}} such significant move; ...|$|E

50|$|For example, company XYZ is set {{to release}} its {{quarterly}} financial results in two weeks. A trader believes that the release of these results will cause a large movement {{in the price of}} XYZ's stock, but does not know whether the price will go up or down. He can enter into a <b>long</b> <b>straddle,</b> where he gets a profit no matter which way the price of XYZ stock moves, if the price changes enough either way. If the price goes up enough, he uses the call option and ignores the put option. If the price goes down, he uses the put option and ignores the call option. If the price does not change enough, he loses money, up to the total amount paid for the two options. The risk is limited by the total premium paid for the options, as opposed to the short straddle where the risk is virtually unlimited.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{valuation}} of a weather derivative with payoffs depending on temperature. We use historical {{data from the}} weather station in the Slovak town Košice to obtain unique prices of option contracts in an incomplete market. Numerical examples of prices of some contracts are presented, using the Burn analysis. We provide {{an example of how}} a weather contract can be designed to hedge the financial risk of a suboptimal temperature condition. The comparative comparison of the selected option hedging strategies has shown the best results for the producers in agricultural industries who hedges against an unfavourable weather conditions. The results of analysis proved that by buying put option or call option, the farmer establishes the highest payoff in the case of temperature decrease or increase. The <b>Long</b> <b>Straddle</b> Strategy is the most expensive but is available to the farmer who hedges against a high volatility in temperature movement. We conclude with the findings that weather derivatives could be useful tools to diminish the financial losses for agricultural industries highly dependent for temperature...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} the economy that splits investors into two groups. One group (the reference traders) trades an underlying asset according to the difference in realized returns between that asset and some evolving consensus estimate of those returns; the other group (hedgers) hedge options, namely straddles, on the underlying asset. We consider the cases when hedgers are <b>long</b> the <b>straddle</b> and when the hedgers are short the straddle. We numerically simulate the terminal distribution of the underlying asset price and find that hedgers that are <b>long</b> the <b>straddle</b> tend to push the underlying toward the strike, while hedgers that are short the straddle cause the underlying security to have a bimodal terminal probability distribution with a local minimum at the strike.

50|$|The {{first major}} {{development}} at Edgeley Park was {{the construction of}} the original Main Stand on the north (Hardcastle Road) side of the ground. Initially holding around 500 seats, this was a relatively low timber structure and it was totally destroyed by a fire in 1935. It was replaced a year later by the current stand, constructed of brick and steel, a building seen by many as a traditional, old-fashioned stand, typical of football stadia in Northern England. The roof of the Main Stand at Edgeley Park is supported towards the front by three steel columns, which slightly impede the view of supporters from certain seats. Unusually, rather than running the length of the pitch, as would normally be expected in football stadia nowadays, the Main Stand is only about 75 yards <b>long,</b> <b>straddling</b> the half way line, with the gaps at each end containing other club-related buildings.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In [1], {{the author}} {{introduced}} {{a strategy to}} use network coding on p-Cycles {{in order to provide}} 1 +N protection for straddling connections and links against single link failures in mesh optical networks. In this paper we extend the work in [1] and introduce a GMPLS-based implementation of this strategy for link protection, that is also used to protect on-cycle links. We refer to this scheme as hybrid 1 +N protection, since some data units are transmitted without being combined with other data units. The strategy uses a combination of GMPLS standard Label Switched Paths (LSP) for protecting on-cycle links, and modified LSPs, which we refer to as Label Switched Cycles (LSC), for protecting straddling links. The strategy does not have to explicitly detect failures, but rather detects the absence of data units. Destinations receive backup copies of packets within no more than the p-Cycle propagation delay for on-cycle link failures, and no {{more than the sum of}} the propagation delays of the p-Cycle and the <b>longest</b> <b>straddling</b> link for straddling link failures. The implementation details of this strategy are presented, and the cost of implementation, in terms of link usage is evaluated and is shown to be modest. This scheme can therefore provide protection at higher layers, at a speed that is comparable to that achieved at the physical layer, but at a much reduced cost, while being flexible, and requiring less involvement from the management and control planes.

40|$|I {{study the}} {{cross-section}} of realized stock option returns and find an economically {{important source of}} predictability in the cross-sectional distribution of implied volatility. A zero-cost trading strategy that is <b>long</b> in <b>straddles</b> with a large positive forecast {{of the change in}} implied volatility and short in straddles with a large negative forecast produces an economically important and statistically significant average monthly return. The results are robust to different market conditions, to firm risk-characteristics, to various industry groupings, to options liquidity characteristics, and are not explained by linear factor models. Compared to the market prediction, the implied volatility estimate obtained from the cross-sectional forecasting model is a more precise and efficient estimate of future realized volatility...|$|R

50|$|The Kárahnjúkastífla Dam is 193m tall, 730m <b>long</b> and <b>straddles</b> the river. It {{is made of}} 8.5 {{million cubic}} meters of material, making it the largest dam of its type in Europe. Construction on the dam began in April 2003 and was {{completed}} in November 2006. The Kárahnjúkastífla Dam does not create the reservoir alone, as the dam is higher in elevation than the two valleys that flank the river valley. To create the desired level, auxiliary or saddle dams were built. The 60m tall and 1,000m long Desjarárstífla Dam is adjacent and {{to the east of}} the Kárahnjúkastífla Dam. The Sauðárdalsstífla Dam is 4 km to the southwest, 25m tall and 1,100m long. Both auxiliary dams were built between April 2004 and October 2006. The reservoir began to fill in September 2006.|$|R
