5|$|Former Governor-General Sir Paul Hasluck, {{believed}} that the fundamental reason for the crisis was the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> and confidence between Whitlam and Kerr, and {{that the role of}} the Governor-General to provide counsel, advice and warning.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} his final match for the Red and Whites, though, as {{at the end of}} the season he agreed to sign for Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach. He made 120 {{appearances}} for Atlético Madrid over the course of a four-year span, scoring six goals and earning three winners' medals. Domínguez later revealed that the club's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in academy players had contributed to his decision to sign for Gladbach.|$|E
5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. A new plan was made to attack Ascalon but this was {{abandoned}} due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. Following the battle, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. As {{a result of the}} attack, Damascus no longer trusted the crusaders, and the city was formally handed over to Nur ad-Din in 1154. Bernard of Clairvaux was also humiliated, and when his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} decades have {{witnessed}} rapid development of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) technologies. However, {{in contrast to the}} huge potential and convenience enabled by MANETs, many people are still reluctant to allow their mobile computing devices to join MANETs and run MANET applications. One of the main reasons is that it is difficult (1) to guarantee trustworthiness of the MANET applications executed on remote nodes, i. e., the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trusted</b> application, (2) to ensure fair and secure communication between multiple network nodes, i. e., the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trusted</b> communication, and (3) to authenticate network nodes, i. e., the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trusted</b> identity. In this dissertation, we exploit low cost trusted hardware and the application centric nature of MANETs to address the problems <b>of</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trusted</b> application, trusted communication and trusted identity in MANETs. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of four systems: (i) a service-aware trusted execution monitor (Satem) that ensures trusted code execution, (ii) a distributed method that creates a protected MANET to shield all network member nodes from being attacked, (iii) a distributed network communication policy enforcement mechanism that ensures secur...|$|R

5|$|The {{municipality}} {{gave the}} necessary permissions for construction in December 1997, but {{required that the}} club finance the upgrades, which the club could not afford. Kjell Ove Johansen, CEO of Bodø/Glimt's operating company, quit his job in November 1998 in protest against the mayor's and councilors' negative attitude and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> towards Bodø/Glimt regarding the venue plans. On 27 January 1999, the municipal council passed a resolution allowing the venue {{to be sold to}} the club for NOK7.9 million, with the official take-over date being 1 May. In addition, the company would pay NOK5.5 million to the municipality at a later date, after the venue had become profitable.|$|E

She at one time despised Shinji for his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in his father Gendo, with whom Rei is very close. However, after Shinji and Rei successfully defeat the Angel Ramiel, she takes a friendly liking to him. Towards the end of the series it is revealed that she is one of many clones, whose use is to replace the currently existing Rei if she is killed.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he {{was said to have}} heard a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with the first day of Baisakhi.|$|E

5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. A new plan was made to attack Ascalon and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> that had {{resulted}} from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart {{during the course of}} the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} Dutch threat, Oerip {{intended}} to attack while the former colonists were still consolidating their forces, {{a plan that}} was quashed by the government's attempts at diplomacy. He preferred guerrilla tactics to formal military conflicts, once telling a subordinate that the best attack would be one with a hundred snipers hidden behind enemy lines. Oerip was strongly against the Renville Agreement, an ultimately unsuccessful treaty {{that led to the}} withdrawal of 35,000troops from western Java and the formalisation of the Van Mook Line between Dutch and Indonesian forces. He saw the agreement, ratified on 17January 1948, as a stalling tactic, giving the Dutch the chance to strengthen their forces. Meanwhile, Amir Sjarifuddin– by then also serving as prime minister– began culling the army, predominantly keeping leftist-leaning troops. Disgusted with what he perceived as the government's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in the military, Oerip tendered his resignation, although he continued to serve as an advisor to the Minister of Defence, Vice President Hatta.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, he had {{received}} worrying British intelligence reports that {{said he was in}} danger of being assassinated and his country may face a coup d'état. His tribesmen were unhappy at Habibullah's perceived subservience to the British, and his council and relatives openly spoke of their suspicions at his inactivity. Habibullah began purging his court of officials who were known to be close to Nasrullah and Amanullah. He recalled emissaries he had sent to Persia for talks with Germany and Turkey for military aid. Meanwhile, the war took {{a turn for the worse}} for the Central Powers. The Arab revolt against Turkey and the loss of Erzurum to the Russians ended the hopes of sending a Turkish division to Afghanistan. The German influence in Persia also declined rapidly, ending the hopes that Goltz Pasha could lead a Persian volunteer division into Afghanistan. The mission came to realise that the Emir deeply mistrusted them. A further attempt by British intelligence to feed false information to the mission, purportedly originating from Goltz Pasha, convinced von Hentig of the Emir's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust.</b> A last offer was made by Nasrullah in May 1916 to remove Habibullah from power and lead the frontier tribes in a campaign against British India. However, von Hentig knew it would come to nothing, and the Germans left Kabul on 21 May 1916. Niedermayer instructed Wagner to stay in Herat as a liaison officer. The Indian members also stayed, persisting in their attempts at an alliance.|$|E

On June 5 episode of Impact, Anderson impersonated Storm, with Storm's retro entrance music, then attacked Storm after he refused to grant him a match. After Anderson lost the brawl, the match was set at Slammiversary, who was win by Anderson. A Following Slammiversary, Anderson formed a tag team with Gunner but tensions already rose between them because of Gunner's relationship to Samuel Shaw, whom Gunner had been helping through psychiatric counselling. Anderson and Gunner would continue to team together with Shaw at their side who would try to help them in their matches but Anderson refused because of his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust.</b> On the August 14th edition of Impact, Anderson and Shaw finally came to punches during a match between Anderson and Gunner. At Hardcore Justice, Anderson was defeated by Shaw in a I Quit match. On September 17, 2014, Mr. Anderson came to the aid of fellow former Army Sergeant and amputee wrestler Chris Melendez on his debut from a post-match attack by Kenny King.

5|$|The band Pylon was {{a long-standing}} and {{influential}} {{part of the}} Athens scene, and became critical darlings in the 1980s, but never achieved significant mainstream success. This was partially because they eschewed several record contracts from the major labels due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in their corporate goodwill. Pylon's dance rock style was not very accessible or commercial, and was accompanied grating, chanting-style vocals, funky guitars and bass-heavy beats. Other 1980s local bands with nationwide alternative followings included Love Tractor, Oh-OK, with Michael Stipe's sister Lynda Stipe, vocalist Linda Hopper (later of Magnapop) and future solo performer Matthew Sweet, Dreams So Real. The members of R.E.M. have remained fixtures in Athens as they have also become international stars, helping out local performers like Vic Chesnutt, the Chickasaw Mudd Puppies and Jack Logan. The Elephant 6 Collective, a group of like-minded indie bands, gained limited nationwide exposure starting in the mid-1990s {{with the rise of}} Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and Olivia Tremor Control. The same period saw the Kindercore Records roster find critical acclaim, including the bands Sunshine Fix, Masters of the Hemisphere, Japancakes, Love Tractor, Gresham Disco and Of Montreal. Candy, a DJ store owned by Michael Lachowski of Pylon, opened in 1998; the store became {{an important part of the}} burgeoning dance music scene that produced Danger Mouse, Phungus and DJ 43.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} impact of Maryland’s Firearm Safety Act (FSA) of 2013 on {{indicators}} of diversion of handguns to prohibited persons. Interrupted time-series analyses were conducted, and the findings were supplemented by results from a survey of men on parole and probation regarding Baltimore’s underground gun market. The FSA was associated with an 82 percent reduction in police recovery of handguns with strong indicators of diversion (IRR= 0. 18, p=. 005). Forty-one percent of survey respondents reported having more difficulty getting a handgun after the FSA because <b>of</b> increased cost, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trusted</b> sources, or people less willing to engage in straw purchases on their behalf.

25|$|Foreign aid to {{the region}} is a {{difficult}} proposition, according to Craig Cohen, {{an analyst at the}} Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. Since security is difficult, local nongovernmental organizations are required to distribute aid, but there is a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> amongst NGOs and other powers that hampers distribution. Pakistani NGOs are often targets of violent attacks by Islamist militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Due to the extensive hostility to any hint of foreign influence, the American branch of Save the Children was distributing funding anonymously in the region as of July 2007.|$|E

25|$|Patient {{disclosure}} {{is important}} in the medical error process. The current standard of practice at many hospitals is to disclose errors to patients when they occur.

In 2007, 34 states passed legislation that precludes any information from a physician’s apology for a medical error from being used in malpractice court (even a full admission of fault). This encourages physicians to acknowledge and explain mistakes to patients, keeping an open line of communication.|$|E

30|$|Establishing and {{sustaining}} CNs consortia appears difficult due to many impediments, <b>of</b> which <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> partner <b>trust</b> is prominent. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> partner <b>trust</b> is contributed mainly by partners’ behavioral uncertainties coupled to logistics collaborative processes. While {{previous research has}} attempted to mitigate mistrust problem, {{little attention has been}} paid to behavioral trust in logistics collaboration. In its entirety, behavioral <b>trust</b> comprises <b>of</b> partner’s actions and interactions occurring during collaboration, and whose outcome can predictively be estimated. Toward this requirement, therefore, an initial aim was to establish behavioral aspects which influence partner trust. To that end, using SLR, the present paper has succeeded to reveal key behavioral factors (collaborative processes). The factors are information sharing, incentive alignment, decision synchronization, and opportunism. Additionally, this SLR has managed to offer a new perspective concerning the influence of behavioral factors and associated criteria on partner trust in logistics collaboration. Nevertheless, revealed factors constitute operational success and measurable criteria necessary for empirical investigation, especially by means of appropriate experiments.|$|R
40|$|Since the 2007 - 08 crisis, {{banks in}} many {{countries}} have been facing {{what seems to be}} a serious “trust crisis”. This sharp decline in trust in banks and banking, the likely outcome of the near-collapse of banking systems during the crisis, is partly captured by a growing empirical literature. However, this literature presents serious shortcomings, which reflect a more general <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> theorization <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in banks. This <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> theorization certainly has much to do with the distance between the economic literature on banks and banking and the sociological and economic literature on trust. This paper aims at bridging this gap by proposing a new conceptual framework. In particular, the paper identifies three related dimensions <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> that seem to have relevance for the banking industry: “relational”, “systemic” and “vertical” trust. While mainstream financial intermediation theory and agency theory provide a good understanding <b>of</b> relational <b>trust,</b> they are less well equipped to deal with the other dimensions <b>of</b> <b>trust.</b> The paper, therefore, builds on heterodox theories of money and debt to build a more comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in banks. This tentative conceptual framework, in turn, has implications for current theories of banking and <b>of</b> <b>trust.</b> ...|$|R
