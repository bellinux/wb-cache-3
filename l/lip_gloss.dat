The purpose of this 3 -part study was to develop a lexicon for descriptive sensory testing of lip products. In the first study, two focus groups were conducted to understand women’s perceptions of lip products, and elicit desirable and undesirable characteristics in the products. In the second study, six highly trained panelists from the Sensory Analysis Center at Kansas State University developed a lexicon using five samples each of <b>lip</b> balms, <b>lip</b> <b>glosses,</b> and lipsticks. All attributes were measured during or after application. Attributes were categorized under “initial texture”, “initial appearance”, “after appearance” and “after texture. ” The lexicon comprised of 18 terms. The panelists developed definitions, references, and protocols for evaluation for each attribute in the lexicon. The third study consisted of a validation phase, in which 12 samples, four from each product segment, were used. The lexicon developed in this study was inclusive enough to show distinctions between and within the <b>lip</b> <b>glosses,</b> <b>lip</b> balms and lipsticks.

In August 2010, Brown went to Warsaw, Ohio, to briefly join forces with Anny Donewald, a former stripper and founder of Eve's Angels, an organization similar to JC's Girls. Together, Brown and Donewald negotiated a peace accord between women working at a strip club and members of a local church who had been picketing the club for four years. The strippers had been counter-protesting by dancing in bikinis in front of the church during Sunday services while Tommy George, the club's owner, played music from his car. Brown and Donewald spoke at the church, urging them to stop protesting at the strip club and saying, [...] "It's not our job to tell these women that it's time to get out of there...Just love them. Let the Holy Spirit draw them out." [...] Brown and Donewald also visited the strip club and spoke with the strippers, two of whom became Christians while continuing to work at the club. The peace accord received much publicity, but the church's members, led by their pastor Bill Dunfee, resumed picketing once Brown had returned to San Diego.

500|$|Hosting {{a diverse}} cast of strong female {{characters}} while confronting gender norms and barriers, Kim Possible explores feminist themes, specifically third-wave feminism. Alongside several other female-led animated series that premiered throughout the decade, {{which had been}} experiencing a steady influx in media starring [...] "Teenage Action Chicks with special powers", Kim Possible {{is considered to be}} an example of both girl power and power feminism. Similar to the animated shows Totally Spies, Atomic Betty and The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, Kim Possible revolves around an attractive, intelligent and strong female character whose public identity is meant to indicate that she should be received as a positive role models for young girls. According to Betsy Wallace of Common Sense Media, Kim Possible [...] "capitalizes on the female villain-fighting craze that sparked with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Alias", albeit simplifying the genre for a younger generation. Agreeing that the series adopted the then-new [...] "crime-fighting female" [...] formula, Tracey McLoone of PopMatters admitted that Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Alias and The Powerpuff Girls comparisons are inevitable, {{but at the same time}} observed that Kim is more confident than her predecessors, incorporating cheerleading and acrobatics into her fights against enemies, while using traditionally [...] "girly" [...] accessories such as <b>lip</b> <b>gloss</b> and makeup to her advantage in battle.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Human NutritionKoushik AdhikariThe {{cosmetic}} industry is growing rapidly, and one popular category is lip products. Women consider lip products a necessity and many {{would not leave}} home without it. Though the bigger cosmetic companies may have internal cosmetic lexicons, they are not available in the public domain. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a lexicon for descriptive sensory testing of lip products. <b>Lip</b> balms, <b>lip</b> <b>glosses,</b> and lipsticks were tested in this study. In part 1 (EXPERIMENT 1), two focus groups were conducted to understand women's perceptions of lip products, and also to elicit desirable and undesirable characteristics in the products. The women's idea of a perfect lip product was: clear/sheer/neutral color, smooth, not sticky, moisturizing and flavorless/tasteless. In part 2 (EXPERIMENT 2), a lexicon was developed for the lip products. Attributes were categorized under "Initial Texture", "Initial Appearance", "After Appearance" and "After Texture. " In part 3 (EXPERIMENT 3) of the study, the lexicon was validated by testing various lip products using lexicon developed in part 2. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results by product type indicated that the lexicon was able to differentiate among the lipsticks, lip balms and <b>lip</b> <b>glosses.</b> The lexicon was further able to show similarities and differences within a product type. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis, which are both multivariate techniques, validated the inferences from the univariate analysis (ANOVA). The two panelist groups (three panelists from the lexicon development panel – group 1, and three new panelists – group 2) showed no differences (P > 0. 05) in attribute evaluations for all the samples tested. The lexicon developed in this study could be used to identify similarities and differences in other lip products such as lip plumper, lip liners and multi-use products. The authors hope that this research is extrapolated to other aspects of the personal care industry, such as hair care and skin care, and can aid in product development, product optimization, and claim substantiation...|$|R

Thus, some critics perceive the character {{as a combination}} of Buffy Summers from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sydney Bristow from Alias, and The Powerpuff Girls. As an animated series, Kim Possible was revolutionary for its diverse cast of strong female characters, namely Kim and Shego. Many of the character's typically [...] "girly" [...] belongings double as powerful weapons, namely her <b>lip</b> <b>gloss</b> and compact mirror.

[...] Like Kim herself, her grandmother Nana Possible also fought crime when she was young, from whom Kim is believed to have inherited her abilities. Kim's entire family is very intelligent, and constantly reiterate the phrase [...] "anything is possible for a Possible". Therefore, the character is spared [...] "the burden of being the only brain on the show." [...] The character's relationship with her parents is atypically healthy for a teenager. Kim's father James [...] "views women as equals", and thus has a good relationship with Kim although he struggles to come to terms with the reality that she is growing up and dating. Her mother Ann is essentially a [...] "grown up" [...] version of Kim. At one point, Ann insists that Kim invite her on one of her missions as her Mother's Day present, and Kim also admits to being impressed by her mother's work as a brain surgeon. The Artifice observed that Kim and Shego are strikingly similar in appearance. Metacritc believes that Shego is essentially [...] "Kim's dark reflection"; both characters are smart, athletic and attractive with green eyes, but Shego chooses to use her powers for evil instead. Despite their bitter rivalry, Kim and Shego have mutual respect for each other to the point of which they occasionally work together when the situation demands it.

The mean concentrations of metals in these facial cosmetics ranged from 3. 1 to 8. 4 μgg− 1 Cd, 12 – 240 μgg− 1 Pb, 9. 1 – 44 μgg− 1 Cr, 18 – 288 μgg− 1 Ni, 1. 6 – 80 μgg− 1 Cu, 7. 9 – 17 μgg− 1 Co, 2. 3 – 28 mgg− 1 Fe, 12 – 230 μgg− 1 Mn, and from 18 to 320 μgg− 1 Zn. The concentrations of Ni, Cr and Co were above the suggested safe limit of 1 μgg− 1 for skin protection, while Cd and Pb were above the Canadian specified limits. The systemic exposure dosage (SED) values for these metals obtained from the use of these facial cosmetic products were below their respective provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) /or recommended daily intake (RDI) values. The margin of safety values obtained were greater than 100 which indicated that the concentrations of the metals investigated in these facial cosmetics do not present considerable risk to the users except in the case of face powders...|$|R
