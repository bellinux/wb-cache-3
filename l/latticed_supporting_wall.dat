50|$|It is a {{completely}} quite example of usage of <b>supporting</b> <b>walls</b> in construction. And, partition brick walls creates rooms and corridors apart. As a result of applied <b>supporting</b> <b>walls,</b> it has preferred regular rectangular windows in ordered. Artificial lighting is not obligated because of these openings enough in daylight and it has maximum efficacy. However, {{it is hard to}} say same thing for corridors and artificial lightning applied more in corridors.|$|R

Below a thickness limit, such walls wall may warp during peeling. Unsupported walls are even more liable to detachment hence higher limit is for such case.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Latticed</b> {{soil nailing}} <b>support</b> {{is a new}} type of {{revetment}} structure, which combined lattice support and soil nailing. It effectively improves the global stability of the foundation pit. Currently, the theoretical research about this supporting method is still not consummate. In this paper, on the basis of soil mechanics and code, the stability of <b>latticed</b> soil nailing <b>support</b> are analyzed by the theory of the retaining wall, soil nail and the model of supporting piles. Then calculate the displacement in the limit state by elastic fulcrum method and the instantaneous displacement by layer-wise summation method. The total displacement can be calculated by the combination of the two displacements above, which is between 3. 38 mm and 15. 43 mm and close to the measured data. Simulate excavation and supporting process of the pit by finite difference method, analyze the mechanical property and displacement of <b>latticed</b> soil nailing <b>support.</b> Thus the theory of the calculation method to this supporting model is obtained, offering a reference for the similar projects...|$|R

40|$|Analyzes of {{influence}} of the point thermal bridges of buildings with ventilated facade systems on the thermal properties of envelops are presented in the paper. The relation between the separate components of the envelop were made: thermal properties and thickness of <b>supporting</b> <b>wall's</b> layer; value of thermal conductivity and thickness of insulation layer. Studies have shown, {{that the value of}} the point thermal transmittance, which depended on the thermal properties of the envelop and thickness of the layers, might increase to 35 %. The higher thermal conductivity coefficient of the material of the <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> and thickness of the insulation layer, the larger value the point thermal transmittance. And contrary, if the thickness of the <b>supporting</b> <b>wall</b> and coefficient of thermal conductivity of insulation layer was increased, the value the point thermal transmittance was decreased. It is possible to determine the value of thermal bridges of certain construction design solution by simplified calculations, according to the existing dependencies formulas or graphics. In this case it's necessary to have dependence of the point thermal bridges from thermal insulation properties and dimensions of envelop layers...|$|R

50|$|Foundations: The {{interior}} <b>supporting</b> <b>walls</b> {{were made}} of brick without proper foundations, unlike the thick exterior sandstone <b>walls</b> <b>supported</b> on relatively deep and wide foundations. By 1948 the interior walls were settling significantly into the underlying clay soils and thin rubble base, causing them {{to pull away from}} the exterior walls. In time the exterior walls would have been pulled in and collapsed.|$|R

50|$|Although {{different}} building styles exist {{with features}} specific to each region, most {{share a common}} core design.

50|$|Between 1965 and 1966, the <b>support</b> <b>walls,</b> churchyard {{spaces and}} {{staircase}} were defined and expanded, {{which included the}} reinforcement of the northern, southern and western limits with cap-stone and erecting an eastern fence. The project also involved the cleaning and repair of the staircase access to the main chapel and removal of rubble from the doorway and cracks in the walls, doors, window frames and spaces. These improvements lead to the installation of exterior illumination in 1967 to attract tourism. Reconstruction of the <b>support</b> <b>wall,</b> the roofing, construction of interior doorways and painting of the exterior doors were completed {{at the beginning of}} 1970. Similar cleaning and lateral door replacement occurred by the end of 1979.|$|R
