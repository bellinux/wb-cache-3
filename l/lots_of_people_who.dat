50|$|Thom is {{an outspoken}} {{advocate}} of disabled people's rights. Her personal outlook often inverts the typical negative stereotypes associated with disability, for instance {{she sees her}} Tourette's {{as a source of}} creativity and her wheelchair as a symbol of freedom. She advocates for empowerment of disabled people via the social model of disability, telling Exeunt: As a society there are still <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> think about disability solely in negative terms. The medical model - ‘disabled people are broken and need to be fixed’ - and the charity model - ‘tragic and in need of help’ - are ways of conceptualizing disability that remain widespread even though the social model of disability - ‘people are disabled by a failure to consider difference’ - underpins our legislation and public services.Following her own negative experiences of attending the theatre, Thom has campaigned to get more 'relaxed performances' (a performance where the audience are allowed to make noise and move around, which is more suitable for certain neurodiverse people) in theatres, as well as making every performance of Backstage in Biscuit Land a relaxed performance.|$|E
