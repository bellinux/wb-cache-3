40|$|In the {{beginning}} of her travelogue, A Motor‐Flight Through France (1908), Edith Wharton declares that “the motor‐car has restored the romance of travel. ” Many scholars have taken this statement as an index to the book’s themes. However, my reading closely examines particular moments of travel (specifically Wharton’s visits to Beauvais and Les Andelys) to critically interrogate the proposed relationship between “romance” and the motor‐car. Focusing on Part I of Motor‐Flight, which details Wharton’s travels in the northwest of France, my thesis argues that motor travel actually appears monotonous and uninteresting compared to the rather romantic cathedrals, rivers, and castles that she visits. It appears, I argue, that Wharton’s search for the “romance of travel” is truly satisfied by these physical historical places rather than the modernized motor‐car and its <b>accompanying</b> <b>roads...</b>|$|R

Murong Ling, unable to verify either the truth or the falsehood of the message, decided to defect back to Former Yan. Wang immediately accused Murong Ling of treason, and Murong Chui, in fear, fled, but was captured, although Fu Jiān believed that Murong Ling was acting independently and therefore pardoned Murong Chui. Former Yan did not trust Murong Ling and exiled him, and later that year, after he tried to start a rebellion, {{he was killed in}} battle after being betrayed by his brother Murong Lin.|$|R
