5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time there was a change in castle architecture. Until the late 12thcentury castles {{generally}} had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures). The design of castles was not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the mid-12thcentury. By the end of the 12thcentury or the early 13thcentury, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in shape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.|$|E

50|$|Historic {{desertification}} is <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desert-forming {{process from}} a historic perspective. It was presumed {{in the past}} that <b>the</b> main causes <b>of</b> desertification <b>lay</b> in overuse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> resulting in impoverishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil, reduced vegetation cover, increased risk <b>of</b> drought and <b>the</b> resulting wind erosion. However recent projects to regreen deserts have not met with the success envisaged, and cast doubts on this theory. Research suggests that it is extreme events rather than drought caused by low annual prcipitation, that do the most damage.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> British national identity and textual authenticity in the eighteenth century, focusing on literary practices of myth-making and nation-building by a range of authors from Joseph Addison to James Macpherson. Exploring a variety of 'authentic' as well as 'fabricated' sources, the thesis traces <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> Britishness to authors as diverse as King Alfred, Tacitus and Julius Caesar. The question 'Where are the originals?', which Samuel Johnson levelled at the problematic Ossianic poetry of James Macpherson, serves as an organising principle throughout the thesis. Chapter One outlines an illustrative set <b>of</b> perspectives on <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> post-Union identity in Great Britain, addressing the tensions between mythical originals and <b>the</b> premise <b>of</b> authenticity by authors including Geoffrey of Monmouth, Samuel Johnson, Joseph Addison, Martin Martin and Daniel Defoe. Chapter Two examines Addison's association <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ballad Chevy-Chase with the epic tradition, forming a critical context for reading the problematic ballad Hardyknute {{as a product of}} British nation-building. Chapter Three concentrates on Thomas Warton's miscellany entitled The Union, mapping <b>the</b> intermixture <b>of</b> poetry, oratory and the political tension between old and new British identities during the 1750 s. In Chapter Four, William Blackstone's The Great Charter and Charter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest provides a post-Union context for revisiting both <b>the</b> originals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magna Carta and Gilbert Burnet's 'authentication' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient constitution. In Chapter Five, <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Penal Laws and <b>the</b> subsequent demise <b>of</b> professional bards in Ireland {{set the stage for a}} transformation of Irish bardic tradition in Micheal Coimin's <b>Lay</b> <b>of</b> Oisin in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Youth. Finally, Chapter Six brings these various problems of authentic originals, fabrication and identity to bear on <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> James Macpherson. Concentrating primarily on his pre-Ossianic poetry, this final chapter examines <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> Macpherson's literary and political affiliations, aiming to shed some light on the 'originals' which preceded his Ossianic poetry. Tracing <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> British nationhood from the fragmentary to the epic, my argument concludes with Macpherson, situating him within an Addisonian tradition of myth-making and a Bolingbrokean tradition of nation-building. Whether in his Dictionary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English Language or in the Ossian controversy, Johnson's insistence upon pure originals signifies his English resistance to <b>the</b> mixed identity <b>of</b> Britishness. But it remains to be seen whether Johnson's own work, or indeed culture itself, can sustain <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> his question, 'Where are the originals?...|$|R
