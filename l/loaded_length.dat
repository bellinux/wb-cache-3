40|$|A first {{end surface}} of a coiled {{compression}} spring at its relaxed length is machined to a plane transverse to the spring axis. The spring is then placed in a press structure having first and second opposed planar support surfaces, with the machined spring end surface bearing against the first support surface, the unmachined spring end surface bearing against a planar first {{surface of a}} lateral force compensation member, and an opposite, generally spherically curved surface of the compensation member bearing against the second press structure support surface. The spring is then compressed generally to its <b>loaded</b> <b>length,</b> and a circumferentially spaced series of marks, lying in a plane parallel to the second press structure support surface, are formed on the spring coil on which the second spring end surface lies. The spring is then removed from the press structure, and the second spring end surface is machined to the mark plane.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{validate}} the simplified method of analyzing masonry shear walls using models composed of struts and ties describing ultimate conditions, with the numerical results obtained from micro-modeling using finite elements. In this thesis, the current methodology and standards being used in various national and international codes {{for the analysis of}} masonry shear walls are described and their shortcomings are discussed. The principles and advantages of using the simplified method of analysis of masonry shear walls are also explained. For validating the simplified models, computer simulations are carried out using the micro-modeling approach to calculate the ultimate shear capacity of the wall for different applied normal stresses and different loading lengths. In addition to this, parametric analysis is carried out to understand the effect of material properties like friction angle, tensile strength and compressive strength of masonry. The values obtained from micro-modeling are compared to the results obtained from simplified method of analysis. A modified strut-tie model is proposed to explain the effect of friction angle of unit-mortar interface on the ultimate capacity of shear walls. At the end, the values of different parameters like friction angle, <b>loaded</b> <b>length,</b> and applied normal stress are tabulated, for which the simplified model using struts and ties can be safely applied...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} project is to design and analyze the performance of Shock absorber by varying the wire diameter of the coil spring. The Shock absorber {{which is one of}} the Suspension systems is designed mechanically to handle shock impulse and dissipate kinetic energy. It reduces the amplitude of disturbances leading to increase in comfort and improved ride quality. The spring is compressed quickly when the wheel strikes the bump. The compressed spring rebound to its normal dimension or normal <b>loaded</b> <b>length</b> which causes the body to be lifted. The spring goes down below its normal height when the weight of the vehicle pushes the spring down. This, in turn, causes the spring to rebound again. The spring bouncing process occurs over and over every less each time, until the up-and-down movement finally stops. The vehicle handling becomes very difficult and leads to uncomfortable ride when bouncing is allowed uncontrolled. Hence, the designing of spring in a suspension system is very crucial. The analysis is done by considering bike mass, loads, and no of persons seated on bike. Comparison is done by varying the wire diameter of the coil spring to verify the best dimension for the spring in shock absorber.

40|$|A {{suspension}} system or shock absorber is a mechanical device designed {{to smooth out}} or damp shock impulse, and dissipate kinetic energy. The shock absorbers duty is to absorb or dissipate energy. In a vehicle, it reduces the effect of traveling over rough ground, leading to improved ride quality, and increase in comfort due to substantially reduced amplitude of disturbances. When a vehicle is traveling on a level road and the wheels strike a bump, the spring is compressed quickly. The compressed spring will attempt to return to its normal <b>loaded</b> <b>length</b> and, in so doing, will rebound past its normal height, causing the body to be lifted. The weight of the vehicle will then push the spring down below its normal loaded height. This, in turn, causes the spring to rebound again. This bouncing process is repeated over and over, a little less each time, until the up-and-down movement finally stops. If bouncing is allowed to go uncontrolled, it will not only cause an uncomfortable ride but will make handling of the vehicle very difficult. The design of spring in {{suspension system}} is very important. In this project a shock absorber is designed and a 3 D model is created using Pro/Engineer.

40|$|Mathematical and {{computer}} modelling {{have been playing}} an increasingly {{important role in the}} Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) process. Simulation offers great advantages in the development and analysis phase of products and offers a faster, better and more cost effective way than using physical prototypes alone. The ever increasing demand for new and improved products in the vehicle industry has decreased the time available for the development of new vehicles, {{but at the same time}} the demands on quality, reliability and mass that are set for the vehicle are becoming ever more stringent. These requirements have lead to the investigation of procedures and methodologies such as virtual prototyping that will reduce the development time of new vehicles without inhibiting the quality of the vehicle. In order to perform effective and reliable simulations in the CAE process, accurate simulation models of the vehicle and its associated systems, subsystems and components are required. In the vehicle dynamics context simulation models of the tyres, suspension, springs, damper, etc, are needed. This study will look at creating a validated model of a leaf spring suspension system used on commercial vehicles. The primary goal set for the model is to be able to predict the forces at the points where the suspension system is attached to the vehicle chassis as the model is to be used in full vehicle durability simulations. The component which will receive a considerable amount of attention in this study is the leaf spring. Leaf springs have been used in vehicle suspensions for many years. Even though leaf springs are frequently used in practice they still hold great challenges in creating accurate mathematical models. It is needless to say that an accurate model of a leaf spring is required if accurate full vehicle models are to be created. As all simulation models in this study are required to be validated against experimental measurements a thorough experimental characterisation of the suspension system of interest, as well as two different leaf springs, are performed. In order to measure the forces between the suspension attachment points and the chassis, two six component load cells were developed, calibrated, verified and validated. This study will primarily focus on the modelling of a multi-leaf spring as well as a parabolic leaf spring. The study starts with a literature study into the various existing modelling techniques for leaf springs. A novel leaf spring model, which is based on a macro modelling view point similar to that used for modelling material behaviour, is developed. One of the modelling techniques found in the literature, i. e. neural networks, is also used to model the leaf spring. The use of neural networks is applied and some of the challenges associated with the method are indicated. The accuracy and efficiency of the physics-based elasto-plastic leaf spring model and the non physics-based neural network model are compared. The modified percentage relative error metric is compared to two other quantitative validation metrics that were identified from the literature study. It is concluded that the modified percentage relative error has certain limitations but that it is able to give an accurate and representative account of the agreement/disagreement between two periodic signals around zero. The modified percentage relative error is used to obtain the accuracies of the elasto-plastic leaf spring models and the neural network model. Both models give good results with the neural network being almost 3 times more computationally efficient. The elasto-plastic leaf spring model, for the multi-leaf spring, is further extended to model the behaviour of a parabolic leaf spring. Qualitative validation using experimental data shows that the elasto-plastic leaf spring model is able to accurately predict the vertical behaviour of both the multi-leaf spring as well as the parabolic leaf spring. The elasto-plastic leaf spring model was also combined with a method that is able to capture the effect of changes in the spring stiffness due to changes in the <b>loaded</b> <b>length.</b> Quantitative validation shows that the method proposed for accounting for the change in stiffness due to changes in the <b>loaded</b> <b>length</b> is able to capture this characteristic of the physical leaf spring. Following a systematic modelling approach the elasto-plastic multi-leaf spring model is incorporated into a model of a simplified version of the physical suspension system. The qualitative validation results from this model show that the model is able to accurately predict the forces that are transmitted from the suspension system to the chassis. The models created in this study can be used in future work and, with the addition of more detail the models, can be extended to create a model of the complete suspension system.
