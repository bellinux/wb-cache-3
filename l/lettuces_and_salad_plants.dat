In order to accommodate for the intended uses of indoxacarb, Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the limit of quantification to 1 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 1 mg/kg for the proposed uses on rucola, cress, land cress, red mustard, other <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> <b>salad</b> <b>plants,</b> purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves). Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of indoxacarb on the commodities under consideration.

In order to accommodate for the intended use Germany proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 3 mg/kg for spices/seeds and spices/fruits and berries. Belgium compiled an application to modify the existing MRL for the azoxystrobin in rhubarb. In order to accommodate for the intended use Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 5 mg/kg. France, Germany and Belgium drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA.

In rocky areas the more dominant plant is the introduced Hottentot fig (Carpobrotus edulis). On dry slopes, {{including those of the}} Central Basin, there are various chenopods, including the introduced saltbush Atriplex semibaccata. The plain holds a number of important populations of the island's endemic flora. The slopes of Dry Gut hosted the largest remaining group of barn fern (Ceterach haughtonii). Dry Gut was also home to the most abundant remaining population of the endemic boneseed, (Osteospermum sancta-helenae). Annual flushes of endemic babies'-toes (Hydrodea cryptantha), goosefoot (Chenopodium helenense) and neglected sedge (Bulbostylis neglecta) occur across the plain.

In order to accommodate for the intended uses of metaflumizone in Europe, Italy proposed to raise the existing MRLs for all the crops under consideration, except for pepper, head cabbage, Brussels sprouts, <b>lettuce,</b> scarole, melon <b>and</b> watermelon as well as to raise MRLs for several animal commodities. According to EFSA, the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all crops under consideration, except for melons, watermelons, herbs <b>and</b> <b>salad</b> <b>plants</b> (except <b>lettuce).</b> For peppers, Brussels sprouts and head cabbage no need to modify the existing MRL was identified [...] The new intended use on cotton seed will not affect the existing livestock dietary burden and thus the potential carry-over of metaflumizone residues into food of animal origin was not further investigated.

The less critical NEU use on broccoli <b>and</b> <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> intended uses of metaflumizone on other crops under consideration will not result in consumer intake concerns.

40|$|Ready-to-eat {{vegetable}} salads containing lettuce as a {{main ingredient}} have become popular food items in recent years. Microorganisms associated with these products determine their shelf-life, sensory appeal and safety. This thesis investigates the bacterial ecology of lettuce, aspects of their pre-harvest contamination with microorganisms, {{and the presence of}} antimicrobial constituents in such produce. Commercial pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, fungicides), used during lettuce cultivation were examined as potential sources of microbial contaminants. None of the pesticide concentrates contained viable microorganisms. After reconstitution in water, two of the pesticides supported growth of inoculated species of Pseudomonas, Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Pesticides reconstituted in agricultural waters (bore, dam and river) supported the growth of microorganisms (e. g. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas spp. and coliforms) naturally present in these waters. Unless properly managed, pesticide application could contribute microbial contaminants to vegetable produce, thereby affecting their quality. Bacterial species associated with retail samples of lettuce were examined by plate culture on Tryptone Soy Agar and PCR-DGGE analysis. Macerates <b>and</b> rinses of <b>lettuce</b> sub-samples with <b>and</b> without addition of Tween 80 were examined to maximize bacterial recoveries. Predominant bacteria isolated by agar culture included species of Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Curtobacterium and Burkholderia, at populations of 103 - 106 cfu/g. PCR-DGGE was unable to recover the same incidence of species as agar culture and failed to detect bacteria in many samples. In some samples, PCR-DGGE detected species of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Serratia and Acinetobacter, not found by culture. Failure of the PCR-DGGE analyses was attributed to interference by plant chloroplast DNA. Preparative agarose gel electrophoresis of lettuce macerates was necessary to remove chloroplast DNA before application of PCR-DGGE analysis. Thirty percent of lettuce samples contained Acinetobacter species at 101 - 104 cfu/g when examined after culture on minimal salts agar or enrichment in Baumann enrichment medium. Other Acinetobacter media failed to give reliable isolation of these species from <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> <b>salad</b> vegetables. <b>Lettuce</b> could be an environmental source of Acinetobacter nosocomial infections. Juices, solvent extracts and supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extracts of <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> capsicum samples did not exhibit antimicrobial action against a range of food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria...|$|R

50|$|Its large {{alluvial}} plain allows intensive, high quality agriculture, in historical times based mainly on autarkical crops -- wheat, beans, etc. Then came {{a time when}} Dyer's Madder was cultivated - its first real industrial cultivation. Harvesting this plant required 1000 locals and 600 immigrant workers. This period of cultivation was short-lived -- the market collapsed {{after a few years}} when chemical dyes appeared. However, the construction of the main Paris-Marseille railway via Lyon (the PLM) in the 1840s led to the replacement in local agricultures of madders by other fruit and vegetables. The land had already been leveled and irrigated; it remained only to plant cypress trees to protect the crops from the mistral to begin cultivation of these new crops. The Mediterranean sunshine combined with the presence of a very shallow and abundant water table and irrigation with water from the Canal des Alpines gave varied fruit (apples, pears, peaches, etc.) and vegetable (beans, eggplant, tomatoes, zucchini, etc.) crops.

NoV outbreaks, however, have also been known to occur from other common-source food-borne vehicles, such as <b>lettuce,</b> frozen raspberries, <b>and</b> <b>salad.</b> In this study, we evaluated romaine lettuce as a potential vehicle for NoV transmission by testing the binding and distribution of NoV {{to the surface of}} romaine.

An extract of romaine lettuce leaves in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (romaine extract [RE]) bound rNVLP in a dose-dependent manner. RE did not bind rNVLP by histo-blood group antigens (HBGA), nor was RE competitive with rNVLP binding to porcine gastric mucin. These results suggested that non-HBGA molecules in RE bind rNVLP by a binding site(s) that is different from the defined binding pocket on the virion. Extracts of cilantro, iceberg <b>lettuce,</b> spinach, <b>and</b> celery also bound rNVLP.
