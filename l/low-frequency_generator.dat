40|$|Abstract: The {{need for}} {{accurate}} calibration of current meters in the picoampere range is continuously increasing. A traceable current source for calibration of meters in the 100 fA – 100 pA current range is here presented. The source {{is based on}} a <b>low-frequency</b> <b>generator</b> ramp generator, which charges and discharges a gas-dielectric capacitor. Current traceability is given by the measurement of voltage parameters with a sampling voltmeter, and by calibration of the capacitor at audio frequency. The source has been employed in the EUROMET.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for the {{measurement}} of (group) delay from the radio-frequency (RF) input to the intermediate-frequency (IF) output of a mixer or a receiver. The method is particularly convenient for measuring the change in group delay with the local-oscillator (LO) tuning frequency of the receiver since the method does not require access to, or even knowledge of, the LO signal. The method employs a calibrated comb (impulse) generator. Other required equipment {{is limited to a}} reference signal generator and a digitizer of modest bandwidth, allowing the measurement to rely on a <b>low-frequency</b> <b>generator</b> and an oscilloscope. Simulated and measured data are presented to verify the approach. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of spike discharge in eccentric cell axons from the in situ lateral eye of Limulus, under small sinusoidal modulation {{of light to}} which the eye is adapted, are described over two decades of light intensity and nearly three decades of frequency. Steady-state lateral inhibition coefficients, derived from the very low-frequency response, average 0. 04 at three interommatidial spacings. The gain vs. frequency of a singly illuminated ommatidium is described closely from 0. 004 to 0. 4 cps by the linear transfer function s 0. 25; this function also accounts approximately for the measured phase leads, the small signal adaptation following small step inputs, and for Pinter's (1966) earlier <b>low-frequency</b> <b>generator</b> potential data. We suggest that such dynamics could arise from a summation in the generator potential of distributed intensity-dependent relaxation processes along the dendrite and rhabdome. Analysis of the dynamic responses of an eccentric cell with and without simultaneously modulated illumination of particular neighbors indicates an effect equivalent to self-inhibition acting via a first-order low-pass filter with time constant 0. 42 sec, and steady-state gain near 4. 0. The corresponding filters for lateral inhibition required time constants from 0. 35 to 1 sec and effective finite delay of 50 – 90 msec...|$|E

40|$|The Italian {{national}} standard of direct current is being extended {{down to the}} femtoampere range. Two current sources have been developed. The first one, working in the 100 pA to 100 fA range, {{is based on a}} <b>low-frequency</b> trapezoidal wave <b>generator,</b> measured with a sampling digital voltmeter at regular time intervals, which charges and discharges a gas-dielectric capacitor. The second, working in the 10 -mu A to 10 -pA range, makes use of a calibrated resistor to generate a known current.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on results of an {{intensive}} study, which has been performed to understand and tune deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) processes for optimized aspect ratio, trench profile and etch mask selectivity. The development of the DRIE process was mainly driven by the increase of the etch depth. Trenches, made with these DRIE processes, are used for the fabrication of micro-scanner mirrors. Filled trenches are integrated for electrical isolation, open trenches for the etching of mechanical separated structures, e. g. mirror spring and comb electrodes. Especially for micro-scanners with high frequencies, the mirror thickness is of great importance due to the dependence on the dynamic mirror deformation. We investigated {{the influence of the}} passivation process by lowering the waferchuck temperature und by adding oxygen plasma as inhibitor. After an etch tool upgrade, we analyzed also the influence of a <b>low-frequency</b> (LF) <b>generator</b> and a new control software on the etch results. Goal of these developments of the DRIE process was a higher aspect ratio, an improved filling of isolation trenches and a higher selectivity to the etch mask...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a self-testable BIST applica- tion for non-linearity test in high-speed high-performance ADCs in nanometric CMOS technologies. The technique {{makes use of}} an on-chip <b>low-frequency</b> signal <b>generator</b> optimized toward high accuracy, followed by a dedicated buffer based on a resistive feedback amplifier. This buffer has two main features: it isolates the on-chip generator output from the high-frequency switching noise at the input sampling of the ADC under test, and it allows a robust injection of a controlled offset to apply double-histogram techniques for linearity evaluation. This approach results in a true self-testable BIST strategy making feasible the simultaneous estimation of the non-linearity for both the generator and the ADCUT. In order to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed circuitry, a practical design in a 1. 8 V 0. 18 m CMOS process is presented here as demonstrator. Transistor-level simu- lation results with a 2 Vpp sin! usoidal test-stimulus show an effec- tive resolution in static conditions greater than 15 bits, being a suitable solution for the ADC static test with effective resolutions {{in the order of}} 13 bits and 100 Msps of sampling frequency...|$|R
5000|$|Early analog synthesizers used {{technology}} from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment. They were generally [...] "modular" [...] synthesizers, {{consisting of a}} number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators. Synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), voltage-controlled filters (VCFs), and voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). The control voltage varied frequency in VCOs and VCFs, and attenuation (gain) in VCAs. Additionally, they used envelope <b>generators,</b> <b>low-frequency</b> oscillators, and ring modulators.Some synthesizers also had effects devices, such as reverb units, or tools such as sequencers or sound mixers. Because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them, an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system.|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} interest in electrified railways {{can be explained by}} their huge capacity, high efficiency, and low pollution. Today’s electrified railway is expecting higher demands for electric power for increased speeds, increased traffic volume capacity, and heavier freight loads. This will in turn impose greater demands on railway infrastructure managers to increase the overall capacity of their railways without traffic disruption. The increasing demand for railway transportation services is having a significant effect on important stakeholder requirements, such as safety, punctuality, dependability, sustainability and costs. This in turn is affecting railway practices in the areas of operation, maintenance, and modernisation. The traction power supply system (TPSS) {{is one of the most}} important parts of the electrified railway system due to its responsibility for providing a continuous and adequate electrical power for electric railway vehicles and its great impact on the availability performance. The TPSS provides the railway with power either directly with <b>low-frequency</b> <b>generators</b> or indirectly via frequency converters (FCs). In the converter-based electrified railway network, frequency converter stations represent the generation system which converts the electric power from the three-phase 50 Hz public grid to electric power for the single-phase 16. 7 Hz traction grid. Obviously, any operational problems in the FCs will cause an unavailability of traction power capacity and consequently entail operational problems for trains, resulting in speed reduction, train delays, or cancellations. Shortages of traction power may occur due to a loss of capacity or a shortage of reserve capacity. The installed capacity should be capable of meeting the system load in the case of unexpectedly large loads, in the event of one or more FC units not being in service due to forced outages or scheduled maintenance, or when a combination of these scenarios takes place. The purpose of the research for this thesis has been to develop methodologies and tools for availability evaluation and improvement of FCs and the traction power capacity, in order to prevent and mitigate outage events through optimal decisions for improvement. To fulfil the stated purpose, empirical data have been collected from reporting databases, interviews, and documents. Examples of the data gathered are train delay statistics, failure statistics, and electrical measurements. The data have been analysed on two different levels, the FC type level and the FC station level, as well as by applying theories related to RAM analysis. The study has addressed issues regarding availability performance as follows: improvement of data reporting system planning, reliability modelling, evaluation of availability performance, and, finally, identification of effective ways to reduce shortages of traction power. The analysis outcome has revealed the areas where resources must be invested for improvement to reduce and prevent loss of load due to capacity outages.
