This paper describes the design concept and theory of this new mechanical arm based on the direct-drive method using rare-earth DC torque motors. Because these motors have high torque, light weight and compact size, we can construct robots with far better performance than those presently available. For example, we can eliminate all the transmission mechanisms between the motors and their loads, such as reducers and chain belts, and construct a simple mechanism (direct-drive) where the arm links are directly coupled to the motor rotors and stators.

The research is performed within the project based on development of socially acceptable robot named "SARA". Two approaches for spine realization of humanoids exist: multi-joint viscoelastic structures (5 - 10 joints) that have variable flexibility and structures that consist of one joint - torso/waist joint, which has low elasticity and high stiffness. We propose multi-joint flexible structure with stiff, <b>low</b> <b>backlash</b> and self-locking mechanisms that require small actuators.

40|$|Introduction: Multileaf {{collimator}} (MLC) is {{state of}} the art among the radiation field shaping systems for conformal radiotherapy techniques. Some advantages of this system are as follow: reduction of treatment time, higher precision in conforming the radiation field to the projection of the target volume and lowering the chance of errors made by technologists. The purpose of this research was to design and construct the mechanical section of a prototype MLC.   Material and Methods: The MLC consists of a base plate, 52 leaves, 2 leaf carriages, 2 nuts and 52 triangular thread screws. The leaves are arranged in two opposing banks each containing 26 leaves. The carriages are used to extend the movement of the leaves. The components of the MLC are fabricated by machining processes. The MLC is designed to be mounted on the conventional linear accelerators as an add-on accessory. The leaves were made of aluminum. The dimensions of the leaves are 5 x 200 x 50 mm.   Result: The collimator system weighs approximately 37 kg excluding the leaves. The projected width of each leaf on the isocenter of a Varian linear accelerator is 10 mm. The movement of the leaves is accomplished by using the triangular thread screws. The screws required to have a <b>low</b> axial <b>backlash</b> which in turn results in lower precision positioning of the leaves. The positioning accuracy of each leaf is approximately 1. 4 mm. Discussion and Conclusion: Mashhad MLC system, in it’s present form and design weighs 37 kg. but if Aluminum blades are replaced by tungsten ones then the over all weights of MLC may exceed the weight limit a linac may hold. Therefore futher modifications are required to reduce the MLC total weight.

To obtain high stiffness, the cable is typically wrapped around the input and output drum in a figure-eight pattern multiple times. This stiffness can be determined by analyzing the amount of deformation between the cable and the drums and the friction caused by this contact. In product literature and various textbooks [1][2][3], it was noticed that different methods of determining the stiffness of the transmission drive were presented depending how friction was considered. It is found the model which considers the extension from the external torque and preload force matches experimental data {{along with the other}} model that defined the area of traction to act in a certain section of the drum.

40|$|The Hollow Cylinder Apparatus (HCA) is {{the only}} soil test device that can {{facilitate}} independent control of both the magnitudes and directions of the principal stresses. The stress history and loading conditions {{at a point in}} a soil deposit can be reproduced on a Hollow Cylindrical (HC) specimen, and its constitutive behaviour and pore-pressure response measured. However, shortcomings in the equipment, instrumentation and the procedural approaches can potentially invalidate the test results obtained from existing HCAs. Measurement and process control limitations confine their operation to static testing over the strain range from 0. 0001 to 0. 20. Many of the existing HCAs are incapable of generalised stress path testing. A new HCA that can simulate the complex loading conditions at a point in a soil deposit, on a hollow cylindrical test specimen, was developed. It facilitates accurate measurements of the specimen?s constitutive and pore-pressure responses over the complete strain range during stress path testing or displacement-controlled loading. Test specimen dimensions, which limit the stress non-uniformity during testing to an acceptable level, were identified. A sample preparation apparatus was also developed and a technique was perfected to reconstitute saturated sand specimens in the new apparatus. The research and development of the new HCA?s cell, its pressure systems, the servo-mechanisms, which displace and rotate the loading piston, their instrumentation and ancillary equipment, are described. Linear actuators control the hydraulic systems, which apply the inner and outer confining pressures and the back-pressure to the specimen. Innovative servo-mechanisms, which induce an axial force and a torque across the specimen, are mounted beneath the cell {{so that it can be}} readily assembled and disassembled by an operator. The cell?s tie bars are located inside its acrylic cylinder and the load path through it is extremely stiff. The servo-mechanisms can quasi-statically or dynamically load specimens of all soil types, weak rock and pavement base materials in direct compression, extension or pure torsion, to failure. They can also apply tensile normal stresses to the test specimen to facilitate investigations into the engineering properties of materials other than soil. The mechanisms have a <b>low</b> inertia, zero <b>backlash</b> and insignificant compliance values. The axial force, torque and the confining pressures that are applied and the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s polar deformational, pore-pressure and volume change responses can be accurately measured. Its static deformational response can be measured over the specimen?s zone of uniform stress, near its mid-height using instruments located inside the cell. These instruments can be remotely relocated during a test to accommodate the specimen?s deformational response. The control sensitivity of the pressure systems and servo-mechanisms and the instruments 2 ̆ 7 resolution and accuracy values are sufficient to facilitate low amplitude cyclic testing in order to determine the soil?s quasi-elastic constitutive properties. The specimen 2 ̆ 7 s boundary displacements can also be measured using instruments located outside the cell. They facilitate dynamic measurements over the reduced strain range from the order of 10 - 4 strain, to failure. A hollow-shaft type encoder was uniquely incorporated in this instance to measure the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s twist. The servo-mechanisms can readily produce the high-speed response, which is necessary to facilitate accurate dynamic testing. A complementary control system was integrated in the new HCA with the aim of developing a fully automated stress path and displacement-controlled test device. Test specimens of 71 mm inner diameter, 100 mm outer diameter and 200 mm high were selected in view of theoretical and practical considerations. These dimensions also facilitate the testing of undisturbed samples. The development of the sample preparation apparatus and the technique, which employs the wet-pluviation method followed by tapping that was perfected, is described. This technique can consistently reconstitute specimens with a uniform controlled density and their dimensions have excellent repeatability...|$|R

40|$|Gears with {{involute}} profile {{have been used}} broadly as power transmission mechanisms. High speed reduction ratios can be obtained with trains of gears, resulting in high power losses due to friction. Compound planetary gears allow obtaining high speed reduction ratios with a lower number of gears involved in the power transmission, hence transmitting it with higher efficiency. Although high efficiency is a main requisite for speed reducers, for some applications it may be desirable to have an irreversible mechanism. A modern trend in power transmission systems is to use cycloidal profile gears. These systems present <b>low</b> <b>backlash,</b> high load capability and higher efficiency due to the rolling motion.

Automated jacks supporting the primary reflector were selected as the appropriate technology since they promised greater performance and potentially lower costs than a homologous or carbon fiber design, and had certain advantages over an active secondary. The design of the Active Surface has presented many challenges. Since the actuators are mounted on a tipping structure, it was required that they support a significant side-load.

Cycloid gear drive is a transmission device that is commonly used to boost up the output torque. It has been widely applied in many industrial applications including ship power transmission, robotic actuation, hybrid electric vehicle and renewable energy due to advantages of high mechanical efficiency, <b>low</b> <b>backlash,</b> compact size and high ratio mechanical transmission. The structure of cycloid gear is different from common gears which engage externally, it engages internally and operates in cycloidal motion. In robotic industry, requirements on compact size and high transmission ratio result {{in the application of}} cycloid gear drives. Chapter 2 would introduce it in detail. Synchronous {{electric machine}} has been widely applied and investigated for more than a century. In industry, synchronous machines are used for power generating, electric power drive and many other electro-mechanical transformations. In particular, permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) is the most common one because the control strategy is relatively simple with the help of booming power electronics. Commonly, PMSM is used as mechanical power input in robotic industry. Chapter 3 would elaborate it. Typical human-sized legged locomotion needs an output torque around 300 N∙m to accomplish motions. The direct drive design uses only one high-torque electric machine with multi-stage transmission cannot meet the size and weight requirement of the leg actuation.

40|$|Epicyclic {{mechanisms}} {{have found}} wide applications in industry, especially in automobiles and robotics. Low efficiency {{due to the}} high gearing power occurring in an epicyclic train is an important problem. This thesis develops a novel family of epicyclic transmissions, based on cams and rollers. This kind of cam-based mechanical transmissions, Speed-o-Cam (SoC), offers features such as high stiffness, <b>low</b> <b>backlash,</b> and high efficiency. We develop multi-lobbed cam profiles, the sun cam and the ring cam, which comprise an epicyclic cam train (ECT) with the roller follower. New design criteria are established: the generalized transmission index (GTI) and the contact ratio in cam transmissions. The GTI is an index that quantifies the force transmission quality in a mechanism, thereby generalizing the pressure angle, the transmission angle, and the transmission index (TI) proposed by Sutherland and Roth in 1973. The contact ratio is an index of the quantity of overlap occurring between two conjugate cams during transmission. A contact ratio greater than unity guarantees smooth motion during operation. In order to avoid "poor" transmission, we apply an undercutting technique on the cam profile to achieve a smooth motion. We introduce two new concepts, virtual power and virtual power ratio, and derive an original algorithm to compute the efficiency in an epicyclic train upon the assumption that power loss is due only to friction upon meshing. The results show that friction has a larger effect on the total efficiency of an epicyclic train than on a simple train. Examples are given to validate this algorithm, by comparison of our results with previous works. The dual-wheel transmission (DWT), proposed elsewhere using epicyclic gear trains (EGTs), is designed here with epicyclic trains of cams and rollers. We optimize the DWT to achieve a compact design and a high transmission performance. Furthermore, we define the total transmission index (TTI), which allow us to evaluate the final DWT design. Two virtual prototypes of the DWT, the central and the offset versions, are generated: the former is capable of quasi-omnidirectional mobility, the latter of full omnidirectional mobility. Finally, we include a general kinematic analysis of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) with single-wheel drives and apply this method to WMRs with DWT units; then, we obtain symbolic solutions to the direct kinematics (DK) and inverse kinematics (IK) problems, for both central and offset types of units...|$|E
