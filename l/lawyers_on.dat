5|$|Based upon another {{recommendation}} from Cabranes, Sotomayor {{was a member}} of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992. There she was a top policy maker who worked actively with the organization's <b>lawyers</b> <b>on</b> issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights. The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009 in an {{out-of-court}} discussion, <b>lawyers</b> <b>on</b> {{behalf of}} El-Sherbini's family and widower approached the Ministry of Justice of the State of Saxony about compensation. In the verdict on 11 November 2009, Judge Birgit Wiegand granted the claimant's request (Adhäsionsantrag, § 406 StPO) to {{claim for damages}} against the defendant in an 'adherent case' within the remit of this criminal case. It established — without a separate trial for a private law claim — that Wiens {{has an obligation to}} compensate Okaz and El-Sherbini's beneficiaries for having harmed Okaz and killed El-Sherbini.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the <b>lawyers</b> <b>on</b> both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial at}} the upper {{regional}} court in Dresden began on 26 October 2009. It took place under strict security precautions due to alleged death threats to Wiens. All concurrent trials were transferred to other local venues, due to the security concerns, the great interest by the national and international media, and the public. El-Sherbini's widower, brother and parents acted {{in the role of}} 'co-claimant' and were represented by eight <b>lawyers.</b> <b>On</b> {{the first day of the}} trial, the entire prosecution counsel constituted of eight lawyers from Germany, France and Egypt was present in court; the defendant arrived in court shrouded behind a mask, sunglasses, hat and a hood. The judge asked the defendant to remove his head attire and to confirm his name and date of birth. The defendant complied, except for removing his sunglasses, for which he was fined for contempt of court. The defence counsel motioned for the judges to be removed from the trial on the grounds of bias as they were colleagues of witnesses and worked near the crime scene. This was denied by a separate panel that had ruled on this motion.|$|E

25|$|The American lawyers’ {{argument}} can be summarized as {{trying to prove that}} “invisible injury” occurred in the region. Large sums of money rested on the results of this case as the decision would affect various other smelting projects across North America; as such, the lawyers representing Cominco successfully limited the definition of damage to the actual, observable, economic damage. <b>Lawyers</b> <b>on</b> both sides were well practiced with substantial experience. R.C. “Judge” Crowe, VP of Cominco and a Montreal Corporate Lawyer, and John E. Read represented Cominco. The U.S. hired Jacob G. Metzger, a State Department attorney with experience in negotiating international claims. Metzger had a habit of not writing his arguments down, and when he died in 1937 the American scientists and lawyers went into the hearing unprepared.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of his chief defense lawyer, Khamis al-Obeidi, Saddam began a hunger strike, protesting against the lack of international protection for <b>lawyers,</b> <b>On</b> 23 June 2006, {{it was reported that}} Saddam ended his hunger strike, having missed one meal. On 27 June 2006, two of Saddam Hussein's lawyers, Ramsey Clark, a former US Attorney-General, and Curtis Doebbler, held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., to call for immediate security for all the Iraqi defense lawyers and to complain in a written statement that the trial was unfair, and was being conducted by the American authorities using Iraqis as a front. The two lawyers claimed that the United States had refused to provide adequate protection for the defense lawyers despite repeated requests that were made and that the United States was intentionally ensuring an unfair trial.|$|E
500|$|The SS Court Main Office (Hauptamt SS-Gericht) was an {{internal}} legal system for conducting investigations, trials, and punishment of the SS and police. It {{had more than}} 600 <b>lawyers</b> <b>on</b> staff in the main offices in Berlin and Munich. Proceedings were conducted at 38 regional SS courts throughout Germany. It was the only authority authorized to try SS personnel, except for SS members who were on active duty in the Wehrmacht (in such cases, the SS member in question was tried by a standard military tribunal). Its creation placed the SS {{beyond the reach of}} civilian legal authority. Himmler personally intervened as he saw fit regarding convictions and punishment. The historian Karl Dietrich Bracher describes this court system as one factor {{in the creation of the}} Nazi totalitarian police state, as it removed objective legal procedures, rendering citizens defenseless against the [...] "summary justice of the SS terror." ...|$|E

500|$|Though the UFA MLAs {{were not}} willing to accept a non-farmer as premier, many of them {{realized}} that the post of Attorney-General should go to a lawyer. Others were less convinced, and Brownlee was invited to address the UFA caucus. He acknowledged {{that there was no}} constitutional requirement on the question, but advised that a non-lawyer attorney-general would be wholly reliant on the advice of the <b>lawyers</b> <b>on</b> his staff. With the caucus convinced, Greenfield asked Brownlee to accept the position. Brownlee demurred, reluctant to take the resulting cut in income, not eager to leave his family in Calgary to work in Edmonton (the provincial capital), and leery of the high expectations invested in the new government by the province's farmers. [...] Ultimately, a combination of duty, loyalty, and ambition convinced him to accept the position. [...] Though the choice of cabinet ministers is traditionally the prerogative of the premier, as part of the UFA's agenda of democratic reform Greenfield agreed to present his choices to the caucus for vetting. Brownlee was approved August 11, 1921, and was sworn in two days later.|$|E
500|$|Police arrested Julie Schenecker at the scene, {{later that}} day she was {{admitted}} to hospital for a [...] "pre-existing medical condition". She was released {{the next day and}} taken to Hillsborough County Jail, where she was held without bail. On February 9, 2011, Schenecker was indicted by a grand jury for first degree murder. Her arraignment was set for February 16, where she entered a plea of not guilty, with her defense team indicating they would pursue an insanity defense. Prosecutors initially said they would seek the death penalty for Schenecker., but later declined to do so. In August 2012, <b>lawyers</b> <b>on</b> both sides said they needed a year to review computer files found on the computer in the Schenecker home before trial. In December 2012, at a hearing a trial date was set for October 7, 2013, for Julie Schenecker. In August 2013, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Emmett Lamar Battles granted a defense motion requesting more time to review evidence and depose expert witnesses. The trial was delayed until April 28, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The {{philosophy}} {{of law is}} commonly known as jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence asks [...] "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks [...] "what is law?" [...] John Austin's utilitarian answer was that law is [...] "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience". Natural <b>lawyers</b> <b>on</b> the other side, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of [...] "natural law" [...] emerged in ancient Greek philosophy concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of Western culture through the writings of Thomas Aquinas, notably his Treatise on Law.|$|E

Peck concluded that RAF [...] "was {{the response to}} criminal aggression of the U.S. government in Indochina and {{the assistance of the}} German government. The real terrorist was my government." [...] Thomas presented data about the joint operations of FRG and US secret services in Eastern Europe.
