5|$|Days {{after the}} 2011 {{parliamentary}} elections in early December 2011, {{it was suggested}} by Vesna Pusić– already recognized as the future Minister of Foreign and European Affairs– that the referendum should be postponed until March 2012 to allow better preparation for the poll. The suggestion was soon followed by a similar request made by GONG that the referendum be postponed until mid-February or later; its request was also supported by five major trade unions. GONG's request was made {{because of what they}} stated to be: poor information provided to citizens; undefined procedures for voter registration away from a voter's permanent residence; unclear directions for voting abroad; no <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> specifically defining the composition of ballot counting commissions; no provisions for referendum vote monitoring by partisan, non-partisan and foreign monitors; no <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> regarding referendum funding (since the 2011 state budget did not appropriate any funds to cover referendum expenses); no <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> funding the pro-referendum campaign or allowing the campaign itself; and the lack of restrictions against campaigning {{on the day of the}} referendum. The union support for this request was due to the government's ultimately not putting forward the other referendum (altering the conditions for referendums from citizens by changing the number of petitioners required and the time allowed to gather their signatures), which they had earlier agreed to do. Another request to postpone the election was made by more than a thousand signatories of a petition to the government, demanding that the referendum be postponed until after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) returned the final verdict in the case against generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač. They cited concerns over EU support for the ICTY, which they describe as biased; they therefore questioned if the EU favoured some nations over others.|$|E

5000|$|In Greece every court {{controls}} {{the constitutionality of}} the laws and there is no [...] "permanent" [...] Supreme Constitutional Court, as in Spain, Germany etc. If any court judges a <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> as [...] "unconstitutional", it decides not to apply it, but it has not the power to declare the <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> [...] "null and void". This restriction is also binding for the Supreme Courts, which declare the unconstitutional <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> [...] "inapplicable". Nonetheless, if a case concerning the constitutionality of a law is introduced into the Supreme Special Court (after the issuing of contradictory decisions of the Supreme Courts), the Court has the constitutional right to declare an unconstitutional <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> as [...] "powerless".

Montserrat also issues land holding licenses to CARICOM nationals as an administrative procedure in seeking to comply with CARICOM’s right of establishment obligations, and intends to remove all impediments except for those related to cost recovery.

25|$|According to GlobalSecurity, police {{impunity}} {{and corruption}} are serious problems. In 2008 President Assad issued {{a law that}} mandates that only the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces may issue an arrest warrant {{in the case of}} a crime committed by a military officer, member of the internal security forces, or customs police officer in the pursuit of his normal duties, and that such cases must be tried in military courts. Arbitrary and false arrests are also problems, and detainees had no legal redress. According to the accusations, the authorities use the Emergency Law to detain persons critical of the government and charge them with a wide range of political crimes, including treason. Incommunicado detention was a severe problem. Many persons who disappeared were believed to be either in long-term detention without charge or possibly to have died while detained. Many detainees brought to trial were held incommunicado for years, and their trials were often marked by irregularities and lack of due process. A shortage of available courts and lack of <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> for a speedy trial or plea bargaining led to lengthy pretrial detentions.|$|E
25|$|Midwives {{were known}} by many {{different}} titles in antiquity, ranging from iatrinē (Gr. nurse), maia (Gr., midwife), obstetrix (Lat., obstetrician), and medica (Lat., doctor). It appears as though midwifery was treated {{differently in the}} Eastern end of the Mediterranean basin {{as opposed to the}} West. In the East, some women advanced beyond the profession of midwife (maia) to that of gynaecologist (iatros gynaikeios, translated as women's doctor), for which formal training was required. Also, there were some gynecological tracts circulating in the medical and educated circles of the East that were written by women with Greek names, although these women were few in number. Based on these facts, it would appear that midwifery in the East was a respectable profession in which respectable women could earn their livelihoods and enough esteem to publish works read and cited by male physicians. In fact, a number of Roman <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> strongly suggest that midwives enjoyed status and remuneration comparable to that of male doctors. One example of such a midwife is Salpe of Lemnos, who wrote on women’s diseases and was mentioned several times in the works of Pliny.|$|E
