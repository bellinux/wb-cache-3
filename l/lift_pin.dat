40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} {{the results of the}} 150 % rated capacity load test performed by DynCorp Hoisting and Rigging on the CASTOR GSF special cask lifting beams. The two lifting beams were originally rated and tested at 20, 000 kg (44, 000 lb) by the cask manufacturer in Germany. The testing performed by DynCorp rated and tested the lifting beams to 30, 000 kg (66, 000 lb) + 0 %, - 5 %, for Hanford Site use. The CASTOR GSF cask, used to transport isotopic Heat Sources (canisters), must be lifted with its own designed lifting beam system (Figures 1, 2, and 3). As designed, the beam material is RSt 37 - 2 (equivalent to American Society for Testing and Materials [ASTM] A- 570), the eye plate is St 52 - 2 (equivalent to ASTM A- 516), and the <b>lifting</b> <b>pin</b> is St 50 (equivalent to ASTM A- 515). The beam has two opposing 58 mm (2. 3 in.) diameter by 120 mm(4. 7 in.) length, high grade steel pins that engage the cask for <b>lifting.</b> The <b>pins</b> have a manual locking mechanism to prevent disengagement from the casks.

5000|$|The 'Double Three-legged Gravity Escapement' {{shown here}} {{is a form of}} {{escapement}} first devised by a barrister named Bloxam and later improved by Lord Grimthorpe. It is the standard for all really accurate 'Tower' clocks. [...] In the animation shown here the two [...] "gravity arms" [...] are coloured blue and red. The two three-legged escape wheels are also coloured blue and red. They work in two parallel planes so that the blue wheel only impacts the locking block on the blue arm and the red wheel only impacts the red arm. In a real escapement these impacts give rise to loud audible [...] "ticks" [...] and these are indicated by the appearance of a * beside the locking blocks. The three black <b>lifting</b> <b>pins</b> are key to the operation of the escapement. They cause the weighted gravity arms to be raised by an amount indicated by the pair of parallel lines {{on each side of the}} escapement. This gain in potential energy is the energy given to the pendulum on each cycle. For the Trinity College Cambridge Clock a mass of around 50 grams is lifted through 3 mm each 1.5 seconds - which works out to 1 mW of power. The driving power from the falling weight is about 12 mW, so t{{here is a}} substantial excess of power used to drive the escapement. Much of this energy is dissipated in the acceleration and deceleration of the frictional [...] "fly" [...] attached to the escape wheels.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of wheel studs over wheel bolts is greater ease for tire changes by creating {{the ability to}} lift both the wheel and tire onto the studs creating the ability to hold and locate the assembly during tire changes {{rather than trying to}} hold up the wheel and tire while lining up the holes to insert a bolt. Many wheels that use bolts also have one or more small locator pins to assist this: the wheel is <b>lifted</b> onto the <b>pins,</b> then the bolts inserted. Once the bolts are tightened and the wheel is fully installed, the pins have no further function whilst the vehicle is being driven.|$|R
50|$|To {{fasten the}} binding, the spring {{assembly}} was lifted, sliding on a plastic disk. After being raised slightly it could move forward, releasing all {{tension on the}} clips. A metal clip prevented it from moving under the boot area, while also acting as a mounting spot for a safety strap. The boot could then be forced onto the angled upper area of the clips, forcing them to open outward, and then fastened by pushing the spring back down to re-apply tension. Step-in action in the S-2/3/4 series was accomplished by a small spring-loaded pin catch on the cams. When the spring assembly was <b>lifted,</b> the <b>pin</b> was forced upward into a hole on the T-arm running to the spring, holding it forward. When the skier stepped in, the pin would be pushed down and release the arm, springing the clips closed. The S-9 model improved on this using a large lever over the spring assembly that released spring pressure by pushing the spring forward when it was pushed down with a ski pole. The lever also had a finger that pressed up on the sole of the boot, helping it pop open the clips. This gave the system true step-in, step-out behaviour.|$|R

50|$|When the pallet {{is pushing}} the escape wheel {{backwards}} it is also being driven hard against its stop. To prevent wear, or damage, the stops are designed to give way. Each stop is hinged about the same axis as its pallet. The pallets are tail-heavy but the stops are nose-heavy, tending to fall towards the wheel. The stops are sufficiently nose-heavy {{that the combination of}} pallet plus stop also tends to fall towards the wheel but this is prevented by a fixed pin on the anchor. This means that the pin holds the stop which holds the pallet in just the right place to engage cleanly with the escape wheel. When the pallet meets the wheel, it pushes the wheel backwards and as it does it lifts the stop off its pin. When the wheel then pushes the pallet, the stop comes back down onto its pin and parts company with its pallet. Each stop is also <b>lifted</b> off its <b>pin</b> once in each cycle by the momentum of the arriving pallet.|$|R
2500|$|When a pin rolls back, {{the smaller}} {{diameter}} of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball return wheel. As the pins are still moving from the shaking by the board, a pin will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. It may be seated in the pinwheel head-first or base-first. [...] The wheel brings the pin {{to the top and}} drops it into a metal tray, called a [...] "turnaround pan", similar to what exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pin distributor arm. It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the bowler. The weight of the pin's body makes it drop into the pan base-first, so that the pin's base is facing the bowler. From there a conveyor belt <b>lifts</b> the <b>pin</b> up, letting it slide into one of ten spots – nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin – in a rotating metal basket called the [...] "turret" [...] (located just above the deck) with only the deck itself, protected with the attached sheet metal [...] "deck shield", visible to the bowler as it descends to handle the pins. When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or [...] "indexes") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute {{in the center of the}} turret being filled last. Once the turret is full, and the empty deck reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table, which lowers them onto the lane to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck.|$|R
40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1978 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Assn. and the Hydrology Section - Arizona Academy of Science - April 14 - 15, 1978, Flagstaff, ArizonaDescribed is a {{microroughness}} meter {{developed to}} obtain numerous and accurate measurements of rangeland surface microroughness and characteristics.

Performance tests on multi-plot sprinkler infiltrometer studies conducted on the Santa Rita Experimental Range in southeastern Arizona indicated that the meter was accurate and relatively precise in repeating soil surface roughness measurements but was not precise in defining the theoretical characteristics of constructed surfaces. It was concluded, however, that these errors in precision were insignificant and due partly to surface geometry construction errors and that the meter is a convenient, quick, simple and accurate means of measuring surface roughness in studies requiring many plots and data points...|$|R

5000|$|This game {{is played}} by rolling a ball down an alley towards nine pins. Unlike the ten-pin ball — and like the ones used for the eastern North American [...] "small-ball" [...] bowling sports of five pin bowling, candlepin and duckpin — the ninepin ball mostly has no holes for the fingers, though there exist special balls with two finger holes {{designed}} for novice players. The lanes are 19.5 m long and have no oil on them. The nine pins (literally known as [...] "cones" [...] in the local languages) are placed in a diamond shape on the alley. In modern lane systems the pins are reset by a pin-setter machine which <b>lifts</b> up the <b>pins,</b> each connected by a string on top, and lowers {{them back into the}} diamond shape for the next roll. The strings can be a positive factor for the bowler, as they can knock down other pins, or a negative factor, as they can get tangled up, though this is not always a problem as the machine can retract the strings for a short distance and allow a few seconds for them to untangle automatically. Compared with the ten-pin [...] "free-fall" [...] pin-setter, the string pin-setter has fewer moving parts, consumes less power, and costs less to maintain.|$|R
3000|$|Various casting methods (Plaster, Moulage, Faxfilm (Cowres, Davm L, Dodge, James K. A Method for Comparison of Tool Marks, 1948; Science and Practice Committee Report, 1949), {{plasticine}} (Kirk, 1953; O'hara & Osterbtrn, 1949), thermoplastics (Kirk, 1953), wax and electroplating (Tarko, 1948)) {{have been}} proposed for reproduction and comparison of individual characteristics marks on fired cartridge cases {{as an aid to}} firearms and tool mark identification. Most of the proposed methods had little or limited success due to time-consuming techniques and unsatisfactory results. In 1938, Moritz proposed a technique utilizing cellulose acetate with an acetone or amyl-acetate vehicle for the reproduction and comparison of the individual characteristics on cartridge cases, bullets and breech faces (Morrrz, 1938; Biasotti, 1956). The only advantage of the technique was preparation of flexible, translucent cast that could be flattened and viewed by transillumination thus reducing or obviating the difficulties inherent in the direct observation of curved or inaccessible surfaces by reflected illumination. Later, Faxfilm (trade name) became a commercial adaptation of the technique proposed by Moritz. It had larger application in studying the quality of finish on machined metal parts. The use of Faxfilm in law enforcement work has been reported, but literature on its practical application is meager (Science and Practice Committee Report, 1949; Biasotti, 1956). Cowles and Dodge have reported the successful application of Faxfilm to tool mark recovery and comparison and have pointed out its limitations when applied to deep impressions or to painted surfaces (Cowres, Davm L, Dodge, James K. A Method for Comparison of Tool Marks, 1948). Later another method for to form replicas of the fired bullets were proposed using sheets of vinyl thermoplastic varying in thickness from 0.030 to 0.125 " [...] (depending on the depth of the mark). The disadvantage of the method was the application of heat (100 to 125  °C.) and pressure (Kirk, 1953). An infrared lamp or electric hot plates were used for heating. These replicas were flattened and viewed by transillumination as either a positive or negative image. Accurate, reproducible replicas, free from air bubbles, shrinkage, and warping were obtained. However, the necessity of applying heat and pressure simultaneously, which may not be a serious disadvantage in the laboratory, makes this method rather impractical to use at the crime scene in the recovery of tool marks. Another material commonly used for <b>lifting</b> firing <b>pin</b> impression is plasticine, it is also used for replication of rifiling marks of fired bullet (Jain et al., 2004).|$|R
