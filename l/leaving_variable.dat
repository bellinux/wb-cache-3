25|$|The {{geometrical}} {{operation of}} {{moving from a}} basic feasible solution to an adjacent basic feasible solution is implemented as a pivot operation. First, a nonzero pivot element is selected in a nonbasic column. The row containing this element is multiplied by its reciprocal to change this element to 1, and then multiples of the row {{are added to the}} other rows to change the other entries in the column to 0. The result is that, if the pivot element is in row r, then the column becomes the r-th column of the identity matrix. The variable for this column is now a basic variable, replacing the variable which corresponded to the r-th column of the identity matrix before the operation. In effect, the variable corresponding to the pivot column enters the set of basic variables and is called the entering variable, and the variable being replaced leaves the set of basic variables and is called the <b>leaving</b> <b>variable.</b> The tableau is still in canonical form but with the set of basic variables changed by one element.|$|E

50|$|The network {{simplex method}} is an {{adaptation}} of the bounded variable primal simplex algorithm. The basis is represented as a rooted spanning tree of the underlying network, in which variables are represented by arcs, and the simplex multipliers by node potentials. At each iteration, an entering variable is selected by some pricing strategy, based on the dual multipliers (node potentials), and forms a cycle with the arcs of the tree. The <b>leaving</b> <b>variable</b> is the arc of the cycle with the least augmenting flow. The substitution of entering for leaving arc, and {{the reconstruction of the}} tree is called a pivot. When no non-basic arc remains eligible to enter, the optimal solution has been reached.|$|E
5000|$|The {{criss-cross}} {{algorithm is}} simpler than the simplex algorithm, because the criss-cross algorithm only has one phase. Its pivoting rules {{are similar to}} the least-index pivoting rule of Bland. Bland's rule uses only signs of coefficients rather than their (real-number) order when deciding eligible pivots. Bland's rule selects an entering variables by comparing values of reduced costs, using the real-number ordering of the eligible pivots. Unlike Bland's rule, the criss-cross algorithm is [...] "purely combinatorial", selecting an entering variable and a <b>leaving</b> <b>variable</b> by considering only the signs of coefficients rather than their real-number ordering. The criss-cross algorithm has been applied to furnish constructive proofs of basic results in real linear algebra, such as the lemma of Farkas.|$|E
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} TableÂ  1, the self-certified sick leave rate is 3.2 % on average, while the GP-certified sick leave rate is 7 %. The {{correlation}} coefficient between GP-certified sick leave and self-certified sick leave is, perhaps surprisingly, only 0.055. The low correlation between the two sick <b>leave</b> <b>variables</b> is not due to there only being a few employees with GP-certified sick leave. Out of the 226 employees, there are 136 employees (60 %) who have GP-certified sick leave in the period we analyse, 168 employees (74 %) with self-certified sick leave and 116 employees (51 %) with both self- and GP-certified sick leave.

40|$|ENGLISH: Simplex {{algorithm}} is a mathematical procedure for solving linear programming problems {{over and over}} {{with a way to}} test the angle points that meet the constraints to find the extreme point of the corner points that will maximize or minimize the objective function. Mathematical model of linear programming problems must first be modified in order to wake-matrix contains the identity of mathematics must be solved by using simplex algorithm. Building a slack variable is formed by bringing mathematics, surplus variables and variables in the form of artificial constraints that limit the need and requirement. In this case, the presence of an artificial variable as a variable which is zero at the optimal solution requires the use of a number M, ie {{a very large number of}} often called "Big M, the coefficient of artificial variables in the objective function. If the objective function is maximized, then - M is the coefficient of artificial variables. Conversely, if the objective function is minimized, then + M is the coefficient. Optimality condition: Entering Variable in maximizing (minimize) is a variable coefficient non basis the most negative (positive) in the equation destination z. Coefficient with the same value can be chosen arbitrarily. Optimum value is achieved if all the coefficients in the equation z non basic nonnegative (non positive). Feasibility conditions: either to maximize or minimize problem, the <b>leaving</b> <b>variable</b> is the current basic variables that have the smallest cut point (the minimum ratio in the denominator is strictly positive) to the variable entries.

Lines associated with the variable of the equation called the pivot and elements in the intersection between the entrance and common pivot column called pivot elements. Gauss-Jordan method to make a change on the basis of the use of two types of calculations: 1. pivot equation: new pivot equation= last pivot equation/ pivot element 2. all other equations including z new equation= (last equation-entering colomn coefisien) x new pivot equation Both types of calculations are basically looking for a new basic solution by substituting out the variables included in all equations, except in the pivot variable...|$|E
