2500|$|Headphones {{may be used}} {{to prevent}} other people from hearing the sound either for privacy or to prevent disturbance, as in {{listening}} in a public library. They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than <b>loudspeakers</b> <b>of</b> similar cost. Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones. High-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20Hz within 3dB. While a loudspeaker must use a relatively large (often 15" [...] or 18") speaker driver to reproduce low frequencies, headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide (or much smaller, {{as is the case with}} in-ear monitor headphones). Headphones' impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that only relatively small volumes of air need to be moved.|$|E
2500|$|The early {{earphones}} {{used with}} wireless-era crystal sets had moving iron drivers that {{worked in a}} way similar to the horn <b>loudspeakers</b> <b>of</b> the period; modern loudspeakers use a moving-coil principle. Each earpiece contained a permanent magnet about which was a coil of wire which formed a second [...] electromagnet. Both magnetic poles were close to a steel diaphram of the speaker. When the audio signal from the radio was passed through the electromagnet's windings, current was caused to flow in the coil which created a varying magnetic field that augmented or diminished that due to the permanent magnet. This varied the force of attraction on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations of the diaphragm push and pull {{on the air in}} front of it, creating sound waves. Standard headphones used in telephone work had a low impedance, often 75 Ω, and required more current than a crystal radio could supply. Therefore, the type used with crystal set radios (and other sensitive equipment) was wound with more turns of finer wire giving it a high impedance of 2000-8000 Ω.|$|E

Clynes enlisted his gifted son Darius as software engineer on the HP team to help make it possible. Nine months later, a critical demonstration took place to show that the principles Clynes had discovered would work well with real instruments, not just with oscillators, to enable music played with meaningful phrasing and expression. Clynes and the assembled HP researchers first heard the sound of flute, violin, and cello from the HP workstation performing a Haydn trio expressively in real time over the <b>loudspeakers</b> <b>of</b> the vast halls of the HP Research Building.

5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} stated that operating an amplifier pair in bridge mode can give {{four times the}} power (of one of the pair). This statement makes reference {{to the fact that}} power is proportional to the square of the voltage, implying that if the output voltage is doubled - as it is in bridge mode - then the power available increases by a factor of four. This would be true if the amplifier in bridged mode were used to drive <b>loudspeakers</b> <b>of</b> the same impedance used in stereo mode. However, in this case, the current through the loudspeaker and the amplifier would also double, which could exceed the amplifier ratings and lead to overheating and finally destruction of the amplifier. In fact, the minimum impedance of the loudspeaker in bridged mode should be double the minimum impedance rated for stereo mode. Consequently, operating a pair of existing amplifier channels in bridge mode doubles available power output to the load.|$|E
