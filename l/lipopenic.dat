50|$|Mice with genetic {{disruption}} of the dgat1 or dgat2 genes {{have been made by}} the Farese laboratory at UCSF. Surprisingly, DGAT1−/− mice are healthy and fertile and have no changes in triglyceride levels. These mice are also lean and resistant to diet-induced obesity, consequently generating interest in DGAT1 inhibitors for the treatment of obesity. In contrast, DGAT2−/− mice have reduced triglyceride levels but are <b>lipopenic,</b> suffer from skin barrier abnormalities (including the inability to retain moisture), and die shortly after birth.|$|E
40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Ruth Harris) Genetically obese mice exhibit mutations in leptin or its receptor and are inappropriate for studying human obesity, a hyperleptinemic condition with an intact leptin system. High-fat diets reportedly induce resistance to peripherally administered leptin and may better represent obese humans. 35 -day-old, C 57 BL/ 6 J high-fat (45 % kcal fat) fed mice housed individually did not decrease food intake or body weight in response to central or peripheral leptin injections. Peripheral infusions of leptin reduced body fat of 35 -day-old mice and 15 -week-old mice fed high-fat diet but {{had no effect on}} adipocyte glycerol or free fatty acid release in adult mice suggesting that leptin reduces body fat by mechanisms other than lipolysis. Group-housing young mice on bedding prevented fat loss in high-fat fed female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice suggesting that the <b>lipopenic</b> effect of leptin is in part due to increased thermogenesis. These studies suggest the development of leptin resistance is complex and involves additional factors. INDEX WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) -induced {{beta cell}} {{cytotoxicity}} has {{been implicated in}} the autoimmune cytotoxicity of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These cytotoxic effects may be mediated by nitric oxide (NO). Since long-chain fatty acids (FFA), like IL- 1 beta, upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase and enhance NO generation in islets, it seemed possible that islets might be protected from IL- 1 beta-induced damage by lowering their lipid content. We found that IL- 1 beta-induced NO production varied directly and islet cell viability inversely with islet triglyceride (TG) content. Fat-laden islets of obese rats were most vulnerable to IL- 1 beta, while moderately fat-depleted islets of food-restricted normal rats were less vulnerable than those of free-feeding normal rats. Severely <b>lipopenic</b> islets of rats made chronically hyperleptinemic by adenoviral leptin gene transfer resisted IL- 1 beta cytotoxicity even at 300 pg/ml, the maximal concentration. Troglitazone lowered islet TG in cultured islets from both normal rats and obese, leptin-resistant rats and reduced NO production and enhanced cell survival. We conclude that measures that lower islet TG content protect against IL- 1 beta-induced NO production and cytotoxicity. Leptin or troglitazone could provide in vivo protection against insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus...|$|E
40|$|Adenovirus-induced hyperleptinemia causes rapid {{disappearance}} {{of body fat}} in normal rats, presumably by up-regulating fatty acid oxidation within white adipocytes. To determine the role of peroxisomal proliferation-activated receptor (PPAR) α expression, which was increased during the rapid loss of fat, we infused adenovirus–leptin into PPARα−/− and PPARα+/+ mice. Despite similar degrees of hyperleptinemia and reduction in food intake, epididymal fat pad weight declined 55 % in wild-type but only 6 % in PPARα−/− mice; liver triacylglycerol fell 39 % in the wild-type group but was unchanged in PPAR−/− mice. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase- 1 mRNA rose 52 % in the wild-type mice but did not increase in PPARα−/− mice. PPARγ coactivator- 1 α rose 3 -fold in the fat and 46 % in the liver of wild-type mice but was unchanged in PPARα−/− mice. Although AMP-activated protein kinase could not be implicated in the <b>lipopenic</b> actions of hyperleptinemia, acetyl CoA carboxylase protein was reduced in the liver of wild-type but not in PPARα−/− mice. Thus, in PPARα−/− mice, up-regulation of carnitine palmitoyl transferase- 1 mRNA in fat, down-regulation of acetyl CoA carboxylase in liver, and up-regulation of PPARγ coactivator- 1 α mRNA in both tissues are abolished, as is the reduction in their triacylglycerol content...|$|E
40|$|Leptin regulates {{appetite}} and body weight via hypothalamic targets, {{but it can}} act directly on cultured pancreatic islets to regulate their fat metabolism. To obtain in vivo evidence that leptin may act peripherally as well as centrally, we compared the effect of adenovirally induced hyperleptinemia on food intake, body weight, and islet fat content in ventromedial hypothalamic-lesioned (VMHL) rats, sham-lesioned (SL) controls, and Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats in which the leptin receptor is mutated. Infusion with recombinant adenovirus containing the rat leptin cDNA increased plasma leptin by approximately 20 ng/ml in VMHL and ZDF rats but {{had no effect on}} their food intake, body weight, or fat tissue weight. Caloric matching of hyperphagic VMHL rats to SL controls did not reduce their resistance to hyperleptinemia. Whereas prediabetic ZDF rats had a fourfold elevation in islet fat, in VMHL rats islet fat was normal and none of them became diabetic. Isolated islets from ZDF rats were completely resistant to the <b>lipopenic</b> action of leptin, while VMHL islets exhibited 50 % of the normal response; caloric matching of VMHL rats to SL controls increased leptin responsiveness of their islets to 92 % of controls. We conclude that leptin regulation of adipocyte fat requires an intact VMH but that islet fat content is regulated independently of the VMH...|$|E

Methods: We recruited 145 type 2 diabetics and 130 control subjects. Thirty-seven diabetics had no complications, 54 had microvascular complications and 54 had macrovascular complications. We determined the parameters homocysteine of lipid, vitamin B 12, triglycerides, and folates for all subjects. Associated treatments used {{one or more of}} the following drugs, statin, fibrate, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-blockers. Results: Hyperhomocysteinemia was present in 35. 6 % of patients. Diabetics had elevated serum levels of triglycerides (P &lt; 0. 001), homocysteine (P &lt; 0. 01), folates (P &lt; 0. 01) and vitamin B 12 (P &lt; 0. 001). A strong association was found between type 2 diabetes and hyperhomocysteinemia (P &lt; 0. 001). Diabetics with associated treatment had elevated homocysteine, vitamin B 12 and folate levels when compared to diabetes-free controls. For diabetics with macrovascular complications, we found significant differences in homocysteine (P = 0. 010) and folate (P = 0. 014) between those taking associated drugs and those who did not. For diabetics with microvascular complications, a significant difference was found in folate only (P = 0. 012). Conclusion: Drugs used for hypertension and hyperlipidemia may have an effect on homocysteine levels, for this reason the interaction between drug action and homocysteine levels should be taken into consideration.
