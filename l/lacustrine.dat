5|$|The area {{inhabited}} by A. longicervia {{is thought to}} have experienced significant climatic fluctuations during the Early Cretaceous, ranging from arid or semi-arid to more humid conditions. The substrate in the region was mostly composed of <b>lacustrine</b> sediments and volcanic rocks.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Devonian {{is divided}} into three main groups. The lower part of the sequence, mostly Eifelian in age, is {{dominated}} by <b>lacustrine</b> beds of the lower and upper Stromness Flagstones that were deposited in Lake Orcadie. The later Rousay flagstone formation is found throughout much of the North and South Isles and East Mainland.|$|E
5|$|Tufa {{deposits}} {{formed in}} the lake. The continental environment Pleistocene sediments were formed from <b>lacustrine</b> carbonate deposits. These rocks contain amphibole, clay minerals such as illite, kaolinite and smectite, feldspar, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, pyroxene and quartz. The composition of these rocks resembles that of the Altiplano soils.|$|E
5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. <b>Lacustrine</b> shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from <b>lacustrine</b> planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E
5|$|Deposits in the United States {{constitute}} 62% {{of world}} resources; together, the United States, Russia and Brazil account for 86% of the world's resources {{in terms of}} shale-oil content. These figures remain tentative, with exploration or analysis of several deposits still outstanding. Professor Alan R. Carroll of University of Wisconsin–Madison regards the Upper Permian <b>lacustrine</b> oil-shale deposits of northwest China, absent from previous global oil shale assessments, as comparable in size to the Green River Formation.|$|E
5|$|Ford and Martin (2010) {{proposed}} that Psittacosaurus was semi-aquatic, swimming with its tail like a crocodile, and paddling and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the <b>lacustrine</b> (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; {{the position of}} the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of the arms and legs; tails with long chevrons (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of gastroliths, interpreted as ballast. They further suggested that some species of Psittacosaurus were more terrestrial than others.|$|E
5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae deposited in a <b>lacustrine</b> environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to brackish water. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Kettle Creek has {{an area of}} 244 square miles. It {{is located}} in Clinton, Potter, Cameron, and Tioga Counties. Forested land makes up 93.5 percent of the lower Kettle Creek watershed, 2.7 percent is abandoned coal mines and quarries, 2.4 percent is grassland, and 1.4 percent is developed land. This part of the watershed is not densely populated. The {{upper reaches of the}} watershed are also mostly forested, with some riparian meadows and camps. Public lands such as state forest or state park lands occupy 92 percent of the watershed. Most of the private land is located near floodplains. A total of 0.3 percent of the watershed, or 456 acres, (including 15 percent of the private land) is agricultural land. Much of the private and agricultural land is either in the northern reaches of the watershed, near Germania, or in or near the lower Kettle Creek valley. Wetlands make up under 1 percent of the watershed's area; 37 percent of them are on private lands. A total of 47 percent, or 382 acres, of the watershed's wetlands are riverine wetlands. palustrine wetlands cover 299 acres, or 37 percent of the total wetlands, and 133 acres (16 percent) are <b>lacustrine</b> wetlands. Most of the watershed's <b>lacustrine</b> wetlands are located in Kettle Creek's floodplain. Palustrine wetlands are found on the Kettle Creek Lake.|$|E
5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, <b>lacustrine</b> sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E
5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} trout in sea-run, resident stream and <b>lacustrine</b> forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run {{cutthroat trout}} fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E
5|$|The 15.3 to 7 mya old Campanario Formation forms {{much of the}} {{basement}} in the Laguna del Maule area. This geological formation contains andesitic-dacitic ignimbrites and tuffs with later dacitic dykes that were emplaced 3.6–2.0 mya. This formation is affected by various faults that extend in north-south direction. An older unit, of Jurassic-Cretaceous age, crops out northwest of the volcanic field. Other formations include an Oligocene-Miocene <b>lacustrine</b> formation named Cura-Mallín, and another intermediary formation named Trapa-Trapa. Trapa-Trapa is of volcanic origin and between 19 and 10 million years old. Remnants of Quaternary ignimbrites and Pliocene, early Quaternary volcanic centres, are also found around the field.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{and fine}} silt, {{dominated}} by lutite, were {{deposited in the}} lake. Closer to the shore, sand was also emplaced. Deltaic deposits have been found as well. Minerals identified include biotite, chlorite, illite, kaolinite, montmorillonite and muscovite, with varying colors depending {{on the origin of}} the sediments. The material deposited by Lake Cahuilla is also known as the Cahuilla formation. The Borrego and Pleistocene Brawley formations may also be linked to Lake Cahuilla. These <b>lacustrine</b> materials bury {{the northern part of the}} Colorado River Delta, and they give the ground a grayish color. The clays left by the lake were used for the production of ceramic by the inhabitants of the region; likewise Lake Cahuilla is responsible for the fertile soils of the Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley, an important agricultural province of the United States. Halite deposits left by the lake were mined in the 19-20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the shell is basically whitish or yellowish, with a net-like dark reddish or violet pattern. This pattern is very variable (depending on environmental factors), sometimes partly presenting bands, and even occasionally being evenly dark. The shell is very variable in color and color patterns, showing great polymorphism. Shell coloration and patterns are very plastic in all species of the genus Theodoxus and these qualities {{may be influenced by}} factors like ionic composition of water, type of substratum and nutrition of individuals in various habitats. Zettler and colleagues (2004) showed that in the outer coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, the nearly black and often corroded shell form of Theodoxus fluviatilis is predominant, whereas in the inner (sheltered) parts of coastal waters, yellowish-green forms prevail. Glöer and Pešić (2015) observed that specimens from a darker stony substrate were black or dark brown. Shells of specimens of Theodoxus fluviatilis from Northern Europe are ornamented with a pattern of white, drop-like spots on a dark or red background. Specimens from South France and Spain are ornamented with a pattern of zigzag stripes, while specimens from the Balkans show all possible combinations of white drop-like spots and zigzag stripes. Animals from <b>lacustrine</b> habitats show dark or light bands on the shell.|$|E
25|$|The {{conglomerates}} and sandstones of {{the formation}} are representative of an alluvial environment. The coquinas represent a shallow <b>lacustrine</b> environment. Similar to the Atafona Formation of the Campos Basin, the sandstones, stevensite-bearing siltstones and shales represent an alkaline <b>lacustrine</b> environment affected by volcanic activity. The shales represent deeper <b>lacustrine</b> waters in more distal areas. The alternation of the two facies implies a series of alluvial progradation-retractions into the Cretaceous carbonate lakes. The low textural and compositional maturity of conglomerates and sandstones implies the basin was supplied from areas close to the basin margins.|$|E
25|$|Research on the Australian basins {{showed that}} δD of <b>lacustrine</b> algal sourced kerogen with {{terrestrial}} contributions varies from -105‰ to -200‰, and δD of kerogen from near-coastal depositional environment has a narrower range from -75‰ to -120‰. The smaller span in D/H ratios of coastal kerogen {{is thought to}} reflect the relatively stable regional climate. Pedentchouk and his colleagues reported δD values of -70‰ to -120‰ in immature to low mature kerogen from early Cretaceous <b>lacustrine</b> sediments in West Africa.|$|E
25|$|Source correlation. Marine and <b>lacustrine</b> environments are {{characterized}} by distinctly different δD values. Many studies have tried to relate measured δD with source types. For methane, D concentration and clumped isotopes is particularly diagnostic of sources.|$|E
25|$|Several {{life history}} forms of Arctic {{grayling}} occur: fluvial populations that live and spawn in rivers; <b>lacustrine</b> populations that live and spawn in lakes; and potamodromous populations {{that live in}} lakes and spawn in tributary streams.|$|E
25|$|The {{shores of}} all Siberian lakes, which filled the {{depressions}} during the <b>Lacustrine</b> period, abound in remains {{dating from the}} Neolithic age. Countless kurgans (tumuli), furnaces, and other archaeological artifacts bear witness to a dense population. Some of the earliest artifacts found in Central Asia derive from Siberia.|$|E
25|$|Rocks of {{probable}} lower Devonian age {{are exposed}} near Yesnaby, on western Mainland. A ridge of granitic basement divides the Hara Ebb Formation, {{a sequence of}} breccias, conglomerates and sandstones deposited in an alluvial fan setting, from the Yesnaby Sandstone which was deposited in an aeolian setting. The contact with the overlying Middle Devonian <b>lacustrine</b> Lower Stromness Flagstones is an angular unconformity.|$|E
25|$|The common {{denominator}} among most deposits of fossil insects and terrestrial plants is the lake environment. Those insects that became preserved were either {{living in the}} fossil lake (autochthonous) or carried into it from surrounding habitats by winds, stream currents, or their own flight (allochthonous). Drowning and dying insects not eaten by fish and other predators settle to the bottom, where they may be preserved in the lake’s sediments, called <b>lacustrine,</b> under appropriate conditions. Even amber, or fossil resin from trees, requires a watery environment that is <b>lacustrine</b> or brackish {{in order to be}} preserved. Without protection in anoxic sediments, amber would gradually disintegrate; it is never found buried in fossil soils. Various factors contribute greatly to what kinds of insects become preserved and how well, if indeed at all, including lake depth, temperature, and alkalinity; type of sediments; whether the lake was surrounded by forest or vast and featureless salt pans; and if it was choked in anoxia or highly oxygenated. There are some major exceptions to the <b>lacustrine</b> theme of fossil insects, the most famous being the Late Jurassic limestones from Solnhofen and Eichstätt, Germany, which are marine. These deposits are famous for pterosaurs and the earliest bird, Archaeopteryx. The limestones were formed by a very fine mud of calcite that settled within stagnant, hypersaline bays isolated from inland seas. Most organisms in these limestones, including rare insects, were preserved intact, sometimes with feathers and outlines of soft wing membranes, indicating that there was very little decay. The insects, however, are like casts or molds, having relief but little detail. In some cases iron oxides precipitated around wing veins, revealing better detail.|$|E
25|$|The depositional {{environment}} {{has been interpreted}} as <b>lacustrine</b> (Lake Humboldt) and fluvio-deltaic, with a near-continuous deposition since the Late Pliocene. The Sabana Formation represents the uppermost unit of the <b>lacustrine</b> deposition of Lake Humboldt. At {{the edges of the}} lake, numerous deltas of fluvio-glacial origin were present, reflected in the coarser sediments. During periods of stormy climate around the lake, coarser sediments were transported to the interior of the lake. The depositional cycles were geologically speaking fast and the water level of the lake fluctuated greatly during its history. Furthermore, the local tectonic activity of the Bogotá savanna, related to movements of the Bogotá Fault, influenced the depositional cycles. The middle unit of the formation shows a drying out of the lake and subaerial erosional surfaces. The upper part of the Sabana sequence is characterised by fluvial deposits around a retreating Lake Humboldt, estimated at an age of around 30,000 years BP. The glacial origin was predominantly the Sumapaz Páramo to the south of the Bogotá savanna, with minor snow-capped peaks in the Eastern Hills of Bogotá.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies of}} natural samples have shown slight {{increases}} in δD with thermal maturity. Amane Waseda reported δD of oil samples in northeast Japan to increase from around -130‰ to around -110‰ with higher maturity. At low thermal maturity, dos Santos Neto and Hayes reported δD of saturate fraction {{of oil in}} Portiguar Basin derived from a <b>lacustrine</b> environment is -90‰, and from a marine-evaporitic environment is -120‰ to -135‰.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, S. hartti {{was found}} in the Recôncavo Basin of Brazil, {{specifically}} in the Ilhas Formation of the Bahia series, it was a shallow <b>lacustrine</b> environment dating from the late Aptian, similar in age to the habitat of S. imperator, with similar aquatic fauna, including Lepidotus and two species of Mawsonia. The dinosaur fauna is of a very fragmentary nature and identification does not go beyond indeterminate theropod and iguanodontid remains.|$|E
25|$|White spruce is {{a climax}} canopy {{tree in the}} boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. It {{generally}} occurs on well-drained soils in alluvial and riparian zones, although it also occurs in soils of glacial and <b>lacustrine</b> origin. The understory is dominated by feather mosses (Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi, Ptilium crista-castrensis, and Dicranum spp.), and occasionally peat moss. In the far north, the total depth of the moss and underlying humus is normally between , although {{it tends to be}} shallower when hardwoods are present in the stand.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} {{composition of}} the region is the Tertiary period (Miocene and Pliocene) in western hills and Quaternary (Pleistocene and Holocene) in the more flat, like the sole of river. According to the Geographic Institute Agustin Codazzi, the materials {{in the area are}} mainly Quaternary alluvial, <b>lacustrine,</b> fluviolacustre. The land ranges from banks, dikes, terraces, valleys, narrow, small alluvial fans, to marshes, swamps, flats and hills. The materials of the Tertiary (Miocene and Pliocene) are in the western hills, and presented as varied slopes.|$|E
25|$|Hesperia Planum is {{generally}} interpreted to {{be composed of}} flood lavas, although layered volcaniclastic or <b>lacustrine</b> (lake-bed) sediments cannot be ruled out. The lavas appear to partly fill a large, irregular topographic depression that existed in Noachian times. The rims of pre-existing impact craters are still visible in places, indicating that the lava deposits are 250–500 m in thickness. The volume of lavas within Hesperia Planum is comparable to that found in large igneous provinces on Earth, such as the Columbia River Basalt Group.|$|E
25|$|During {{the end of}} {{the last}} Devensian glacial period the {{formation}} of Lake Humber in the lowest reaches of the river, meant that substantial lake bed clays and silts were laid down to create the flat landscape of the Humberhead Levels. These levels extend across the Trent valley, and include the lower reaches of the Eau, Torne and Idle. In some areas, successive layers of peat were built up above the <b>lacustrine</b> deposits during the Holocene period, which created lowland mires such as the Thorne and Hatfield Moors.|$|E
25|$|This naming {{convention}} led to much {{confusion in the}} early 20th century, as scholars debated whether Teotihuacan or Tula-Hidalgo was the Tollan described by 16th-century chronicles. It now seems clear that Tollan may {{be understood as a}} generic Nahua term applied to any large settlement. In the Mesoamerican concept of urbanism, Tollan and other language equivalents serve as a metaphor, linking the bundles of reeds and rushes that formed part of the <b>lacustrine</b> environment of the Valley of Mexico and the large gathering of people in a city.|$|E
25|$|The Dead Sea {{is formed}} in a {{pull-apart}} basin {{due to the}} left-stepping offset between the Wadi Arabah and Jordan Valley segments. The part of the basin with a sedimentary fill of more than 2km is 150km long and 15–17km wide in its central part. In the north, the fill reaches its maximum thickness of about 10km. The sequence includes Miocene fluvial sandstones of the Hazeva Formation overlain by a sequence of Late Miocene to early Pliocene evaporites, mainly halite, the Sedom Formation, and a <b>lacustrine</b> to fluvial sequence of Pliocene to recent age.|$|E
25|$|The Eday Group overlies the Rousay Flagstones and {{represents}} a change to dominantly fluvial/aeolian deposition with only occasional <b>lacustrine</b> intervals. The Eday Group {{consists of three}} sandstone units, the lower, middle and upper Eday Sandstones separated by the Eday Flagstones and Eday Marl respectively. The Eday Marl consists mainly of red and green mudstones and siltstones and {{is thought to have}} been deposited in a river floodplain environment. Locally pseudomorphs of halite have been found and rarely marine microfossils (scolecodonts) indicating that the basin was affected by occasional marine incursions at this time.|$|E
25|$|The {{consumption}} of fish {{is by far}} the most significant source of ingestion-related mercury exposure in humans, although plants and livestock also contain mercury due to bioconcentration of mercury from seawater, freshwater, marine and <b>lacustrine</b> sediments, soils, and atmosphere, and due to biomagnification by ingesting other mercury-containing organisms. Exposure to mercury can occur from breathing contaminated air, from eating foods that have acquired mercury residues during processing, from exposure to mercury vapor in mercury amalgam dental restorations, and from improper use or disposal of mercury and mercury-containing objects, for example, after spills of elemental mercury or improper disposal of fluorescent lamps.|$|E
25|$|White spruce {{occurs on}} a wide variety of soils, {{including}} soils of glacial, <b>lacustrine,</b> marine, and alluvial origins; overlying basic dolomites, limestones and acidic Precambrian and Devonian granites and gneisses; and Silurian sedimentary schists, shales, slates, and conglomerates (Halliday 1937). The wide range of textures accommodated includes clays (Wilde et al. 1949, 1954; Nienstaedt 1957, Rowe 1972), even those that are massive when wet and columnar when dry (Jameson 1963), and sand flats, and coarse soils (Forest Section L 4d, Rowe 1972). Its occurrence on some organic soils is not characteristic, except perhaps on shallow mesic organic soils in Saskatchewan and in association with black spruce on organic soils in central Yukon (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).|$|E
25|$|Most of the Ethiopian uplands have {{a decided}} slope to the north-west, so {{that nearly all}} the large rivers flow in that {{direction}} to the Nile, comprising some 85% of its water. Such are the Tekezé River in the north, the Abay in the center, and the Sobat in the south, and about four-fifths of the entire drainage is discharged through these three arteries. The rest is carried off by the Awash, which runs out in the saline <b>lacustrine</b> district {{along the border with}} Djibouti; by the Shebelle River and the Jubba, which flow southeast through Somalia, though the Shebelle fails to reach the Indian Ocean; and by the Omo, the main feeder of the closed basin of Lake Turkana.|$|E
25|$|The Alpine orogeny was {{the main}} cause of {{extensive}} tectonic activities and it was responsible for the formation of the hydrothermal field within the region. The Chaves graben was formed by the relative motion of the block with different types of sediments being settled. The most recent formations are a sedimentary series (<b>lacustrine,</b> alluvial, colluvial, detritic, etc.) with variable thickness that had their origin during the Miocene. Two main faults cross and influence the tectonic activities: the north-northeast by south-southeast Chaves-Verin Fault and a fault system crossing near Faiões and Santo Estêvão. The first fault developed from late Hercynian tectonic episode occurring between 280 and 300 million years ago, that developed into an almost north-south direction into the lithosphere. Intense neotectonic activity reactivated these old fractures, originating in a complex pattern of faults in the sedimentary basin.|$|E
25|$|According to Fage (2013), the Tutsi are serologically {{related to}} Bantu and Nilotic populations. This in turn rules out a {{possible}} Cushitic origin for the founding Tutsi-Hima ruling {{class in the}} <b>lacustrine</b> kingdoms. However, the royal burial customs of the latter kingdoms are quite similar to those practiced by the former Cushitic Sidama states in the southern Gibe region of Ethiopia. By contrast, Bantu populations {{to the north of}} the Tutsi-Hima in Kenya were until modern times essentially without a king, while there were a number of Bantu kingdoms to the south of the Tutsi-Hima in Tanzania, all of which shared the Tutsi-Hima's chieftaincy pattern. Since the Cushitic Sidama kingdoms interacted with Nilotic groups, Fage thus proposes that the Tutsi may have descended from one such migrating Nilotic population. The Tutsis' Nilotic ancestors would thereby in earlier times have served as cultural intermediaries, adopting some monarchical traditions from adjacent Cushitic kingdoms and subsequently taking those borrowed customs south with them when they first settled amongst Bantu autochthones in the Great Lakes area.|$|E
25|$|Podzolized, brunisolic, luvisolic, gleysolic, and regosolic (immature) {{soils are}} typical of those {{supporting}} white spruce throughout {{the range of the}} species (Nienstaedt 1957). Soils supporting white spruce are most commonly Alfisols or Inceptisols (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). In the podzol region of Wisconsin, white spruce occurs on loam podzols, podzolized gley loams, strongly podzolized clays, gley-podzol clays, stream-bottom soils, and wood peat (Wilde et al. 1949). Moist sandy loams also support good growth (Harlow and Harrar 1950). On sandy podzols (Wilde et al. 1949), it is usually a minor species (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Good development occurs on moist alluvium (Seeley, cited by Nienstaedt 1957; Jeffrey 1961, 1964; Lacate et al. 1965; Viereck 1973) on the banks of streams and borders of swamps (Sargent 1898, Kenety 1917, Rowe 1972). White spruce makes good growth on well-drained <b>lacustrine</b> soils in Alberta Mixedwoods (Heger 1971), on moderately-well-drained clay loams in Saskatchewan (Kabzems 1971), and on melanized loams and clays (with sparse litter and a dark-coloured organically-enriched mineral horizon) in the Algoma district of Ontario (Wilde et al. 1954).|$|E
