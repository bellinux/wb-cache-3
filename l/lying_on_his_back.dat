5|$|Following his {{military}} service {{and return to}} Winchester in 1779, White studied jurisprudence under his uncle, Alexander White, {{one of the most}} preeminent lawyers practicing in the Shenandoah Valley. During the course of his four years of law studies, White read the legal treatises of William Blackstone and Edward Coke among others while <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> or propped up on a couch recovering from his injuries. White was admitted to practice law at Winchester in December 1782, after which he engaged in the practice of law for eleven years.|$|E
5|$|As {{a tribute}} to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a {{childbirth}} scene by stuffing the ball under his shirt and <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued {{after the birth of}} his daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.|$|E

It was gouged out to one metre and was planned to come up underneath the men's cage after passing through 16 metres of rock. The last phase was to involve a miner using hand tools to create an opening whilst <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

25|$|Montgomery Meigs later had his son's body {{moved to}} Arlington National Cemetery, where it rests in a tomb {{next to his}} own and many others of the Meigs family. John Rodgers Meigs' tomb is covered by a {{distinctive}} bronze sculpture. The high relief sculpture depicts a two-thirds life-size John Rodgers Meigs, in his first lieutenant's engineer uniform, <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> in the mud. The hooves of the Confederate cavalrymen have trampled on the body and left imprints in the mud.|$|E
25|$|During the film's production, Argento became {{stricken}} {{with a severe}} case of hepatitis---and had to direct some sequences while <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> At one point, the illness became so painful that he was bedridden for a few days; filming was then restricted to second unit work, some of which was done by Mario Bava. Argento has called Inferno one of his least favorite of all his films...as his memories of the movie are tainted by his recollection of the painful illness he suffered.|$|E
25|$|During their meeting, {{the deputy}} {{leader of the}} expedition, Xu Jing, spontaneously blurted out that on his descent from the First Step, he {{recalled}} having spotted a dead climber <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> feet facing uphill, in a hollow or slot in the rock. Since no one other than Mallory and Irvine had ever been lost {{on the north side}} of Everest before 1960, and Mallory had been found much lower down, it was almost a certainty that Xu had discovered Irvine. However, the sighting was brief, and Xu was in desperate straits during the descent, and while he clearly remembered seeing the body, he was unclear about where it was.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E
25|$|The suspects' {{mobile phones}} and {{personal}} computers contained multiple video {{recordings of the}} murders. A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48‑year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly {{in the face with}} a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko in the eye and abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video. The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was still breathing after a screwdriver was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh. Only two suspects appear to be present in the video, with one always behind the camera.|$|E
500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, he painted in a {{standing}} position, not <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> According to Vasari, [...] "The work {{was carried out}} in extremely uncomfortable conditions, from his having to work with his head tilted upwards". Michelangelo described his physical discomfort in a humorous sonnet accompanied by a little sketch.|$|E
50|$|Gurah is a Javanese health {{treatment}} originating from Bantul, near Yogyakarta.

500|$|... "It's an {{illusion}} to believe himself {{active in the}} story. Does he think he's changing something, watching news programmes, or <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the sofa on Sunday afternoon, reading more opinion columns of ungrounded certainties, more long articles about what really lies behind this or that development, or what is surely going to happen next, predictions forgotten {{as soon as they}} are read, well before events disprove them?" [...] Physically, Perowne is neither above nor outside the fray but at an angle to it; emotionally his own intelligence makes him apathetic, he can see both sides of the argument, and his beliefs are characterised by a series of hard choices rather than sure certainties.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Freddy vs. Jason entered {{production}} {{there had been}} ten previous Friday the 13th films. Make-up effects artist Terezakis wanted to put his own mark on Jason's look—he wanted Jason to be less rotted and decomposed and more defined, so that the audience would see a new Jason, but still recognized the face. Terezakis tried to keep continuity with the previous films, but recognized that had he followed them too literally, then [...] "Jason would {{have been reduced to}} a pile of goo." [...] Ronny Yu wanted everything surrounding the hockey mask to act as a frame, making the mask the focal point of each shot. To achieve this, Terezakis created a [...] "pooled-blood look" [...] for the character by painting the skin black, based on the idea the blood had pooled {{in the back of his}} head because he had been <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> for a long time. As with other make-up artists before him, Terezakis followed Savini's original skull design, and aged it appropriately.|$|E
500|$|In III.2 Shaun re-appears as [...] "Jaunty Jaun" [...] and {{delivers}} a lengthy and sexually suggestive sermon {{to his sister}} Issy, and her twenty-eight schoolmates from St. Brigid's School. Throughout this book Shaun is continually regressing, changing from an old man to an overgrown baby <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> and eventually, in III.3, into a vessel through which the voice of HCE speaks again {{by means of a}} spiritual medium. This leads to HCE's defence of his life in the passage [...] "Haveth Childers Everywhere". Part III ends in the bedroom of Mr. and Mrs. Porter as they attempt to copulate while their children, Jerry, Kevin and Isobel Porter, are sleeping upstairs and the dawn is rising outside (III.4). Jerry awakes from a nightmare of a scary father figure, and Mrs. Porter interrupts the coitus to go comfort him with the words [...] "You were dreamend, dear. The pawdrag? The fawthrig? Shoe! Hear are no phanthares in the room at all, avikkeen. No bad bold faathern, dear one." [...] She returns to bed, and the rooster crows at the conclusion of their coitus at the Part's culmination.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins and}} ends with the band in a {{hospital}} setting watching an old man being administered medication through an IV drip. The majority of the video {{takes place in a}} surreal outdoor setting that incorporates imagery from the film The Wizard of Oz. During the song's first verse, the old man from the hospital climbs onto a crow-ridden Christian cross. The second verse introduces a young girl in a white robe and peaked cap reaching for human fetuses in a tree, and an overweight woman in a suit with human organs painted onto it and with angel wings affixed to her back. In the video's final cut, the band is only shown performing in the outdoor setting during the choruses, where Cobain's face moves in and out of focus in the camera. While most of the video was devised by Cobain, Corbijn added elements such as the intentionally artificial crows, a ladder for the old man to climb onto the cross with, and a box with a heart at the top that the band performs inside of during the song's final chorus. Corbijn created another cut of the video featuring alternate footage during the final verse, including more shots of the young girl and the woman, and scenes of Cobain <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> in the poppy field, with mist surrounding him. This version of the video is featured on the DVD [...]|$|E
2500|$|There are {{versions}} of the [...] "cowgirl" [...] sex position where the woman is squatting over the man, who is <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> instead of kneeling over him.

2500|$|Wyatt {{spent six}} years in Italy, 176268, in company with Richard Bagot of Staffordshire, who was Secretary to the Earl of Northampton's embassy to the Venetian Republic. In Venice, Wyatt studied with Antonio Visentini (1688–1782) as an {{architectural}} draughtsman and painter. In Rome he made measured drawings of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, [...] "being under the necessity of <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on a ladder slung horizontally, without cradle or side-rail, over a frightful void of 300 feet".|$|E
