5|$|The {{analogy of}} a game was first {{proposed}} by Hans-Georg Gadamer {{in an attempt to}} demonstrate the epistemic unity of language. He suggested that language is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being. Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; Christianity teaches this to be the divine word which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide {{written by}} Rebecca Silverman, {{also of the}} Anime News Network, {{expressed}} differing sentiments than that of Dong. Silverman was quick to mention {{that she had not}} previously played the game to which the series was based on. With that being said, she described the first episode as not feeling <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play. She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive. She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the Great Kantō earthquake of the 1920s. In her full series review, Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used. Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong, Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down. She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise. On the other hand, Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change.|$|E
25|$|As {{the male}} {{children}} of a Bali Aga couple marry and form their own households, new houses are added at the downhill end of the row. When older generations die, the houses they lived at the uphill end become vacant and are inherited by younger couples, rather <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of musical chairs. If there are no heirs, the house are returned to the village. This ideal pattern of succession is not always adhered to but {{it is expected that}} the most senior member of the extended family should dwell in the house at the uphill end.|$|E

25|$|Like its predecessor, Battlefront II {{includes}} Galactic Conquest. In this mode, {{the player}} commands a fleet throughout the galaxy conquering and protecting planets, much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of Risk. When two opposing forces reach the same planet, the game switches {{to the traditional}} perspective, and the player must eliminate the enemy faction {{to gain control of}} that planet. Players gain credits for performing well which can be used to buy new character classes, a new fleet, or bonuses that provide additional support when attacking or defending a planet. While the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions allow cooperative and competitive battles in Galactic Conquest mode through splitscreen gameplay, the PC version does not.|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} in Angel Beats! follows {{an interactive}} branching plot line with multiple scenarios. Originally {{meant to be}} a role-playing game, Maeda eventually conceded to making it into a visual novel adventure game. When designing the game, Maeda did not want to include choices for the player that would not have a meaningful effect, so the choices given were focused to {{have an effect on the}} plot and character interactions. A reviewer noted that its game structure makes it feel more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> compared to other adventure games released around the same time, which have less choices available to the player and less-divergent plot lines. 1st Beat ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 twice more after that.|$|E
25|$|Handheld {{ergonomic}} keyboards {{are designed}} to be held <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> controller, and can be used as such, instead of laid out flat on top of a table surface. Typically handheld keyboards hold all the alphanumeric keys and symbols that a standard keyboard would have, yet only be accessed by pressing two sets of keys at once; one acting as a function key similar to a 'Shift' key that would allow for capital letters on a standard keyboard. Handheld keyboards allow the user the ability to move around a room or to lean back on a chair while also being able to type in front or away from the computer. Some variations of handheld ergonomic keyboards also include a trackball mouse that allow mouse movement and typing included in one handheld device.|$|E

25|$|In {{a review}} on Famitsu.com by Taiga Asaba, Angel Beats! 1st Beat is {{described}} as not merely complementing the anime it is based on, but instead using the characters and setting to produce a wholly new story, which creates a separate charm surrounding the separate versions of the story. Asaba notes that the theme revolving around family already present in the anime is expanded upon in the game {{for each of the}} characters. Regarding the game's mechanics, Asaba found it fairly difficult to go down specific character routes, noting that a small change in how to diverge the plot line results in large changes to the characters. Asaba writes that its game structure makes it feel more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> compared to other adventure games released around the same time, which have less choices available to the player and less-divergent plot lines.|$|E

500|$|Brian Crecente, {{editor-in-chief}} of Kotaku, praised the general use of {{light as a}} gameplay-mechanic. He commented on the episodic structure, saying it made the player feel satisfied even after short gameplay sessions. He also praised the overall storyline, having played the final episode thrice in a row, saying: [...] "For {{the first time in}} my life, I have experienced something that plays <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> but has the impact of a movie... Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound to leave you thinking about it and wanting more for days after its completion." [...] He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being [...] "packed with memorable people", but concluded that the game [...] "redefines interactive storytelling".|$|E

It is still turn-based like the PSP game, but instead of battles being timed and all armies moving at once, each force has its own turn, making Advance even more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> board <b>game.</b>|$|R

500|$|Square Enix {{had changed}} its mind, {{and no longer}} liked the Nordic style of this {{spin-off}} game, so a last-minute style change was attempted. [...] The game {{had been such a}} well-guarded secret, and had been through so many changes, that most employees did not know they had been working on a Final Fantasy game until very late in development. Grin attempted to change the art style to fit more with traditional Final Fantasy games, but still did not receive any positive feedback. In response, Grin sent Square Enix an image of one of the latter's own games, Final Fantasy XII, and were told that it does not look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> in Final Fantasys style. Following that exchange, Grin {{came to the conclusion that}} there was no longer any way to satisfy the publisher.|$|E
500|$|Wizards & Warriors III {{received}} {{praise from}} Retro Gamer magazine in September2010, {{as part of}} its retrospective on the Wizards & Warriors series. They said that the third installment was the best game in the series as well as developer Ste Pickford's personal favorite, {{despite the fact that it}} did not sell as well as its predecessor Ironsword. Developer Ste Pickford said: [...] "Wizards & WarriorsIII was more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> that I really wanted to make. IronSword was pretty much a straight sequel for a game dropped in our lap; we look at it and tried to make a new version with some improvements." [...] Pickford added that, while he could have done better with both Ironsword and Wizards & WarriorsIII, he wished he would have been able to see the latter to its completion.|$|E

Introduced {{at the end of the}} first volume of the manga, Kisshu {{primarily}} acts in a playful and carefree manner, seeming to enjoying fighting with the Mew Mews and treating it <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game.</b> Throughout the series, Kisshu develops increasingly stronger feelings for Ichigo, first regarding her as an [...] "interesting toy" [...] (that he would kill for his leader), and obsessing over her. Kisshu eventually kidnaps Ichigo, confesses his love, and then demands that she cry because he loves seeing her being frightened. Quiche again declares his love to Ichigo towards the end of the series, but attacks and begins strangling her while crying when she rejects him again. He eventually releases her after asking how he can make her love him. Quiche is killed after turning against Deep Blue by protecting Ichigo, but is revived with the power of the Mew Aqua after Deep Blue's defeat. He returns with Pie and Tart to their planet after wishing Ichigo happiness and stealing one final kiss. The name [...] "Kishu" [...] or [...] "Kisshu" [...] is a mistranslation in the fansubs.|$|E

500|$|Development of Wizards & Warriors III: Kuros: Visions of Power {{started in}} 1990, when, after strong sales with , Rare gave Zippo Games {{the rights to}} develop and direct the third {{installment}} in the series; the company's founders, Ste and John Pickford, co-designed the game. Ste Pickford was the lead artist and designed all the concept art for the game, while Lyndon Brooke also assisted {{with some of the}} drawings, and Steve Hughes and Andy Miah wrote the software. The game was originally titled Silversword, which {{was the name of the}} development project. The Pickford brothers came up with the concept of Kuros' disguises of knight, wizard, and thief as a homage to Ultimate Play the Game's (Rare's former incarnation) 1983 ZXSpectrum title Atic Atac. Ste Pickford said that designing a game which consisted of multiple characters, guilds, and secrets [...] "was a dream come true at the time", saying that they wanted to pay tribute to the various Ultimate Play the Game titles they played in the early 1980s. Pickford wanted to design a game that was a step forward from most Action RPGs for the NES; he opted for nonlinear gameplay in which the different disguises and accompanying abilities would allow the player to access new areas of the map. [...] "Wizards & WarriorsIII was more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> that I really wanted to make." [...] Pickford said.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News said, [...] "Although it's called Captain America: Civil War, {{the latest}} Marvel movie is {{actually}} a supersized Avengers picture—overstuffed to bursting. And sometimes during its {{two and a half}} hour running time, it just goes bust." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "As a work of thought, Civil War is compromised, but at least there are thoughts to compromise. As an action film, it has its moments, but aside from the big opening sequence—the action scenes are a bit flat." [...] Andrew O'Hehir writing for Salon said, [...] "Much of Captain America: Civil War is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from Captain America: The Winter Soldier two summers ago." [...] While Nicholas Barber of BBC gave the film a generally favorable review, praising both its visuals and action sequences, he criticized {{the fact that there was}} [...] "no cogent reason for any of [...] to be on one side or the other, which is why their inevitable dust-up feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of dodgeball in a school playground." [...] Mark Millar, writer of the [...] "Civil War" [...] comic storyline on which the film was based, felt the film [...] "had a good opening twenty , but then I honestly can’t remember what the movie was about." [...] He also felt the film lacked levity, especially considering the Russo brothers' background in comedy.|$|E
500|$|The game is {{markedly}} {{more difficult}} than its predecessor. Amiga Format called this [...] "good/bad news", whereas The One directed its [...] "major criticism" [...] at the difficulty level, saying [...] "some of the levels are quite simply horrendous", and that the game is [...] "close to being intensely frustrating at times." [...] Amiga Computing also felt the high difficulty to be the [...] "biggest problem": [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> to get progressively harder rather than getting virtually impossible after just four missions." [...] Amiga Format also criticised the difficulty and felt [...] "some of the levels are {{a bit of a}} drag." [...] Amiga Power was annoyed at the early tutorial missions, finding them redundant, but otherwise noted the increased challenge as a positive, and said: [...] "The original game went in pulses of fiendishly hard and stupidly simple levels, but in CF2 the difficulty curve's, well, more of a curve." [...] The reviewer praised the clever level design, explaining: [...] "The levels penalise you for taking the obvious route and reward you for trying an obscure approach [...] loads of levels make you think before you move, injecting puzzle elements into the killing", citing the example of traps with empty vehicles as bait. The reviewer praised the smaller, tighter levels with a difficulty curve within those levels: [...] "gung-ho" [...] sections building to tactical play against tougher enemies. He compared this favourably with the first game: [...] "The level design is consistently better", in particular the [...] "Beirut, Mediaevil and Chicago levels look and play wonderfully." [...] He nevertheless felt the thematic shifts lacked coherence and atmosphere.|$|E

2500|$|However, Gamearena {{criticized the}} {{depiction}} of the heroine and the game's lack of mass-market appeal: [...] "Many people found DMC too campy and over-the-top, and Bayonetta makes it look monochrome in comparison. If you don't like the genre, Bayonetta will not change your mind." [...] GameSpot's video review lamented duller graphics and inconsistent frame rates for its PS3 port. The Associated Press review opined that [...] "Bayonetta feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> that would have blown me away 15 years ago. (It even pays tribute to Sega arcade classics like Space Harrier and Hang-On.) While it introduces an exotic new vision, it doesn't give us anything to do except fight, and its strictly linear story prevents you from exploring its distinctive universe. It's high on style, but less than satisfying." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{couple was}} not universally {{accepted}} among viewers, and {{a portion of}} the audience felt that pairing the characters would disrupt the dynamics of the series.
