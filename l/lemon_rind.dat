The albums Mega Manço (1992) and Müsadenizle Çocuklar (1995) were considered as the weakest efforts of his career, despite the limited success of 1992 children hit [...] "Ayı" [...] (The Bear). On the other hand, in 1995 he toured in Japan with Kurtalan Ekspres, leading to Live In Japan (1996), his only live album.

50|$|Picarones: a sweet, {{ring-shaped}} fritter with {{a pumpkin}} base; often {{served with a}} molasses syrup. Picarones were created {{during the colonial period}} to replace the Spanish dessert Buñuelos, as buñuelos were too expensive to make (They had an egg custard filling) and some ingredients were unavailable (<b>lemon</b> <b>rinds).</b> Peruvian Picarones are made of squash or pumpkin dough and sweetened with chancaca, raw cane sugar melted into a syrup.|$|R
50|$|Bundevara is a Serbian sweet pie made of rolled phyllo {{or similar}} to strudel, filled with {{sweetened}} grated pumpkin pulp and baked in an oven. Occasionally some nutmeg, cinnamon or similar spices may {{be added to}} the filling, as well as raisins or grated <b>lemon</b> <b>rinds.</b> It is usually dusted with icing sugar and/or vanilla sugar, and may be served either hot or cold. The pumpkins (or squashes) with more intense coloured pulp (richer in carotene) are more appreciated.

50|$|<b>Lemon</b> juice, <b>rind,</b> and zest {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of foods and drinks. Lemon juice is used to make lemonade, soft drinks, and cocktails. It is used in {{marinades}} for fish, where its acid neutralizes amines in fish by converting them into nonvolatile ammonium salts, and meat, where the acid partially hydrolyzes tough collagen fibers, tenderizing the meat, but the low pH denatures the proteins, causing them to dry out when cooked. Lemon juice is frequently used in the United Kingdom to add to pancakes, especially on Shrove Tuesday.|$|R
2500|$|Limonene {{takes its}} name from the <b>lemon,</b> as the <b>rind</b> of the <b>lemon,</b> like other citrus fruits, {{contains}} considerable amounts of this compound, which contributes to their odor. Limonene is a chiral molecule, and biological sources produce one enantiomer: the principal industrial source, citrus fruit, contains D-limonene ((+)-limonene), which is the (R)-enantiomer. Racemic limonene is known as dipentene. [...] D-Limonene is obtained commercially from citrus fruits through two primary methods: centrifugal separation or steam distillation.|$|R
50|$|Croatian cuisine is {{heterogeneous}} and {{is known}} as a cuisine of the regions, since every region of Croatia has its own distinct culinary tradition. Its roots date back to ancient times. The differences in the selection of foodstuffs and forms of cooking are most notable between those in mainland and those in coastal regions. Mainland cuisine is more characterized by the earlier Slavic and the more recent contacts with neighboring cultures—Hungarian and Turkish, using lard for cooking, and spices such as black pepper, paprika, and garlic. The coastal region bears the influences of the Greek and Roman cuisine, {{as well as of the}} later Mediterranean cuisine, in particular Italian (especially Venetian). Coastal cuisines use olive oil, and herbs and spices such as rosemary, sage, bay leaf, oregano, marjoram, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and <b>lemon</b> and orange <b>rind.</b> Peasant cooking traditions are based on imaginative variations of several basic ingredients (cereals, dairy products, meat, fish, vegetables, nuts) and cooking procedures (stewing, grilling, roasting, baking), while bourgeois cuisine involves more complicated procedures and use of selected herbs and spices. Charcuterie is part of Croatian tradition in all regions. Food and recipes from other former Yugoslav countries are also popular in Croatia.|$|R
50|$|Ravioli are {{traditionally}} made at home. The filling {{varies according to}} the area where they are prepared. In Rome and Latium the filling is made with ricotta cheese, spinach, nutmeg and black pepper. In Sardinia, ravioli are filled with ricotta and grated <b>lemon</b> <b>rind.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the 20th century Arabic's {{literature}} and Arab history {{accounts of the}} period Safarberlik became a synonym for the famous famine that overran Greater Syria, especially Mont Lebanon, in 1916 during World War I. The Syrian journalist Abd al-Ghani al-Utri in his book I’tirafat Shami ‘atiq; sira dhattyya wa suwar dimashqiyya (translated: Confessions of an old Damascene, Biography and Damascene pictures) suggests that Syrians have sanctified bread even since the Great War. The diary of a Palestinian Ottoman soldier, Ihsan Turjman, during WWI clearly describes the scarcity of foodstuffs and the overpricing sugar, rice and grains.Novelists, journalists, and playwrights used the oral accounts of those who lived and experienced WWI, and the miseries of Safarberlik that they described to produce an impressive body of literary and drama production. Safarberlik scenes report on the miserable circumstances people lived through. In al-Ghazzi’s book Shirwal Barhum (translated: The Pants of Barhum), during Safarberlik people were depicted as fighting over <b>lemon</b> and orange <b>rinds</b> while children pick watermelon rinds from the mud. Siham Turjman tells the account of her mother who was then 14 years old and tells that during the Safarberlik everything was expensive, people would line {{up in front of}} the bakery at midnight to buy the following morning coal-like, burnt, and overpriced bread.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{traditional}} methods of preparation, honeycombs are crushed, and the balls of wax containing 20-30% of honey are collected in generic containers. In the days immediately after all the honey extract has settled, the remaining combs containing honey and pollen are dipped in hot water (~ 50 °C), so that the water dissolves all the honey still present in the combs. At this point, any remaining lumps of wax and pollen are broken up {{through the use of}} a suitable mixer or by hand. The remaining wax is then pressed further to squeeze out any remaining liquid and is then stored in appropriate containers. The remaining liquid from the previous step is filtered, for example with a linen cloth, at least twice, and then placed in a suitable high-capacity boiler (sometimes made of copper) where it is boiled and concentrated via decoction. During this concentration process, finely cut <b>lemon</b> or orange <b>rinds</b> are added, and any impurities on the surface of the liquid are removed. The content of the boiler becomes gradually syrupy and must be kept in constant motion to prevent the product from sticking on the bottom and developing a smokey flavour. The liquid also becomes caramelized, becoming dark like molasses but much more complex, with a toasty flavour that has hints of coffee and caramel. When the liquid assumes a consistency similar to that of honey, the heating is interrupted, and the boiler is deposited in a secluded place and allowed to cool before the abbamele is drained.|$|R
50|$|Lemon {{juice and}} rind {{are used to}} make marmalade, lemon curd and lemon liqueur. Lemon slices and <b>lemon</b> <b>rind</b> are used as a garnish for food and drinks. Lemon zest, the grated outer rind of the fruit, is used to add flavor to baked goods, puddings, rice, and other dishes.|$|E
50|$|Pink Gin or Pink Plymouth is a {{cocktail}} made fashionable in England in the mid-19th century, consisting of Plymouth gin and {{a dash of}} Angostura bitters, a dark red bitters that makes the whole drink pinkish. <b>Lemon</b> <b>rind</b> is also commonly used as a garnish, with the citrus oils subtly complementing the flavour.|$|E
50|$|Arroz con leche (rice pudding): Another dessert {{originally}} from Spain {{that can be}} found in various varieties throughout Latin America.

50|$|Patiently Le Grand re-created the {{medicinal}} formula, marrying myrrh with juniper, saffron with <b>lemon</b> <b>rind.</b> The drink {{was sent}} to market in a distinctive bottle. But first, Le Grand played a new card: that of advertising. He persuaded several renowned artists to create posters and placards for placement in France and abroad. These artists included Alphonse Mucha, Sem, Lopes Silva, and even Louise Abbéma in 1899, with an oil-on-canvas titled La Renommée de la Bénédictine displayed at the Salon in 1899 {{and then at the}} World's Fair in Paris in 1900.|$|E
5000|$|Alfajores: {{a dessert}} found in {{virtually}} all of Spain's former colonies. It {{is derived from the}} versions popular in Spain during the colonial period. The original Spanish recipes, however, have been modified because the original ingredients are expensive in Peru (almonds, honey) or even unobtainable (hazelnuts, <b>lemon</b> <b>rind,</b> coriander seed, etc.). The basic recipe uses a base mix of flour, margarine, and powdered sugar, which is oven-baked. Alfajores consist of two or more layers of this baked pastry, and is usually filled with manjar blanco (a caramel-colored, sweet, creamy filling made with milk and sugar) ...|$|E
50|$|Matè is {{a popular}} drink {{consumed}} by the Druze brought to the Levant from Lebanese migrants from Argentina in the 19th century. Mate is made by steeping dried leaves of yerba mate in hot water and is served with a metal straw (bambija or masassa) from a gourd (finjan). Mate is often the first item served when entering a Druze home. It is a social drink and can be shared between multiple participants. After each drinker, the metal straw is cleaned with a <b>lemon</b> <b>rind.</b> Traditional snacks eaten with mate include raisins, nuts, dried figs, biscuits, and chips.|$|E
50|$|The {{dough is}} made of flour, sugar, egg yolk, milk or sour cream and butter, and yeast. The dough may be flavored with lemon or orange zest or rum. The poppy seed filling may contain ground poppy seeds, raisins, butter or milk, sugar or honey, rum and vanilla. Sometimes a {{tablespoon}} of apricot jam, {{which is one of}} the most popular jams used in the Hungarian cuisine, is substituted for sugar. The walnut roll filling contains raisins, rum, butter or milk, <b>lemon</b> <b>rind</b> and chopped walnuts. This filling may be spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove or vanilla.|$|E
5000|$|Guava fruits, usually 4 to 12 cm long, are round or oval {{depending}} on the species. They have a pronounced and typical fragrance, similar to <b>lemon</b> <b>rind</b> but less sharp.

Varying between species, the skin can be any thickness, is usually green before maturity, but becomes yellow, maroon, or green when ripe.

50|$|Ponche crema is a Venezuelan and Trinidadian cream-based liqueur. Recipes vary {{depending}} on the region, but main ingredients typically include milk, eggs, sugar, rum, and other minor ingredients such as vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and <b>lemon</b> <b>rind.</b> A variant type is prepared with concentrated liquid coffee or instant coffee powder. However, most references to the ponche crema name aim at a traditional commercial product, available since 1900, whose recipe and manufacturing process are kept secret. Ponche crema is a beverage traditionally served in Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago during Christmas time, much as eggnog is in the United States. It is usually served cold, in small cups, either as an aperitif or a pousse-café.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} recipe {{consists of}} coffee with condensed milk and cognac; {{a few drops}} of Licor 43 as well as a couple of coffee beans, <b>lemon</b> <b>rind</b> and cinnamon may be added, but it is usual to find it without the grains of coffee and lemon peel. It is commonly served in a special glass, thicker than usual to avoid thermal collapse of it, and whose design is inspired by the one manufactured at the ancient Glass Factory of St. Lucia in Cartagena. This new glass replaced the glass of vermouth that was originally used because of its greater resistance, and since 1945 is the company Jose Diaz is in charge of its manufacturing and commercialization.|$|E

5000|$|Vánočka is a braided bread, {{baked in}} Czech Republic and Slovakia (in Slovak called vianočka) {{traditionally}} at Christmas time. It was first referenced during the 16th century, {{where it could}} only be made by a baker who was a guild craftsman. During the 18th century, people took the recipe into their homes and began baking it themselves. It is rich in eggs and butter, making it similar to brioche. <b>Lemon</b> <b>rind</b> and rum add color and flavor; the dough can also contain raisins and almonds, and is braided like challah. [...] A vánočka may be built from three progressively smaller braids, stacked on top of each other; this is sometimes interpreted as a rough sculpture of the baby Jesus wrapped in cloth and lying in a manger.|$|E

5000|$|The fresh grape {{is large}} and juicy, round to oval-shaped, pale greenish-white in color and has a sweet, very {{pleasant}} aroma. It also has a sweet and generally pleasant flavor, sometime being described as [...] "foxy". One reviewer, Paul Bulas, attempted to characterize the [...] "foxy" [...] description. In analyzing the Niagara grape, he detected aromas like candied <b>lemon</b> <b>rind,</b> a Riesling-like diesel aroma, flowery jasmine-like notes, and what he called [...] "a high-toned, candied muskiness." [...] This latter descriptor he felt was the primary element of the term [...] "foxy". His opinion of wines made with the grape {{is that they have}} unique and interesting properties that are not well known due to Niagara's reputation as a less-than-optimum wine grape. A diesel aroma in wine {{is considered to be a}} positive attribute, but it can be excessive in wines made with the Niagara grape. One opinion is that Niagara grape skins should not contact the must for too long a time after pressing to avoid an excess of this characteristic.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prepare and {{evaluate}} a formulated functional yoghurt cake using hot water extract of stevia leaves as a sweetener. The ingredients of the regular yoghurt cake were replaced by both low caloric value and functional ingredients. Sucrose was replaced by hot water extract of stevia, butter was replaced by olive oil, full cream milk was replaced by skimmed milk, whole egg was replaced by egg white and 72 % extraction wheat flour was replaced by whole wheat flour. Orange peels and <b>lemon</b> <b>rind</b> were also added to the formulated yoghurt with stevia extract. Sensory evaluations for both the regular yoghurt cake and formulated yoghurt cake for diabetics were carried out using scores of the appearance, color, odor, flavor, texture and overall acceptability. The obtained results showed that the regular yoghurt cake and formulated yoghurt cake for diabetics have a good score. The biological evaluation of rat blood parameters of control and yoghurt cake for diabetics groups showed that bilirubin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, blood glucose and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) values (means) in yoghurt cake for diabetics group were similar to results obtained in regular yoghurt cake group. There was a slight decrease in urea and aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) (37. 05 mg/dl and 86. 82 U/L, respectively) values in yoghurt cake for diabetics group compared with control (43. 26 mg/dl and 97. 00 U/L, respectively).
