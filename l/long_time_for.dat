5|$|Camelot Software Planning spent between {{twelve and}} {{eighteen}} months developing Golden Sun, {{which is considered}} a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a handheld video game; the finished product {{was described as a}} testament to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game {{a few weeks before the}} release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.|$|E
5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun {{is a process that}} involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 Constantine {{had signed}} an initial three-year {{contract}} with Nelson, {{to play in}} the Lancashire League. The contract was worth £500 per season, plus performance bonuses and travelling expenses. He remained there until 1937, an unusually <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a professional to remain with one club. Constantine's appearances boosted attendances and gate receipts for all Nelson's matches, and was of great financial benefit to both the club and the League as a whole. In Constantine's nine seasons at the club, Nelson never finished lower than second, won the league competition seven times and the knockout cup twice. In 1931 Constantine renewed his contract for £650 per season; when in 1935 a rival league attempted to sign him, all the Lancashire League clubs contributed to his wage, which rose to £750 per year between 1935 and 1937. This was far more than the then maximum wage for a professional footballer of £386, or the £500 per season that a top county cricketer could potentially earn, and possibly made Constantine the best-paid sportsman in the country. Consequently, he and his family enjoyed a good standard of living {{for the first time in}} their lives.|$|E

Edward Jenner had also studied vaccination using cowpox (Vaccinia) to give cross-immunity to smallpox in the late 1790s, and by the early 1800s vaccination had spread to most of Europe.|$|E

However, once his attack at mid-day got underway, it broke the French right flank and helped convince them to retreat from Marengo.

25|$|In Sweden {{and states}} {{bordering}} the Baltic Sea, the oldest surviving manuscript {{from the first}} Swedish law {{to be put to}} paper is from c. 1345, although earlier versions probably existed. The law was created for the young town Stockholm's customs, but it was also used in Lödöse and probably in a few other towns, as well. No town was allowed to use the law without the formal permission by the Swedish king. Its use may have become more widespread {{if it had not been}} superseded by the new town law by King Magnus Eriksson (1316–1374). The term Bjarkey Laws was however used for a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Magnus Eriksson's law in various locations.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June 2010, the Palermo Court of Appeals {{reduced the}} 2004 nine-year {{sentence}} for collusion with the Mafia to seven years. In reviewing the previous sentence, {{the appeals court}} said the conviction stood only for acts committed by Dell'Utri prior to 1992, while he was acquitted for charges after that year. The prosecution had asked that the sentence be increased to 11 years. The judges took six days to consider their decision, an extraordinary <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> deliberations. The verdict effectively cleared Dell'Utri and Italian prime minister Berlusconi over allegations his entry into politics was backed by Cosa Nostra and a terrorist bombing campaign. However, Prosecuting Offices in other Italian cities are looking into these allegations.|$|E

25|$|Hipparchus is {{credited}} with the invention or improvement of several astronomical instruments, which were used for a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> naked-eye observations. According to Synesius of Ptolemais (4th century) he made the first astrolabion: {{this may have been}} an armillary sphere (which Ptolemy however says he constructed, in Almagest V.1); or the predecessor of the planar instrument called astrolabe (also mentioned by Theon of Alexandria). With an astrolabe Hipparchus was the first to be able to measure the geographical latitude and time by observing fixed stars. Previously this was done at daytime by measuring the shadow cast by a gnomon, by recording the length of the longest day of the year or with the portable instrument known as a scaphe.|$|E
25|$|While the Hudson Tunnel Project {{would double}} the number of tracks under the Hudson River, it would not result in an {{increase}} in rail capacity due to constraints at Penn Station. Penn Station operates at capacity during peak periods, and since it takes a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> passengers to board and alight trains, trains cannot leave and enter the station as might otherwise be possible. Even with improvements in the station, there are inadequate train storage facilities at Penn, and there is no capacity in the East River Tunnels to allow for trains to be stored during middays at Sunnyside Yard. Without these additional improvements, it is assumed that the same number of trains going between New Jersey and New York today would be operating in 2030, albeit with the additional tunnel capacity.|$|E
25|$|In 1919 Huxley married Juliette Baillot (1896–1994). She was a French Swiss girl {{whom he had}} met at Garsington Manor, {{the country}} house of Lady Ottoline Morrell, a Bloomsbury Group socialite {{with a penchant for}} artists and intellectuals. The newly-weds' life {{together}} included students, faculty wives, grebes and, unfortunately, another depressive breakdown, this time rather serious. From his wife's autobiography it seems his mental illness took the form of a bipolar disorder, with the depressive phases being of moderate to severe intensity. It took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> him to recover on this occasion, but despite this he left a legacy of students who admired him, and who became leaders in zoology for the next thirty or forty years. E. B. Ford always remembered his openness and encouragement at the start of his career.|$|E

25|$|Minocycline {{may cause}} upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, {{headache}} and vomiting. Minocycline increases sensitivity to sunlight. Minocycline {{may affect the}} quality of sleep and rarely cause sleep disorders. It has also been linked to cases of lupus. Prolonged use of minocycline {{over an extended period of}} time can lead to blue-gray skin, fingernails and staining of scar tissue. This staining is not permanent but can take a very <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the skin color to return to normal; on the other hand a muddy brown skin color in sun exposed areas is usually a permanent skin discolouration. Permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. Rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization.|$|E
25|$|Endospores {{can stay}} dormant {{for a very}} <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> instance, endospores {{were found in the}} tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs. When placed in {{appropriate}} medium, under appropriate conditions, they were able to be reactivated. In 1995, Raul Cano of California Polytechnic State University found bacterial spores in the gut of a fossilized bee trapped in amber from a tree in the Dominican Republic. The bee fossilized in amber was dated to being about 25 million years old. The spores germinated when the amber was cracked open and the material from the gut of the bee was extracted and placed in nutrient medium. After the spores were analyzed by microscopy, it was determined that the cells were very similar to Bacillus sphericus which is found in bees in the Dominican Republic today.|$|E
25|$|The town grew {{strongly}} in the 19th century. In 1801 the population was 3,095. By 1850 it was over 10,000 and by 1901 it was almost 39,000. Such rapid growth demanded a railway connection but the town had to wait a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> one. The London and Birmingham Railway (L) had been built through Tring in 1838, and the Great Northern Railway was built through Hitchin in 1852, both bypassing Luton, the largest town in the area. A branch line connecting with the L at Leighton Buzzard was proposed, but because of objections to release of land, construction terminated at Dunstable in 1848. It was another ten years before the branch was extended to Bute Street Station, and the first train to Dunstable ran on 3 May 1858. The line was later extended to Welwyn and from 1860 direct trains to King's Cross ran. The Midland Railway was extended from Bedford to St Pancras through Leagrave and Midland Road station and opened on 9 September 1867.|$|E

25|$|It took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the Maharajahs Ghulab Singh and Ranbir Singh {{to extend}} their writ over Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, and not until 1870 did they assert their {{authority}} over Gilgit town. The grip of the Jammu and Kashmir government over this area was tenuous. The Indian government undertook administrative reforms in 1885 and created Gilgit Agency in 1889 {{as a way for}} the British to secure the region as a buffer from the Russians. As a result of this Great Game, with British fear of Russian activities in Chinese Sinkiang increasing, in 1935 the Gilgit Agency was expanded by the Maharajah Hari Singh leasing the Gilgit Wazarat to the government of India for a period of sixty years and for an amount of 75,000Rs. This gave the British political agent complete control of defence, communications and foreign relations while the Kashmiri state retained civil administration and the British retained control of defence and foreign affairs.|$|E
25|$|Because of her {{participation}} in the musical, it took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Beni to release new material. When the musical stopped touring in 2006, she began modeling as the face of Cecil McBee, {{one of the largest}} and most popular Japanese clothing lines that appeals to teenage and college girls. She was also the host of the NHK fashion program, Tokyo Kawaii TV, where Beni discusses the latest fashion trends in Japan. When she became the face of Orion Beer a new single was announced to be released on September 20. Her seventh single was named How Are U?. This single was her first single not to chart on the Oricon chart and is considered a total flop. Her eighth single named Luna was an ending theme song for the Japanese drama Warui Yatsura. This single charted at the No. 77 spot making it a small comeback from Beni. On April 25, 2007, Beni released her third studio album named Gem. The album charted at the No. 114 place on the Oricon chart.|$|E
